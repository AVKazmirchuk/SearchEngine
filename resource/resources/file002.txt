off to the airport  don t forget the worms in a can and the beginner s guide to travelling by air  presented by dave barry  the officer at miami international airport  to help prevent unnecessary airport delays and strangling  consult the beginner s guide to travelling by air   when to be at the airport  you should be at the airport already   how much luggage can you carry on  you can carry one small bag and one medium bag  for a total of two bags  you may not carry on three bags by insisting to airport personnel that one of your bags is not really a bag  as if it is some kind of magical invisible fairy bag that airline personnel cannot see  you also may not carry on a suitcase the size of a sleeper sofa  apparently containing the entire wardrobe of some broadway production  the fact that your suitcase has wheels does not automatically mean that you may carry it on the airplane  a piano also has wheels  but you wouldn t try to take a piano onto a plane  would you   prohibited objects  you may not take knives  guns spears  armored personnel carrier  flame throwers  scary animals or sharp objects  if you know karate or kung fu  you may take your hands on board  but you must keep them clasped tightly under you armpits throughout the flight   how to go through the security check point  have your boarding pass and photo id ready  remove all your possessions from your pockets and put them in a plastic tray  have your boarding pass and photo id ready  remove your belt  shoes  and pacemakers and put them in another plastic tray  have your boarding pass and photo id ready  remove your laptop computer and put this in another plastic tray  for god s sake have your boarding pass and photo id ready  put everything   trays  bags  children under     on the moving belt  then stand in a non terroristic manner until the security person signals to you  at which time  while holding your boarding pass and photo id up  you should shuffle meekly forward until your pants fall to the floor   joking around with the security personnel  airport security personnel are a whacky and fun loving group who are bored to death from spending eight hours a day reminding morons to have their boarding passes and photo ids ready  there is nothing they enjoy more  than a good joke  such as the one where you give the victim a can that says   peanut brittle   when he opens it  giant spring loaded worms come shooting out  that always sets off a round of hearty knee slapping at the checkpoint   to crown it all  if you just use your common sense  waiting in long lines at the airport won t be tough on you

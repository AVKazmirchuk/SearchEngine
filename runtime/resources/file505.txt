its phases her hair was as yellow as the silk her form was as tall and graceful as a stalk in the low grounds during a wet summer her eyes were as big and startling as bunions and green was her favorite color on my last trip into the cool recesses of your sequestered city i met a human named vaucross he was worth that is he had a million he told me he was in business on the street a sidewalk merchant says i sarcastic exactly says he senior partner of a paving concern i kind of took to him for this reason i met him on broadway one night when i was out of heart luck tobacco and place he was all silk hat diamonds and front he was all front if you had gone behind him you would have only looked yourself in the face i looked like a cross between count tolstoy and a june lobster i was out of luck i had but let me lay my eyes on that dealer again vaucross stopped and talked to me a few minutes and then he took me to a high toned restaurant to eat dinner there was music and then some beethoven and bordelaise sauce and cussing in french and frangipangi and some hauteur and cigarettes when i am flush i know them places i declare i must have looked as bad as a magazine artist sitting there without any money and my hair all rumpled like i was booked to read a chapter from elsie s school days at a brooklyn bohemian smoker but vaucross treated me like a bear hunter s guide he wasn t afraid of hurting the waiter s feelings mr pogue he explains to me i am using you go on says i i hope you don t wake up and then he tells me you know the kind of man he was he was a new yorker his whole ambition was to be noticed he wanted to be conspicuous he wanted people to point him out and bow to him and tell others who he was he said it had been the desire of his life always he didn t have but a million so he couldn t attract attention by spending money he said he tried to get into public notice one time by planting a little public square on the east side with garlic for free use of the poor but carnegie heard of it and covered it over at once with a library in the gaelic language three times he had jumped in the way of automibiles but the only result was five broken ribs and

month says mr vaucross my expenditure for lunches to reporters was get anything out of that i asks that reminds me says he add for perpsin yes i got indigestion how am i supposed to push along your scramble for prominence i inquires contrast something of that sort to night says vaucross it grieves me but i am forced to resort to eccentricity and here he drops his napkin in his soup and rises up and bows to a gent who is devastating a potato under a palm across the room the police commissioner says my climber gratified friend says i in a hurry have ambitions but don t kick a rung out of your ladder when you use me as a stepping stone to salute the police you spoil my appetite on the grounds that i may be degraded and incriminated be thoughtful at the quaker city squab en casserole the idea about artemisia blye comes to me suppose i can manage to get you in the papers says i a column or two every day in all of em and your picture in most of em for a week how much would it be worth to you ten thousand dollars says vaucross warm in a minute but no murder says he and i won t wear pink pants at a cotillon i wouldn t ask you to says i this is honorable stylish and uneffiminate tell the waiter to bring a demi tasse and some other beans and i will disclose to you the opus moderandi we closed the deal an hour later in the rococo rouge et noise room i telegraphed that night to miss artemisia in salina she took a couple of photographs and an autograph letter to an elder in the fourth presbyterian church in the morning and got some transportation and she stopped in topeka long enough to trade a flashlight interior and a valentine to the vice president of a trust company for a mileage book and a package of five dollar notes with scrawled on the band the fifth evening after

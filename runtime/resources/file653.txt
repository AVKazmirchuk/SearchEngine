well to keep clear of engine house no sometimes all thoughts of the japs left john byrnes s head that was when the alarm of fire had sounded and he was strapped in his driver s seat on the swaying cart guilding erebus and joe the finest team in the whole department according to the crew of of all the codes adopted by man for regulating his actions toward his fellow mortals the greatest are these the code of king arthur s knights of the round table the constitution of the united states and the unwritten rules of the new york fire department the round table methods are no longer practicable since the invention of street cars and breach of promise suits and our constitution is being found more and more unconstitutional every day so the code of our firemen must be considered in the lead with the golden rule and jeffries s new punch trying for place and show the constitution says that one man is as good as another but the fire department says he is better this is a too generous theory but the law will not tallow itself to be construed otherwise all of which comes perilously near to being a paradox and commends itself to the attention of the s p c a one of the transatlantic liners dumped out at ellis island a lump of protozoa which was expected to evolve into an american citizen a steward kicked him down the gangway a doctor pounced upon his eyes like a raven seeking for trachoma or ophthalmia he was hustled ashore and ejected into the city in the name of liberty perhaps theoretically thus inoculating against kingocracy with a drop of its own virus this hypodermic injection of europeanism wandered happily into the veins of the city with the broad grin of a pleased child it was not burdened with baggage cares or ambitions its body was lithely built and clothed in a sort of foreign fustian its face was brightly vacant with a small flat nose and was mostly covered by a thick ragged curling beard like the coat of a spaniel in the pocket of the imported thing were a few coins denarii sendi kopecks pfennigs pilasters whatever the financial nomenclature of his unknown country nay have been prattling to himself always broadly grinning pleased by the roar and movement of the barbarous city into which the steamship cut rates had shunted him the alien strayed away from the sea which he hated as far as the district covered by engine company no light as a cork he was kept bobbing along by the human tide the cruelest atom in all the silt of the stream that emptied into the reservoir of liberty while crossing third avenue he slowed his steps enchanted by the thunder of the elevated trains above him and the soothing crash of the wheels on the cobbles and then there was a new delightful chord in the uproar the musical clanging of a gong and a great shining juggernaut belching fire and smoke that people were hurrying to see this beautiful thing entrancing to the eye dashed past and the protoplasmic immigrant stepped into the wake of it with his broad enraptured uncomprehending grin and so stepping stepped into the path of no s flying hose cart with john byrnes gripping with arms of steel the reins over the plunging backs of erebus and joe the unwritten constitutional code of the fireman has no exceptions or amendments it is a simple thing as simple as the rule of three there was the heedless unit in the right of way there was the hose cart and the iron pillar of the elevated railroad john byrnes swung all his weight and muscle on the left rein the team and cart swerved that way and crashed like a torpedo into the pillar the men on the cart went flying like skittles the driver s strap burst the pillar rang with the shock and john byrnes fell on the car track with a broken shoulder twenty feet away while erebus beautiful raven black best loved erebus lay whickering in his harness with a broken leg in consideration for the feelings of engine company no the details will be lightly touched the company does not like to be reminded of that day there was a great crowd and hurry calls were sent in and while the ambulance gong was clearing the way the men of no heard the crack of the s p c a agent s pistol and turned their heads away not daring to look toward erebus again when the firemen got back to the engine house they found that one of them was dragging by the collar the cause of their desolation and grief they set it in the middle of the floor and gathered grimly about it through its whiskers the calamitous object chattered effervescently and waved its hands sounds like a seidlitz powder said mike dowling disgustedly and it makes me sicker than one call that a man that hoss was worth a steamer full of such two legged animals it s a immigrant that s what it is look at the doctor s chalk mark on its coat said reilly the desk man it s just landed it must be a kind of a dago or a hun or one of them finns i guess that s the kind of truck that europe unloads onto us think of a thing like that getting in the way and laying john up in hospital and spoiling the best fire team in the city groaned another fireman it ought to be taken down to the dock and drowned somebody go around and get

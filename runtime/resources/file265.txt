toga he dragged a dust covered trunk from a corner of the cave and with difficulty wrenched open its lid candles he had in plenty and the cave was soon aglow clothes ten years old in cut scissors razors hats shoes all his discarded attire and belongings were dragged ruthlessly from their renunciatory rest and strewn about in painful disorder a pair of scissors soon reduced his beard sufficiently for the dulled razors to perform approximately their office cutting his own hair was beyond the hermit s skill so he only combed and brushed it backward as smoothly as he could charity forbids us to consider the heartburnings and exertions of one so long removed from haberdashery and society at the last the hermit went to an inner corner of his cave and began to dig in the soft earth with a long iron spoon out of the cavity he thus made he drew a tin can and out of the can three thousand dollars in bills tightly rolled and wrapped in oiled silk he was a real hermit as this may assure you you may take a brief look at him as he hastens down the little mountain side a long wrinkled black frock coat reached to his calves white duck trousers unacquainted with the tailor s goose a pink shirt white standing collar with brilliant blue butterfly tie and buttoned congress gaiters but think sir and madam ten years from beneath a narrow brimmed straw hat with a striped band flowed his hair seeing him with all your shrewdness you could not have guessed him you would have said that he played hamlet or the tuba or pinochle you would never have laid your hand on your heart and said he is a hermit who lived ten years in a cave for love of one lady to win another the dancing pavilion extended above the waters of the river gay lanterns and frosted electric globes shed a soft glamour within it a hundred ladies and gentlemen from the inn and summer cottages flitted in and about it to the left of the dusty roadway down which the hermit had tramped were the inn and grill room something seemed to be on there too the windows were brilliantly lighted and music was playing music different from the two steps and waltzes of the casino band a negro man wearing a white jacket came through the iron gate with its immense granite posts and wrought iron lamp holders what is going on here to night asked the hermit well sah said the servitor dey is having de reg lar thursday evenin dance in de casino and in de grill room dere s a beefsteak dinner sah the hermit glanced up at the inn on the hillside whence burst suddenly a triumphant strain of splendid harmony and up there said he they are playing mendelssohn what is going on up there up in de inn said the dusky one dey is a weddin goin on mr binkley a mighty rich man am marryin miss trenholme sah de young lady who am quite de belle of de place sah he also serves if i could have a thousand years just one little thousand years more of life i might in that time draw near enough to true romance to touch the hem of her robe up from ships men come and from waste places and forest and road and garret and cellar to maunder to me in strangely distributed words of the things they have seen and considered the recording of their tales is no more than a matter of ears and fingers there are only two fates i dread deafness and writer s cramp the hand is yet steady let the ear bear the blame if these printed words be not in the order they were delivered to me by hunky magee true camp follower of fortune biography shall claim you but an instant i first knew hunky when he was head waiter at chubb s little beefsteak restaurant and cafe on third avenue there was only one waiter besides then successively i caromed against him in the little streets of the big city after his trip to alaska his voyage as cook with a treasure seeking expedition to the caribbean and his failure as a pearl fisher in the arkansas river between these dashes into the land of adventure he usually came back to chubb s for a while chubb s was a port for him when gales blew too high but when you dined there and hunky went for your steak you never knew whether he would come to anchor in the kitchen or in the malayan archipelago you wouldn t care for his description he was soft of voice and hard of face and rarely had to use more than one eye to quell any approach to a disturbance among chubb s customers one night i found hunky standing at a corner of twenty third street and third avenue after an absence of several months in ten minutes we had a little round table between us in a quiet corner and my ears began to get busy i leave out my sly ruses and feints to draw hunky s word of mouth blows it all came to something like this speaking of the next election said hunky did you ever know much about indians no i don t mean the cooper beadle cigar store or laughing water kind i mean the modern indian the kind that takes greek prizes in colleges and scalps the half back on the other side in football games the kind that eats macaroons and tea in the afternoons with the daughter of the professor of biology and fills up on grasshoppers and fried rattlesnake when they get back to the ancestral wickiup well they ain t so bad i like em better than most foreigners that have come over in the last few hundred years one thing about the indian is this when he mixes with the white race he swaps all his own vices for them of the pale faces and he retains all his own virtues well his virtues are enough to call out the reserves whenever he lets em loose but the imported foreigners adopt our virtues and keep their own vices and it s going to take our whole standing army some day to police that gang but let me tell you about the trip i took to mexico with high jack snakefeeder a cherokee twice removed a graduate of a pennsylvania college and the latest thing in pointed toed rubber heeled patent kid moccasins and madras hunting shirt with turned back cuffs he was a friend of mine i met him in tahlequah when i was out there during the land boom and we got thick he had got all there was out of colleges and had come back to lead his people out of egypt he was a man of first class style and wrote essays and had been invited to visit rich guys houses in boston and such places there was a cherokee girl in muscogee that high jack was foolish about he took me to see her a few times her name was florence blue feather but you want to clear your mind of all ideas of squaws with nose rings and army blankets this young lady was whiter than you are and better educated than i ever was you couldn t have told her from any of the girls shopping in the swell third avenue stores i liked her so well that i got to calling on her now and then when high jack wasn t along which is the way of friends in such matters she was educated at the muscogee college and was making a specialty of let s see eth yes ethnology that s the art that goes back and traces the descent of different races of people leading up from jelly fish through monkeys and to the o briens high jack had took up that line too and had read papers about it before all kinds of riotous assemblies chautauquas and choctaws and chowder parties and such having a mutual taste for musty information like that was what made em like each other i suppose but i don t know what they call congeniality of tastes ain t always it now when miss blue feather and me was talking together i listened to her affidavits about the first families of the land of nod being cousins german well if the germans don t nod who does to the mound builders of ohio with incomprehension and respect and when i d tell her about the bowery and coney island and sing her a few songs that i d heard the jamaica niggers sing at their church lawn parties she didn t look much less interested than she did when high jack would tell her that he had a pipe that the first inhabitants of america originally arrived here on stilts after a freshet at tenafly new jersey but i was going to tell you more about high jack about six months ago i get a letter from him saying he d been commissioned by the minority report bureau of ethnology at washington to go down to mexico and translate some excavations or dig up the meaning of some shorthand notes on some ruins or something of that sort and if i d go along he could squeeze the price into the expense account well i d been holding a napkin over my arm at chubb s about long enough then so i wired high jack yes and he sent me a ticket and i met him in washington and he had a lot of news to tell me first of all was that florence blue feather had suddenly disappeared from her home and environments run away i asked vanished says high jack disappeared like your shadow when the sun goes under a cloud she was seen on the street and then she turned a corner and nobody ever seen her afterward the whole community turned out to look for her but we never found a clew that s bad that s bad says i she was a mighty nice girl and as smart as you find em high jack seemed to take it hard i guess he must have esteemed miss blue feather quite highly i could see that he d referred the matter to the whiskey jug that was his weak point and many another man s i ve noticed that when a man loses a girl he generally takes to drink either just before or just after it happens from washington we railroaded it to new orleans and there took a tramp steamer bound for belize and a gale pounded us all down the caribbean and nearly wrecked us on the yucatan coast opposite a little town without a harbor called boca de coacoyula suppose the ship had run against that name in the dark better fifty years of europe than a cyclone in the bay says high jack snakefeeder so we get the captain to send us ashore in a dory when the squall seemed to cease from squalling we will find ruins here or make em says high the government doesn t care which we do an appropriation is an appropriation boca de coacoyula was a dead town them biblical towns we read about tired and siphon after they was destroyed they must have looked like forty second street and broadway compared to this boca place it still claimed inhabitants as estimated and engraved on the stone court house by the census taker in the citizens were a mixture of indians and other indians but some of em was light colored which i was surprised to see the town was huddled up on the shore with woods so thick around it that a subpoena server couldn t have reached a monkey ten yards away with the papers we wondered what kept it from being annexed to kansas but we soon found out that it was major bing major bing was the ointment around the fly he had the cochineal sarsaparilla log wood annatto hemp and all other dye woods and pure food adulteration concessions cornered he had five sixths of the boca de thingama jiggers working for him on shares it was a beautiful graft we used to brag about morgan and e h and others of our wisest when i was in the provinces but now no more that peninsula has got our little country turned into a submarine without even the observation tower showing major bing s idea was this he had the population go forth into the forest and gather these products when they brought em in he gave em one fifth for their trouble sometimes they d strike and demand a sixth the major always gave in to em the major had a bungalow so close on the sea that the nine inch tide seeped through the cracks in the kitchen floor me and him and high jack snakefeeder sat on the porch and drank rum from noon till midnight he said he had piled up in new orleans banks and high and me could stay with him forever if we would but high jack happened to think of the united states and began to talk ethnology ruins says major bing the woods are full of em i don t know how far they date back but they was here before i came high jack asks what form of worship the citizens of that locality are addicted to why says the major rubbing his nose i can t hardly say i imagine it s infidel or aztec or nonconformist or something like that there s a church here a methodist or some other kind with a parson named skidder he claims to have converted the people to christianity he and me don t assimilate except on state occasions i imagine they worship some kind of gods or idols yet but skidder says he has em in the fold a few days later high jack and me prowling around strikes a plain path into the forest and follows it a good four miles then a branch turns to the left we go a mile maybe down that and run up against the finest ruin you ever saw solid stone with trees and vines and under brush all growing up against it and in it and through it all over it was chiselled carvings of funny beasts and people that would have been arrested if they d ever come out in vaudeville that way we approached it from the rear high jack had been drinking too much rum ever since we landed in boca you know how an indian is the palefaces fixed his clock when they introduced him to firewater he d brought a quart along with him hunky says he we ll explore the ancient temple it may be that the storin that landed us here was propitious the minority report bureau of ethnology says he may yet profit by the vagaries of wind and tide we went in the rear door of the bum edifice we struck a kind of alcove without bath there was a granite davenport and a stone wash stand without any soap or exit for the water and some hardwood pegs drove into holes in the wall and that was all to go out of that furnished apartment into a harlem hall bedroom would make you feel like getting back home from an amateur violoncello solo at an east side settlement house while high was examining some hieroglyphics on the wall that the stone masons must have made when their tools slipped i stepped into the front room that was at least thirty by fifty feet stone floor six little windows like square port holes that didn t let much light in i looked back over my shoulder and sees high jack s face three feet away high says i of all the and then i noticed he looked funny and i turned around he d taken off his clothes to the waist and he didn t seem to hear me i touched him and came near beating it high jack had turned to stone i had been drinking some rum myself ossified i says to him loudly i knew what would happen if you kept it up and then high jack comes in from the alcove when he hears me conversing with nobody and we have a look at mr snakefeeder no it s a stone idol or god or revised statute or something and it looks as much like high jack as one green pea looks like itself it s got exactly his face and size and color but it s steadier on its pins it stands on a kind of rostrum or pedestal and you can see it s been there ten million years he s a cousin of mine sings high and then he turns solemn hunky he says putting one hand on my shoulder and one on the statue s i m in the holy temple of my ancestors well if looks goes for anything says i you ve struck a twin stand side by side with buddy and let s see if there s any diff erence there wasn t you know an indian can keep his face as still as an iron dog s when he wants to so when high jack froze his features you couldn t have told him from the other one there s some letters says i on his nob s pedestal but i can t make em out the alphabet of this country seems to be composed of sometimes a e i o and u but generally z s l s and t s high jack s ethnology gets the upper hand of his rum for a minute and he investigates the inscription hunky says he this is a statue of tlotopaxl one of the most powerful gods of the ancient aztecs glad to know him says i but in his present condition he reminds me of the joke shakespeare got off on julius caesar we might say about your friend imperious what s his name dead and tunied to stone no use to write or call him on the phone hunky says high jack snakefeeder looking at me funny do you believe in reincarnation it sounds to me says i like either a clean up of the slaughter houses or a new kind of boston pink i don t know i believe says he that i am the reincarnation of tlotopaxl my researches have convinced me that the cherokees of all the north american tribes can boast of the straightest descent from the proud aztec race that says he was a favorite theory of mine and florence blue feather s and she what if she high jack grabs my arm and walls his eyes at me just then he looked more like his eminent co indian murderer crazy horse well says i what if she what if she what if she you re drunk says i impersonating idols and believing in what was it recarnalization let s have a drink says i it s as spooky here as a brooklyn artificial limb factory at midnight with the gas turned down just then i heard somebody coming and i dragged high jack into the bedless bedchamber there was peep holes bored through the wall so we could see the whole front part of the temple major bing told me afterward that the ancient priests in charge used to rubber through them at the congregation in a few minutes an old indian woman came in with a big oval earthen dish full of grub she set it on a square block of stone in front of the graven image and laid down and walloped her face on the floor a few times and then took a walk for herself high jack and me was hungry so we came out and looked it over there was goat steaks and fried rice cakes and plantains and cassava and broiled land crabs and mangoes nothing like what you get at chubb s we ate hearty and had another round of rum it must be old tecumseh s or whatever you call him birthday says i or do they feed him every day i thought gods only drank vanilla on mount catawampus then some more native parties in short kimonos that showed their aboriginees punctured the near horizon and me and high had to skip back into father axletree s private boudoir they came by ones twos and threes and left all sorts of offerings there was enough grub for bingham s nine gods of war with plenty left over for the peace conference at the hague they brought jars of honey and bunches of bananas and bottles of wine and stacks of tortillas and beautiful shawls worth one hundred dollars apiece that the indian women weave of a kind of vegetable fibre like silk all of em got down and wriggled on the floor in front of that hard finish god and then sneaked off through the woods again i wonder who gets this rake off remarks high jack oh says i there s priests or deputy idols or a committee of disarrangements somewhere in the woods on the job wherever you find a god you ll find somebody waiting to take charge of the burnt offerings and then we took another swig of rum and walked out to the parlor front door to cool off for it was as hot inside as a summer camp on the palisades and while we stood there in the breeze we looks down the path and sees a young lady approaching the blasted ruin she was bare footed and had on a white robe and carried a wreath of white flowers in her hand when she got nearer we saw she had a long blue feather stuck through her black hair and when she got nearer still me and high jack snakefeeder grabbed each other to keep from tumbling down on the floor for the girl s face was as much like florence blue feather s as his was like old king toxicology s and then was when high jack s booze drowned his system of ethnology he dragged me inside back of the statue and says lay hold of it hunky we ll pack it into the other room i felt it all the time says he i m the reconsideration of the god locomotorataxia and florence blue feather was my bride a thousand years ago she has come to seek me in the temple where i used to reign all right says i there s no use arguing against the rum question you take his feet we lifted the three hundred pound stone god and carried him into the back room of the cafe the temple i mean and leaned him against the wall it was more work than bouncing three live ones from an all night broadway joint on new year s eve then high jack ran out and brought in a couple of them indian silk shawls and began to undress himself oh figs says i is it thus strong drink is an adder and subtractor too is it the heat or the call of the wild that s got you but high jack is too full of exaltation and cane juice to reply he stops the disrobing business just short of the manhattan beach rules and then winds them red and white shawls around him and goes out and stands on the pedestal as steady as any platinum deity you ever saw and i looks through a peek hole to see what he is up to in a few minutes in comes the girl with the flower wreath danged if i wasn t knocked a little silly when she got close she looked so exactly much like florence blue feather i wonder says i to myself if she has been reincarcerated too if i could see says i to myself whether she has a mole on her left but the next minute i thought she looked one eighth of a shade darker than florence but she looked good at that and high jack hadn t drunk all the rum that had been drank the girl went up within ten feet of the bum idol and got down and massaged her nose with the floor like the rest did then she went nearer and laid the flower wreath on the block of stone at high jack s feet rummy as i was i thought it was kind of nice of her to think of offering flowers instead of household and kitchen provisions even a stone god ought to appreciate a little sentiment like that on top of the fancy groceries they had piled up in front of him and then high jack steps down from his pedestal quiet and mentions a few words that sounded just like the hieroglyphics carved on the walls of the ruin the girl gives a little jump backward and her eyes fly open as big as doughnuts but she don t beat it why didn t she i ll tell you why i think why it don t seem to a girl so supernatural unlikely strange and startling that a stone god should come to life for her if he was to do it for one of them snub nosed brown girls on the other side of the woods now it would be different but her i ll bet she said to herself well goodness me you ve been a long time getting on your job i ve half a mind not to speak to you but she and high jack holds hands and walks away out of the temple together by the time i d had time to take another drink and enter upon the scene they was twenty yards away going up the path in the woods that the girl had come down with the natural scenery already in place it was just like a play to watch em she looking up at him and him giving her back the best that an indian can hand out in the way of a goo goo eye but there wasn t anything in that recarnification and revulsion to tintype for me hey injun i yells out to high jack we ve got a board bill due in town and you re leaving me without a cent brace up and cut out the neapolitan fisher maiden and let s go back home but on the two goes without looking once back until as you might say the forest swallowed em up and i never saw or heard of high jack snakefeeder from that day to this i don t know if the cherokees came from the aspics but if they did one of em went back all i could do was to hustle back to that boca place and panhandle major bing he detached himself from enough of his winnings to buy me a ticket home and i m back again on the job at chubb s sir and i m going to hold it steady come round and you ll find the steaks as good as ever i wondered what hunky magee thought about his own story so i asked him if he had any theories about reincarnation and transmogrification and such mysteries as he had touched upon nothing like that said hunky positively what ailed high jack was too much booze and education they ll do an indian up every time but what about miss blue feather i persisted say said hunky with a grin that little lady that stole high jack certainly did give me a jar when i first took a look at her but it was only for a minute you remember i told you high jack said that miss florence blue feather disappeared from home about a year ago well where she landed four days later was in as neat a five room flat on east twenty third street as you ever walked sideways through and she s been mrs magee ever since the moment of victory ben granger is a war veteran aged twenty nine which should enable you to guess the war he is also principal merchant and postmaster of cadiz a little town over which the breezes from the gulf of mexico perpetually blow ben helped to hurl the don from his stronghold in the greater antilles and then hiking across half the world he marched as a corporal usher up and down the blazing tropic aisles of the open air college in which the filipino was schooled now with his bayonet beaten into a cheese slicer he rallies his corporal s guard of cronies in the shade of his well whittled porch instead of in the matted jungles of mindanao always have his interest and choice been for deeds rather than for words but the consideration and digestion of motives is not beyond him as this story which is his will attest what is it he asked me one moonlit eve as we sat among his boxes and barrels that generally makes men go through dangers and fire and trouble and starvation and battle and such rucouses what does a man do it for why does he try to outdo his fellow humans and be braver and stronger and more daring and showy than even his best friends are what s his game what does he expect to get out of it he don t do it just for the fresh air and exercise what would you say now bill that an ordinary man expects generally speaking for his efforts along the line of ambition and extraordinary hustling in the marketplaces forums shooting galleries lyceums battle fields links cinder paths and arenas of the civilized and vice versa places of the world well ben said i with judicial seriousness i think we might safely limit the number of motives of a man who seeks fame to three to ambition which is a desire for popular applause to avarice which looks to the material side of success and to love of some woman whom he either possesses or desires to possess ben pondered over my words while a mocking bird on the top of a mesquite by the porch trilled a dozen bars i reckon said he that your diagnosis about covers the case according to the rules laid down in the copy books and historical readers but what i had in my mind was the case of willie robbins a person i used to know i ll tell you about him before i close up the store if you don t mind listening willie was one of our social set up in san augustine i was clerking there then for brady murchison wholesale dry goods and ranch supplies willie and i belonged to the same german club and athletic association and military company he played the triangle in our serenading and quartet crowd that used to ring the welkin three nights a week somewhere in town willie jibed with his name considerable he weighed about as much as a hundred pounds of veal in his summer suitings and he had a where is mary expression on his features so plain that you could almost see the wool growing on him and yet you couldn t fence him away from the girls with barbed wire you know that kind of young fellows a kind of a mixture of fools and angels they rush in and fear to tread at the same time but they never fail to tread when they get the chance he was always on hand when a joyful occasion was had as the morning paper would say looking as happy as a king full and at the same time as uncomfortable as a raw oyster served with sweet pickles he danced like he had hind hobbles on and he had a vocabulary of about three hundred and fifty words that he made stretch over four germans a week and plagiarized from to get him through two ice cream suppers and a sunday night call he seemed to me to be a sort of a mixture of maltese kitten sensitive plant and a member of a stranded two orphans company i ll give you an estimate of his physiological and pictorial make up and then i ll stick spurs into the sides of my narrative willie inclined to the caucasian in his coloring and manner of style his hair was opalescent and his conversation fragmentary his eyes were the same blue shade as the china dog s on the right hand corner of your aunt ellen s mantelpiece he took things as they come and i never felt any hostility against him i let him live and so did others but what does this willie do but coax his heart out of his boots and lose it to myra allison the liveliest brightest keenest smartest and prettiest girl in san augustine i tell you she had the blackest eyes the shiniest curls and the most tantalizing oh no you re off i wasn t a victim i might have been but i knew better i kept out joe granberry was it from the start he had everybody else beat a couple of leagues and thence east to a stake and mound but anyhow myra was a nine pound full merino fall clip fleece sacked and loaded on a four horse team for san antone one night there was an ice cream sociable at mrs colonel spraggins in san augustine we fellows had a big room up stairs opened up for us to put our hats and things in and to comb our hair and put on the clean collars we brought along inside the sweat bands of our hats in short a room to fix up in just like they have everywhere at high toned doings a little farther down the hall was the girls room which they used to powder up in and so forth downstairs we that is the san augustine social cotillion and merrymakers club had a stretcher put down in the parlor where our dance was going on willie robbins and me happened to be up in our cloak room i believe we called it when myra allison skipped through the hall on her way down stairs from the girls room willie was standing before the mirror deeply interested in smoothing down the blond grass plot on his head which seemed to give him lots of trouble myra was always full of life and devilment she stopped and stuck her head in our door she certainly was good looking but i knew how joe granberry stood with her so did willie but he kept on ba a a ing after her and following her around he had a system of persistence that didn t coincide with pale hair and light eyes hello willie says myra what are you doing to yourself in the glass i m trying to look fly says willie well you never could be fly says myra with her special laugh which was the provokingest sound i ever heard except the rattle of an empty canteen against my saddle horn i looked around at willie after myra had gone he had a kind of a lily white look on him which seemed to show that her remark had as you might say disrupted his soul i never noticed anything in what she said that sounded particularly destructive to a man s ideas of self consciousness but he was set back to an extent you could scarcely imagine after we went down stairs with our clean collars on willie never went near myra again that night after all he seemed to be a diluted kind of a skim milk sort of a chap and i never wondered that joe granberry beat him out the next day the battleship maine was blown up and then pretty soon somebody i reckon it was joe bailey or ben tillman or maybe the government declared war against spain well everybody south of mason hamlin s line knew that the north by itself couldn t whip a whole country the size of spain so the yankees commenced to holler for help and the johnny rebs answered the call we re coming father william a hundred thousand strong and then some was the way they sang it and the old party lines drawn by sherman s march and the kuklux and nine cent cotton and the jim crow street car ordinances faded away we became one undivided country with no north very little east a good sized chunk of west and a south that loomed up as big as the first foreign label on a new eight dollar suit case of course the dogs of war weren t a complete pack without a yelp from the san augustine rifles company d of the fourteenth texas regiment our company was among the first to land in cuba and strike terror into the hearts of the foe i m not going to give you a history of the war i m just dragging it in to fill out my story about willie robbins just as the republican party dragged it in to help out the election in if anybody ever had heroitis it was that willie robbins from the minute he set foot on the soil of the tyrants of castile he seemed to engulf danger as a cat laps up cream he certainly astonished every man in our company from the captain up you d have expected him to gravitate naturally to the job of an orderly to the colonel or typewriter in the commissary but not any he created the part of the flaxen haired boy hero who lives and gets back home with the goods instead of dying with an important despatch in his hands at his colonel s feet our company got into a section of cuban scenery where one of the messiest and most unsung portions of the campaign occurred we were out every day capering around in the bushes and having little skirmishes with the spanish troops that looked more like kind of tired out feuds than anything else the war was a joke to us and of no interest to them we never could see it any other way than as a howling farce comedy that the san augustine rifles were actually fighting to uphold the stars and stripes and the blamed little senors didn t get enough pay to make them care whether they were patriots or traitors now and then somebody would get killed it seemed like a waste of life to me i was at coney island when i went to new york once and one of them down hill skidding apparatuses they call roller coasters flew the track and killed a man in a brown sack suit whenever the spaniards shot one of our men it struck me as just about as unnecessary and regrettable as that was but i m dropping willie robbins out of the conversation he was out for bloodshed laurels ambition medals recommendations and all other forms of military glory and he didn t seem to be afraid of any of the recognized forms of military danger such as spaniards cannon balls canned beef gunpowder or nepotism he went forth with his pallid hair and china blue eyes and ate up spaniards like you would sardines a la canopy wars and rumbles of wars never flustered him he would stand guard duty mosquitoes hardtack treat and fire with equally perfect unanimity no blondes in history ever come in comparison distance of him except the jack of diamonds and queen catherine of russia i remember one time a little caballard of spanish men sauntered out from behind a patch of sugar cane and shot bob turner the first sergeant of our company while we were eating dinner as required by the army regulations we fellows went through the usual tactics of falling into line saluting the enemy and loading and firing kneeling that wasn t the texas way of scrapping but being a very important addendum and annex to the regular army the san augustine rifles had to conform to the red tape system of getting even by the time we had got out our upton s tactics turned to page fifty seven said one two three one two three a couple of times and got blank cartridges into our springfields the spanish outfit had smiled repeatedly rolled and lit cigarettes by squads and walked away contemptuously i went straight to captain floyd and says to him sam i don t think this war is a straight game you know as well as i do that bob turner was one of the whitest fellows that ever threw a leg over a saddle and now these wirepullers in washington have fixed his clock he s politically and ostensibly dead it ain t fair why should they keep this thing up if they want spain licked why don t they turn the san augustine rifles and joe seely s ranger company and a car load of west texas deputy sheriffs onto these spaniards and let us exonerate them from the face of the earth i never did says i care much about fighting by the lord chesterfield ring rules i m going to hand in my resignation and go home if anybody else i am personally acquainted with gets hurt in this war if you can get somebody in my place sam says i i ll quit the first of next week i don t want to work in an army that don t give its help a chance never mind my wages says i let the secretary of the treasury keep em well ben says the captain to me your allegations and estimations of the tactics of war government patriotism guard mounting and democracy are all right but i ve looked into the system of international arbitration and the ethics of justifiable slaughter a little closer maybe than you have now you can hand in your resignation the first of next week if you are so minded but if you do says sam i ll order a corporal s guard to take you over by that limestone bluff on the creek and shoot enough lead into you to ballast a submarine air ship i m captain of this company and i ve swore allegiance to the amalgamated states regardless of sectional secessional and congressional differences have you got any smoking tobacco winds up sam mine got wet when i swum the creek this morning the reason i drag all this non ex parte evidence in is because willie robbins was standing there listening to us i was a second sergeant and he was a private then but among us texans and westerners there never was as much tactics and subordination as there was in the regular army we never called our captain anything but sam except when there was a lot of major generals and admirals around so as to preserve the discipline and says willie robbins to me in a sharp construction of voice much unbecoming to his light hair and previous record you ought to be shot ben for emitting any such sentiments a man that won t fight for his country is worse than a horse thief if i was the cap i d put you in the guard house for thirty days on round steak and tamales war says willie is great and glorious i didn t know you were a coward i m not says i if i was i d knock some of the pallidness off of your marble brow i m lenient with you i says just as i am with the spaniards because you have always reminded me of something with mushrooms on the side why you little lady of shalott says i you underdone leader of cotillions you glassy fashion and moulded form you white pine soldier made in the cisalpine alps in germany for the late new year trade do you know of whom you are talking to we ve been in the same social circle says i and i ve put up with you because you seemed so meek and self un satisfying i don t understand why you have so sudden taken a personal interest in chivalrousness and murder your nature s undergone a complete revelation now how is it well you wouldn t understand ben says willie giving one of his refined smiles and turning away come back here says i catching him by the tail of his khaki coat you ve made me kind of mad in spite of the aloofness in which i have heretofore held you you are out for making a success in this hero business and i believe i know what for you are doing it either because you are crazy or because you expect to catch some girl by it now if it s a girl i ve got something here to show you i wouldn t have done it but i was plumb mad i pulled a san augustine paper out of my hip pocket and showed him an item it was a half a column about the marriage of myra allison and joe granberry willie laughed and i saw i hadn t touched him oh says he everybody knew that was going to happen i heard about that a week ago and then he gave me the laugh again all right says i then why do you so recklessly chase the bright rainbow of fame do you expect to be elected president or do you belong to a suicide club and then captain sam interferes you gentlemen quit jawing and go back to your quarters says he or i ll have you escorted to the guard house now scat both of you before you go which one of you has got any chewing tobacco we re off sam says i it s supper time anyhow but what do you think of what we was talking about i ve noticed you throwing out a good many grappling hooks for this here balloon called fame what s ambition anyhow what does a man risk his life day after day for do you know of anything he gets in the end that can pay him for the trouble i want to go back home says i i don t care whether cuba sinks or swims and i don t give a pipeful of rabbit tobacco whether queen sophia christina or charlie culberson rules these fairy isles and i don t want my name on any list except the list of survivors but i ve noticed you sam says i seeking the bubble notoriety in the cannon s larynx a number of times now what do you do it for is it ambition business or some freckle faced pheebe at home that you are heroing for well ben says sam kind of hefting his sword out from between his knees as your superior officer i could court martial you for attempted cowardice and desertion but i won t and i ll tell you why i m trying for promotion and the usual honors of war and conquest a major gets more pay than a captain and i need the money correct for you says i i can understand that your system of fame seeking is rooted in the deepest soil of patriotism but i can t comprehend says i why willie robbins whose folks at home are well off and who used to be as meek and undesirous of notice as a cat with cream on his whiskers should all at once develop into a warrior bold with the most fire eating kind of proclivities and the girl in his case seems to have been eliminated by marriage to another fellow i reckon says i it s a plain case of just common ambition he wants his name maybe to go thundering down the coroners of time it must be that well without itemizing his deeds willie sure made good as a hero he simply spent most of his time on his knees begging our captain to send him on forlorn hopes and dangerous scouting expeditions in every fight he was the first man to mix it at close quarters with the don alfonsos he got three or four bullets planted in various parts of his autonomy once he went off with a detail of eight men and captured a whole company of spanish he kept captain floyd busy writing out recommendations of his bravery to send in to head quarters and he began to accumulate medals for all kinds of things heroism and target shooting and valor and tactics and uninsubordination and all the little accomplishments that look good to the third assistant secretaries of the war department finally cap floyd got promoted to be a major general or a knight commander of the main herd or something like that he pounded around on a white horse all desecrated up with gold leaf and hen feathers and a good templar s hat and wasn t allowed by the regulations to speak to us and willie robbins was made captain of our company and maybe he didn t go after the wreath of fame then as far as i could see it was him that ended the war he got eighteen of us boys friends of his too killed in battles that he stirred up himself and that didn t seem to me necessary at all one night he took twelve of us and waded through a little nil about a hundred and ninety yards wide and climbed a couple of mountains and sneaked through a mile of neglected shrubbery and a couple of rock quarries and into a rye straw village and captured a spanish general named as they said benny veedus benny seemed to me hardly worth the trouble being a blackish man without shoes or cuffs and anxious to surrender and throw himself on the commissary of his foe but that job gave willie the big boost he wanted the san augustine news and the galveston st louis new york and kansas city papers printed his picture and columns of stuff about him old san augustine simply went crazy over its gallant son the news had an editorial tearfully begging the government to call off the regular army and the national guard and let willie carry on the rest of the war single handed it said that a refusal to do so would be regarded as a proof that the northern jealousy of the south was still as rampant as ever if the war hadn t ended pretty soon i don t know to what heights of gold braid and encomiums willie would have climbed but it did there was a secession of hostilities just three days after he was appointed a colonel and got in three more medals by registered mail and shot two spaniards while they were drinking lemonade in an ambuscade our company went back to san augustine when the war was over there wasn t anywhere else for it to go and what do you think the old town notified us in print by wire cable special delivery and a nigger named saul sent on a gray mule to san antone that they was going to give us the biggest blow out complimentary alimentary and elementary that ever disturbed the kildees on the sand flats outside of the immediate contiguity of the city i say we but it was all meant for ex private captain de facto and colonel elect willie robbins the town was crazy about him they notified us that the reception they were going to put up would make the mardi gras in new orleans look like an afternoon tea in bury st edmunds with a curate s aunt well the san augustine rifles got back home on schedule time everybody was at the depot giving forth roosevelt democrat they used to be called rebel yells there was two brass bands and the mayor and schoolgirls in white frightening the street car horses by throwing cherokee roses in the streets and well maybe you ve seen a celebration by a town that was inland and out of water they wanted brevet colonel willie to get into a carriage and be drawn by prominent citizens and some of the city aldermen to the armory but he stuck to his company and marched at the head of it up sam houston avenue the buildings on both sides was covered with flags and audiences and everybody hollered robbins or hello willie as we marched up in files of fours i never saw a illustriouser looking human in my life than willie was he had at least seven or eight medals and diplomas and decorations on the breast of his khaki coat he was sunburnt the color of a saddle and he certainly done himself proud they told us at the depot that the courthouse was to be illuminated at half past seven and there would be speeches and chili con came at the palace hotel miss delphine thompson was to read an original poem by james whitcomb ryan and constable hooker had promised us a salute of nine guns from chicago that he had arrested that day after we had disbanded in the armory willie says to me want to walk out a piece with me why yes says i if it ain t so far that we can t hear the tumult and the shouting die away i m hungry myself says i and i m pining for some home grub but i ll go with you willie steered me down some side streets till we came to a little white cottage in a new lot with a twenty by thirty foot lawn decorated with brickbats and old barrel staves halt and give the countersign says i to willie don t you know this dugout it s the bird s nest that joe granberry built before he married myra allison what you going there for but willie already had the gate open he walked up the brick walk to the steps and i went with him myra was sitting in a rocking chair on the porch sewing her hair was smoothed back kind of hasty and tied in a knot i never noticed till then that she had freckles joe was at one side of the porch in his shirtsleeves with no collar on and no signs of a shave trying to scrape out a hole among the brickbats and tin cans to plant a little fruit tree in he looked up but never said a word and neither did myra willie was sure dandy looking in his uniform with medals strung on his breast and his new gold handled sword you d never have taken him for the little white headed snipe that the girls used to order about and make fun of he just stood there for a minute looking at myra with a peculiar little smile on his face and then he says to her slow and kind of holding on to his words with his teeth oh i don t know maybe i could if i tried that was all that was said willie raised his hat and we walked away and somehow when he said that i remembered all of a sudden the night of that dance and willie brushing his hair before the looking glass and myra sticking her head in the door to guy him when we got back to sam houston avenue willie says well so long ben i m going down home and get off my shoes and take a rest you says i what s the matter with you ain t the court house jammed with everybody in town waiting to honor the hero and two brass bands and recitations and flags and jags and grub to follow waiting for you willie sighs all right ben says he darned if i didn t forget all about that and that s why i say concluded ben granger that you can t tell where ambition begins any more than you can where it is going to wind up the head hunter when the war between spain and george dewey was over i went to the philippine islands there i remained as bushwhacker correspondent for my paper until its managing editor notified me that an eight hundred word cablegram describing the grief of a pet carabao over the death of an infant moro was not considered by the office to be war news so i resigned and came home on board the trading vessel that brought me back i pondered much upon the strange things i had sensed in the weird archipelago of the yellow brown people the manoeuvres and skirmishings of the petty war interested me not i was spellbound by the outlandish and unreadable countenance of that race that had turned its expressionless gaze upon us out of an unguessable past particularly during my stay in mindanao had i been fascinated and attracted by that delightfully original tribe of heathen known as the head hunters those grim flinty relentless little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed presence paralleling the trail of their prey through unmapped forests across perilous mountain tops adown bottomless chasms into uninhabitable jungles always near with the invisible hand of death uplifted betraying their pursuit only by such signs as a beast or a bird or a gliding serpent might make a twig crackling in the awful sweat soaked night a drench of dew showering from the screening foliage of a giant tree a whisper at even from the rushes of a water level a hint of death for every mile and every hour they amused me greatly those little fellows of one idea when you think of it their method is beautifully and almost hilariously effective and simple you have your hut in which you live and carry out the destiny that was decreed for you spiked to the jamb of your bamboo doorway is a basket made of green withes plaited from time to time as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move you you creep forth with your snickersnee and take up the silent trail back from it you come triumphant bearing the severed gory head of your victim which you deposit with pardonable pride in the basket at the side of your door it may be the head of your enemy your friend or a stranger according as competition jealousy or simple sportiveness has been your incentive to labor in any case your reward is certain the village men in passing stop to congratulate you as your neighbor on weaker planes of life stops to admire and praise the begonias in your front yard your particular brown maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft tiger s eyes at the evidence of your love for her you chew betel nut and listen content to the intermittent soft drip from the ends of the severed neck arteries and you show your teeth and grunt like a water buffalo which is as near as you can come to laughing at the thought that the cold acephalous body of your door ornament is being spotted by wheeling vultures in the mindanaoan wilds truly the life of the merry head hunter captivated me he had reduced art and philosophy to a simple code to take your adversary s head to basket it at the portal of your castle to see it lying there a dead thing with its cunning and stratagems and power gone is there a better way to foil his plots to refute his arguments to establish your superiority over his skill and wisdom the ship that brought me home was captained by an erratic swede who changed his course and deposited me with genuine compassion in a small town on the pacific coast of one of the central american republics a few hundred miles south of the port to which he had engaged to convey me but i was wearied of movement and exotic fancies so i leaped contentedly upon the firm sands of the village of mojada telling myself i should be sure to find there the rest that i craved after all far better to linger there i thought lulled by the sedative plash of the waves and the rustling of palm fronds than to sit upon the horsehair sofa of my parental home in the east and there cast down by currant wine and cake and scourged by fatuous relatives drivel into the ears of gaping neighbors sad stories of the death of colonial governors when i first saw chloe greene she was standing all in white in the doorway of her father s tile roofed dobe house she was polishing a silver cup with a cloth and she looked like a pearl laid against black velvet she turned on me a flatteringly protracted but a wiltingly disapproving gaze and then went inside humming a light song to indicate the value she placed upon my existence small wonder for dr stamford the most disreputable professional man between juneau and valparaiso and i were zigzagging along the turfy street tunelessly singing the words of auld lang syne to the air of muzzer s little coal black coon we had come from the ice factory which was mojada s palace of wickedness where we had been playing billiards and opening black bottles white with frost that we dragged with strings out of old sandoval s ice cold vats i turned in sudden rage to dr stamford as sober as the verger of a cathedral in a moment i had become aware that we were swine cast before a pearl you beast i said this is half your doing and the other half is the fault of this cursed country i d better have gone back to sleepy town and died in a wild orgy of currant wine and buns than to have had this happen stamford filled the empty street with his roaring laughter you too he cried and all as quick as the popping of a cork well she does seem to strike agreeably upon the retina but don t burn your fingers all mojada will tell you that louis devoe is the man we will see about that said i and perhaps whether he is a man as well as the man i lost no time in meeting louis devoe that was easily accomplished for the foreign colony in mojada numbered scarce a dozen and they gathered daily at a half decent hotel kept by a turk where they managed to patch together the fluttering rags of country and civilization that were left them i sought devoe before i did my pearl of the doorway because i had learned a little of the game of war and knew better than to strike for a prize before testing the strength of the enemy a sort of cold dismay something akin to fear filled me when i had estimated him i found a man so perfectly poised so charming so deeply learned in the world s rituals so full of tact courtesy and hospitality so endowed with grace and ease and a kind of careless haughty power that i almost overstepped the bounds in probing him in turning him on the spit to find the weak point that i so craved for him to have but i left him whole i had to make bitter acknowledgment to myself that louis devoe was a gentleman worthy of my best blows and i swore to give him them he was a great merchant of the country a wealthy importer and exporter all day he sat in a fastidiously appointed office surrounded by works of art and evidences of his high culture directing through glass doors and windows the affairs of his house in person he was slender and hardly tall his small well shaped head was covered with thick brown hair trimmed short and he wore a thick brown beard also cut close and to a fine point his manners were a pattern before long i had become a regular and a welcome visitor at the greene home i shook my wild habits from me like a worn out cloak i trained for the conflict with the care of a prize fighter and the self denial of a brahmin as for chloe greene i shall weary you with no sonnets to her eyebrow she was a splendidly feminine girl as wholesome as a november pippin and no more mysterious than a windowpane she had whimsical little theories that she had deduced from life and that fitted the maxims of epictetus like princess gowns i wonder after all if that old duffer wasn t rather wise chloe had a father the reverend homer greene and an intermittent mother who sometimes palely presided over a twilight teapot the reverend homer was a burr like man with a life work he was writing a concordance to the scriptures and had arrived as far as kings being presumably a suitor for his daughter s hand i was timber for his literary outpourings i had the family tree of israel drilled into my head until i used to cry aloud in my sleep and aminadab begat jay eye see and so forth until he had tackled another book i once made a calculation that the reverend homer s concordance would be worked up as far as the seven vials mentioned in revelations about the third day after they were opened louis devoe as well as i was a visitor and an intimate friend of the greenes it was there i met him the oftenest and a more agreeable man or a more accomplished i have never hated in my life luckily or unfortunately i came to be accepted as a boy my appearance was youthful and i suppose i had that pleading and homeless air that always draws the motherliness that is in women and the cursed theories and hobbies of pater familiases chloe called me tommy and made sisterly fun of my attempts to woo her with devoe she was vastly more reserved he was the man of romance one to stir her imagination and deepest feelings had her fancy leaned toward him i was closer to her but standing in no glamour i had the task before me of winning her in what seems to me the american way of fighting with cleanness and pluck and everyday devotion to break away the barriers of friendship that divided us and to take her if i could between sunrise and dark abetted by neither moonlight nor music nor foreign wiles chloe gave no sign of bestowing her blithe affections upon either of us but one day she let out to me an inkling of what she preferred in a man it was tremendously interesting to me but not illuminating as to its application i had been tormenting her for the dozenth time with the statement and catalogue of my sentiments toward her tommy said she i don t want a man to show his love for me by leading an army against another country and blowing people off the earth with cannons if you mean that the opposite way i answered as they say women do i ll see what i can do the papers are full of this diplomatic row in russia my people know some big people in washington who are right next to the army people and i could get an artillery commission and i m not that way interrupted chloe i mean what i say it isn t the big things that are done in the world tommy that count with a woman when the knights were riding abroad in their armor to slay dragons many a stay at home page won a lonesome lady s hand by being on the spot to pick up her glove and be quick with her cloak when the wind blew the man i am to like best whoever he shall be must show his love in little ways he must never forget after hearing it once that i do not like to have any one walk at my left side that i detest bright colored neckties that i prefer to sit with my back to a light that i like candied violets that i must not be talked to when i am looking at the moonlight shining on water and that i very very often long for dates stuffed with english walnuts frivolity i said with a frown any well trained servant would be equal to such details and he must remember went on chloe to remind me of what i want when i do not know myself what i want you re rising in the scale i said what you seem to need is a first class clairvoyant and if i say that i am dying to hear a beethoven sonata and stamp my foot when i say it he must know by that that what my soul craves is salted almonds and he will have them ready in his pocket now said i i am at a loss i do not know whether your soul s affinity is to be an impresario or a fancy grocer chole turned her pearly smile upon me take less than half of what i said as a jest she went on and don t think too lightly of the little things boy be a paladin if you must but don t let it show on you most women are only very big children and most men are only very little ones please us don t try to overpower us when we want a hero we can make one out of even a plain grocer the third time he catches our handkerchief before it falls to the ground that evening i was taken down with pernicious fever that is a kind of coast fever with improvements and high geared attachments your temperature goes up among the threes and fours and remains there laughing scornfully and feverishly at the cinchona trees and the coal tar derivatives pernicious fever is a case for a simple mathematician instead of a doctor it is merely this formula vitality the desire to live the duration of the fever the result i took to my bed in the two roomed thatched hut where i had been comfortably established and sent for a gallon of rum that was not for myself drunk stamford was the best doctor between the andes and the pacific he came sat at my bedside and drank himself into condition my boy said he my lily white and reformed romeo medicine will do you no good but i will give you quinine which being bitter will arouse in you hatred and anger two stimulants that will add ten per cent to your chances you are as strong as a caribou calf and you will get well if the fever doesn t get in a knockout blow when you re off your guard for two weeks i lay on my back feeling like a hindoo widow on a burning ghat old atasca an untrained indian nurse sat near the door like a petrified statue of what s the use attending to her duties which were mainly to see that time went by without slipping a cog sometimes i would fancy myself back in the philippines or at worse times sliding off the horsehair sofa in sleepytown one afternoon i ordered atasca to vamose and got up and dressed carefully i took my temperature which i was pleased to find i paid almost dainty attention to my dress choosing solicitously a necktie of a dull and subdued hue the mirror showed that i was looking little the worse from my illness the fever gave brightness to my eyes and color to my face and while i looked at my reflection my color went and came again as i thought of chloe greene and the millions of eons that had passed since i d seen her and of louis devoe and the time he had gained on me i went straight to her house i seemed to float rather than walk i hardly felt the ground under my feet i thought pernicious fever must be a great boon to make one feel so strong i found chloe and louis devoe sitting under the awning in front of the house she jumped up and met me with a double handshake i m glad glad glad to see you out again she cried every word a pearl strung on the string of her sentence you are well tommy or better of course i wanted to come to see you but they wouldn t let me oh yes said i carelessly it was nothing merely a little fever i am out again as you see we three sat there and talked for half an hour or so then chloe looked out yearningly and almost piteously across the ocean i could see in her sea blue eyes some deep and intense desire devoe curse him saw it too what is it we asked in unison cocoanut pudding said chloe pathetically i ve wanted some oh so badly for two days it s got beyond a wish it s an obsession the cocoanut season is over said devoe in that voice of his that gave thrilling interest to his most commonplace words i hardly think one could be found in mojada the natives never use them except when they are green and the milk is fresh they sell all the ripe ones to the fruiterers wouldn t a broiled lobster or a welsh rabbit do as well i remarked with the engaging idiocy of a pernicious fever convalescent chloe came as near to pouting as a sweet disposition and a perfect profile would allow her to come the reverend homer poked his ermine lined face through the doorway and added a concordance to the conversation sometimes said he old campos keeps the dried nuts in his little store on the hill but it would be far better my daughter to restrain unusual desires and partake thankfully of the daily dishes that the lord has set before us stuff said i how was that asked the reverend homer sharply i say it s tough said i to drop into the vernacular that miss greene should be deprived of the food she desires a simple thing like kalsomine pudding perhaps i continued solicitously some pickled walnuts or a fricassee of hungarian butternuts would do as well every one looked at me with a slight exhibition of curiosity louis devoe arose and made his adieus i watched him until he had sauntered slowly and grandiosely to the corner around which he turned to reach his great warehouse and store chloe made her excuses and went inside for a few minutes to attend to some detail affecting the seven o clock dinner she was a passed mistress in housekeeping i had tasted her puddings and bread with beatitude when all had gone i turned casually and saw a basket made of plaited green withes hanging by a nail outside the door jamb with a rush that made my hot temples throb there came vividly to my mind recollections of the head hunters those grim flinty relentless little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed presence from time to time as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move him one creeps forth with his snickersnee and takes up the silent trail back he comes triumphant bearing the severed gory head of his victim his particular brown or white maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft tiger s eyes at the evidence of his love for her i stole softly from the house and returned to my hut from its supporting nails in the wall i took a machete as heavy as a butcher s cleaver and sharper than a safety razor and then i chuckled softly to myself and set out to the fastidiously appointed private office of monsieur louis devoe usurper to the hand of the pearl of the pacific he was never slow at thinking he gave one look at my face and another at the weapon in my hand as i entered his door and then he seemed to fade from my sight i ran to the back door kicked it open and saw him running like a deer up the road toward the wood that began two hundred yards away i was after him with a shout i remember hearing children and women screaming and seeing them flying from the road he was fleet but i was stronger a mile and i had almost come up with him he doubled cunningly and dashed into a brake that extended into a small canon i crashed through this after him and in five minutes had him cornered in an angle of insurmountable cliffs there his instinct of self preservation steadied him as it will steady even animals at bay he turned to me quite calm with a ghastly smile oh rayburn he said with such an awful effort at ease that i was impolite enough to laugh rudely in his face oh rayburn said he come let s have done with this nonsense of course i know it s the fever and you re not yourself but collect yourself man give me that ridiculous weapon now and let s go back and talk it over i will go back said i carrying your head with me we will see how charmingly it can discourse when it lies in the basket at her door come said he persuasively i think better of you than to suppose that you try this sort of thing as a joke but even the vagaries of a fever crazed lunatic come some time to a limit what is this talk about heads and baskets get yourself together and throw away that absurd cane chopper what would miss greene think of you he ended with the silky cajolery that one would use toward a fretful child listen said i at last you have struck upon the right note what would she think of me listen i repeated there are women i said who look upon horsehair sofas and currant wine as dross to them even the calculated modulation of your well trimmed talk sounds like the dropping of rotten plums from a tree in the night they are the maidens who walk back and forth in the villages scorning the emptiness of the baskets at the doors of the young men who would win them one such as they i said is waiting only a fool would try to win a woman by drooling like a braggart in her doorway or by waiting upon her whims like a footman they are all daughters of herodias and to gain their hearts one must lay the heads of his enemies before them with his own hands now bend your neck louis devoe do not be a coward as well as a chatterer at a lady s tea table there there said devoe falteringly you know me don t you rayburn oh yes i said i know you i know you i know you but the basket is empty the old men of the village and the young men and both the dark maidens and the ones who are as fair as pearls walk back and forth and see its emptiness will you kneel now or must we have a scuffle it is not like you to make things go roughly and with bad form but the basket is waiting for your head with that he went to pieces i had to catch him as he tried to scamper past me like a scared rabbit i stretched him out and got a foot on his chest but he squirmed like a worm although i appealed repeatedly to his sense of propriety and the duty he owed to himself as a gentleman not to make a row but at last he gave me the chance and i swung the machete it was not hard work he flopped like a chicken during the six or seven blows that it took to sever his head but finally he lay still and i tied his head in my handkerchief the eyes opened and shut thrice while i walked a hundred yards i was red to my feet with the drip but what did that matter with delight i felt under my hands the crisp touch of his short thick brown hair and close trimmed beard i reached the house of the greenes and dumped the head of louis devoe into the basket that still hung by the nail in the door jamb i sat in a chair under the awning and waited the sun was within two hours of setting chloe came out and looked surprised where have you been tommy she asked you were gone when i came out look in the basket i said rising to my feet she looked and gave a little scream of delight i was pleased to note oh tommy she said it was just what i wanted you to do it s leaking a little but that doesn t matter wasn t i telling you it s the little things that count and you remembered little things she held the ensanguined head of louis devoe in her white apron tiny streams of red widened on her apron and dripped upon the floor her face was bright and tender little things indeed i thought again the head hunters are right these are the things that women like you to do for them chloe came close to me there was no one in sight she looked tip at me with sea blue eyes that said things they had never said before you think of me she said you are the man i was describing you think of the little things and they are what make the world worth living in the man for me must consider my little wishes and make me happy in small ways he must bring me little red peaches in december if i wish for them and then i will love him till june i will have no knight in armor slaying his rival or killing dragons for me you please me very well tommy i stooped and kissed her then a moisture broke out on my forehead and i began to feel weak i saw the red stains vanish from chloe s apron and the head of louis devoe turn to a brown dried cocoanut there will be cocoanut pudding for dinner tommy boy said chloe gayly and you must come i must go in for a little while she vanished in a delightful flutter dr stamford tramped up hurriedly he seized my pulse as though it were his own property that i had escaped with you are the biggest fool outside of any asylum he said angrily why did you leave your bed and the idiotic things you ve been doing and no wonder with your pulse going like a sledge hammer name some of them said i devoe sent for me said stamford he saw you from his window go to old campos store chase him up the hill with his own yardstick and then come back and make off with his biggest cocoanut it s the little things that count after all said i it s your little bed that counts with you just now said the doctor you come with me at once or i ll throw up the case you re as loony as a loon so i got no cocoanut pudding that evening but i conceived a distrust as to the value of the method of the head hunters perhaps for many centuries the maidens of the villages may have been looking wistfully at the heads in the baskets at the doorways longing for other and lesser trophies no story to avoid having this book hurled into corner of the room by the suspicious reader i will assert in time that this is not a newspaper story you will encounter no shirt sleeved omniscient city editor no prodigy cub reporter just off the farm no scoop no story no anything but if you will concede me the setting of the first scene in the reporters room of the morning beacon i will repay the favor by keeping strictly my promises set forth above i was doing space work on the beacon hoping to be put on a salary some one had cleared with a rake or a shovel a small space for me at the end of a long table piled high with exchanges congressional records and old files there i did my work i wrote whatever the city whispered or roared or chuckled to me on my diligent wanderings about its streets my income was not regular one day tripp came in and leaned on my table tripp was something in the mechanical department i think he had something to do with the pictures for he smelled of photographers supplies and his hands were always stained and cut up with acids he was about twenty five and looked forty half of his face was covered with short curly red whiskers that looked like a door mat with the welcome left off he was pale and unhealthy and miserable and fawning and an assiduous borrower of sums ranging from twenty five cents to a dollar one dollar was his limit he knew the extent of his credit as well as the chemical national bank knows the amount of h that collateral will show on analysis when he sat on my table he held one hand with the other to keep both from shaking whiskey he had a spurious air of lightness and bravado about him that deceived no one but was useful in his borrowing because it was so pitifully and perceptibly assumed this day i had coaxed from the cashier five shining silver dollars as a grumbling advance on a story that the sunday editor had reluctantly accepted so if i was not feeling at peace with the world at least an armistice had been declared and i was beginning with ardor to write a description of the brooklyn bridge by moonlight well tripp said i looking up at him rather impatiently how goes it he was looking to day more miserable more cringing and haggard and downtrodden than i had ever seen him he was at that stage of misery where he drew your pity so fully that you longed to kick him have you got a dollar asked tripp with his most fawning look and his dog like eyes that blinked in the narrow space between his high growing matted beard and his low growing matted hair i have said i and again i said i have more loudly and inhospitably and four besides and i had hard work corkscrewing them out of old atkinson i can tell you and i drew them i continued to meet a want a hiatus a demand a need an exigency a requirement of exactly five dollars i was driven to emphasis by the premonition that i was to lose one of the dollars on the spot i don t want to borrow any said tripp and i breathed again i thought you d like to get put onto a good story he went on i ve got a rattling fine one for you you ought to make it run a column at least it ll make a dandy if you work it up right it ll probably cost you a dollar or two to get the stuff i don t want anything out of it myself i became placated the proposition showed that tripp appreciated past favors although he did not return them if he had been wise enough to strike me for a quarter then he would have got it what is the story i asked poising my pencil with a finely calculated editorial air i ll tell you said tripp it s a girl a beauty one of the howlingest amsden s junes you ever saw rosebuds covered with dew violets in their mossy bed and truck like that she s lived on long island twenty years and never saw new york city before i ran against her on thirty fourth street she d just got in on the east river ferry i tell you she s a beauty that would take the hydrogen out of all the peroxides in the world she stopped me on the street and asked me where she could find george brown asked me where she could find george brown in new york city what do you think of that i talked to her and found that she was going to marry a young farmer named dodd hiram dodd next week but it seems that george brown still holds the championship in her youthful fancy george had greased his cowhide boots some years ago and came to the city to make his fortune but he forgot to remember to show up again at greenburg and hiram got in as second best choice but when it comes to the scratch ada her name s ada lowery saddles a nag and rides eight miles to the railroad station and catches the a m train for the city looking for george you know you understand about women george wasn t there so she wanted him well you know i couldn t leave her loose in wolftown on the hudson i suppose she thought the first person she inquired of would say george brown why yes lemme see he s a short man with light blue eyes ain t he oh yes you ll find george on one hundred and twenty fifth street right next to the grocery he s bill clerk in a saddle and harness store that s about how innocent and beautiful she is you know those little long island water front villages like greenburg a couple of duck farms for sport and clams and about nine summer visitors for industries that s the kind of a place she comes from but say you ought to see her what could i do i don t know what money looks like in the morning and she d paid her last cent of pocket money for her railroad ticket except a quarter which she had squandered on gum drops she was eating them out of a paper bag i took her to a boarding house on thirty second street where i used to live and hocked her she s in soak for a dollar that s old mother mcginnis price per day i ll show you the house what words are these tripp said i i thought you said you had a story every ferryboat that crosses the east river brings or takes away girls from long island the premature lines on tripp s face grew deeper he frowned seriously from his tangle of hair he separated his hands and emphasized his answer with one shaking forefinger can t you see he said what a rattling fine story it would make you could do it fine all about the romance you know and describe the girl and put a lot of stuff in it about true love and sling in a few stickfuls of funny business joshing the long islanders about being green and well you know how to do it you ought to get fifteen dollars out of it anyhow and it ll cost you only about four dollars you ll make a clear profit of eleven how will it cost me four dollars i asked suspiciously one dollar to mrs mcginnis tripp answered promptly and two dollars to pay the girl s fare back home and the fourth dimension i inquired making a rapid mental calculation one dollar to me said tripp for whiskey are you on i smiled enigmatically and spread my elbows as if to begin writing again but this grim abject specious subservient burr like wreck of a man would not be shaken off his forehead suddenly became shiningly moist don t you see he said with a sort of desperate calmness that this girl has got to be sent home to day not to night nor to morrow but to day i can t do anything for her you know i m the janitor and corresponding secretary of the down and out club i thought you could make a newspaper story out of it and win out a piece of money on general results but anyhow don t you see that she s got to get back home before night and then i began to feel that dull leaden soul depressing sensation known as the sense of duty why should that sense fall upon one as a weight and a burden i knew that i was doomed that day to give up the bulk of my store of hard wrung coin to the relief of this ada lowery but i swore to myself that tripp s whiskey dollar would not be forthcoming he might play knight errant at my expense but he would indulge in no wassail afterward commemorating my weakness and gullibility in a kind of chilly anger i put on my coat and hat tripp submissive cringing vainly endeavoring to please conducted me via the street cars to the human pawn shop of mother mcginnis i paid the fares it seemed that the collodion scented don quixote and the smallest minted coin were strangers tripp pulled the bell at the door of the mouldly red brick boarding house at its faint tinkle he paled and crouched as a rabbit makes ready to spring away at the sound of a hunting dog i guessed what a life he had led terror haunted by the coming footsteps of landladies give me one of the dollars quick he said the door opened six inches mother mcginnis stood there with white eyes they were white i say and a yellow face holding together at her throat with one hand a dingy pink flannel dressing sack tripp thrust the dollar through the space without a word and it bought us entry she s in the parlor said the mcginnis turning the back of her sack upon us in the dim parlor a girl sat at the cracked marble centre table weeping comfortably and eating gum drops she was a flawless beauty crying had only made her brilliant eyes brighter when she crunched a gum drop you thought only of the poetry of motion and envied the senseless confection eve at the age of five minutes must have been a ringer for miss ada lowery at nineteen or twenty i was introduced and a gum drop suffered neglect while she conveyed to me a naive interest such as a puppy dog a prize winner might bestow upon a crawling beetle or a frog tripp took his stand by the table with the fingers of one hand spread upon it as an attorney or a master of ceremonies might have stood but he looked the master of nothing his faded coat was buttoned high as if it sought to be charitable to deficiencies of tie and linen i thought of a scotch terrier at the sight of his shifty eyes in the glade between his tangled hair and beard for one ignoble moment i felt ashamed of having been introduced as his friend in the presence of so much beauty in distress but evidently tripp meant to conduct the ceremonies whatever they might be i thought i detected in his actions and pose an intention of foisting the situation upon me as material for a newspaper story in a lingering hope of extracting from me his whiskey dollar my friend i shuddered mr chalmers said tripp will tell you miss lowery the same that i did he s a reporter and he can hand out the talk better than i can that s why i brought him with me tripp wasn t it the silver tongued orator you wanted he s wise to a lot of things and he ll tell you now what s best to do i stood on one foot as it were as i sat in my rickety chair why er miss lowery i began secretly enraged at tripp s awkward opening i am at your service of course but er as i haven t been apprized of the circumstances of the case i er oh said miss lowery beaming for a moment it ain t as bad as that there ain t any circumstances it s the first time i ve ever been in new york except once when i was five years old and i had no idea it was such a big town and i met mr mr snip on the street and asked him about a friend of mine and he brought me here and asked me to wait i advise you miss lowery said tripp to tell mr chalmers all he s a friend of mine i was getting used to it by this time and he ll give you the right tip why certainly said miss ada chewing a gum drop toward me there ain t anything to tell except that well everything s fixed for me to marry hiram dodd next thursday evening hi has got two hundred acres of land with a lot of shore front and one of the best truck farms on the island but this morning i had my horse saddled up he s a white horse named dancer and i rode over to the station i told em at home i was going to spend the day with susie adams it was a story i guess but i don t care and i came to new york on the train and i met mr mr flip on the street and asked him if he knew where i could find g g now miss lowery broke in tripp loudly and with much bad taste i thought as she hesitated with her word you like this young man hiram dodd don t you he s all right and good to you ain t he of course i like him said miss lowery emphatically hi s all right and of course he s good to me so is everybody i could have sworn it myself throughout miss ada lowery s life all men would be to good to her they would strive contrive struggle and compete to hold umbrellas over her hat check her trunk pick up her handkerchief buy for her soda at the fountain but went on miss lowery last night got to thinking about g george and i down went the bright gold head upon dimpled clasped hands on the table such a beautiful april storm unrestrainedly sobbed i wished i could have comforted her but i was not george and i was glad i was not hiram and yet i was sorry too by and by the shower passed she straightened up brave and half way smiling she would have made a splendid wife for crying only made her eyes more bright and tender she took a gum drop and began her story i guess i m a terrible hayseed she said between her little gulps and sighs but i can t help it g george brown and i were sweet hearts since he was eight and i was five when he was nineteen that was four years ago he left greenburg and went to the city he said he was going to be a policeman or a railroad president or something and then he was coming back for me but i never heard from him any more and i i liked him another flow of tears seemed imminent but tripp hurled himself into the crevasse and dammed it confound him i could see his game he was trying to make a story of it for his sordid ends and profit go on mr chalmers said he and tell the lady what s the proper caper that s what i told her you d hand it to her straight spiel up i coughed and tried to feel less wrathful toward tripp i saw my duty cunningly i had been inveigled but i was securely trapped tripp s first dictum to me had been just and correct the young lady must be sent back to greenburg that day she must be argued with convinced assured instructed ticketed and returned without delay i hated hiram and despised george but duty must be done noblesse oblige and only five silver dollars are not strictly romantic compatibles but sometimes they can be made to jibe it was mine to be sir oracle and then pay the freight so i assumed an air that mingled solomon s with that of the general passenger agent of the long island railroad miss lowery said i as impressively as i could life is rather a queer proposition after all there was a familiar sound to these words after i had spoken them and i hoped miss lowery had never heard mr cohan s song those whom we first love we seldom wed our earlier romances tinged with the magic radiance of youth often fail to materialize the last three words sounded somewhat trite when they struck the air but those fondly cherished dreams i went on may cast a pleasant afterglow on our future lives however impracticable and vague they may have been but life is full of realities as well as visions and dreams one cannot live on memories may i ask miss lowery if you think you could pass a happy that is a contented and harmonious life with mr er dodd if in other ways than romantic recollections he seems to er fill the bill as i might say oh hi s all right answered miss lowery yes i could get along with him fine he s promised me an automobile and a motor boat but somehow when it got so close to the time i was to marry him i couldn t help wishing well just thinking about george something must have happened to him or he d have written on the day he left he and me got a hammer and a chisel and cut a dime into two pieces i took one piece and he took the other and we promised to be true to each other and always keep the pieces till we saw each other again i ve got mine at home now in a ring box in the top drawer of my dresser i guess i was silly to come up here looking for him i never realized what a big place it is and then tripp joined in with a little grating laugh that he had still trying to drag in a little story or drama to earn the miserable dollar that he craved oh the boys from the country forget a lot when they come to the city and learn something i guess george maybe is on the bum or got roped in by some other girl or maybe gone to the dogs on account of whiskey or the races you listen to mr chalmers and go back home and you ll be all right but now the time was come for action for the hands of the clock were moving close to noon frowning upon tripp i argued gently and philosophically with miss lowery delicately convincing her of the importance of returning home at once and i impressed upon her the truth that it would not be absolutely necessary to her future happiness that she mention to hi the wonders or the fact of her visit to the city that had swallowed up the unlucky george she said she had left her horse unfortunate rosinante tied to a tree near the railroad station tripp and i gave her instructions to mount the patient steed as soon as she arrived and ride home as fast as possible there she was to recount the exciting adventure of a day spent with susie adams she could fix susie i was sure of that and all would be well and then being susceptible to the barbed arrows of beauty i warmed to the adventure the three of us hurried to the ferry and there i found the price of a ticket to greenburg to be but a dollar and eighty cents i bought one and a red red rose with the twenty cents for miss lowery we saw her aboard her ferryboat and stood watching her wave her handkerchief at us until it was the tiniest white patch imaginable and then tripp and i faced each other brought back to earth left dry and desolate in the shade of the sombre verities of life the spell wrought by beauty and romance was dwindling i looked at tripp and almost sneered he looked more careworn contemptible and disreputable than ever i fingered the two silver dollars remaining in my pocket and looked at him with the half closed eyelids of contempt he mustered up an imitation of resistance can t you get a story out of it he asked huskily some sort of a story even if you have to fake part of it not a line said i i can fancy the look on grimes face if i should try to put over any slush like this but we ve helped the little lady out and that ll have to be our only reward i m sorry said tripp almost inaudibly i m sorry you re out your money now it seemed to me like a find of a big story you know that is a sort of thing that would write up pretty well let s try to forget it said i with a praiseworthy attempt at gayety and take the next car cross town i steeled myself against his unexpressed but palpable desire he should not coax cajole or wring from me the dollar he craved i had had enough of that wild goose chase tripp feebly unbuttoned his coat of the faded pattern and glossy seams to reach for something that had once been a handkerchief deep down in some obscure and cavernous pocket as he did so i caught the shine of a cheap silver plated watch chain across his vest and something dangling from it caused me to stretch forth my hand and seize it curiously it was the half of a silver dime that had been cut in halves with a chisel what i said looking at him keenly oh yes he responded dully george brown alias tripp what s the use barring the w c t u i d like to know if anybody disapproves of my having produced promptly from my pocket tripp s whiskey dollar and unhesitatingly laying it in his hand the higher pragmatism i where to go for wisdom has become a question of serious import the ancients are discredited plato is boiler plate aristotle is tottering marcus aurelius is reeling aesop has been

we know a thing we know it but very often we are not wise to it that we are wise and but let s go on with the story ii once upon a time i found a ten cent magazine lying on a bench in a little city park anyhow that was the amount he asked me for when i sat on the bench next to him he was a musty dingy and tattered magazine with some queer stories bound in him i was sure he turned out to be a scrap book i am a newspaper reporter i said to him to try him i have been detailed to write up some of the experiences of the unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in this park may i ask you to what you attribute your downfall in i was interrupted by a laugh from my purchase a laugh so rusty and unpractised that i was sure it had been his first for many a day oh no no said he you ain t a reporter reporters don t talk that way they pretend to be one of us and say they ve just got in on the blind baggage from st louis i can tell a reporter on sight us park bums get to be fine judges of human nature we sit here all day and watch the people go by i can size up anybody who walks past my bench in a way that would surprise you well i said go on and tell me how do you size me up i should say said the student of human nature with unpardonable hesitation that you was say in the contracting business or maybe worked in a store or was a sign painter you stopped in the park to finish your cigar and thought you d get a little free monologue out of me still you might be a plasterer or a lawyer it s getting kind of dark you see and your wife won t let you smoke at home i frowned gloomily but judging again went on the reader of men i d say you ain t got a wife no said i rising restlessly no no no i ain t but i will have by the arrows of cupid that is if my voice must have trailed away and muffled itself in uncertainty and despair i see you have a story yourself said the dusty vagrant impudently it seemed to me suppose you take your dime back and spin your yarn for me i m interested myself in the ups and downs of unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in the park somehow that amused me i looked at the frowsy derelict with more interest i did have a story why not tell it to him i had told none of my friends i had always been a reserved and bottled up man it was psychical timidity or sensitiveness perhaps both and i smiled to myself in wonder when i felt an impulse to confide in this stranger and vagabond jack said i mack said he mack said i i ll tell you do you want the dime back in advance said he i handed him a dollar the dime said i was the price of listening to your story right on the point of the jaw said he go on and then incredible as it may seem to the lovers in the world who confide their sorrows only to the night wind and the gibbous moon i laid bare my secret to that wreck of all things that you would have supposed to be in sympathy with love i told him of the days and weeks and months that i had spent in adoring mildred telfair i spoke of my despair my grievous days and wakeful nights my dwindling hopes and distress of mind i even pictured to this night prowler her beauty and dignity the great sway she had in society and the magnificence of her life as the elder daughter of an ancient race whose pride overbalanced the dollars of the city s millionaires why don t you cop the lady out asked mack bringing me down to earth and dialect again i explained to him that my worth was so small my income so minute and my fears so large that i hadn t the courage to speak to her of my worship i told him that in her presence i could only blush and stammer and that she looked upon me with a wonderful maddening smile of amusement she kind of moves in the professional class don t she asked mack the telfair family i began haughtily i mean professional beauty said my hearer she is greatly and widely admired i answered cautiously any sisters one you know any more girls why several i answered and a few others say said mack tell me one thing can you hand out the dope to other girls can you chin em and make matinee eyes at em and squeeze em you know what i mean you re just shy when it comes to this particular dame the professional beauty ain t that right in a way you have outlined the situation with approximate truth i admitted i thought so said mack grimly now that reminds me of my own case i ll tell you about it i was indignant but concealed it what was this loafer s case or anybody s case compared with mine besides i had given him a dollar and ten cents feel my muscle said my companion suddenly flexing his biceps i did so mechanically the fellows in gyms are always asking you to do that his arm was as hard as cast iron four years ago said mack i could lick any man in new york outside of the professional ring your case and mine is just the same i come from the west side between thirtieth and fourteenth i won t give the number on the door i was a scrapper when i was ten and when i was twenty no amateur in the city could stand up four rounds with me s a fact you know bill mccarty no he managed the smokers for some of them swell clubs well i knocked out everything bill brought up before me i was a middle weight but could train down to a welter when necessary i boxed all over the west side at bouts and benefits and private entertainments and was never put out once but say the first time i put my foot in the ring with a professional i was no more than a canned lobster i dunno how it was i seemed to lose heart i guess i got too much imagination there was a formality and publieness about it that kind of weakened my nerve i never won a fight in the ring light weights and all kinds of scrubs used to sign up with my manager and then walk up and tap me on the wrist and see me fall the minute i seen the crowd and a lot of gents in evening clothes down in front and seen a professional come inside the ropes i got as weak as ginger ale of course it wasn t long till i couldn t get no backers and i didn t have any more chances to fight a professional or many amateurs either but lemme tell you i was as good as most men inside the ring or out it was just that dumb dead feeling i had when i was up against a regular that always done me up well sir after i had got out of the business i got a mighty grouch on i used to go round town licking private citizens and all kinds of unprofessionals just to please myself i d lick cops in dark streets and car conductors and cab drivers and draymen whenever i could start a row with em it didn t make any difference how big they were or how much science they had i got away with em if i d only just have had the confidence in the ring that i had beating up the best men outside of it i d be wearing black pearls and heliotrope silk socks to day one evening i was walking along near the bowery thinking about things when along comes a slumming party about six or seven they was all in swallowtails and these silk hats that don t shine one of the gang kind of shoves me off the sidewalk i hadn t had a scrap in three days and i just says de lighted and hits him back of the ear well we had it that johnnie put up as decent a little fight as you d want to see in the moving pictures it was on a side street and no cops around the other guy had a lot of science but it only took me about six minutes to lay him out some of the swallowtails dragged him up against some steps and began to fan him another one of em comes over to me and says young man do you know what you ve done oh beat it says i i ve done nothing but a little punching bag work take freddy back to yale and tell him to quit studying sociology on the wrong side of the sidewalk my good fellow says he i don t know who you are but i d like to you ve knocked out reddy burns the champion middle weight of the world he came to new york yesterday to try to get a match on with jim jeifries if you but when i come out of my faint i was laying on the floor in a drug store saturated with aromatic spirits of ammonia if i d known that was reddy burns i d have got down in the gutter and crawled past him instead of handing him one like i did why if i d ever been in a ring and seen him climbing over the ropes i d have been all to the sal volatile so that s what imagination does concluded mack and as i said your case and mine is simultaneous you ll never win out you can t go up against the professionals i tell you it s a park bench for yours in this romance business mack the pessimist laughed harshly i m afraid i don t see the parallel i said coldly i have only a very slight acquaintance with the prize ring the derelict touched my sleeve with his forefinger for emphasis as he explained his parable every man said he with some dignity has got his lamps on something that looks good to him with you it s this dame that you re afraid to say your say to with me it was to win out in the ring well you ll lose just like i did why do you think i shall lose i asked warmly cause said he you re afraid to go in the ring you dassen t stand up before a professional your case and mine is just the same you re a amateur and that means that you d better keep outside of the ropes well i must be going i said rising and looking with elaborate care at my watch when i was twenty feet away the park bencher called to me much obliged for the dollar he said and for the dime but you ll never get er you re in the amateur class serves you right i said to myself for hobnobbing with a tramp his impudence but as i walked his words seemed to repeat themselves over and over again in my brain i think i even grew angry at the man i ll show him i finally said aloud i ll show him that i can fight reddy burns too even knowing who he is i hurried to a telephone booth and rang up the telfair residence a soft sweet voice answered didn t i know that voice my hand holding the receiver shook is that you said i employing the foolish words that form the vocabulary of every talker through the telephone yes this is i came back the answer in the low clear cut tones that are an inheritance of the telfairs who is it please it s me said i less ungrammatically than egotistically it s me and i ve got a few things that i want to say to you right now and immediately and straight to the point dear me said the voice oh it s you mr arden i wondered if any accent on the first word was intended mildred was fine at saying things that you had to study out afterward yes said i i hope so and now to come down to brass tacks i thought that rather a vernacularism if there is such a word as soon as i had said it but i didn t stop to apologize you know of course that i love you and that i have been in that idiotic state for a long time i don t want any more foolish ness about it that is i mean i want an answer from you right now will you marry me or not hold the wire please keep out central hello hello will you or will you not that was just the uppercut for reddy burns chin the answer came back why phil dear of course i will i didn t know that you that is you never said oh come up to the house please i can t say what i want to over the phone you are so importunate but please come up to the house won t you would i i rang the bell of the telfair house violently some sort of a human came to the door and shooed me into the drawing room oh well said i to myself looking at the ceiling any one can learn from any one that was a pretty good philosophy of mack s anyhow he didn t take advantage of his experience but i get the benefit of it if you want to get into the professional class you ve got to i stopped thinking then some one was coming down the stairs my knees began to shake i knew then how mack had felt when a professional began to climb over the ropes i looked around foolishly for a door or a window by which i might escape if it had been any other girl approaching i mightn t have but just then the door opened and bess mildred s younger sister came in i d never seen her look so much like a glorified angel she walked straight tip to me and and i d never noticed before what perfectly wonderful eyes and hair elizabeth telfair had phil she said in the telfair sweet thrilling tones why didn t you tell me about it before i thought it was sister you wanted all the time until you telephoned to me a few minutes ago i suppose mack and i always will be hopeless amateurs but as the thing has turned out in my case i m mighty glad of it best seller i one day last summer i went to pittsburgh well i had to go there on business my chair car was profitably well filled with people of the kind one usually sees on chair cars most of them were ladies in brown silk dresses cut with square yokes with lace insertion and dotted veils who refused to have the windows raised then there was the usual number of men who looked as if they might be in almost any business and going almost anywhere some students of human nature can look at a man in a pullman and tell you where he is from his occupation and his stations in life both flag and social but i never could the only way i can correctly judge a fellow traveller is when the train is held up by robbers or when he reaches at the same time i do for the last towel in the dressing room of the sleeper the porter came and brushed the collection of soot on the window sill off to the left knee of my trousers i removed it with an air of apology the temperature was eighty eight one of the dotted veiled ladies demanded the closing of two more ventilators and spoke loudly of interlaken i leaned back idly in chair no and looked with the tepidest curiosity at the small black bald spotted head just visible above the back of no suddenly no hurled a book to the floor between his chair and the window and looking i saw that it was the rose lady and trevelyan one of the best selling novels of the present day and then the critic or philistine whichever he was veered his chair toward the window and i knew him at once for john a pescud of pittsburgh travelling salesman for a plate glass company an old acquaintance whom i had not seen in two years in two minutes we were faced had shaken hands and had finished with such topics as rain prosperity health residence and destination politics might have followed next but i was not so ill fated i wish you might know john a pescud he is of the stuff that heroes are not often lucky enough to be made of he is a small man with a wide smile and an eye that seems to be fixed upon that little red spot on the end of your nose i never saw him wear but one kind of necktie and he believes in cuff holders and button shoes he is as hard and true as anything ever turned out by the cambria steel works and he believes that as soon as pittsburgh makes smoke consumers compulsory st peter will come down and sit at the foot of smithfield street and let somebody else attend to the gate up in the branch heaven he believes that our plate glass is the most important commodity in the world and that when a man is in his home town he ought to be decent and law abiding during my acquaintance with him in the city of diurnal night i had never known his views on life romance literature and ethics we had browsed during our meetings on local topics and then parted after chateau margaux irish stew flannel cakes cottage pudding and coffee hey there with milk separate now i was to get more of his ideas by way of facts he told me that business had picked up since the party conventions and that he was going to get off at coketown ii say said pescud stirring his discarded book with the toe of his right shoe did you ever read one of these best sellers i mean the kind where the hero is an american swell sometimes even from chicago who falls in love with a royal princess from europe who is travelling under an alias and follows her to her father s kingdom or principality i guess you have they re all alike sometimes this going away masher is a washington newspaper correspondent and sometimes he is a van something from new york or a chicago wheat broker worthy fifty millions but he s always ready to break into the king row of any foreign country that sends over their queens and princesses to try the new plush seats on the big four or the b and there doesn t seem to be any other reason in the book for their being here well this fellow chases the royal chair warmer home as i said and finds out who she is he meets here on the corso or the strasse one evening and gives us ten pages of conversation she reminds him of the difference in their stations and that gives him a chance to ring in three solid pages about america s uncrowned sovereigns if you d take his remarks and set em to music and then take the music away from em they d sound exactly like one of george cohan s songs well you know how it runs on if you ve read any of em he slaps the king s swiss body guards around like everything whenever they get in his way he s a great fencer too now i ve known of some chicago men who were pretty notorious fences but i never heard of any fencers coming from there he stands on the first landing of the royal staircase in castle schutzenfestenstein with a gleaming rapier in his hand and makes a baltimore broil of six platoons of traitors who come to massacre the said king and then he has to fight duels with a couple of chancellors and foil a plot by four austrian archdukes to seize the kingdom for a gasoline station but the great scene is when his rival for the princess hand count feodor attacks him between the portcullis and the ruined chapel armed with a mitrailleuse a yataghan and a couple of siberian bloodhounds this scene is what runs the best seller into the twenty ninth edition before the publisher has had time to draw a check for the advance royalties the american hero shucks his coat and throws it over the heads of the bloodhounds gives the mitrailleuse a slap with his mitt says yah to the yataghan and lands in kid mccoy s best style on the count s left eye of course we have a neat little prize fight right then and there the count in order to make the go possible seems to be an expert at the art of self defence himself and here we have the corbett sullivan fight done over into literature the book ends with the broker and the princess doing a john cecil clay cover under the linden trees on the gorgonzola walk that winds up the love story plenty good enough but i notice that the book dodges the final issue even a best seller has sense enough to shy at either leaving a chicago grain broker on the throne of lobsterpotsdam or bringing over a real princess to eat fish and potato salad in an italian chalet on michigan avenue what do you think about em why said i i hardly know john there s a saying love levels all ranks you know yes said pescud but these kind of love stories are rank on the level i know something about literature even if i am in plate glass these kind of books are wrong and yet i never go into a train but what they pile em up on me no good can come out of an international clinch between the old world aristocracy and one of us fresh americans when people in real life marry they generally hunt up somebody in their own station a fellow usually picks out a girl that went to the same high school and belonged to the same singing society that he did when young millionaires fall in love they always select the chorus girl that likes the same kind of sauce on the lobster that he does washington newspaper correspondents always many widow ladies ten years older than themselves who keep boarding houses no sir you can t make a novel sound right to me when it makes one of c d gibson s bright young men go abroad and turn kingdoms upside down just because he s a taft american aud took a course at a gymnasium and listen how they talk too pescud picked up the best seller and hunted his page listen at this said he trevelyan is chinning with the princess alwyna at the back end of the tulip garden this is how it goes say not so dearest and sweetest of earth s fairest flowers would i aspire you are a star set high above me in a royal heaven i am only myself yet i am a man and i have a heart to do and dare i have no title save that of an uncrowned sovereign but i have an arm and a sword that yet might free schutzenfestenstein from the plots of traitors think of a chicago man packing a sword and talking about freeing anything that sounded as much like canned pork as that he d be much more likely to fight to have an import duty put on it i think i understand you john said i you want fiction writers to be consistent with their scenes and characters they shouldn t mix turkish pashas with vermont farmers or english dukes with long island clam diggers or italian countesses with montana cowboys or cincinnati brewery agents with the rajahs of india or plain business men with aristocracy high above em added pescud it don t jibe people are divided into classes whether we admit it or not and it s everybody s impulse to stick to their own class they do it too i don t see why people go to work and buy hundreds of thousands of books like that you don t see or hear of any such didoes and capers in real life iii well john said i i haven t read a best seller in a long time maybe i ve had notions about them somewhat like yours but tell me more about yourself getting along all right with the company bully said pescud brightening at once i ve had my salary raised twice since i saw you and i get a commission too i ve bought a neat slice of real estate out in the east end and have run up a house on it next year the firm is going to sell me some shares of stock oh i m in on the line of general prosperity no matter who s elected met your affinity yet john i asked oh i didn t tell you about that did i said pescud with a broader grin ho i said so you ve taken time enough off from your plate glass to have a romance no no said john no romance nothing like that but i ll tell you about it i was on the south bound going to cincinnati about eighteen months ago when i saw across the aisle the finest looking girl i d ever laid eyes on nothing spectacular you know but just the sort you want for keeps well i never was up to the flirtation business either handkerchief automobile postage stamp or door step and she wasn t the kind to start anything she read a book and minded her business which was to make the world prettier and better just by residing on it i kept on looking out of the side doors of my eyes and finally the proposition got out of the pullman class into a case of a cottage with a lawn and vines running over the porch i never thought of speaking to her but i let the plate glass business go to smash for a while she changed cars at cincinnati and took a sleeper to louisville over the l and n there she bought another ticket and went on through shelbyville frankfort and lexington along there i began to have a hard time keeping up with her the trains came along when they pleased and didn t seem to be going anywhere in particular except to keep on the track and the right of way as much as possible then they began to stop at junctions instead of towns and at last they stopped altogether i ll bet pinkerton would outbid the plate glass people for my services any time if they knew how i managed to shadow that young lady i contrived to keep out of her sight as much as i could but i never lost track of her the last station she got off at was away down in virginia about six in the afternoon there were about fifty houses and four hundred niggers in sight the rest was red mud mules and speckled hounds a tall old man with a smooth face and white hair looking as proud as julius caesar and roscoe conkling on the same post card was there to meet her his clothcs were frazzled but i didn t notice that till later he took her little satchel and they started over the plank walks and went up a road along the hill i kept along a piece behind em trying to look like i was hunting a garnet ring in the sand that my sister had lost at a picnic the previous saturday they went in a gate on top of the hill it nearly took my breath away when i looked up up there in the biggest grove i ever saw was a tremendous house with round white pillars about a thousand feet high and the yard was so full of rose bushes and box bushes and lilacs that you couldn t have seen the house if it hadn t been as big as the capitol at washington here s where i have to trail says i to myself i thought before that she seemed to be in moderate circumstances at least this must be the governor s mansion or the agricultural building of a new world s fair anyhow i d better go back to the village and get posted by the postmaster or drug the druggist for some information in the village i found a pine hotel called the bay view house the only excuse for the name was a bay horse grazing in the front yard i set my sample case down and tried to be ostensible i told the landlord i was taking orders for plate glass i don t want no plates says he but i do need another glass molasses pitcher by and by i got him down to local gossip and answering questions why says he i thought everybody knowed who lived in the big white house on the hill it s colonel allyn the biggest man and the finest quality in virginia or anywhere else they re the oldest family in the state that was his daughter that got off the train she s been up to illinois to see her aunt who is sick i registered at the hotel and on the third day i caught the young lady walking in the front yard down next to the paling fence i stopped and raised my hat there wasn t any other way excuse me says i can you tell me where mr hinkle lives she looks at me as cool as if i was the man come to see about the weeding of the garden but i thought i saw just a slight twinkle of fun in her eyes no one of that name lives in birchton says she that is she goes on as far as i know is the gentleman you are seeking white well that tickled me no kidding says i i m not looking for smoke even if i do come from pittsburgh you are quite a distance from home says she i d have gone a thousand miles farther says i not if you hadn t waked up when the train started in shelbyville says she and then she turned almost as red as one of the roses on the bushes in the yard i remembered i had dropped off to sleep on a bench in the shelbyville station waiting to see which train she took and only just managed to wake up in time and then i told her why i had come as respectful and earnest as i could and i told her everything about myself and what i was making and how that all i asked was just to get acquainted with her and try to get her to like me she smiles a little and blushes some but her eyes never get mixed up they look straight at whatever she s talking to i never had any one talk like this to me before mr pescud says she what did you say your name is john john a says i and you came mighty near missing the train at powhatan junction too says she with a laugh that sounded as good as a mileage book to me how did you know i asked men are very clumsy said she i knew you were on every train i thought you were going to speak to me and i m glad you didn t then we had more talk and at last a kind of proud serious look came on her face and she turned and pointed a finger at the big house the allyns says she have lived in elmcroft for a hundred years we are a proud family look at that mansion it has fifty rooms see the pillars and porches and balconies the ceilings in the reception rooms and the ball room are twenty eight feet high my father is a lineal descendant of belted earls i belted one of em once in the duquesne hotel in pittsburgh says i and he didn t offer to resent it he was there dividing his attentions between monongahela whiskey and heiresses and he got fresh of course she goes on my father wouldn t allow a drummer to set his foot in elmeroft if he knew that i was talking to one over the fence he would lock me in my room would you let me come there says i would you talk to me if i was to call for i goes on if you said i might come and see you the earls might be belted or suspendered or pinned up with safety pins as far as i am concerned i must not talk to you she says because we have not been introduced it is not exactly proper so i will say good bye mr say the name says i you haven t forgotten it pescud says she a little mad the rest of the name i demands cool as could be john says she john what i says john a says she with her head high are you through now i m coming to see the belted earl to morrow i says he ll feed you to his fox hounds says she laughing if he does it ll improve their running says i i m something of a hunter myself i must be going in now says she i oughtn t to have spoken to you at all i hope you ll have a pleasant trip back to minneapolis or pittsburgh was it good bye good night says i and it wasn t minneapolis what s your name first please she hesitated then she pulled a leaf off a bush and said my name is jessie says she good night miss allyn says i the next morning at eleven sharp i rang the door bell of that world s fair main building after about three quarters of an hour an old nigger man about eighty showed up and asked what i wanted i gave him my business card and said i wanted to see the colonel he showed me in say did you ever crack open a wormy english walnut that s what that house was like there wasn t enough furniture in it to fill an eight dollar flat some old horsehair lounges and three legged chairs and some framed ancestors on the walls were all that met the eye but when colonel allyn comes in the place seemed to light up you could almost hear a band playing and see a bunch of old timers in wigs and white stockings dancing a quadrille it was the style of him although he had on the same shabby clothes i saw him wear at the station for about nine seconds he had me rattled and i came mighty near getting cold feet and trying to sell him some plate glass but i got my nerve back pretty quick he asked me to sit down and i told him everything i told him how i followed his daughter from cincinnati and what i did it for and all about my salary and prospects and explained to him my little code of living to be always decent and right in your home town and when you re on the road never take more than four glasses of beer a day or play higher than a twenty five cent limit at first i thought he was going to throw me out of the window but i kept on talking pretty soon i got a chance to tell him that story about the western congressman who had lost his pocket book and the grass widow you remember that story well that got him to laughing and i ll bet that was the first laugh those ancestors and horsehair sofas had heard in many a day we talked two hours i told him everything i knew and then he began to ask questions and i told him the rest all i asked of him was to give me a chance if i couldn t make a hit with the little lady i d clear out and not bother any more at last he says there was a sir courtenay pescud in the time of charles i if i remember rightly if there was says i he can t claim kin with our bunch we ve always lived in and around pittsburgh i ve got an uncle in the real estate business and one in trouble somewhere out in kansas you can inquire about any of the rest of us from anybody in old smoky town and get satisfactory replies did you ever run across that story about the captain of the whaler who tried to make a sailor say his prayers says i it occurs to me that i have never been so fortunate says the colonel so i told it to him laugh i was wishing to myself that he was a customer what a bill of glass i d sell him and then he says the relating of anecdotes and humorous occurrences has always seemed to me mr pescud to be a particularly agreeable way of promoting and perpetuating amenities between friends with your permission i will relate to you a fox hunting story with which i was personally connected and which may furnish you some amusement so he tells it it takes forty minutes by the watch did i laugh well say when i got my face straight he calls in old pete the super annuated darky and sends him down to the hotel to bring up my valise it was elmcroft for me while i was in the town two evenings later i got a chance to speak a word with miss jessie alone on the porch while the colonel was thinking up another story it s going to be a fine evening says i he s coming says she he s going to tell you this time the story about the old negro and the green watermelons it always comes after the one about the yankees and the game rooster there was another time she goes on that you nearly got left it was at pulaski city yes says i i remember my foot slipped as i was jumping on the step and i nearly tumbled off i know says she and and i i was afraid you had john a i was afraid you had and then she skips into the house through one of the big windows iv coketown droned the porter making his way through the slowing car pescud gathered his hat and baggage with the leisurely promptness of an old traveller i married her a year ago said john i told you i built a house in the east end the belted i mean the colonel is there too i find him waiting at the gate whenever i get back from a trip to hear any new story i might have picked up on the road i glanced out of the window coketown was nothing more than a ragged hillside dotted with a score of black dismal huts propped up against dreary mounds of slag and clinkers it rained in slanting torrents too and the rills foamed and splashed down through the black mud to the railroad tracks you won t sell much plate glass here john said i why do you get off at this end o the world why said pescud the other day i took jessie for a little trip to philadelphia and coming back she thought she saw some petunias in a pot in one of those windows over there just like some she used to raise down in the old virginia home so i thought i d drop off here for the night and see if i could dig up some of the cuttings or blossoms for her here we are good night old man i gave you the address come out and see us when you have time the train moved forward one of the dotted brown ladies insisted on having windows raised now that the rain beat against them the porter came along with his mysterious wand and began to light the car i glanced downward and saw the best seller i picked it up and set it carefully farther along on the floor of the car where the rain drops would not fall upon it and then suddenly i smiled and seemed to see that life has no geographical metes and bounds good luck to you trevelyan i said and may you get the petunias for your princess rus in urbe considering men in relation to money there are three kinds whom i dislike men who have more money than they can spend men who have more money than they do spend and men who spend more money than they have of the three varieties i believe i have the least liking for the first but as a man i liked spencer grenville north pretty well although he had something like two or ten or thirty millions i ve forgotten exactly how many i did not leave town that summer i usually went down to a village on the south shore of long island the place was surrounded by duck farms and the ducks and dogs and whippoorwills and rusty windmills made so much noise that i could sleep as peacefully as if i were in my own flat six doors from the elevated railroad in new york but that summer i did not go remember that one of my friends asked me why i did not i replied because old man new york is the finest summer resort in the world you have heard that phrase before but that is what i told him i was press agent that year for binkly bing the theatrical managers and producers of course you know what a press agent is well he is not that is the secret of being one binkly was touring france in his new c n williamson car and bing had gone to scotland to learn curling which he seemed to associate in his mind with hot tongs rather than with ice before they left they gave me june and july on salary for my vacation which act was in accord with their large spirit of liberality but i remained in new york which i had decided was the finest summer resort in but i said that before on july the th north came to town from his camp in the adirondacks try to imagine a camp with sixteen rooms plumbing eiderdown quilts a butler a garage solid silver plate and a long distance telephone of course it was in the woods if mr pinchot wants to preserve the forests let him give every citizen two or ten or thirty million dollars and the trees will all gather around the summer camps as the birnam woods came to dunsinane and be preserved north came to see me in my three rooms and bath extra charge for light when used extravagantly or all night he slapped me on the back i would rather have my shins kicked any day and greeted me with out door obstreperousness and revolting good spirits he was insolently brown and healthy looking and offensively well dressed just ran down for a few days said he to sign some papers and stuff like that my lawyer wired me to come well you indolent cockney what are you doing in town i took a chance and telephoned and they said you were here what s the matter with that utopia on long island where you used to take your typewriter and your villanous temper every summer anything wrong with the er swans weren t they that used to sing on the farms at night ducks said i the songs of swans are for luckier ears they swim and curve their necks in artificial lakes on the estates of the wealthy to delight the eyes of the favorites of fortune also in central park said north to delight the eyes of immigrants and bummers i ve seen em there lots of times but why are you in the city so late in the summer new york city i began to recite is the finest sum no you don t said north emphatically you don t spring that old one on me i know you know better man you ought to have gone up with us this summer the prestons are there and tom volney and the monroes and lulu stanford and the miss kennedy and her aunt that you liked so well i never liked miss kennedy s aunt i said i didn t say you did said north we are having the greatest time we ve ever had the pickerel and trout are so ravenous that i believe they would swallow your hook with a montana copper mine prospectus fastened on it and we ve a couple of electric launches and i ll tell you what we do every night or two we tow a rowboat behind each one with a big phonograph and a boy to change the discs in em on the water and twenty yards behind you they are not so bad and there are passably good roads through the woods where we go motoring i shipped two cars up there and the pinecliff inn is only three miles away you know the pinecliff some good people are there this season and we run over to the dances twice a week can t you go back with me for a week old man i laughed northy said i if i may be so familiar with a millionaire because i hate both the names spencer and grenville your invitation is meant kindly but the city in the summer time for me here while the bourgeoisie is away i can live as nero lived barring thank heaven the fiddling while the city burns at ninety in the shade the tropics and the zones wait upon me like handmaidens i sit under florida palms and eat pomegranates while boreas himself electrically conjured up blows upon me his arctic breath as for trout you know yourself that jean at maurice s cooks them better than any one else in the world be advised said north my chef has pinched the blue ribbon from the lot he lays some slices of bacon inside the trout wraps it all in corn husks the husks of green corn you know buries them in hot ashes and covers them with live coals we build fires on the bank of the lake and have fish suppers i know said i and the servants bring down tables and chairs and damask cloths and you eat with silver forks i know the kind of camps that you millionaires have and therc are champagne pails set about disgracing the wild flowers and no doubt madame tetrazzini to sing in the boat pavilion after the trout oh no said north concernedly we were never as bad as that we did have a variety troupe up from the city three or four nights but they weren t stars by as far as light can travel in the same length of time i always like a few home comforts even when i m roughing it but don t tell me you prefer to stay in the city during summer i don t believe it if you do why did you spend your summers there for the last four years even sneaking away from town on a night train and refusing to tell your friends where this arcadian village was because said i they might have followed me and discovered it but since then i have learned that amaryllis has come to town the coolest things the freshest the brightest the choicest are to be found in the city if you ve nothing on hand this evening i will show you i m free said north and i have my light car outside i suppose since you ve been converted to the town that your idea of rural sport is to have a little whirl between bicycle cops in central park and then a mug of sticky ale in some stuffy rathskeller under a fan that can t stir up as many revolutions in a week as nicaragua can in a day we ll begin with the spin through the park anyhow i said i was choking with the hot stale air of my little apartment and i wanted that breath of the cool to brace me for the task of proving to my friend that new york was the greatest and so forth where can you find air any fresher or purer than this i asked as we sped into central s boskiest dell air said north contemptuously do you call this air this muggy vapor smelling of garbage and gasoline smoke man i wish you could get one sniff of the real adirondack article in the pine woods at daylight i have heard of it said i but for fragrance and tang and a joy in the nostrils i would not give one puff of sea breeze across the bay down on my little boat dock on long island for ten of your turpentine scented tornadoes then why asked north a little curiously don t you go there instead of staying cooped up in this greater bakery because said i doggedly i have discovered that new york is the greatest summer don t say that again interrupted north unless you ve actually got a job as general passenger agent of the subway you can t really believe it i went to some trouble to try to prove my theory to my friend the weather bureau and the season had conspired to make the argument worthy of an able advocate the city seemed stretched on a broiler directly above the furnaces of avernus there was a kind of tepid gayety afoot and awheel in the boulevards mainly evinced by languid men strolling about in straw hats and evening clothes and rows of idle taxicabs with their flags up looking like a blockaded fourth of july procession the hotels kept up a specious brilliancy and hospitable outlook but inside one saw vast empty caverns and the footrails at the bars gleamed brightly from long disacquaintance with the sole leather of customers in the cross town streets the steps of the old brownstone houses were swarming with stoopers that motley race hailing from sky light room and basement bringing out their straw doorstep mats to sit and fill the air with strange noises and opinions north and i dined on the top of a hotel and here for a few minutes i thought i had made a score an east wind almost cool blew across the roofless roof a capable orchestra concealed in a bower of wistaria played with sufficient judgment to make the art of music probable and the art of conversation possible some ladies in reproachless summer gowns at other tables gave animation and color to the scene and an excellent dinner mainly from the refrigerator seemed to successfully back my judgment as to summer resorts but north grumbled all during the meal and cursed his lawyers and prated so of his confounded camp in the woods that i began to wish he would go back there and leave me in my peaceful city retreat after dining we went to a roof garden vaudeville that was being much praised there we found a good bill an artificially cooled atmosphere cold drinks prompt service and a gay well dressed audience north was bored if this isn t comfortable enough for you on the hottest august night for five years i said a little sarcastically you might think about the kids down in delancey and hester streets lying out on the fire escapes with their tongues hanging out trying to get a breath of air that hasn t been fried on both sides the contrast might increase your enjoyment don t talk socialism said north i gave five hundred dollars to the free ice fund on the first of may i m contrasting these stale artificial hollow wearisome amusements with the enjoyment a man can get in the woods you should see the firs and pines do skirt dances during a storm and lie down flat and drink out of a mountain branch at the end of a day s tramp after the deer that s the only way to spend a summer get out and live with nature i agree with you absolutely said i with emphasis for one moment i had relaxed my vigilance and had spoken my true sentiments north looked at me long and curiously then why in the name of pan and apollo he asked have you been singing this deceitful paean to summer in town i suppose i looked my guilt ha said north i see may i ask her name annie ashton said i simply she played nannette in binkley bing s production of the silver cord she is to have a better part next season take me to see her said north miss ashton lived with her mother in a small hotel they were out of the west and had a little money that bridged the seasons as press agent of binkley bing i had tried to keep her before the public as robert james vandiver i had hoped to withdraw her for if ever one was made to keep company with said vandiver and smell the salt breeze on the south shore of long island and listen to the ducks quack in the watches of the night it was the ashton set forth above but she had a soul above ducks above nightingales aye even above birds of paradise she was very beautiful with quiet ways and seemed genuine she had both taste and talent for the stage and she liked to stay at home and read and make caps for her mother she was unvaryingly kind and friendly with binkley bing s press agent since the theatre had closed she had allowed mr vandiver to call in an unofficial role i had often spoken to her of my friend spencer grenville north and so as it was early the first turn of the vaudeville being not yet over we left to find a telephone miss ashton would be very glad to see mr vandiver and mr north we found her fitting a new cap on her mother i never saw her look more charming north made himself disagreeably entertaining he was a good talker and had a way with him besides he had two ten or thirty millions i ve for gotten which i incautiously admired the mother s cap whereupon she brought out her store of a dozen or two and i took a course in edgings and frills even though annie s fingers had pinked or ruched or hemmed or whatever you do to em they palled upon me and i could hear north drivelling to annie about his odious adirondack camp two days after that i saw north in his motor car with miss ashton and her mother on the next afternoon he dropped in on me bobby said he this old burg isn t such a bad proposition in the summer time after all since i ve keen knocking around it looks better to me there are some first rate musical comedies and light operas on the roofs and in the outdoor gardens and if you hunt up the right places and stick to soft drinks you can keep about as cool here as you can in the country hang it when you come to think of it there s nothing much to the country anyhow you get tired and sunburned and lonesome and you have to eat any old thing that the cook dishes up to you it makes a difference doesn t it said i it certainly does now i found some whitebait yesterday at maurice s with a new sauce that beats anything in the trout line i ever tasted it makes a difference doesn t it i said immense the sauce is the main thing with whitebait it makes a difference doesn t it i asked looking him straight in the eye he understood look here bob he said i was going to tell you i couldn t help it i ll play fair with you but i m going in to win she is the one particular for me all right said i it s a fair field there are no rights for you to encroach upon on thursday afternoon miss ashton invited north and myself to have tea in her apartment he was devoted and she was more charming than usual by avoiding the subject of caps i managed to get a word or two into and out of the talk miss ashton asked me in a make conversational tone something about the next season s tour oh said i i don t know about that i m not going to be with binkley bing next season why i thought said she that they were going to put the number one road company under your charge i thought you told me so they were said i but they won t i ll tell you what i m going to do i m going to the south shore of long island and buy a small cottage i know there on the edge of the bay and i ll buy a catboat and a rowboat and a shotgun and a yellow dog i ve got money enough to do it and i ll smell the salt wind all day when it blows from the sea and the pine odor when it blows from the land and of course i ll write plays until i have a trunk full of em on hand and the next thing and the biggest thing i ll do will be to buy that duck farm next door few people understand ducks i can watch em for hours they can march better than any company in the national guard and they can play follow my leader better than the entire democratic party their voices don t amount to much but i like to hear em they wake you up a dozen times a night but there s a homely sound about their quacking that is more musical to me than the cry of fresh strawber rees under your window in the morning when you want to sleep and i went on enthusiastically do you know the value of ducks besides their beauty and intelligence and order and sweetness of voice picking their feathers gives you an unfailing and never ceasing income on a farm that i know the feathers were sold for in one year think of that and the ones shipped to the market will bring in more money than that yes i am for the ducks and the salt breeze coming over the bay i think i shall get a chinaman cook and with him and the dog and the sunsets for company i shall do well no more of this dull baking senseless roaring city for me miss ashton looked surprised north laughed i am going to begin one of my plays tonight i said so i must be going and with that i took my departure a few days later miss ashton telephoned to me asking me to call at four in the afternoon i did you have been very good to me she said hesitatingly and i thought i would tell you i am going to leave the stage yes said i i suppose you will they usually do when there s so much money there is no money she said or very little our money is almost gone but i am told said i that he has something like two or ten or thirty millions i have forgotten which i know what you mean she said i will not pretend that i do not i am not going to marry mr north then why are you leaving the stage i asked severely what else can you do to earn a living she came closer to me and i can see the look in her eyes yet as she spoke i can pick ducks she said we sold the first year s feathers for a poor rule i have always maintained and asserted ime to time that woman is no mystery that man can foretell construe subdue comprehend and interpret her that she is a mystery has been foisted by herself upon credulous mankind whether i am right or wrong we shall see as harper s drawer used to say in bygone years the following good story is told of miss mr mr and mr we shall have to omit bishop x and the rev for they do not belong in those days paloma was a new town on the line of the southern pacific a reporter would have called it a mushroom town but it was not paloma was first and last of the toadstool variety the train stopped there at noon for the engine to drink and for the passengers both to drink and to dine there was a new yellow pine hotel also a wool warehouse and perhaps three dozen box residences the rest was composed of tents cow ponies black waxy mud and mesquite trees all bound round by a horizon paloma was an about to be city the houses represented faith the tents hope the twice a day train by which you might leave creditably sustained the role of charity the parisian restaurant occupied the muddiest spot in the town while it rained and the warmest when it shone it was operated owned and perpetrated by a citizen known as old man hinkle who had come out of indiana to make his fortune in this land of condensed milk and sorghum there was a four room unpainted weather boarded box house in which the family lived from the kitchen extended a shelter made of poles covered with chaparral brush under this was a table and two benches each twenty feet long the product of paloma home carpentry here was set forth the roast mutton the stewed apples boiled beans soda biscuits puddinorpie and hot coffee of the parisian menu ma hinkle and a subordinate known to the ears as betty but denied to the eyesight presided at the range pa hinkle himself with salamandrous thumbs served the scalding viands during rush hours a mexican youth who rolled and smoked cigarettes between courses aided him in waiting on the guests as is customary at parisian banquets i place the sweets at the end of my wordy menu ileen hinkle the spelling is correct for i have seen her write it no doubt she had been named by ear but she so splendidly bore the orthography that tom moore himself had he seen her would have indorsed the phonography ileen was the daughter of the house and the first lady cashier to invade the territory south of an east and west line drawn through galveston and del rio she sat on a high stool in a rough pine grand stand or was it a temple under the shelter at the door of the kitchen there was a barbed wire protection in front of her with a little arch under which you passed your money heaven knows why the barbed wire for every man who dined parisianly there would have died in her service her duties were light each meal was a dollar you put it under the arch and she took it i set out with the intent to describe ileen hinkle to you instead i must refer you to the volume by edmund burke entitled a philosophical inquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautiful it is an exhaustive treatise dealing first with the primitive conceptions of beauty roundness and smoothness i think they are according to burke it is well said rotundity is a patent charm as for smoothness the more new wrinkles a woman acquires the smoother she becomes ileen was a strictly vegetable compound guaranteed under the pure ambrosia and balm of gilead act of the year of the fall of adam she was a fruit stand blonde strawberries peaches cherries etc her eyes were wide apart and she possessed the calm that precedes a storm that never comes but it seems to me that words at any rate per are wasted in an effort to describe the beautiful like fancy it is engendered in the eyes there are three kinds of beauties i was foreordained to be homiletic i can never stick to a story the first is the freckle faced snub nosed girl whom you like the second is maud adams the third is or are the ladies in bouguereau s paintings ileen hinkle was the fourth she was the mayoress of spotless town there were a thousand golden apples coming to her as helen of the troy laundries the parisian restaurant was within a radius even from beyond its circumference men rode in to paloma to win her smiles they got them one meal one smile one dollar but with all her impartiality ileen seemed to favor three of her admirers above the rest according to the rules of politeness i will mention myself last the first was an artificial product known as bryan jacks a name that had obviously met with reverses jacks was the outcome of paved cities he was a small man made of some material resembling flexible sandstone his hair was the color of a brick quaker meeting house his eyes were twin cranberries his mouth was like the aperture under a drop letters here sign he knew every city from bangor to san francisco thence north to portland thence s e to a given point in florida he had mastered every art trade game business profession and sport in the world had been present at or hurrying on his way to every head line event that had ever occurred between oceans since he was five years old you might open the atlas place your finger at random upon the name of a town and jacks would tell you the front names of three prominent citizens before you could close it again he spoke patronizingly and even disrespectfully of broadway beacon hill michigan euclid and fifth avenues and the st louis four courts compared with him as a cosmopolite the wandering jew would have seemed a mere hermit he had learned everything the world could teach him and he would tell you about it i hate to be reminded of pollock s course of time and so do you but every time i saw jacks i would think of the poet s description of another poet by the name of g g byron who drank early deeply drank drank draughts that common millions might have quenched then died of thirst because there was no more to drink that fitted jacks except that instead of dying he came to paloma which was about the same thing he was a telegrapher and station and express agent at seventy five dollars a month why a young man who knew everything and could do everything was content to serve in such an obscure capacity i never could understand although he let out a hint once that it was as a personal favor to the president and stockholders of the s p ry co one more line of description and i turn jacks over to you he wore bright blue clothes yellow shoes and a bow tie made of the same cloth as his shirt my rival no was bud cunningham whose services had been engaged by a ranch near paloma to assist in compelling refractory cattle to keep within the bounds of decorum and order bud was the only cowboy off the stage that i ever saw who looked like one on it he wore the sombrero the chaps and the handkerchief tied at the back of his neck twice a week bud rode in from the val verde ranch to sup at the parisian restaurant he rode a many high handed kentucky horse at a tremendously fast lope which animal he would rein up so suddenly under the big mesquite at the corner of the brush shelter that his hoofs would plough canals yards long in the loam jacks and i were regular boarders at the restaurant of course the front room of the hinkle house was as neat a little parlor as there was in the black waxy country it was all willow rocking chairs and home knit tidies and albums and conch shells in a row and a little upright piano in one comer here jacks and bud and i or sometimes one or two of us according to our good luck used to sit of evenings when the tide of trade was over and visit miss hinkle ileen was a girl of ideas she was destined for higher things if there can be anything higher than taking in dollars all day through a barbed wire wicket she had read and listened and thought her looks would have formed a career for a less ambitious girl but rising superior to mere beauty she must establish something in the nature of a salon the only one in paloma don t you think that shakespeare was a great writer she would ask with such a pretty little knit of her arched brows that the late ignatius donnelly himself had he seen it could scarcely have saved his bacon ileen was of the opinion also that boston is more cultured than chicago that rosa bonheur was one of the greatest of women painters that westerners are more spontaneous and open hearted than easterners that london must be a very foggy city and that california must be quite lovely in the springtime and of many other opinions indicating a keeping up with the world s best thought these however were but gleaned from hearsay and evidence ileen had theories of her own one in particular she disseminated to us untiringly flattery she detested frankness and honesty of speech and action she declared were the chief mental ornaments of man and woman if ever she could like any one it would be for those qualities i m awfully weary she said one evening when we three musketeers of the mesquite were in the little parlor of having compliments on my looks paid to me i know i m not beautiful bud cunningham told me afterward that it was all he could do to keep from calling her a liar when she said that i m only a little middle western girl went on ileen who justs wants to be simple and neat and tries to help her father make a humble living old man hinkle was shipping a thousand silver dollars a month clear profit to a bank in san antonio bud twisted around in his chair and bent the rim of his hat from which he could never be persuaded to separate he did not know whether she wanted what she said she wanted or what she knew she deserved many a wiser man has hesitated at deciding bud decided why ah miss ileen beauty as you might say ain t everything not sayin that you haven t your share of good looks i always admired more than anything else about you the nice kind way you treat your ma and pa any one what s good to their parents and is a kind of home body don t specially need to be too pretty ileen gave him one of her sweetest smiles thank you mr cunningham she said i consider that one of the finest compliments i ve had in a long time i d so much rather hear you say that than to hear you talk about my eyes and hair i m glad you believe me when i say i don t like flattery our cue was there for us bud had made a good guess you couldn t lose jacks he chimed in next sure thing miss ileen he said the good lookers don t always win out now you ain t bad looking of course but that s nix cum rous i knew a girl once in dubuque with a face like a cocoanut who could skin the cat twice on a horizontal bar without changing hands now a girl might have the california peach crop mashed to a marmalade and not be able to do that i ve seen er worse lookers than you miss ileen but what i like about you is the business way you ve got of doing things cool and wise that s the winning way for a girl mr hinkle told me the other day you d never taken in a lead silver dollar or a plugged one since you ve been on the job now that s the stuff for a girl that s what catches me jacks got his smile too thank you mr jacks said ileen if you only knew how i appreciate any one s being candid and not a flatterer i get so tired of people telling me i m pretty i think it is the loveliest thing to have friends who tell you the truth then i thought i saw an expectant look on ileen s face as she glanced toward me i had a wild sudden impulse to dare fate and tell her of all the beautiful handiwork of the great artificer she was the most exquisite that she was a flawless pearl gleaming pure and serene in a setting of black mud and emerald prairies that she was a a corker and as for mine i cared not if she were as crtiel as a serpent s tooth to her fond parents or if she couldn t tell a plugged dollar from a bridle buckle if i might sing chant praise glorify and worship her peerless and wonderful beauty but i refrained i feared the fate of a flatterer i had witnessed her delight at the crafty and discreet words of bud and jacks no miss hinkle was not one to be beguiled by the plated silver tongue of a flatterer so i joined the ranks of the candid and honest at once i became mendacious and didactic in all ages miss hinkle said i in spite of the poetry and romance of each intellect in woman has been admired more than beauty even in cleopatra herself men found more charm in her queenly mind than in her looks well i should think so said ileen i ve seen pictures of her that weren t so much she had an awfully long nose if i may say so i went on you remind me of cleopatra miss ileen why my nose isn t so long said she opening her eyes wide and touching that comely feature with a dimpled forefinger why er i mean said i i mean as to mental endowments oh said she and then i got my smile just as bud and jacks had got theirs thank every one of you she said very very sweetly for being so frank and honest with me that s the way i want you to be always just tell me plainly and truthfully what you think and we ll all be the best friends in the world and now because you ve been so good to me and understand so well how i dislike people who do nothing but pay me exaggerated compliments i ll sing and play a little for you of course we expressed our thanks and joy but we would have been better pleased if ileen had remained in her low rocking chair face to face with us and let us gaze upon her for she was no adelina patti not even on the fare wellest of the diva s farewell tours she had a cooing little voice like that of a turtle dove that could almost fill the parlor when the windows and doors were closed and betty was not rattling the lids of the stove in the kitchen she had a gamut that i estimate at about eight inches on the piano and her runs and trills sounded like the clothes bubbling in your grandmother s iron wash pot believe that she must have been beautiful when i tell you that it sounded like music to us she must have been beautiful when i tell you that it sounded like music to us ileen s musical taste was catholic she would sing through a pile of sheet music on the left hand top of the piano laying each slaughtered composition on the right hand top the next evening she would sing from right to left her favorites were mendelssohn and moody and sankey by request she always wound up with sweet violets and when the leaves begin to turn when we left at ten o clock the three of us would go down to jacks little wooden station and sit on the platform swinging our feet and trying to pump one another for dews as to which way miss ileen s inclinations seemed to lean that is the way of rivals they do not avoid and glower at one another they convene and converse and construe striving by the art politic to estimate the strength of the enemy one day there came a dark horse to paloma a young lawyer who at once flaunted his shingle and himself spectacularly upon the town his name was c vincent vesey you could see at a glance that he was a recent graduate of a southwestern law school his prince albert coat light striped trousers broad brimmed soft black hat and narrow white muslin bow tie proclaimed that more loudly than any diploma could vesey was a compound of daniel webster lord chesterfield beau brummell and little jack horner his coming boomed paloma the next day after he arrived an addition to the town was surveyed and laid off in lots of course vesey to further his professional fortunes must mingle with the citizenry and outliers of paloma and as well as with the soldier men he was bound to seek popularity with the gay dogs of the place so jacks and bud cunningham and i came to be honored by his acquaintance the doctrine of predestination would have been discredited had not vesey seen ileen hinkle and become fourth in the tourney magnificently he boarded at the yellow pine hotel instead of at the parisian restaurant but he came to be a formidable visitor in the hinkle parlor his competition reduced bud to an inspired increase of profanity drove jacks to an outburst of slang so weird that it sounded more horrible than the most trenchant of bud s imprecations and made me dumb with gloom for vesey had the rhetoric words flowed from him like oil from a gusher hyperbole compliment praise appreciation honeyed gallantry golden opinions eulogy and unveiled panegyric vied with one another for pre eminence in his speech we had small hopes that ileen could resist his oratory and prince albert but a day came that gave us courage about dusk one evening i was sitting on the little gallery in front of the hinkle parlor waiting for ileen to come when i heard voices inside she had come into the room with her father and old man hinkle began to talk to her i had observed before that he was a shrewd man and not unphilosophic ily said he i notice there s three or four young fellers that have been callin to see you regular for quite a while is there any one of em you like better than another why pa she answered i like all of em very well i think mr cuninngham and mr jacks and mr harris are very nice young men they are so frank and honest in everything they say to me i haven t known mr vesey very long but i think he s a very nice young man he s so frank and honest in everything he says to me now that s what i m gittin at says old hinkle you ve always been sayin you like people what tell the truth and don t go humbuggin you with compliments and bogus talk now suppose you make a test of these fellers and see which one of em will talk the straightest to you but how ll i do it pa i ll tell you how you know you sing a little bit ily you took music lessons nearly two years in logansport it wasn t long but it was all we could afford then and your teacher said you didn t have any voice and it was a waste of money to keep on now suppose you ask the fellers what they think of your singin and see what each one of em tells you the man that ll tell you the truth about it ll have a mighty lot of nerve and ll do to tie to what do you think of the plan all right pa said ileen i think it s a good idea i ll try it ileen and mr hinkle went out of the room through the inside doors unobserved i hurried down to the station jacks was at his telegraph table waiting for eight o clock to come it was bud s night in town and when he rode in i repeated the conversation to them both i was loyal to my rivals as all true admirers of all ileens should be simultaneously the three of us were smitten by an uplifting thought surely this test would eliminate vesey from the contest he with his unctuous flattery would be driven from the lists well we remembered ileen s love of frankness and honesty how she treasured truth and candor above vain compliment and blandishment linking arms we did a grotesque dance of joy up and down the platform singing muldoon was a solid man at the top of our voices that evening four of the willow rocking chairs were filled besides the lucky one that sustained the trim figure of miss hinkle three of us awaited with suppressed excitement the application of the test it was tried on bud first mr cunningham said ileen with her dazzling smile after she had sung when the leaves begin to turn what do you really think of my voice frankly and honestly now as you know i want you to always be toward me bud squirmed in his chair at his chance to show the sincerity that he knew was required of him tell you the truth miss ileen he said earnestly you ain t got much more voice than a weasel just a little squeak you know of course we all like to hear you sing for it s kind of sweet and soothin after all and you look most as mighty well sittin on the piano stool as you do faced around but as for real singin i reckon you couldn t call it that i looked closely at ileen to see if bud had overdone his frankness but her pleased smile and sweetly spoken thanks assured me that we were on the right track and what do you think mr jacks she asked next take it from me said jacks you ain t in the prima donna class i ve heard em warble in every city in the united states and i tell you your vocal output don t go otherwise you ve got the grand opera bunch sent to the soap factory in looks i mean for the high screechers generally look like mary ann on her thursday out but nix for the gargle work your epiglottis ain t a real side stepper its footwork ain t good with a merry laugh at jacks criticism ileen looked inquiringly at me i admit that i faltered a little was there not such a thing as being too frank perhaps i even hedged a little in my verdict but i stayed with the critics i am not skilled in scientific music miss ileen i said but frankly i cannot praise very highly the singing voice that nature has given you it has long been a favorite comparison that a great singer sings like a bird well there are birds and birds i would say that your voice reminds me of the thrush s throaty and not strong nor of much compass or variety but still er sweet in er its way and er thank you mr harris interrupted miss hinkle i knew i could depend upon your frankness and honesty and then c vincent vesey drew back one sleeve from his snowy cuff and the water came down at lodore my memory cannot do justice to his masterly tribute to that priceless god given treasure miss hinkle s voice he raved over it in terms that if they had been addressed to the morning stars when they sang together would have made that stellar choir explode in a meteoric shower of flaming self satisfaction he marshalled on his white finger tips the grand opera stars of all the continents from jenny lind to emma abbott only to depreciate their endowments he spoke of larynxes of chest notes of phrasing arpeggios and other strange paraphernalia of the throaty art he admitted as though driven to a corner that jenny lind had a note or two in the high register that miss hinkle had not yet acquired but that was a mere matter of practice and training and as a peroration he predicted solemnly predicted a career in vocal art for the coming star of the southwest and one of which grand old texas may well be proud hitherto unsurpassed in the annals of musical history when we left at ten ileen gave each of us her usual warm cordial handshake entrancing smile and invitation to call again i could not see that one was favored above or below another but three of us knew we knew we knew that frankness and honesty had won and that the rivals now numbered three instead of four down at the station jacks brought out a pint bottle of the proper stuff and we celebrated the downfall of a blatant interloper four days went by without anything happening worthy of recount on the fifth jacks and i entering the brush arbor for our supper saw the mexican youth instead of a divinity in a spotless waist and a navy blue skirt taking in the dollars through the barbed wire wicket we rushed into the kitchen meeting pa hinkle coming out with two cups of hot coffee in his hands where s ileen we asked in recitative pa hinkle was a kindly man well gents said he it was a sudden notion she took but i ve got the money and i let her have her way she s gone to a corn a conservatory in boston for four years for to have her voice cultivated now excuse me to pass gents for this coffee s hot and my thumbs is tender that night there were four instead of three of us sitting on the station platform and swinging our feet c vincent vesey was one of us we discussed things while dogs barked at the moon that rose as big as a five cent piece or a flour barrel over the chaparral and what we discussed was whether it is better to lie to a woman or to tell her the truth and as all of us were young then we did not come to a decision roads of destiny roads of destiny i go to seek on many roads what is to be true heart and strong with love to light will they not bear me in the fight to order shun or wield or mould my destiny unpublished poems of david mignot the song was over the words were david s the air one of the countryside the company about the inn table applauded heartily for the young poet paid for the wine only the notary m papineau shook his head a little at the lines for he was a man of books and he had not drunk with the rest david went out into the village street where the night air drove the wine vapour from his head and then he remembered that he and yvonne had quarrelled that day and that he had resolved to leave his home that night to seek fame and honour in the great world outside when my poems are on every man s tongue he told himself in a fine exhilaration she will perhaps think of the hard words she spoke this day except the roisterers in the tavern the village folk were abed david crept softly into his room in the shed of his father s cottage and made a bundle of his small store of clothing with this upon a staff he set his face outward upon the road that ran from vernoy he passed his father s herd of sheep huddled in their nightly pen the sheep he herded daily leaving them to scatter while he wrote verses on scraps of paper he saw a light yet shining in yvonne s window and a weakness shook his purpose of a sudden perhaps that light meant that she rued sleepless her anger and that morning might but no his decision was made vernoy was no place for him not one soul there could share his thoughts out along that road lay his fate and his future three leagues across the dim moonlit champaign ran the road straight as a ploughman s furrow it was believed in the village that the road ran to paris at least and this name the poet whispered often to himself as he walked never so far from vernoy had david travelled before the left branch three leagues then the road ran and turned into a puzzle it joined with another and a larger road at right angles david stood uncertain for a while and then took the road to the left upon this more important highway were imprinted in the dust wheel tracks left by the recent passage of some vehicle some half an hour later these traces were verified by the sight of a ponderous carriage mired in a little brook at the bottom of a steep hill the driver and postilions were shouting and tugging at the horses bridles on the road at one side stood a huge black clothed man and a slender lady wrapped in a long light cloak david saw the lack of skill in the efforts of the servants he quietly assumed control of the work he directed the outriders to cease their clamour at the horses and to exercise their strength upon the wheels the driver alone urged the animals with his familiar voice david himself heaved a powerful shoulder at the rear of the carriage and with one harmonious tug the great vehicle rolled up on solid ground the outriders climbed to their places david stood for a moment upon one foot the huge gentleman waved a hand you will enter the carriage he said in a voice large like himself but smoothed by art and habit obedience belonged in the path of such a voice brief as was the young poet s hesitation it was cut shorter still by a renewal of the command david s foot went to the step in the darkness he perceived dimly the form of the lady upon the rear seat he was about to seat himself opposite when the voice again swayed him to its will you will sit at the lady s side the gentleman swung his great weight to the forward seat the carriage proceeded up the hill the lady was shrunk silent into her corner david could not estimate whether she was old or young but a delicate mild perfume from her clothes stirred his poet s fancy to the belief that there was loveliness beneath the mystery here was an adventure such as he had often imagined but as yet he held no key to it for no word was spoken while he sat with his impenetrable companions in an hour s time david perceived through the window that the vehicle traversed the street of some town then it stopped in front of a closed and darkened house and a postilion alighted to hammer impatiently upon the door a latticed window above flew wide and a nightcapped head popped out who are ye that disturb honest folk at this time of night my house is closed tis too late for profitable travellers to be abroad cease knocking at my door and be off open spluttered the postilion loudly open for monsiegneur the marquis de beaupertuys ah cried the voice above ten thousand pardons my lord i did not know the hour is so late at once shall the door be opened and the house placed at my lord s disposal inside was heard the clink of chain and bar and the door was flung open shivering with chill and apprehension the landlord of the silver flagon stood half clad candle in hand upon the threshold david followed the marquis out of the carriage assist the lady he was ordered the poet obeyed he felt her small hand tremble as he guided her descent into the house was the next command the room was the long dining hall of the tavern a great oak table ran down its length the huge gentleman seated himself in a chair at the nearer end the lady sank into another against the wall with an air of great weariness david stood considering how best he might now take his leave and continue upon his way my lord said the landlord bowing to the floor h had i ex expected this honour entertainment would have been ready t t there is wine and cold fowl and m m maybe candles said the marquis spreading the fingers of one plump white hand in a gesture he had y yes my lord he fetched half a dozen candles lighted them and set them upon the table if monsieur would perhaps deign to taste a certain burgundy there is a cask candles said monsieur spreading his fingers assuredly quickly i fly my lord a dozen more lighted candles shone in the hall the great bulk of the marquis overflowed his chair he was dressed in fine black from head to foot save for the snowy ruffles at his wrist and throat even the hilt and scabbard of his sword were black his expression was one of sneering pride the ends of an upturned moustache reached nearly to his mocking eyes the lady sat motionless and now david perceived that she was young and possessed of pathetic and appealing beauty he was startled from the contemplation of her forlorn loveliness by the booming voice of the marquis what is your name and pursuit david mignot i am a poet the moustache of the marquis curled nearer to his eyes how do you live i am also a shepherd i guarded my father s flock david answered with his head high but a flush upon his cheek then listen master shepherd and poet to the fortune you have blundered upon to night this lady is my niece mademoiselle lucie de varennes she is of noble descent and is possessed of ten thousand francs a year in her own right as to her charms you have but to observe for yourself if the inventory pleases your shepherd s heart she becomes your wife at a word do not interrupt me to night i conveyed her to the chateau of the comte de villemaur to whom her hand had been promised guests were present the priest was waiting her marriage to one eligible in rank and fortune was ready to be accomplished at the alter this demoiselle so meek and dutiful turned upon me like a leopardess charged me with cruelty and crimes and broke before the gaping priest the troth i had plighted for her i swore there and then by ten thousand devils that she should marry the first man we met after leaving the chateau be he prince charcoal burner or thief you shepherd are the first mademoiselle must be wed this night if not you then another you have ten minutes in which to make your decision do not vex me with words or questions ten minutes shepherd and they are speeding the marquis drummed loudly with his white fingers upon the table he sank into a veiled attitude of waiting it was as if some great house had shut its doors and windows against approach david would have spoken but the huge man s bearing stopped his tongue instead he stood by the lady s chair and bowed mademoiselle he said and he marvelled to find his words flowing easily before so much elegance and beauty you have heard me say i was a shepherd i have also had the fancy at times that i am a poet if it be the test of a poet to adore and cherish the beautiful that fancy is now strengthened can i serve you in any way mademoiselle the young woman looked up at him with eyes dry and mournful his frank glowing face made serious by the gravity of the adventure his strong straight figure and the liquid sympathy in his blue eyes perhaps also her imminent need of long denied help and kindness thawed her to sudden tears monsieur she said in low tones you look to be true and kind he is my uncle the brother of my father and my only relative he loved my mother and he hates me because i am like her he has made my life one long terror i am afraid of his very looks and never before dared to disobey him but to night he would have married me to a man three times my age you will forgive me for bringing this vexation upon you monsieur you will of course decline this mad act he tries to force upon you but let me thank you for your generous words at least i have had none spoken to me in so long there was now something more than generosity in the poet s eyes poet he must have been for yvonne was forgotten this fine new loveliness held him with its freshness and grace the subtle perfume from her filled him with strange emotions his tender look fell warmly upon her she leaned to it thirstily ten minutes said david is given me in which to do what i would devote years to achieve i will not say i pity you mademoiselle it would not be true i love you i cannot ask love from you yet but let me rescue you from this cruel man and in time love may come i think i have a future i will not always be a shepherd for the present i will cherish you with all my heart and make your life less sad will you trust your fate to me mademoiselle ah you would sacrifice yourself from pity from love the time is almost up mademoiselle you will regret it and despise me i will live only to make you happy and myself worthy of you her fine small hand crept into his from beneath her cloak i will trust you she breathed with my life and and love may not be so far off as you think tell him once away from the power of his eyes i may forget david went and stood before the marquis the black figure stirred and the mocking eyes glanced at the great hall clock two minutes to spare a shepherd requires eight minutes to decide whether he will accept a bride of beauty and income speak up shepherd do you consent to become mademoiselle s husband mademoiselle said david standing proudly has done me the honour to yield to my request that she become my wife well said said the marquis you have yet the making of a courtier in you master shepherd mademoiselle could have drawn a worse prize after all and now to be done with the affair as quick as the church and the devil will allow he struck the table soundly with his sword hilt the landlord came knee shaking bringing more candles in the hope of anticipating the great lord s whims fetch a priest said the marquis a priest do you understand in ten minutes have a priest here or the landlord dropped his candles and flew the priest came heavy eyed and ruffled he made david mignot and lucie de verennes man and wife pocketed a gold piece that the marquis tossed him and shuffled out again into the night wine ordered the marquis spreading his ominous fingers at the host fill glasses he said when it was brought he stood up at the head of the table in the candlelight a black mountain of venom and conceit with something like the memory of an old love turned to poison in his eyes as it fell upon his niece monsieur mignot he said raising his wineglass drink after i say this to you you have taken to be your wife one who will make your life a foul and wretched thing the blood in her is an inheritance running black lies and red ruin she will bring you shame and anxiety the devil that descended to her is there in her eyes and skin and mouth that stoop even to beguile a peasant there is your promise monsieur poet for a happy life drink your wine at last mademoiselle i am rid of you the marquis drank a little grievous cry as if from a sudden wound came from the girl s lips david with his glass in his hand stepped forward three paces and faced the marquis there was little of a shepherd in his bearing just now he said calmly you did me the honor to call me monsieur may i hope therefore that my marriage to mademoiselle has placed me somewhat nearer to you in let us say reflected rank has given me the right to stand more as an equal to monseigneur in a certain little piece of business i have in my mind you may hope shepherd sneered the marquis then said david dashing his glass of wine into the contemptuous eyes that mocked him perhaps you will condescend to fight me the fury of the great lord outbroke in one sudden curse like a blast from a horn he tore his sword from its black sheath he called to the hovering landlord a sword there for this lout he turned to the lady with a laugh that chilled her heart and said you put much labour upon me madame it seems i must find you a husband and make you a widow in the same night i know not sword play said david he flushed to make the confession before his lady i know not sword play mimicked the marquis shall we fight like peasants with oaken cudgels hola francois my pistols a postilion brought two shining great pistols ornamented with carven silver from the carriage holsters the marquis tossed one upon the table near david s hand to the other end of the table he cried even a shepherd may pull a trigger few of them attain the honour to die by the weapon of a de beaupertuys the shepherd and the marquis faced each other from the ends of the long table the landlord in an ague of terror clutched the air and stammered m m monseigneur for the love of christ not in my house do not spill blood it will ruin my custom the look of the marquis threatening him paralyzed his tongue coward cried the lord of beaupertuys cease chattering your teeth long enough to give the word for us if you can mine host s knees smote the floor he was without a vocabulary even sounds were beyond him still by gestures he seemed to beseech peace in the name of his house and custom i will give the word said the lady in a clear voice she went up to david and kissed him sweetly her eyes were sparkling bright and colour had come to her cheek she stood against the wall and the two men levelled their pistols for her count un deux trois the two reports came so nearly together that the candles flickered but once the marquis stood smiling the fingers of his left hand resting outspread upon the end of the table david remained erect and turned his head very slowly searching for his wife with his eyes then as a garment falls from where it is hung he sank crumpled upon the floor with a little cry of terror and despair the widowed maid ran and stooped above him she found his wound and then looked up with her old look of pale melancholy through his heart she whispered oh his heart come boomed the great voice of the marquis out with you to the carriage daybreak shall not find you on my hands wed you shall be again and to a living husband this night the next we come upon my lady highwayman or peasant if the road yields no other then the churl that opens my gates out with you into the carriage the marquis implacable and huge the lady wrapped again in the mystery of her cloak the postilion bearing the weapons all moved out to the waiting carriage the sound of its ponderous wheels rolling away echoed through the slumbering village in the hall of the silver flagon the distracted landlord wrung his hands above the slain poet s body while the flames of the four and twenty candles danced and flickered on the table the right branch three leagues then the road ran and turned into a puzzle it joined with another and a larger road at right angles david stood uncertain for a while and then took the road to the right whither it led he knew not but he was resolved to leave vernoy far behind that night he travelled a league and then passed a large chateau which showed testimony of recent entertainment lights shone from every window from the great stone gateway ran a tracery of wheel tracks drawn in the dust by the vehicles of the guests three leagues farther and david was weary he rested and slept for a while on a bed of pine boughs at the roadside then up and on again along the unknown way thus for five days he travelled the great road sleeping upon nature s balsamic beds or in peasants ricks eating of their black hospitable bread drinking from streams or the willing cup of the goatherd at length he crossed a great bridge and set his foot within the smiling city that has crushed or crowned more poets than all the rest of the world his breath came quickly as paris sang to him in a little undertone her vital chant of greeting the hum of voice and foot and wheel high up under the eaves of an old house in the rue conti david paid for lodging and set himself in a wooden chair to his poems the street once sheltering citizens of import and consequence was now given over to those who ever follow in the wake of decline the houses were tall and still possessed of a ruined dignity but many of them were empty save for dust and the spider by night there was the clash of steel and the cries of brawlers straying restlessly from inn to inn where once gentility abode was now but a rancid and rude incontinence but here david found housing commensurate to his scant purse daylight and candlelight found him at pen and paper one afternoon he was returning from a foraging trip to the lower world with bread and curds and a bottle of thin wine halfway up his dark stairway he met or rather came upon for she rested on the stair a young woman of a beauty that should balk even the justice of a poet s imagination a loose dark cloak flung open showed a rich gown beneath her eyes changed swiftly with every little shade of thought within one moment they would be round and artless like a child s and long and cozening like a gypsy s one hand raised her gown undraping a little shoe high heeled with its ribbons dangling untied so heavenly she was so unfitted to stoop so qualified to charm and command perhaps she had seen david coming and had waited for his help there ah would monsieur pardon that she occupied the stairway but the shoe the naughty shoe alas it would not remain tied ah if monsieur would be so gracious the poet s fingers trembled as he tied the contrary ribbons then he would have fled from the danger of her presence but the eyes grew long and cozening like a gypsy s and held him he leaned against the balustrade clutching his bottle of sour wine you have been so good she said smiling does monsieur perhaps live in the house yes madame i i think so madame perhaps in the third story then no madame higher up the lady fluttered her fingers with the least possible gesture of impatience pardon certainly i am not discreet in asking monsieur will forgive me it is surely not becoming that i should inquire where he lodges madame do not say so i live in the no no no do not tell me now i see that i erred but i cannot lose the interest i feel in this house and all that is in it once it was my home often i come here but to dream of those happy days again will you let that be my excuse let me tell you then for you need no excuse stammered the poet i live in the top floor the small room where the stairs turn in the front room asked the lady turning her head sidewise the rear madame the lady sighed as if with relief i will detain you no longer then monsieur she said employing the round and artless eye take good care of my house alas only the memories of it are mine now adieu and accept my thanks for your courtesy she was gone leaving but a smile and a trace of sweet perfume david climbed the stairs as one in slumber but he awoke from it and the smile and the perfume lingered with him and never afterward did either seem quite to leave him this lady of whom he knew nothing drove him to lyrics of eyes chansons of swiftly conceived love odes to curling hair and sonnets to slippers on slender feet poet he must have been for yvonne was forgotten this fine new loveliness held him with its freshness and grace the subtle perfume about her filled him with strange emotions on a certain night three persons were gathered about a table in a room on the third floor of the same house three chairs and the table and a lighted candle upon it was all the furniture one of the persons was a huge man dressed in black his expression was one of sneering pride the ends of his upturned moustache reached nearly to his mocking eyes another was a lady young and beautiful with eyes that could be round and artless as a child s or long and cozening like a gypsy s but were now keen and ambitious like any other conspirator s the third was a man of action a combatant a bold and impatient executive breathing fire and steel he was addressed by the others as captain desrolles this man struck the table with his fist and said with controlled violence to night to night as he goes to midnight mass i am tired of the plotting that gets nowhere i am sick of signals and ciphers and secret meetings and such baragouin let us be honest traitors if france is to be rid of him let us kill in the open and not hunt with snares and traps to night i say i back my words my hand will do the deed to night as he goes to mass the lady turned upon him a cordial look woman however wedded to plots must ever thus bow to rash courage the big man stroked his upturned moustache dear captain he said in a great voice softened by habit this time i agree with you nothing is to be gained by waiting enough of the palace guards belong to us to make the endeavour a safe one to night repeated captain desrolles again striking the table you have heard me marquis my hand will do the deed but now said the huge man softly comes a question word must be sent to our partisans in the palace and a signal agreed upon our stanchest men must accompany the royal carriage at this hour what messenger can penetrate so far as the south doorway ribouet is stationed there once a message is placed in his hands all will go well i will send the message said the lady you countess said the marquis raising his eyebrows your devotion is great we know but listen exclaimed the lady rising and resting her hands upon the table in a garret of this house lives a youth from the provinces as guileless and tender as the lambs he tended there i have met him twice or thrice upon the stairs i questioned him fearing that he might dwell too near the room in which we are accustomed to meet he is mine if i will he writes poems in his garret and i think he dreams of me he will do what i say he shall take the message to the palace the marquis rose from his chair and bowed you did not permit me to finish my sentence countess he said i would have said your devotion is great but your wit and charm are infinitely greater while the conspirators were thus engaged david was polishing some lines addressed to his amorette d escalier he heard a timorous knock at his door and opened it with a great throb to behold her there panting as one in straits with eyes wide open and artless like a child s monsieur she breathed i come to you in distress i believe you to be good and true and i know of no other help how i flew through the streets among the swaggering men monsieur my mother is dying my uncle is a captain of guards in the palace of the king some one must fly to bring him may i hope mademoiselle interrupted davis his eyes shining with the desire to do her service your hopes shall be my wings tell me how i may reach him the lady thrust a sealed paper into his hand go to the south gate the south gate mind and say to the guards there the falcon has left his nest they will pass you and you will go to the south entrance to the palace repeat the words and give this letter to the man who will reply let him strike when he will this is the password monsieur entrusted to me by my uncle for now when the country is disturbed and men plot against the king s life no one without it can gain entrance to the palace grounds after nightfall if you will monsieur take him this letter so that my mother may see him before she closes her eyes give it me said david eagerly but shall i let you return home through the streets alone so late i no no fly each moment is like a precious jewel some time said the lady with eyes long and cozening like a gypsy s i will try to thank you for your goodness the poet thrust the letter into his breast and bounded down the stairway the lady when he was gone returned to the room below the eloquent eyebrows of the marquis interrogated her he is gone she said as fleet and stupid as one of his own sheep to deliver it the table shook again from the batter of captain desrolles s fist sacred name he cried i have left my pistols behind i can trust no others take this said the marquis drawing from beneath his cloak a shining great weapon ornamented with carven silver there are none truer but guard it closely for it bears my arms and crest and already i am suspected me i must put many leagues between myself and paris this night to morrow must find me in my chateau after you dear countess the marquis puffed out the candle the lady well cloaked and the two gentlemen softly descended the stairway and flowed into the crowd that roamed along the narrow pavements of the rue conti david sped at the south gate of the king s residence a halberd was laid to his breast but he turned its point with the words the falcon has left his nest pass brother said the guard and go quickly on the south steps of the palace they moved to seize him but again the mot de passe charmed the watchers one among them stepped forward and began let him strike but a flurry among the guards told of a surprise a man of keen look and soldierly stride suddenly pressed through them and seized the letter which david held in his hand come with me he said and led him inside the great hall then he tore open the letter and read it he beckoned to a man uniformed as an officer of musketeers who was passing captain tetreau you will have the guards at the south entrance and the south gate arrested and confined place men known to be loyal in their places to david he said come with me he conducted him through a corridor and an anteroom into a spacious chamber where a melancholy man sombrely dressed sat brooding in a great leather covered chair to that man he said sire i have told you that the palace is as full of traitors and spies as a sewer is of rats you have thought sire that it was my fancy this man penetrated to your very door by their connivance he bore a letter which i have intercepted i have brought him here that your majesty may no longer think my zeal excessive i will question him said the king stirring in his chair he looked at david with heavy eyes dulled by an opaque film the poet bent his knee from where do you come asked the king from the village of vernoy in the province of eure et loir sire what do you follow in paris i i would be a poet sire what did you in vernoy i minded my father s flock of sheep the king stirred again and the film lifted from his eyes ah in the fields yes sire you lived in the fields you went out in the cool of the morning and lay among the hedges in the grass the flock distributed itself upon the hillside you drank of the living stream you ate your sweet brown bread in the shade and you listened doubtless to blackbirds piping in the grove is not that so shepherd it is sire answered david with a sigh and to the bees at the flowers and maybe to the grape gatherers singing on the hill yes yes said the king impatiently maybe to them but surely to the blackbirds they whistled often in the grove did they not nowhere sire so sweetly as in eure et loir i have endeavored to express their song in some verses that i have written can you repeat those verses asked the king eagerly a long time ago i listened to the blackbirds it would be something better than a kingdom if one could rightly construe their song and at night you drove the sheep to the fold and then sat in peace and tranquillity to your pleasant bread can you repeat those verses shepherd they run this way sire said david with respectful ardour lazy shepherd see your lambkins skip ecstatic on the mead see the firs dance in the breezes hear pan blowing at his reed hear us calling from the tree tops see us swoop upon your flock yield us wool to make our nests warm in the branches of the if it please your majesty interrupted a harsh voice i will ask a question or two of this rhymester there is little time to spare i crave pardon sire if my anxiety for your safety offends the loyalty said the king of the duke d aumale is too well proven to give offence he sank into his chair and the film came again over his eyes first said the duke i will read you the letter he brought to night is the anniversary of the dauphin s death if he goes as is his custom to midnight mass to pray for the soul of his son the falcon will strike at the corner of the rue esplanade if this be his intention set a red light in the upper room at the southwest corner of the palace that the falcon may take heed peasant said the duke sternly you have heard these words who gave you this message to bring my lord duke said david sincerely i will tell you a lady gave it me she said her mother was ill and that this writing would fetch her uncle to her bedside i do not know the meaning of the letter but i will swear that she is beautiful and good describe the woman commanded the duke and how you came to be her dupe describe her said david with a tender smile you would command words to perform miracles well she is made of sunshine and deep shade she is slender like the alders and moves with their grace her eyes change while you gaze into them now round and then half shut as the sun peeps between two clouds when she comes heaven is all about her when she leaves there is chaos and a scent of hawthorn blossoms she came to see me in the rue conti number twenty nine it is the house said the duke turning to the king that we have been watching thanks to the poet s tongue we have a picture of the infamous countess quebedaux sire and my lord duke said david earnestly i hope my poor words have done no injustice i have looked into that lady s eyes i will stake my life that she is an angel letter or no letter the duke looked at him steadily i will put you to the proof he said slowly dressed as the king you shall yourself attend mass in his carriage at midnight do you accept the test david smiled i have looked into her eyes he said i had my proof there take yours how you will half an hour before twelve the duke d aumale with his own hands set a red lamp in a southwest window of the palace at ten minutes to the hour david leaning on his arm dressed as the king from top to toe with his head bowed in his cloak walked slowly from the royal apartments to the waiting carriage the duke assisted him inside and closed the door the carriage whirled away along its route to the cathedral on the qui vive in a house at the corner of the rue esplanade was captain tetreau with twenty men ready to pounce upon the conspirators when they should appear but it seemed that for some reason the plotters had slightly altered their plans when the royal carriage had reached the rue christopher one square nearer than the rue esplanade forth from it burst captain desrolles with his band of would be regicides and assailed the equipage the guards upon the carriage though surprised at the premature attack descended and fought valiantly the noise of conflict attracted the force of captain tetreau and they came pelting down the street to the rescue but in the meantime the desperate desrolles had torn open the door of the king s carriage thrust his weapon against the body of the dark figure inside and fired now with loyal reinforcements at hand the street rang with cries and the rasp of steel but the frightened horses had dashed away upon the cushions lay the dead body of the poor mock king and poet slain by a ball from the pistol of monseigneur the marquis de beaupertuys the main road three leagues then the road ran and turned into a puzzle it joined with another and a larger road at right angles david stood uncertain for a while and then sat himself to rest upon its side whither these roads led he knew not either way there seemed to lie a great world full of chance and peril and then sitting there his eye fell upon a bright star one that he and yvonne had named for theirs that set him thinking of yvonne and he wondered if he had not been too hasty why should he leave her and his home because a few hot words had come between them was love so brittle a thing that jealousy the very proof of it could break it mornings always brought a cure for the little heartaches of evening there was yet time for him to return home without any one in the sweetly sleeping village of vernoy being the wiser his heart was yvonne s there where he had lived always he could write his poems and find his happiness david rose and shook off his unrest and the wild mood that had tempted him he set his face steadfastly back along the road he had come by the time he had retravelled the road to vernoy his desire to rove was gone he passed the sheepfold and the sheep scurried with a drumming flutter at his late footsteps warming his heart by the homely sound he crept without noise into his little room and lay there thankful that his feet had escaped the distress of new roads that night how well he knew woman s heart the next evening yvonne was at the well in the road where the young congregated in order that the cure might have business the corner of her eye was engaged in a search for david albeit her set mouth seemed unrelenting he saw the look braved the mouth drew from it a recantation and later a kiss as they walked homeward together three months afterwards they were married david s father was shrewd and prosperous he gave them a wedding that was heard of three leagues away both the young people were favourites in the village there was a procession in the streets a dance on the green they had the marionettes and a tumbler out from dreux to delight the guests then a year and david s father died the sheep and the cottage descended to him he already had the seemliest wife in the village yvonne s milk pails and her brass kettles were bright ouf they blinded you in the sun when you passed that way but you must keep your eyes upon her yard for her flower beds were so neat and gay they restored to you your sight and you might hear her sing aye as far as the double chestnut tree above pere gruneau s blacksmith forge but a day came when david drew out paper from a long shut drawer and began to bite the end of a pencil spring had come again and touched his heart poet he must have been for now yvonne was well nigh forgotten this fine new loveliness of earth held him with its witchery and grace the perfume from her woods and meadows stirred him strangely daily had he gone forth with his flock and brought it safe at night but now he stretched himself under the hedge and pieced words together on his bits of paper the sheep strayed and the wolves perceiving that difficult poems make easy mutton ventured from the woods and stole his lambs david s stock of poems grew longer and his flock smaller yvonne s nose and temper waxed sharp and her talk blunt her pans and kettles grew dull but her eyes had caught their flash she pointed out to the poet that his neglect was reducing the flock and bringing woe upon the household david hired a boy to guard the sheep locked himself in the little room at the top of the cottage and wrote more poems the boy being a poet by nature but not furnished with an outlet in the way of writing spent his time in slumber the wolves lost no time in discovering that poetry and sleep are practically the same so the flock steadily grew smaller yvonne s ill temper increased at an equal rate sometimes she would stand in the yard and rail at david through his high window then you could hear her as far as the double chestnut tree above pere gruneau s blacksmith forge m papineau the kind wise meddling old notary saw this as he saw everything at which his nose pointed he went to david fortified himself with a great pinch of snuff and said friend mignot i affixed the seal upon the marriage certificate of your father it would distress me to be obliged to attest a paper signifying the bankruptcy of his son but that is what you are coming to i speak as an old friend now listen to what i have to say you have your heart set i perceive upon poetry at dreux i have a friend one monsieur bril georges bril he lives in a little cleared space in a houseful of books he is a learned man he visits paris each year he himself has written books he will tell you when the catacombs were made how they found out the names of the stars and why the plover has a long bill the meaning and the form of poetry is to him as intelligent as the baa of a sheep is to you i will give you a letter to him and you shall take him your poems and let him read them then you will know if you shall write more or give your attention to your wife and business write the letter said david i am sorry you did not speak of this sooner at sunrise the next morning he was on the road to dreux with the precious roll of poems under his arm at noon he wiped the dust from his feet at the door of monsieur bril that learned man broke the seal of m papineau s letter and sucked up its contents through his gleaming spectacles as the sun draws water he took david inside to his study and sat him down upon a little island beat upon by a sea of books monsieur bril had a conscience he flinched not even at a mass of manuscript the thickness of a finger length and rolled to an incorrigible curve he broke the back of the roll against his knee and began to read he slighted nothing he bored into the lump as a worm into a nut seeking for a kernel meanwhile david sat marooned trembling in the spray of so much literature it roared in his ears he held no chart or compass for voyaging in that sea half the world he thought must be writing books monsieur bril bored to the last page of the poems then he took off his spectacles and wiped them with his handkerchief my old friend papineau is well he asked in the best of health said david how many sheep have you monsieur mignot three hundred and nine when i counted them yesterday the flock has had ill fortune to that number it has decreased from eight hundred and fifty you have a wife and home and lived in comfort the sheep brought you plenty you went into the fields with them and lived in the keen air and ate the sweet bread of contentment you had but to be vigilant and recline there upon nature s breast listening to the whistle of the blackbirds in the grove am i right thus far it was so said david i have read all your verses continued monsieur bril his eyes wandering about his sea of books as if he conned the horizon for a sail look yonder through that window monsieur mignot tell me what you see in that tree i see a crow said david looking there is a bird said monsieur bril that shall assist me where i am disposed to shirk a duty you know that bird monsieur mignot he is the philosopher of the air he is happy through submission to his lot none so merry or full crawed as he with his whimsical eye and rollicking step the fields yield him what he desires he never grieves that his plumage is not gay like the oriole s and you have heard monsieur mignot the notes that nature has given him is the nightingale any happier do you think david rose to his feet the crow cawed harshly from his tree i thank you monsieur bril he said slowly there was not then one nightingale among all those croaks i could not have missed it said monsieur bril with a sigh i read every word live your poetry man do not try to write it any more i thank you said david again and now i will be going back to my sheep if you would dine with me said the man of books and overlook the smart of it i will give you reasons at length no said the poet i must be back in the fields cawing at my sheep back along the road to vernoy he trudged with his poems under his arm when he reached his village he turned into the shop of one zeigler a jew out of armenia who sold anything that came to his hand friend said david wolves from the forest harass my sheep on the hills i must purchase firearms to protect them what have you a bad day this for me friend mignot said zeigler spreading his hands for i perceive that i must sell you a weapon that will not fetch a tenth of its value only last i week i bought from a peddlar a wagon full of goods that he procured at a sale by a commissionaire of the crown the sale was of the chateau and belongings of a great lord i know not his title who has been banished for conspiracy against the king there are some choice firearms in the lot this pistol oh a weapon fit for a prince it shall be only forty francs to you friend mignot if i lose ten by the sale but perhaps an arquebuse this will do said david throwing the money on the counter is it charged i will charge it said zeigler and for ten francs more add a store of powder and ball david laid his pistol under his coat and walked to his cottage yvonne was not there of late she had taken to gadding much among the neighbours but a fire was glowing in the kitchen stove david opened the door of it and thrust his poems in upon the coals as they blazed up they made a singing harsh sound in the flue the song of the crow said the poet he went up to his attic room and closed the door so quiet was the village that a score of people heard the roar of the great pistol they flocked thither and up the stairs where the smoke issuing drew their notice the men laid the body of the poet upon his bed awkwardly arranging it to conceal the torn plumage of the poor black crow the women chattered in a luxury of zealous pity some of them ran to tell yvonne m papineau whose nose had brought him there among the first picked up the weapon and ran his eye over its silver mountings with a mingled air of connoisseurship and grief the arms he explained aside to the cure and crest of monseigneur the marquis de beaupertuys the guardian of the accolade not the least important of the force of the weymouth bank was uncle bushrod sixty years had uncle bushrod given of faithful service to the house of weymouth as chattel servitor and friend of the colour of the mahogany bank furniture was uncle bushrod thus dark was he externally white as the uninked pages of the bank ledgers was his soul eminently pleasing to uncle bushrod would the comparison have been for to him the only institution in existence worth considering was the weymouth bank of which he was something between porter and generalissimo in charge weymouth lay dreamy and umbrageous among the low foothills along the brow of a southern valley three banks there were in weymouthville two were hopeless misguided enterprises lacking the presence and prestige of a weymouth to give them glory the third was the bank managed by the weymouths and uncle bushrod in the old weymouth homestead the red brick white porticoed mansion the first to your right as you crossed elder creek coming into town lived mr robert weymouth the president of the bank his widowed daughter mrs vesey called miss letty by every one and her two children nan and guy there also in a cottage on the grounds resided uncle bushrod and aunt malindy his wife mr william weymouth the cashier of the bank lived in a modern fine house on the principal avenue mr robert was a large stout man sixty two years of age with a smooth plump face long iron gray hair and fiery blue eyes he was high tempered kind and generous with a youthful smile and a formidable stern voice that did not always mean what it sounded like mr william was a milder man correct in deportment and absorbed in business the weymouths formed the family of weymouthville and were looked up to as was their right of heritage uncle bushrod was the bank s trusted porter messenger vassal and guardian he carried a key to the vault just as mr robert and mr williams did sometimes there was ten fifteen or twenty thousand dollars in sacked silver stacked on the vault floor it was safe with uncle bushrod he was a weymouth in heart honesty and pride of late uncle bushrod had not been without worry it was on account of marse robert for nearly a year mr robert had been known to indulge in too much drink not enough understand to become tipsy but the habit was getting a hold upon him and every one was beginning to notice it half a dozen times a day he would leave the bank and step around to the merchants and planters hotel to take a drink mr roberts usual keen judgment and business capacity became a little impaired mr william a weymouth but not so rich in experience tried to dam the inevitable backflow of the tide but with incomplete success the deposits in the weymouth bank dropped from six figures to five past due paper began to accumulate owing to injudicious loans no one cared to address mr robert on the subject of temperance many of his friends said that the cause of it had been the death of his wife some two years before others hesitated on account of mr robert s quick temper which was extremely apt to resent personal interference of such a nature miss letty and the children noticed the change and grieved about it uncle bushrod also worried but he was one of those who would not have dared to remonstrate although he and marse robert had been raised almost as companions but there was a heavier shock coming to uncle bushrod than that caused by the bank president s toddies and juleps mr robert had a passion for fishing which he usually indulged whenever the season and business permitted one day when reports had been coming in relating to the bass and perch he announced his intention of making a two or three days visit to the lakes he was going down he said to reedy lake with judge archinard an old friend now uncle bushrod was treasurer of the sons and daughters of the burning bush every association he belonged to made him treasurer without hesitation he stood aa in coloured circles he was understood among them to be mr bushrod weymouth of the weymouth bank the night following the day on which mr robert mentioned his intended fishing trip the old man woke up and rose from his bed at twelve o clock declaring he must go down to the bank and fetch the pass book of the sons and daughters which he had forgotten to bring home the bookkeeper had balanced it for him that day put the cancelled checks in it and snapped two elastic bands around it he put but one band around other pass books aunt malindy objected to the mission at so late an hour denouncing it as foolish and unnecessary but uncle bushrod was not to be deflected from duty i done told sister adaline hoskins he said to come by here for dat book to morrer mawnin at sebin o clock for to kyar it to de meetin of de bo d of rangements and dat book gwine to be here when she come so uncle bushrod put on his old brown suit got his thick hickory stick and meandered through the almost deserted streets of weymouthville he entered the bank unlocking the side door and found the pass book where he had left it in the little back room used for consultations where he always hung his coat looking about casually he saw that everything was as he had left it and was about to start for home when he was brought to a standstill by the sudden rattle of a key in the front door some one came quickly in closed the door softly and entered the counting room through the door in the iron railing that division of the bank s space was connected with the back room by a narrow passageway now in deep darkness uncle bushrod firmly gripping his hickory stick tiptoed gently up this passage until he could see the midnight intruder into the sacred precincts of the weymouth bank one dim gas jet burned there but even in its nebulous light he perceived at once that the prowler was the bank s president wondering fearful undecided what to do the old coloured man stood motionless in the gloomy strip of hallway and waited developments the vault with its big iron door was opposite him inside that was the safe holding the papers of value the gold and currency of the bank on the floor of the vault was perhaps eighteen thousand dollars in silver the president took his key from his pocket opened the vault and went inside nearly closing the door behind him uncle bushrod saw through the narrow aperture the flicker of a candle in a minute or two it seemed an hour to the watcher mr robert came out bringing with him a large hand satchel handling it in a careful but hurried manner as if fearful that he might be observed with one hand he closed and locked the vault door with a reluctant theory forming itself beneath his wool uncle bushrod waited and watched shaking in his concealing shadow mr robert set the satchel softly upon a desk and turned his coat collar up about his neck and ears he was dressed in a rough suit of gray as if for travelling he glanced with frowning intentness at the big office clock above the burning gas jet and then looked lingeringly about the bank lingeringly and fondly uncle bushrod thought as one who bids farewell to dear and familiar scenes now he caught up his burden again and moved promptly and softly out of the bank by the way he had come locking the front door behind him for a minute or longer uncle bushrod was as stone in his tracks had that midnight rifler of safes and vaults been any other on earth than the man he was the old retainer would have rushed upon him and struck to save the weymouth property but now the watcher s soul was tortured by the poignant dread of something worse than mere robbery he was seized by an accusing terror that said the weymouth name and the weymouth honour were about to be lost marse robert robbing the bank what else could it mean the hour of the night the stealthy visit to the vault the satchel brought forth and with expedition and silence the prowler s rough dress his solicitous reading of the clock and noiseless departure what else could it mean and then to the turmoil of uncle bushrod s thoughts came the corroborating recollection of preceding events mr robert s increasing intemperance and consequent many moods of royal high spirits and stern tempers the casual talk he had heard in the bank of the decrease in business and difficulty in collecting loans what else could it all mean but that mr robert weymouth was an absconder was about to fly with the bank s remaining funds leaving mr william miss letty little nab guy and uncle bushrod to bear the disgrace during one minute uncle bushrod considered these things and then he awoke to sudden determination and action lawd lawd he moaned aloud as he hobbled hastily toward the side door sech a come off after all dese here years of big doin s and fine doin s scan lous sights upon de yearth when de weymouth fambly done turn out robbers and bezzlers time for uncle bushrod to clean out somebody s chicken coop and eben matters up oh lawd marse robert you ain t gwine do dat n miss letty an dem chillun so proud and talkin weymouth weymouth all de time i m gwine to stop you ef i can spec you shoot mr nigger s head off ef he fool wid you but i m gwine stop you ef i can uncle bushrod aided by his hickory stick impeded by his rheumatism hurried down the street toward the railroad station where the two lines touching weymouthville met as he had expected and feared he saw there mr robert standing in the shadow of the building waiting for the train he held the satchel in his hand when uncle bushrod came within twenty yards of the bank president standing like a huge gray ghost by the station wall sudden perturbation seized him the rashness and audacity of the thing he had come to do struck him fully he would have been happy could he have turned and fled from the possibilities of the famous weymouth wrath but again he saw in his fancy the white reproachful face of miss letty and the distressed looks of nan and guy should he fail in his duty and they question him as to his stewardship braced by the thought he approached in a straight line clearing his throat and pounding with his stick so that he might be early recognized thus he might avoid the likely danger of too suddenly surprising the sometimes hasty mr robert is that you bushrod called the clamant clear voice of the gray ghost yes suh marse robert what the devil are you doing out at this time of night for the first time in his life uncle bushrod told marse robert a falsehood he could not repress it he would have to circumlocute a little his nerve was not equal to a direct attack i done been down suh to see ol aunt m ria patterson she taken sick in de night and i kyar ed her a bottle of m lindy s medercine yes suh humph said robert you better get home out of the night air it s damp you ll hardly be worth killing to morrow on account of your rheumatism think it ll be a clear day bushrod i low it will suh de sun sot red las night mr robert lit a cigar in the shadow and the smoke looked like his gray ghost expanding and escaping into the night air somehow uncle bushrod could barely force his reluctant tongue to the dreadful subject he stood awkward shambling with his feet upon the gravel and fumbling with his stick but then afar off three miles away at the jimtown switch he heard the faint whistle of the coming train the one that was to transport the weymouth name into the regions of dishonour and shame all fear left him he took off his hat and faced the chief of the clan he served the great royal kind lofty terrible weymouth he bearded him there at the brink of the awful thing that was about to happen marse robert he began his voice quivering a little with the stress of his feelings you member de day dey all rode de tunnament at oak lawn de day suh dat you win in de ridin and you crown miss lucy de queen tournament said mr robert taking his cigar from his mouth yes i remember very well the but what the deuce are you talking about tournaments here at midnight for go long home bushrod i believe you re sleep walking miss lucy tetch you on de shoulder continued the old man never heeding wid a s ord and say i mek you a knight suh robert rise up pure and fearless and widout reproach dat what miss lucy say dat s been a long time ago but me nor you ain t forgot it and den dar s another time we ain t forgot de

bushrod wharfo didn you take good care of mr robert mr robert weymouth threw away his cigar and shook free one arm with that peculiar gesture that always preceded his outbursts of irascibility uncle bushrod bowed his head to the expected storm but he did not flinch if the house of weymouth was to fall he would fall with it the banker spoke and uncle bushrod blinked with surprise the storm was there but it was suppressed to the quietness of a summer breeze bushrod said mr robert in a lower voice than he usually employed you have overstepped all bounds you have presumed upon the leniency with which you have been treated to meddle unpardonably so you know what is in this satchel your long and faithful service is some excuse but go home bushrod not another word but bushrod grasped the

sleepy passengers got off and wandered away into the night the conductor stepped to the gravel swung his lantern and called hello frank at some one invisible the bell clanged the brakes hissed the conductor drawled all aboard mr robert released his hold on the satchel uncle bushrod hugged it to his breast with both arms as a lover clasps his first beloved take it back with you bushrod said mr robert thrusting his hands into his pockets and let the subject drop now mind you ve said quite enough i m going to take the train tell mr william i will be back on saturday good night the banker climbed the steps of the moving train and disappeared in a coach uncle bushrod stood motionless still embracing the precious satchel his eyes were closed and his lips were moving in thanks to the master above for the salvation of the weymouth honour he knew mr robert would return when he said he would the weymouths never lied nor now thank the lord could it be said that they embezzled the money in banks then awake to the necessity for further guardianship of weymouth trust funds the old man started for the bank with the redeemed satchel three hours from weymouthville in the gray dawn mr robert alighted from the train at a lonely flag station dimly he could see the figure of a man waiting on the platform and the shape of a spring waggon team and driver half a dozen lengthy bamboo fishing poles projected from the waggon s rear you re here bob said judge archinard mr robert s old friend and schoolmate it s going to be a royal day for fishing i thought you said why didn t you bring along the stuff the president of the weymouth bank took off his hat and rumpled his gray locks well ben to tell you the truth there s an infernally presumptuous old nigger belonging in my family that broke up the arrangement he came down to the depot and vetoed the whole proceeding he means all right and well i reckon he is right somehow he had found out what i had along though i hid it in the bank vault and sneaked it out at midnight i reckon he has noticed that i ve been indulging a little more than a gentleman should and he laid for me with some reaching arguments i m going to quit drinking mr robert concluded i ve come to the conclusion that a man can t keep it up and be quite what he d like to be pure and fearless and without reproach that s the way old bushrod quoted it well i ll have to admit said the judge thoughtfully as they climbed into the waggon that the old darkey s argument can t conscientiously be overruled still said mr robert with a ghost of a sigh there was two quarts of the finest old silk velvet bourbon in that satchel you ever wet your lips with the discounters of money the spectacle of the money caliphs of the present day going about bagdad on the subway trying to relieve the wants of the people is enough to make the great al raschid turn haroun in his grave if not so then the assertion should do so the real caliph having been a wit and a scholar and therefore a hater of puns how properly to alleviate the troubles of the poor is one of the greatest troubles of the rich but one thing agreed upon by all professional philanthropists is that you must never hand over any cash to your subject the poor are notoriously temperamental and when they get money they exhibit a strong tendency to spend it for stuffed olives and enlarged crayon portraits instead of giving it to the instalment man and still old haroun had some advantages as an eleemosynarian he took around with him on his rambles his vizier giafar a vizier is a composite of a chauffeur a secretary of state and a night and day bank and old uncle mesrour his executioner who toted a snickersnee with this entourage a caliphing tour could hardly fail to be successful have you noticed lately any newspaper articles headed what shall we do with our ex presidents well now suppose that mr carnegie could engage him and joe gans to go about assisting in the distribution of free libraries do you suppose any town would have had the hardihood to refuse one that caliphalous combination would cause two libraries to grow where there had been only one set of e p roe s works before but as i said the money caliphs are handicapped they have the idea that earth has no sorrow that dough cannot heal and they rely upon it solely al raschid administered justice rewarding the deserving and punished whomsoever he disliked on the spot he was the originator of the short story contest whenever he succoured any chance pick up in the bazaars he always made the succouree tell the sad story of his life if the narrative lacked construction style and esprit he commanded his vizier to dole him out a couple of thousand ten dollar notes of the first national bank of the bosphorus or else gave him a soft job as keeper of the bird seed for the bulbuls in the imperial gardens if the story was a cracker jack he had mesrour the executioner whack of his head the report that haroun al raschid is yet alive and is editing the magazine that your grandmother used to subscribe for lacks confirmation and now follows the story of the millionaire the inefficacious increment and the babes drawn from the wood young howard pilkins the millionaire got his money ornithologically he was a shrewd judge of storks and got in on the ground floor at the residence of his immediate ancestors the pilkins brewing company for his mother was a partner in the business finally old man pilkins died from a torpid liver and then mrs pilkins died from worry on account of torpid delivery waggons and there you have young howard pilkins with and a good fellow at that he was an agreeable modestly arrogant young man who implicitly believed that money could buy anything that the world had to offer and bagdad on the subway for a long time did everything possible to encourage his belief but the rat trap caught him at last he heard the spring snap and found his heart in a wire cage regarding a piece of cheese whose other name was alice von der ruysling the von der ruyslings still live in that little square about which so much has been said and in which so little has been done to day you hear of mr tilden s underground passage and you hear mr gould s elevated passage and that about ends the noise in the world made by gramercy square but once it was different the von der ruyslings live there yet and they received the first key ever made to gramercy park you shall have no description of alice v d r just call up in your mind the picture of your own maggie or vera or beatrice straighten her nose soften her voice tone her down and then tone her up make her beautiful and unattainable and you have a faint dry point etching of alice the family owned a crumbly brick house and a coachman named joseph in a coat of many colours and a horse so old that he claimed to belong to the order of the perissodactyla and had toes instead of hoofs in the year the family had to buy a new set of harness for their perissodactyl before using it they made joseph smear it over with a mixture of ashes and soot it was the von der ruysling family that bought the territory between the bowery and east river and rivington street and the statue of liberty in the year from an indian chief for a quart of passementerie and a pair of turkey red portieres designed for a harlem flat i have always admired that indian s perspicacity and good taste all this is merely to convince you that the von der ruyslings were exactly the kind of poor aristocrats that turn down their noses at people who have money oh well i don t mean that i mean people who have just money one evening pilkins went down to the red brick house in gramercy square and made what he thought was a proposal to alice v d r alice with her nose turned down and thinking of his money considered it a proposition and refused it and him pilkins summoning all his resources as any good general would have done made an indiscreet references to the advantages that his money would provide that settled it the lady turned so cold that walter wellman himself would have waited until spring to make a dash for her in a dog sled but pilkins was something of a sport himself you can t fool all the millionaires every time the ball drops on the western union building if at any time he said to a v d r you feel that you would like to reconsider your answer send me a rose like that pilkins audaciously touched a jacque rose that she wore loosely in her hair very well said she and when i do you will understand by it that either you or i have learned something new about the purchasing power of money you ve been spoiled my friend no i don t think i could marry you to morrow i will send you back the presents you have given me presents said pilkins in surprise i never gave you a present in my life i would like to see a full length portrait of the man that you would take a present from why you never would let me send you flowers or candy or even art calendars you ve forgotten said alice v d r with a little smile it was a long time ago when our families were neighbours you were seven and i was trundling my doll on the sidewalk you have me a little gray hairy kitten with shoe buttony eyes its head came off and it was full of candy you paid five cents for it you told me so i haven t the candy to return to you i hadn t developed a conscience at three so i ate it but i have the kitten yet and i will wrap it up neatly to night and send it to you to morrow beneath the lightness of alice v d r s talk the steadfastness of her rejection showed firm and plain so there was nothing left for him but to leave the crumbly red brick house and be off with his abhorred millions on his way back pilkins walked through madison square the hour hand of the clock hung about eight the air was stingingly cool but not at the freezing point the dim little square seemed like a great cold unroofed room with its four walls of houses spangled with thousands of insufficient lights only a few loiterers were huddled here and there on the benches but suddenly pilkins came upon a youth sitting brave and as if conflicting with summer sultriness coatless his white shirt sleeves conspicuous in the light from the globe of an electric close to his side was a girl smiling dreamy happy around her shoulders was palpably the missing coat of the cold defying youth it appeared to be a modern panorama of the babes in the wood revised and brought up to date with the exception that the robins hadn t turned up yet with the protecting leaves with delight the money caliphs view a situation that they think is relievable while you wait pilkins sat on the bench one seat removed from the youth he glanced cautiously and saw as men do see and women oh never can that they were of the same order pilkins leaned over after a short time and spoke to the youth who answered smilingly and courteously from general topics the conversation concentrated to the bed rock of grim personalities but pilkins did it as delicately and heartily as any caliph could have done and when it came to the point the youth turned to him soft voiced and with his undiminished smile i don t want to seem unappreciative old man he said with a youth s somewhat too early spontaneity of address but you see i can t accept anything from a stranger i know you re all right and i m tremendously obliged but i couldn t think of borrowing from anybody you see i m marcus clayton the claytons of roanoke county virginia you know the young lady is miss eva bedford i reckon you ve heard of the bedfords she s seventeen and one of the bedfords of bedford county we ve eloped from home to get married and we wanted to see new york we got in this afternoon somebody got my pocketbook on the ferry boat and i had only three cents in change outside of it i ll get some work somewhere to morrow and we ll get married but i say old man said pilkins in confidential low tones you can t keep the lady out here in the cold all night now as for hotels i told you said the youth with a broader smile that i didn t have but three cents besides if i had a thousand we d have to wait here until morning you can understand that of course i m much obliged but i can t take any of your money miss bedford and i have lived an outdoor life and we don t mind a little cold i ll get work of some kind to morrow we ve got a paper bag of cakes and chocolates and we ll get along all right listen said the millionaire impressively my name is pilkins and i m worth several million dollars i happen to have in my pockets about or in cash don t you think you are drawing it rather fine when you decline to accept as much of it as will make you and the young lady comfortable at least for the night i can t say sir that i do think so said clayton of roanoke county i ve been raised to look at such things differently but i m mightily obliged to you just the same then you force me to say good night said the millionaire twice that day had his money been scorned by simple ones to whom his dollars had appeared as but tin tobacco tags he was no worshipper of the actual minted coin or stamped paper but he had always believed in its almost unlimited power to purchase pilkins walked away rapidly and then turned abruptly and returned to the bench where the young couple sat he took off his hat and began to speak the girl looked at him with the same sprightly glowing interest that she had been giving to the lights and statuary and sky reaching buildings that made the old square seem so far away from bedford county mr er roanoke said pilkins i admire your your indepen your idiocy so much that i m going to appeal to your chivalry i believe that s what you southerners call it when you keep a lady sitting outdoors on a bench on a cold night just to keep your old out of date pride going now i ve a friend a lady whom i have known all my life who lives a few blocks from here with her parents and sisters and aunts and all that kind of endorsement of course i am sure this lady would be happy and pleased to put up that is to have miss er bedford give her the pleasure of having her as a guest for the night don t you think mr roanoke of er virginie that you could unbend your prejudices that far clayton of roanoke rose and held out his hand old man he said miss bedford will be much pleased to accept the hospitality of the lady you refer to he formally introduced mr pilkins to miss bedford the girl looked at him sweetly and comfortably it s a lovely evening mr pilkins don t you think so she said slowly pilkins conducted them to the crumbly red brick house of the von der ruyslings his card brought alice downstairs wondering the runaways were sent into the drawing room while pilkins told alice all about it in the hall of course i will take her in said alice haven t those southern girls a thoroughbred air of course she will stay here you will look after mr clayton of course will i said pilkins delightedly oh yes i ll look after him as a citizen of new york and therefore a part owner of its public parks i m going to extend to him the hospitality of madison square to night he s going to sit there on a bench till morning there s no use arguing with him isn t he wonderful i m glad you ll look after the little lady alice i tell you those babes in the wood made my that is er made wall street and the bank of england look like penny arcades miss von der ruysling whisked miss bedford of bedford county up to restful regions upstairs when she came down she put an oblong small pasteboard box into pilkins hands your present she said that i am returning to you oh yes i remember said pilkins with a sigh the woolly kitten he left clayton on a park bench and shook hands with him heartily after i get work said the youth i ll look you up your address is on your card isn t it thanks well good night i m awfully obliged to you for your kindness no thanks i don t smoke good night in his room pilkins opened the box and took out the staring funny kitten long ago ravaged of his candy and minus one shoe button eye pilkins looked at it sorrowfully after all he said i don t believe that just money alone will and then he gave a shout and dug into the bottom of the box for something else that had been the kitten s resting place a crushed but red red fragrant glorious promising jacqueminot rose the enchanted profile there are few caliphesses women are scheherazades by birth predilection instinct and arrangement of the vocal cords the thousand and one stories are being told every day by hundreds of thousands of viziers daughters to their respective sultans but the bowstring will get some of em yet if they don t watch out i heard a story though of one lady caliph it isn t precisely an arabian nights story because it brings in cinderella who flourished her dishrag in another epoch and country so if you don t mind the mixed dates which seem to give it an eastern flavour after all we ll get along in new york there is an old old hotel you have seen woodcuts of it in the magazines it was built let s see at a time when there was nothing above fourteenth street except the old indian trail to boston and hammerstein s office soon the old hostelry will be torn down and as the stout walls are riven apart and the bricks go roaring down the chutes crowds of citizens will gather at the nearest corners and weep over the destruction of a dear old landmark civic pride is strongest in new bagdad and the wettest weeper and the loudest howler against the iconoclasts will be the man originally from terre haute whose fond memories of the old hotel are limited to his having been kicked out from its free lunch counter in at this hotel always stopped mrs maggie brown mrs brown was a bony woman of sixty dressed in the rustiest black and carrying a handbag made apparently from the hide of the original animal that adam decided to call an alligator she always occupied a small parlour and bedroom at the top of the hotel at a rental of two dollars per day and always while she was there each day came hurrying to see her many men sharp faced anxious looking with only seconds to spare for maggie brown was said to be the third richest woman in the world and these solicitous gentlemen were only the city s wealthiest brokers and business men seeking trifling loans of half a dozen millions or so from the dingy old lady with the prehistoric handbag the stenographer and typewriter of the acropolis hotel there i ve let the name of it out was miss ida bates she was a hold over from the greek classics there wasn t a flaw in her looks some old timer paying his regards to a lady said to have loved her was a liberal education well even to have looked over the black hair and neat white shirtwaist of miss bates was equal to a full course in any correspondence school in the country she sometimes did a little typewriting for me and as she refused to take the money in advance she came to look upon me as something of a friend and protege she had unfailing kindliness and a good nature and not even a white lead drummer or a fur importer had ever dared to cross the dead line of good behaviour in her presence the entire force of the acropolis from the owner who lived in vienna down to the head porter who had been bedridden for sixteen years would have sprung to her defence in a moment one day i walked past miss bates s little sanctum remingtorium and saw in her place a black haired unit unmistakably a person pounding with each of her forefingers upon the keys musing on the mutability of temporal affairs i passed on the next day i went on a two weeks vacation returning i strolled through the lobby of the acropolis and saw with a little warm glow of auld lang syne miss bates as grecian and kind and flawless as ever just putting the cover on her machine the hour for closing had come but she asked me in to sit for a few minutes on the dictation chair miss bates explained her absence from and return to the acropolis hotel in words identical with or similar to these following well man how are the stories coming pretty regularly said i about equal to their going i m sorry said she good typewriting is the main thing in a story you ve missed me haven t you no one said i whom i have ever known knows as well as you do how to space properly belt buckles semi colons hotel guests and hairpins but you ve been away too i saw a package of peppermint pepsin in your place the other day i was going to tell you all about it said miss bates if you hadn t interrupted me of course you know about maggie brown who stops here well she s worth she lives in jersey in a ten dollar flat she s always got more cash on hand than half a dozen business candidates for vice president i don t know whether she carries it in her stocking or not but i know she s mighty popular down in the part of town where they worship the golden calf well about two weeks ago mrs brown stops at the door and rubbers at me for ten minutes i m sitting with my side to her striking off some manifold copies of a copper mine proposition for a nice old man from tonopah but i always see everything all around me when i m hard at work i can see things through my side combs and i can leave one button unbuttoned in the back of my shirtwaist and see who s behind me i didn t look around because i make from eighteen to twenty dollars a week and i didn t have to that evening at knocking off time she sends for me to come up to her apartment i expected to have to typewrite about two thousand words of notes of hand liens and contracts with a ten cent tip in sight but i went well man i was certainly surprised old maggie brown had turned human child says she you re the most beautiful creature i ever saw in my life i want you to quit your work and come and live with me i ve no kith or kin says she except a husband and a son or two and i hold no communication with any of em they re extravagant burdens on a hard working woman i want you to be a daughter to me they say i m stingy and mean and the papers print lies about my doing my own cooking and washing it s a lie she goes on i put my washing out except the handkerchiefs and stockings and petticoats and collars and light stuff like that i ve got forty million dollars in cash and stocks and bonds that are as negotiable as standard oil preferred at a church fair i m a lonely old woman and i need companionship you re the most beautiful human being i ever saw says she will you come and live with me i ll show em whether i can spend money or not she says well man what would you have done of course i fell to it and to tell you the truth i began to like old maggie it wasn t all on account of the forty millions and what she could do for me i was kind of lonesome in the world too everybody s got to have somebody they can explain to about the pain in their left shoulder and how fast patent leather shoes wear out when they begin to crack and you can t talk about such things to men you meet in hotels they re looking for just such openings so i gave up my job in the hotel and went with mrs brown i certainly seemed to have a mash on her she d look at me for half an hour at a time when i was sitting reading or looking at the magazines one time i says to her do i remind you of some deceased relative or friend of your childhood mrs brown i ve noticed you give me a pretty good optical inspection from time to time you have a face she says exactly like a dear friend of mine the best friend i ever had but i like you for yourself child too she says and say man what do you suppose she did loosened up like a marcel wave in the surf at coney she took me to a swell dressmaker and gave her a la carte to fit me out money no object they were rush orders and madame locked the front door and put the whole force to work then we moved to where do you think no guess again that s right the hotel bonton we had a six room apartment and it cost a day i saw the bill i began to love that old lady and then man when my dresses began to come in oh i won t tell you about em you couldn t understand and i began to call her aunt maggie you ve read about cinderella of course well what cinderella said when the prince fitted that a on her foot was a hard luck story compared to the things i told myself then aunt maggie says she is going to give me a coming out banquet in the bonton that ll make moving vans of all the old dutch families on fifth avenue i ve been out before aunt maggie says i but i ll come out again but you know says i that this is one of the swellest hotels in the city and you know pardon me that it s hard to get a bunch of notables together unless you ve trained for it don t fret about that child says aunt maggie i don t send out invitations i issue orders i ll have fifty guests here that couldn t be brought together again at any reception unless it were given by king edward or william travers jerome they are men of course and all of em either owe me money or intend to some of their wives won t come but a good many will well i wish you could have been at that banquet the dinner service was all gold and cut glass there were about forty men and eight ladies present besides aunt maggie and i you d never have known the third richest woman in the world she had on a new black silk dress with so much passementerie on it that it sounded exactly like a hailstorm i heard once when i was staying all night with a girl that lived in a top floor studio and my dress say man i can t waste the words on you it was all hand made lace where there was any of it at all and it cost i saw the bill the men were all bald headed or white whiskered and they kept up a running fire of light repartee about per cents and bryan and the cotton crop on the left of me was something that talked like a banker and on my right was a young fellow who said he was a newspaper artist he was the only well i was going to tell you after the dinner was over mrs brown and i went up to the apartment we had to squeeze our way through a mob of reporters all the way through the halls that s one of the things money does for you say do you happen to know a newspaper artist named lathrop a tall man with nice eyes and an easy way of talking no i don t remember what paper he works on well all right when we got upstairs mrs brown telephones for the bill right away it came and it was i saw the bill aunt maggie fainted i got her on a lounge and opened the bead work child says she when she got back to the world what was it a raise of rent or an income tax just a little dinner says i nothing to worry about hardly a drop in the bucket shop sit up and take notice a dispossess notice if there s no other kind but say man do you know what aunt maggie did she got cold feet she hustled me out of that hotel bonton at nine the next morning we went to a rooming house on the lower west side she rented one room that had water on the floor below and light on the floor above after we got moved all you could see in the room was about worth of new swell dresses and a one burner gas stove aunt maggie had had a sudden attack of the hedges i guess everybody has got to go on a spree once in their life a man spends his on highballs and a woman gets woozy on clothes but with forty million dollars say i d like to have a picture of but speaking of pictures did you ever run across a newspaper artist named lathrop a tall oh i asked you that before didn t i he was mighty nice to me at the dinner his voice just suited me i guess he must have thought i was to inherit some of aunt maggie s money well mr man three days of that light housekeeping was plenty for me aunt maggie was affectionate as ever she d hardly let me get out of her sight but let me tell you she was a hedger from hedgersville hedger county seventy five cents a day was the limit she set we cooked our own meals in the room there i was with a thousand dollars worth of the latest things in clothes doing stunts over a one burner gas stove as i say on the third day i flew the coop i couldn t stand for throwing together a fifteen cent kidney stew while wearing at the same time a house dress with valenciennes lace insertion so i goes into the closet and puts on the cheapest dress mrs brown had bought for me it s the one i ve got on now not so bad for is it i d left all my own clothes in my sister s flat in brooklyn mrs brown formerly aunt maggie says i to her i m going to extend my feet alternately one after the other in such a manner and direction that this tenement will recede from me in the quickest possible time i am no worshipper of money says i but there are some things i can t stand i can stand the fabulous monster that i ve read about that blows hot birds and cold bottles with the same breath but i can t stand a quitter says i they say you ve got forty million dollars well you ll never have any less and i was beginning to like you too says i well the late aunt maggie kicks till the tears flow she offers to move into a swell room with a two burner stove and running water i ve spent an awful lot of money child says she we ll have to economize for a while you re the most beautiful creature i ever laid eyes on she says and i don t want you to leave me well you see me don t you i walked straight to the acropolis and asked for my job back and i got it how did you say your writings were getting along i know you ve lost out some by not having me to type em do you ever have em illustrated and by the way did you ever happen to know a newspaper artist oh shut up i know i asked you before i wonder what paper he works on it s funny but i couldn t help thinking that he wasn t thinking about the money he might have been thinking i was thinking i d get from old maggie brown if i only knew some of the newspaper editors i d the sound of an easy footstep came from the doorway ida bates saw who it was with her back hair comb i saw her turn pink perfect statue that she was a miracle that i share with pygmalion only am i excusable she said to me adorable petitioner that she became it s it s mr lathrop i wonder if it really wasn t the money i wonder if after all he of course i was invited to the wedding after the ceremony i dragged lathrop aside you are an artist said i and haven t figured out why maggie brown conceived such a strong liking for miss bates that was let me show you the bride wore a simple white dress as beautifully draped as the costumes of the ancient greeks i took some leaves from one of the decorative wreaths in the little parlour and made a chaplet of them and placed them on nee bates shining chestnut hair and made her turn her profile to her husband by jingo said he isn t ida a dead ringer for the lady s head on the silver dollar next to reading matter he compelled my interest as he stepped from the ferry at desbrosses street he had the air of being familiar with hemispheres and worlds and of entering new york as the lord of a demesne who revisited it in after years of absence but i thought that with all his air he had never before set foot on the slippery cobblestones of the city of too many caliphs he wore loose clothes of a strange bluish drab colour and a conservative round panama hat without the cock a loop indentations and cants with which northern fanciers disfigure the tropic head gear moreover he was the homeliest man i have ever seen his ugliness was less repellent than startling arising from a sort of lincolnian ruggedness and irregularity of feature that spellbound you with wonder and dismay so may have looked afrites or the shapes metamorphosed from the vapour of the fisherman s vase as he afterward told me his name was judson tate and he may as well be called so at once he wore his green silk tie through a topaz ring and he carried a cane made of the vertebrae of a shark judson tate accosted me with some large and casual inquiries about the city s streets and hotels in the manner of one who had but for the moment forgotten the trifling details i could think of no reason for disparaging my own quiet hotel in the downtown district so the mid morning of the night found us already victualed and drinked at my expense and ready to be chaired and tobaccoed in a quiet corner of the lobby there was something on judson tate s mind and such as it was he tried to convey it to me already he had accepted me as his friend and when i looked at his great snuff brown first mate s hand with which he brought emphasis to his periods within six inches of my nose i wondered if by any chance he was as sudden in conceiving enmity against strangers when this man began to talk i perceived in him a certain power his voice was a persuasive instrument upon which he played with a somewhat specious but effective art he did not try to make you forget his ugliness he flaunted it in your face and made it part of the charm of his speech shutting your eyes you would have trailed after this rat catcher s pipes at least to the walls of hamelin beyond that you would have had to be more childish to follow but let him play his own tune to the words set down so that if all is too dull the art of music may bear the blame women said judson tate are mysterious creatures my spirits sank i was not there to listen to such a world old hypothesis to such a time worn long ago refuted bald feeble illogical vicious patent sophistry to an ancient baseless wearisome ragged unfounded insidious falsehood originated by women themselves and by them insinuated foisted thrust spread and ingeniously promulgated into the ears of mankind by underhanded secret and deceptive methods for the purpose of augmenting furthering and reinforcing their own charms and designs oh i don t know said i vernacularly have you ever heard of oratama he asked possibly i answered i seem to recall a toe dancer or a suburban addition or was it a perfume of some such name it is a town said judson tate on the coast of a foreign country of which you know nothing and could understand less it is a country governed by a dictator and controlled by revolutions and insubordination it was there that a great life drama was played with judson tate the homeliest man in america and fergus mcmahan the handsomest adventurer in history or fiction and senorita anabela zamora the beautiful daughter of the alcalde of oratama as chief actors and another thing nowhere else on the globe except in the department of trienta y tres in uruguay does the chuchula plant grow the products of the country i speak of are valuable woods dyestuffs gold rubber ivory and cocoa i was not aware said i that south america produced any ivory there you are twice mistaken said judson tate distributing the words over at least an octave of his wonderful voice i did not say that the country i spoke of was in south america i must be careful my dear man i have been in politics there you know but even so i have played chess against its president with a set carved from the nasal bones of the tapir one of our native specimens of the order of perissodactyle ungulates inhabiting the cordilleras which was as pretty ivory as you would care to see but is was of romance and adventure and the ways of women that was i going to tell you and not of zoological animals for fifteen years i was the ruling power behind old sancho benavides the royal high thumbscrew of the republic you ve seen his picture in the papers a mushy black man with whiskers like the notes on a swiss music box cylinder and a scroll in his right hand like the ones they write births on in the family bible well that chocolate potentate used to be the biggest item of interest anywhere between the colour line and the parallels of latitude it was three throws horses whether he was to wind up in the hall of fame or the bureau of combustibles he d have been sure called the roosevelt of the southern continent if it hadn t been that grover cleveland was president at the time he d hold office a couple of terms then he d sit out for a hand always after appointing his own successor for the interims but it was not benavides the liberator who was making all this fame for himself not him it was judson tate benavides was only the chip over the bug i gave him the tip when to declare war and increase import duties and wear his state trousers but that wasn t what i wanted to tell you how did i get to be it i ll tell you because i m the most gifted talker that ever made vocal sounds since adam first opened his eyes pushed aside the smelling salts and asked where am i as you observe i am about the ugliest man you ever saw outside the gallery of photographs of the new england early christian scientists so at an early age i perceived that what i lacked in looks i must make up in eloquence that i ve done i get what i go after as the back stop and still small voice of old benavides i made all the great historical powers behind the throne such as talleyrand mrs de pompadour and loeb look as small as the minority report of a duma i could talk nations into or out of debt harangue armies to sleep on the battlefield reduce insurrections inflammations taxes appropriations or surpluses with a few words and call up the dogs of war or the dove of peace with the same bird like whistle beauty and epaulettes and curly moustaches and grecian profiles in other men were never in my way when people first look at me they shudder unless they are in the last stages of angina pectoris they are mine in ten minutes after i begin to talk women and men i win em as they come now you wouldn t think women would fancy a man with a face like mine would you oh yes mr tate said i history is bright and fiction dull with homely men who have charmed women there seems pardon me interrupted judson tate but you don t quite understand you have yet to hear my story fergus mcmahan was a friend of mine in the capital for a handsome man i ll admit he was the duty free merchandise he had blond curls and laughing blue eyes and was featured regular they said he was a ringer for the statue they call herr mees the god of speech and eloquence resting in some museum at rome some german anarchist i suppose they are always resting and talking but fergus was no talker he was brought up with the idea that to be beautiful was to make good his conversation was about as edifying as listening to a leak dropping in a tin dish pan at the head of the bed when you want to go to sleep but he and me got to be friends maybe because we was so opposite don t you think looking at the hallowe en mask that i call my face when i m shaving seemed to give fergus pleasure and i m sure that whenever i heard the feeble output of throat noises that he called conversation i felt contented to be a gargoyle with a silver tongue one time i found it necessary to go down to this coast town of oratama to straighten out a lot of political unrest and chop off a few heads in the customs and military departments fergus who owned the ice and sulphur match concessions of the republic says he ll keep me company so in a jangle of mule train bells we gallops into oratama and the town belonged to us as much as long island sound doesn t belong to japan when t r is at oyster bay i say us but i mean me everybody for four nations two oceans one bay and isthmus and five archipelagoes around had heard of judson tate gentleman adventurer they called me i had been written up in five columns of the yellow journals words with marginal decorations in a monthly magazine and a stickful on the twelfth page of the new york times if the beauty of fergus mcmahan gained any part of our reception in oratama i ll eat the price tag in my panama it was me that they hung out paper flowers and palm branches for i am not a jealous man i am stating facts the people were nebuchadnezzars they bit the grass before me there was no dust in the town for them to bite they bowed down to judson tate they knew that i was the power behind sancho benavides a word from me was more to them than a whole deckle edged library from east aurora in sectional bookcases was from anybody else and yet there are people who spend hours fixing their faces rubbing in cold cream and massaging the muscles always toward the eyes and taking in the slack with tincture of benzoin and electrolyzing moles to what end looking handsome oh what a mistake it s the larynx that the beauty doctors ought to work on it s words more than warts talk more than talcum palaver more than powder blarney more than bloom that counts the phonograph instead of the photograph but i was going to tell you the local astors put me and fergus up at the centipede club a frame building built on posts sunk in the surf the tide s only nine inches the little big high low jack in the game of the town came around and kowtowed oh it wasn t to herr mees they had heard about judson tate one afternoon me and fergus mcmahan was sitting on the seaward gallery of the centipede drinking iced rum and talking judson says fergus there s an angel in oratama so long says i as it ain t gabriel why talk as if you had heard a trump blow it s the senorita anabela zamora says fergus she s she s she s as lovely as as hell bravo says i laughing heartily you have a true lover s eloquence to paint the beauties of your inamorata you remind me says i of faust s wooing of marguerite that is if he wooed her after he went down the trap door of the stage judson says fergus you know you are as beautiless as a rhinoceros you can t have any interest in women i m awfully gone in miss anabela and that s why i m telling you oh seguramente says i i know i have a front elevation like an aztec god that guards a buried treasure that never did exist in jefferson county yucatan but there are compensations for instance i am it in this country as far as the eye can reach and then a few perches and poles and again says i when i engage people in a set to of oral vocal and laryngeal utterances i do not usually confine my side of the argument to what may be likened to a cheap phonographic reproduction of the ravings of a jellyfish oh i know says fergus amiable that i m not handy at small talk or large either that s why i m telling you i want you to help me how can i do it i asked i have subsidized says fergus the services of senorita anabela s duenna whose name is francesca you have a reputation in this country judson says fergus of being a great man and a hero i have says i and i deserve it and i says fergus am the best looking man between the arctic circle and antarctic ice pack with limitations says i as to physiognomy and geography i freely concede you to be between the two of us says fergus we ought to land the senorita anabela zamora the lady as you know is of an old spanish family and further than looking at her driving in the family carruaje of afternoons around the plaza or catching a glimpse of her through a barred window of evenings she is as unapproachable as a star land her for which one of us says i for me of course says fergus you ve never seen her now i ve had francesca point me out to her as being you on several occasions when she sees me on the plaza she thinks she s looking at don judson tate the greatest hero statesman and romantic figure in the country with your reputation and my looks combined in one man how can she resist him she s heard all about your thrilling history of course and she s seen me can any woman want more asks fergus mcmahan can she do with less i ask how can we separate our mutual attractions and how shall we apportion the proceeds then fergus tells me his scheme the house of the alcalde don luis zamora he says has a patio of course a kind of inner courtyard opening from the street in an angle of it is his daughter s window as dark a place as you could find and what do you think he wants me to do why knowing my freedom charm and skilfulness of tongue he proposes that i go into the patio at midnight when the hobgoblin face of me cannot be seen and make love to her for him for the pretty man that she has seen on the plaza thinking him to be don judson tate why shouldn t i do it for him for my friend fergus mcmahan for him to ask me was a compliment an acknowledgment of his own shortcomings you little lily white fine haired highly polished piece of dumb sculpture says i i ll help you make your arrangements and get me in the dark outside her window and my stream of conversation opened up with the moonlight tremolo stop turned on and she s yours keep your face hid jud says fergus for heaven s sake keep your face hid i m a friend of yours in all kinds of sentiment but this is a business deal if i could talk i wouldn t ask you but seeing me and listening to you i don t see why she can t be landed by you says i by me says fergus well fergus and the duenna francesca attended to the details and one night they fetched me a long black cloak with a high collar and led me to the house at midnight i stood by the window in the patio until i heard a voice as soft and sweet as an angel s whisper on the other side of the bars i could see only a faint white clad shape inside and true to fergus i pulled the collar of my cloak high up for it was july in the wet seasons and the nights were chilly and smothering a laugh as i thought of the tongue tied fergus i began to talk well sir i talked an hour at the senorita anabela i say at because it was not with now and then she would say oh senor or now ain t you foolin or i know you don t mean that and such things as women will when they are being rightly courted both of us knew english and spanish so in two languages i tried to win the heart of the lady for my friend fergus but for the bars to the window i could have done it in one at the end of the hour she dismissed me and gave me a big red rose i handed it over to fergus when i got home for three weeks every third or fourth night i impersonated my friend in the patio at the window of senorita anabela at last she admitted that her heart was mine and spoke of having seen me every afternoon when she drove in the plaza it was fergus she had seen of course but it was my talk that won her suppose fergus had gone there and tried to make a hit in the dark with his beauty all invisible and not a word to say for himself on the last night she promised to be mine that is fergus s and she put her hand between the bars for me to kiss i bestowed the kiss and took the news to fergus you might have left that for me to do says he that ll be your job hereafter says i keep on doing that and don t try to talk maybe after she thinks she s in love she won t notice the difference between real conversation and the inarticulate sort of droning that you give forth now i had never seen senorita anabela so the next day fergus asks me to walk with him through the plaza and view the daily promenade and exhibition of oratama society a sight that had no interest for me but i went and children and dogs took to the banana groves and mangrove swamps as soon as they had a look at my face here she comes said fergus twirling his moustache the one in white in the open carriage with the black horse i looked and felt the ground rock under my feet for senorita anabela zamora was the most beautiful woman in the world and the only one from that moment on so far as judson tate was concerned i saw at a glance that i must be hers and she mine forever i thought of my face and nearly fainted and then i thought of my other talents and stood upright again and i had been wooing her for three weeks for another man as senorita anabela s carriage rolled slowly past she gave fergus a long soft glance from the corners of her night black eyes a glance that would have sent judson tate up into heaven in a rubber tired chariot but she never looked at me and that handsome man only ruffles his curls and smirks and prances like a lady killer at my side what do you think of her judson asks fergus with an air this much says i she is to me mrs judson tate i am no man to play tricks on a friend so take your warning i thought fergus would die laughing well well well said he you old doughface struck too are you that s great but you re too late francesca tells me that anabela talks of nothing but me day and night of course i m awfully obliged to you for making that chin music to her of evenings but do you know i ve an idea that i could have done it as well myself mrs judson tate says i don t forget the name you ve had the use of my tongue to go with your good looks my boy you can t lend me your looks but hereafter my tongue is my own keep your mind on the name that s to be on the visiting cards two inches by three and a half mrs judson tate that s all all right says fergus laughing again i ve talked with her father the alcalde and he s willing he s to give a baile to morrow evening in his new warehouse if you were a dancing man jud i d expect you around to meet the future mrs mcmahan but on the next evening when the music was playing loudest at the alcade zamora s baile into the room steps judson tate in a new white linen clothes as if he were the biggest man in the whole nation which he was some of the musicians jumped off the key when they saw my face and one or two of the timidest senoritas let out a screech or two but up prances the alcalde and almost wipes the dust off my shoes with his forehead no mere good looks could have won me that sensational entrance i hear much senor zamora says i of the charm of your daughter it would give me great pleasure to be presented to her there were about six dozen willow rocking chairs with pink tidies tied on to them arranged against the walls in one of them sat senorita anabela in white swiss and red slippers with pearls and fireflies in her hair fergus was at the other end of the room trying to break away from two maroons and a claybank girl the alcalde leads me up to anabela and presents me when she took the first look at my face she dropped her fan and nearly turned her chair over from the shock but i m used to that i sat down by her and began to talk when she heard me speak she jumped and her eyes got as big as alligator pears she couldn t strike a balance between the tones of my voice and face i carried but i kept on talking in the key of c which is the ladies key and presently she sat still in her chair and a dreamy look came into her eyes she was coming my way she knew of judson tate and what a big man he was and the big things he had done and that was in my favour but of course it was some shock to her to find out that i was not the pretty man that had been pointed out to her as the great judson and then i took the spanish language which is better than english for certain purposes and played on it like a harp of a thousand strings i ranged from the second g below the staff up to f sharp above it i set my voice to poetry art romance flowers and moonlight i repeated some of the verses that i had murmured to her in the dark at her window and i knew from a sudden soft sparkle in her eye that she recognized in my voice the tones of her midnight mysterious wooer anyhow i had fergus mcmahan going oh the vocal is the true art no doubt about that handsome is as handsome palavers that s the renovated proverb i took senorita anabela for a walk in the lemon grove while fergus disfiguring himself with an ugly frown was waltzing with the claybank girl before we returned i had permission to come to her window in the patio the next evening at midnight and talk some more oh it was easy enough in two weeks anabela was engaged to me and fergus was out he took it calm for a handsome man and told me he wasn t going to give in talk may be all right in its place judson he says to me although i ve never thought it worth cultivating but says he to expect mere words to back up successfully a face like yours in a lady s good graces is like expecting a man to make a square meal on the ringing of a dinner bell but i haven t begun on the story i was going to tell you yet one day i took a long ride in the hot sunshine and then took a bath in the cold waters of a lagoon on the edge of the town before i d cooled off that evening after dark i called at the alcalde s to see anabela i was calling regular every evening then and we were to be married in a month she was looking like a bulbul a gazelle and a tea rose and her eyes were as soft and bright as two quarts of cream skimmed off from the milky way she looked at my rugged features without any expression of fear or repugnance indeed i fancied that i saw a look of deep admiration and affection such as she had cast at fergus on the plaza i sat down and opened my mouth to tell anabela what she loved to hear that she was a trust monopolizing all the loveliness of earth i opened my mouth and instead of the usual vibrating words of love and compliment there came forth a faint wheeze such as a baby with croup might emit not a word not a syllable not an intelligible sound i had caught cold in my laryngeal regions when i took my injudicious bath for two hours i sat trying to entertain anabela she talked a certain amount but it was perfunctory and diluted the nearest approach i made to speech was to formulate a sound like a clam trying to sing a life on the ocean wave at low tide it seemed that anabela s eyes did not rest upon me as often as usual i had nothing with which to charm her ears we looked at pictures and she played the guitar occasionally very badly when i left her parting manner seemed cool or at least thoughtful this happened for five evenings consecutively on the sixth day she ran away with fergus mcmahan it was known that they fled in a sailing yacht bound for belize i was only eight hours behind them in a small steam launch belonging to the revenue department before i sailed i rushed into the botica of old manuel iquito a half breed indian druggist i could not speak but i pointed to my throat and made a sound like escaping steam he began to yawn in an hour according to the customs of the country i would have been waited on i reached across the counter seized him by the throat and pointed again to my own he yawned once more and thrust into my hand a small bottle containing a black liquid take one small spoonful every two hours says he i threw him a dollar and skinned for the steamer i steamed into the harbour at belize thirteen seconds behind the yacht that anabela and fergus were on they started for the shore in a dory just as my skiff was lowered over the side i tried to order my sailormen to row faster but the sounds died in my larynx before they came to the light then i thought of old iquito s medicine and i got out his bottle and took a swallow of it the two boats landed at the same moment i walked straight up to anabela and fergus her eyes rested upon me for an instant then she turned them full of feeling and confidence upon fergus i knew i could not speak but i was desperate in speech lay my only hope i could not stand beside fergus and challenge comparison in the way of beauty purely involuntarily my larynx and epiglottis attempted to reproduce the sounds that my mind was calling upon my vocal organs to send forth to my intense surprise and delight the words rolled forth beautifully clear resonant exquisitely modulated full of power expression and long repressed emotion senorita anabela says i may i speak with you aside for a moment you don t want details about that do you thanks the old eloquence had come back all right i led her under a cocoanut palm and put my old verbal spell on her again judson says she when you are talking to me i can hear nothing else i can see nothing else there is nothing and nobody else in the world for me well that s about all of the story anabela went back to oratama in the steamer with me i never heard what became of fergus i never saw him any more anabela is now mrs judson tate has my story bored you much no said i i am always interested in psychological studies a human heart and especially a woman s is a wonderful thing to contemplate it is said judson tate and so are the trachea and bronchial tubes of man and the larynx too did you ever make a study of the windpipe never said i but i have taken much pleasure in your story may i ask after mrs tate and inquire of her present health and whereabouts oh sure said judson tate we are living in bergen avenue jersey city the climate down in oratama didn t suit mrs t i don t suppose you ever dissected the arytenoid cartilages of the epiglottis did you why no said i i am no surgeon pardon me said judson tate but every man should know enough of anatomy and therapeutics to safeguard his own health a sudden cold may set up capillary bronchitis or inflammation of the pulmonary vesicles which may result in a serious affection of the vocal organs perhaps so said i with some impatience but that is neither here nor there speaking of the strange manifestations of the affection of women i yes yes interrupted judson tate they have peculiar ways but as i was going to tell you when i went back to oratama i found out from manuel iquito what was in that mixture he gave me for my lost voice i told you how quick it cured me he made that stuff from the chuchula plant now look here judson tate drew an oblong white pasteboard box from his pocket for any cough he said or cold or hoarseness or bronchial affection whatsoever i have here the greatest remedy in the world you see the formula printed on the box each tablet contains licorice grains balsam tolu grain oil of anise minim oil of tar minim oleo resin of cubebs minim fluid extract of chuchula minim i am in new york went on judson tate for the purpose of organizing a company to market the greatest remedy for throat affections ever discovered at present i am introducing the lozenges in a small way i have here a box containing four dozen which i am selling for the small sum of fifty cents if you are suffering i got up and went away without a word i walked slowly up to the little park near my hotel leaving judson tate alone with his conscience my feelings were lacerated he had poured gently upon me a story that i might have used there was a little of the breath of life in it and some of the synthetic atmosphere that passes when cunningly tinkered in the marts and at the last it had proven to be a commercial pill deftly coated with the sugar of fiction the worst of it was that i could not offer it for sale advertising departments and counting rooms look down upon me and it would never do for the literary therefore i sat upon a bench with other disappointed ones until my eyelids drooped i went to my room and as my custom is read for an hour stories in my favourite magazines this was to get my mind back to art again and as i read each story i threw the magazines sadly and hopelessly one by one upon the floor each author without one exception to bring balm to my heart wrote liltingly and sprightly a story of some particular make of motor car that seemed to control the sparking plug of his genius and when the last one was hurled from me i took heart if readers can swallow so many proprietary automobiles i said to myself they ought not to strain at one of tate s compound magic chuchula bronchial lozenges and so if you see this story in print you will understand that business is business and that if art gets very far ahead of commerce she will have to get up and hustle i may as well add to make a clean job of it that you can t buy the chuchula plant in the drug stores art and the bronco out of the wilderness had come a painter genius whose coronations alone are democratic had woven a chaplet of chaparral for the brow of lonny briscoe art whose divine expression flows impartially from the fingertips of a cowboy or a dilettante emperor had chosen for a medium the boy artist of the san saba the outcome seven feet by twelve of besmeared canvas stood gilt framed in the lobby of the capitol the legislature was in session the capital city of that great western state was enjoying the season of activity and profit that the congregation of the solons bestowed the boarding houses were corralling the easy dollars of the gamesome law makers the greatest state in the west an empire in area and resources had arisen and repudiated the old libel or barbarism lawbreaking and bloodshed order reigned within her borders life and property were as safe there sir as anywhere among the corrupt cities of the effete east pillow shams churches strawberry feasts and habeas corpus flourished with impunity might the tenderfoot ventilate his stovepipe or his theories of culture the arts and sciences received nurture and subsidy and therefore it behooved the legislature of this great state to make appropriation for the purchase of lonny briscoe s immortal painting rarely has the san saba country contributed to the spread of the fine arts its sons have excelled in the solider graces in the throw of the lariat the manipulation of the esteemed the intrepidity of the one card draw and the nocturnal stimulation of towns from undue lethargy but hitherto it had not been famed as a stronghold of aesthetics lonny briscoe s brush had removed that disability here among the limestone rocks the succulent cactus and the drought parched grass of that arid valley had been born the boy artist why he came to woo art is beyond postulation beyond doubt some spore of the afflatus must have sprung up within him in spite of the desert soil of san saba the tricksy spirit of creation must have incited him to attempted expression and then have sat hilarious among the white hot sands of the valley watching its mischievous work for lonny s picture viewed as a thing of art was something to have driven away dull care from the bosoms of the critics the painting one might almost say panorama was designed to portray a typical western scene interest culminating in a central animal figure that of a stampeding steer life size wild eyed fiery breaking away in a mad rush from the herd that close ridden by a typical cowpuncher occupied a position somewhat in the right background of the picture the landscape presented fitting and faithful accessories chaparral mesquit and pear were distributed in just proportions a spanish dagger plant with its waxen blossoms in a creamy aggregation as large as a water bucket contributed floral beauty and variety the distance was undulating prairie bisected by stretches of the intermittent streams peculiar to the region lined with the rich green of live oak and water elm a richly mottled rattlesnake lay coiled beneath a pale green clump of prickly pear in the foreground a third of the canvas was ultramarine and lake white the typical western sky and the flying clouds rainless and feathery between two plastered pillars in the commodious hallway near the door of the chamber of representatives stood the painting citizens and lawmakers passed there by twos and groups and sometimes crowds to gaze upon it many perhaps a majority of them had lived the prairie life and recalled easily the familiar scene old cattlemen stood reminiscent and candidly pleased chatting with brothers of former camps and trails of the days it brought back to mind art critics were few in the town and there was heard none of that jargon of colour perspective and feeling such as the east loves to use as a curb and a rod to the pretensions of the artist twas a great picture most of them agreed admiring the gilt frame larger than any they had ever seen senator kinney was the picture s champion and sponsor it was he who so often stepped forward and asserted with the voice of a bronco buster that it would be a lasting blot sir upon the name of this great state if it should decline to recognize in a proper manner the genius that had so brilliantly transferred to imperishable canvas a scene so typical of the great sources of our state s wealth and prosperity land and er live stock senator kinney represented a section of the state in the extreme west miles from the san saba country but the true lover of art is not limited by metes and bounds nor was senator mullens representing the san saba country lukewarm in his belief that the state should purchase the painting of his constituent he was advised that the san saba country was unanimous in its admiration of the great painting by one of its own denizens hundreds of connoisseurs had straddled their broncos and ridden miles to view it before its removal to the capital senator mullens desired reelection and he knew the importance of the san saba vote he also knew that with the help of senator kinney who was a power in the legislature the thing could be put through now senator kinney had an irrigation bill that he wanted passed for the benefit of his own section and he knew senator mullens could render him valuable aid and information the san saba country already enjoying the benefits of similar legislation with these interests happily dovetailed wonder at the sudden interest in art at the state capital must necessarily be small few artists have uncovered their first picture to the world under happier auspices than did lonny briscoe senators kinney and mullens came to an understanding in the matter of irrigation and art while partaking of long drinks in the cafe of the empire hotel h m said senator kinney i don t know i m no art critic but it seems to me the thing won t work it looks like the worst kind of a chromo to me i don t want to cast any reflections upon the artistic talent of your constituent senator but i myself wouldn t give six bits for the picture without the frame how are you going to cram a thing like that down the throat of a legislature that kicks about a little item in the expense bill of six hundred and eighty one dollars for rubber erasers for only one term it s wasting time i d like to help you mullens but they d laugh us out of the senate chamber if we were to try it but you don t get the point said senator mullens in his deliberate tones tapping kinney s glass with his long forefinger i have my own doubts as to what the picture is intended to represent a bullfight or a japanese allegory but i want this legislature to make an appropriation to purchase of course the subject of the picture should have been in the state historical line but it s too late to have the paint scraped off and changed the state won t miss the money and the picture can be stowed away in a lumber room where it won t annoy any one now here s the point to work on leaving art to look after itself the chap that painted the picture is the grandson of lucien briscoe say it again said kinney leaning his head thoughtfully of the old original lucien briscoe of him the man who you know the man who carved the state out of the wilderness the man who settled the indians the man who cleaned out the horse thieves the man who refused the crown the state s favourite son do you see the point now wrap up the picture said kinney it s as good as sold why didn t you say that at first instead of philandering along about art i ll resign my seat in the senate and go back to chain carrying for the county surveyor the day i can t make this state buy a picture calcimined by a grandson of lucien briscoe did you ever hear of a special appropriation for the purchase of a home for the daughter of one eyed smothers well that went through like a motion to adjourn and old one eyed never killed half as many indians as briscoe did about what figure had you and the calciminer agreed upon to sandbag the treasury for i thought said mullens that maybe five hundred five hundred interrupted kinney as he hammered on his glass for a lead pencil and looked around for a waiter only five hundred for a red steer on the hoof delivered by a grandson of lucien briscoe where s your state pride man two thousand is what it ll be you ll introduce the bill and i ll get up on the floor of the senate and wave the scalp of every indian old lucien ever murdered let s see there was something else proud and foolish he did wasn t there oh yes he declined all emoluments and benefits he was entitled to refused his head right and veteran donation certificates could have been governor but wouldn t declined a pension now s the state s chance to pay up it ll have to take the picture but then it deserves some punishment for keeping the briscoe family waiting so long we ll bring this thing up about the middle of the month after the tax bill is settled now mullens you send over as soon as you can and get me the figures on the cost of those irrigation ditches and the statistics about the increased production per acre i m going to need you when that bill of mine comes up i reckon we ll be able to pull along pretty well together this session and maybe others to come eh senator thus did fortune elect to smile upon the boy artist of the san saba fate had already done her share when she arranged his atoms in the cosmogony of creation as the grandson of lucien briscoe the original briscoe had been a pioneer both as to territorial occupation and in certain acts prompted by a great and simple heart he had been one of the first settlers and crusaders against the wild forces of nature the savage and the shallow politician his name and memory were revered equally with any upon the list comprising houston boone crockett clark and green he had lived simply independently and unvexed by ambition even a less shrewd man than senator kinney could have prophesied that his state would hasten to honour and reward his grandson come out of the chaparral at even so late a day and so before the great picture by the door of the chamber of representatives at frequent times for many days could be found the breezy robust form of senator kinney and be heard his clarion voice reciting the past deeds of lucien briscoe in connection with the handiwork of his grandson senator mullens s work was more subdued in sight and sound but directed along identical lines then as the day for the introduction of the bill for appropriation draws nigh up from the san saba country rides lonny briscoe and a loyal lobby of cowpunchers bronco back to boost the cause of art and glorify the name of friendship for lonny is one of them a knight of stirrup and chaparreras as handy with the lariat and as he is with brush and palette on a march afternoon the lobby dashed with a whoop into town the cowpunchers had adjusted their garb suitably from that prescribed for the range to the more conventional requirements of town they had conceded their leather chaparreras and transferred their six shooters and belts from their persons to the horns of their saddles among them rode lonny a youth of twenty three brown solemn faced ingenuous bowlegged reticent bestriding hot tamales the most sagacious cow pony west of the mississippi senator mullens had informed him of the bright prospects of the situation had even mentioned so great was his confidence in the capable kinney the price that the state would in all likelihood pay it seemed to lonny that fame and fortune were in his hands certainly a spark of the divine fire was in the little brown centaur s breast for he was counting the two thousand dollars as but a means to future development of his talent some day he would paint a picture even greater than this one say twelve feet by twenty full of scope and atmosphere and action during the three days that yet intervened before the coming of the date fixed for the introduction of the bill the centaur lobby did valiant service coatless spurred weather tanned full of enthusiasm expressed in bizarre terms they loafed in front of the painting with tireless zeal reasoning not unshrewdly they estimated that their comments upon its fidelity to nature would be received as expert evidence loudly they praised the skill of the painter whenever there were ears near to which such evidence might be profitably addressed lem perry the leader of the claque had a somewhat set speech being uninventive in the construction of new phrases look at that two year old now he would say waving a cinnamon brown hand toward the salient point of the picture why dang my hide the critter s alive i can jest hear him lumpety lump a cuttin away from the herd pretendin he s skeered he s a mean scamp that there steer look at his eyes a wailin and his tail a wavin he s true and nat ral to life he s jest hankerin fur a cow pony to round him up and send him scootin back to the bunch dang my hide jest look at that tail of his n a wavin never knowed a steer to wave his tail any other way dang my hide ef i did jud shelby while admitting the excellence of the steer resolutely confined himself to open admiration of the landscape to the end that the entire picture receive its meed of praise that piece of range he declared is a dead ringer for dead hoss valley same grass same lay of land same old whipperwill creek skallyhootin in and out of them motts of timber them buzzards on the left is circlin round over

and come across this picture why he d just light off n his bronco and hunt a place to camp skinny rogers wedded to comedy conceived a complimentary little piece of acting that never failed to make an impression edging quite near to the picture he would suddenly at favourable moments emit a piercing and awful yi yi leap high and away coming down with a great stamp of heels and whirring of rowels upon the stone flagged floor jeeming cristopher so ran his lines thought that rattler was a gin u ine one ding baste my skin if i didn t seemed to me i heard him rattle look at the blamed unconverted insect a layin under that pear little more and somebody would a been snake bit with these artful dodges contributed by lonney s faithful coterie with the sonorous kinney perpetually sounding the picture s merits and with the solvent prestige of the pioneer briscoe covering it like a precious varnish it seemed that the san saba country could not fail to add a reputation as an art centre to its well known superiority in steer roping contests and achievements with the precarious busted flush thus was created for the picture an atmosphere due rather to externals than to the artist s brush but through it the people seemed to gaze with more of admiration there was a magic in the name of briscoe that counted high against faulty technique and crude colouring the old indian fighter and wolf slayer would have smiled grimly in his happy hunting grounds had he known that his dilettante ghost was thus figuring as an art patron two generations after his uninspired existence came the day when the senate was expected to pass the bill of senator mullens appropriating two thousand dollars for the purchase of the picture the gallery of the senate chamber was early preempted by lonny and the san saba lobby in the front row of chairs they sat wild haired self conscious jingling creaking and rattling subdued by the majesty of the council hall the bill was introduced went to the second reading and then senator mullens spoke for it dryly tediously and at length senator kinney then arose and the welkin seized the bellrope preparatory to ringing oratory was at that time a living thing the world had not quite time to measure its questions by geometry and the multiplication table it was the day of the silver tongue the sweeping gesture the decorative apostrophe the moving peroration the senator spoke the san saba contingent sat breathing hard in the gallery its disordered hair hanging down to its eyes its sixteen ounce hats shifted restlessly from knee to knee below the distinguished senators either lounged at their desks with the abandon of proven statesmanship or maintained correct attitudes indicative of a first term senator kinney spoke for an hour history was his theme history mitigated by patriotism and sentiment he referred casually to the picture in the outer hall it was unnecessary he said to dilate upon its merits the senators had seen for themselves the painter of the picture was the grandson of lucien briscoe then came the word pictures of briscoe s life set forth in thrilling colours his rude and venturesome life his simple minded love for the commonwealth he helped to upbuild his contempt for rewards and praise his extreme and sturdy independence and the great services he had rendered the state the subject of the oration was lucien briscoe the painting stood in the background serving simply as a means now happily brought forward through which the state might bestow a tardy recompense upon the descendent of its favourite son frequent enthusiastic applause from the senators testified to the well reception of the sentiment the bill passed without an opening vote to morrow it would be taken up by the house already was it fixed to glide through that body on rubber tires blandford grayson and plummer all wheel horses and orators and provided with plentiful memoranda concerning the deeds of pioneer briscoe had agreed to furnish the motive power the san saba lobby and its protege stumbled awkwardly down the stairs and out into the capitol yard then they herded closely and gave one yell of triumph but one of them buck kneed simmers it was hit the key with the thoughtful remark she cut the mustard he said all right i reckon they re goin to buy lon s steer i ain t right much on the parlyment ry but i gather that s what the signs added up but she seems to me lonny the argyment ran principal to grandfather instead of paint it s reasonable calculatin that you want to be glad you got the briscoe brand on you my son that remarked clinched in lonny s mind an unpleasant vague suspicion to the same effect his reticence increased and he gathered grass from the ground chewing it pensively the picture as a picture had been humiliatingly absent from the senator s arguments the painter had been held up as a grandson pure and simple while this was gratifying on certain lines it made art look little and slab sided the boy artist was thinking the hotel lonny stopped at was near the capitol it was near to the one o clock dinner hour when the appropriation had been passed by the senate the hotel clerk told lonny that a famous artist from new york had arrived in town that day and was in the hotel he was on his way westward to new mexico to study the effect of sunlight upon the ancient walls of the zunis modern stones reflect light those ancient building materials absorb it the artist wanted this effect in a picture he was painting and was traveling two thousand miles to get it lonny sought this man out after dinner and told his story the artist was an unhealthy man kept alive by genius and indifference to life he went with lonny to the capitol and stood there before the picture the artist pulled his beard and looked unhappy should like to have your sentiments said lonny just as they run out of the pen it s the way they ll come said the painter man i took three different kinds of medicine before dinner by the tablespoonful the taste still lingers i am primed for telling the truth you want to know if the picture is or if it isn t right said lonny is it wool or cotton should i paint some more or cut it out and ride herd a plenty i heard a rumour during pie said the artist that the state is about to pay you two thousand dollars for this picture it s passed the senate said lonny and the house rounds it up to morrow that s lucky said the pale man do you carry a rabbit s foot no said lonny but it seems i had a grandfather he s considerable mixed up in the colour scheme it took me a year to paint that picture is she entirely awful or not some says now that the steer s tail ain t badly drawed they think it s proportioned nice tell me the artist glanced at lonny s wiry figure and nut brown skin something stirred him to a passing irritation for art s sake son he said fractiously don t spend any more money for paint it isn t a picture at all it s a gun you hold up the state with it if you like and get your two thousand but don t get in front of any more canvas live under it buy a couple of hundred ponies with the money i m told they re that cheap and ride ride ride fill your lungs and eat and sleep and be happy no more pictures you look healthy that s genius cultivate it he looked at his watch twenty minutes to three four capsules and one tablet at three that s all you wanted to know isn t it at three o clock the cowpunchers rode up for lonny bringing hot tamales saddled traditions must be observed to celebrate the passage of the bill by the senate the gang must ride wildly through the town creating uproar and excitement liquor must be partaken of the suburbs shot up and the glory of the san saba country vociferously proclaimed a part of the programme had been carried out in the saloons on the way up lonny mounted hot tamales the accomplished little beast prancing with fire and intelligence he was glad to feel lonny s bowlegged grip against his ribs again lonny was his friend and he was willing to do things for him come on boys said lonny urging hot tomales into a gallop with his knees with a whoop the inspired lobby tore after him through the dust lonny led his cohorts straight for the capitol with a wild yell the gang endorsed his now evident intention of riding into it hooray for san saba up the six broad limestone steps clattered the broncos of the cowpunchers into the resounding hallway they pattered scattering in dismay those passing on foot lonny in the lead shoved hot tamales direct for the great picture at that hour a downpouring soft light from the second story windows bathed the big canvas against the darker background of the hall the painting stood out with valuable effect in spite of the defects of the art you could almost fancy that you gazed out upon a landscape you might well flinch a step from the convincing figure of the life size steer stampeding across the grass perhaps it seemed thus to hot tamales the scene was in his line perhaps he only obeyed the will of his rider his ears pricked up he snorted lonny leaned forward in the saddle and elevated his elbows wing like thus signals the cowpuncher to his steed to launch himself full speed ahead did hot tamales fancy he saw a steer red and cavorting that should be headed off and driven back to the herd there was a fierce clatter of hoofs a rush a gathering of steely flank muscles a leap to the jerk of the bridle rein and hot tamales with lonny bending low in the saddle to dodge the top of the frame ripped through the great canvas like a shell from a mortar leaving the cloth hanging in ragged sheds about a monstrous hole quickly lonny pulled up his pony and rounded the pillars spectators came running too astounded to add speech to the commotion the sergeant at arms of the house came forth frowned looked ominous and then grinned many of the legislators crowded out to observe the tumult lonny s cowpunchers were stricken to silent horror by his mad deed senator kinney happened to be among the earliest to emerge before he could speak lonny leaned in his saddle as hot tamales pranced pointed his quirt at the senator and said calmly that was a fine speech you made to day mister but you might as well let up on that propriation business i ain t askin the state to give me nothin i thought i had a picture to sell to it but it wasn t one you said a heap of things about grandfather briscoe that makes me kind of proud i m his grandson well the briscoes ain t takin presents from the state yet anybody can have the frame that wants it hit her up boys away scuttled the san saba delegation out of the hall down the steps along the dusty street halfway to the san saba country they camped that night at bedtime lonny stole away from the campfire and sought hot tamales placidly eating grass at the end of his stake rope lonny hung upon his neck and his art aspirations went forth forever in one long regretful sigh but as he thus made renunciation his breath formed a word or two you was the only one tamales what seen anything in it it did look like a steer didn t it old hoss phoebe you are a man of many novel adventures and varied enterprises i said to captain patricio malone do you believe that the possible element of good luck or bad luck if there is such a thing as luck has influenced your career or persisted for or against you to such an extent that you were forced to attribute results to the operation of the aforesaid good luck or bad luck this question of almost the dull insolence of legal phraseology was put while we sat in rousselin s little red tiled cafe near congo square in new orleans brown faced white hatted finger ringed captains of adventure came often to rousselin s for the cognac they came from sea and land and were chary of relating the things they had seen not because they were more wonderful than the fantasies of the ananiases of print but because they were so different and i was a perpetual wedding guest always striving to cast my buttonhole over the finger of one of these mariners of fortune this captain malone was a hiberno iberian creole who had gone to and fro in the earth and walked up and down in it he looked like any other well dressed man of thirty five whom you might meet except that he was hopelessly weather tanned and wore on his chain an ancient ivory and gold peruvian charm against evil which has nothing at all to do with this story my answer to your question said the captain smiling will be to tell you the story of bad luck kearny that is if you don t mind hearing it my reply was to pound on the table for rousselin strolling along tchoupitoulas street one night began captain malone i noticed without especially taxing my interest a small man walking rapidly toward me he stepped upon a wooden cellar door crashed through it and disappeared i rescued him from a heap of soft coal below he dusted himself briskly swearing fluently in a mechanical tone as an underpaid actor recites the gypsy s curse gratitude and the dust in his throat seemed to call for fluids to clear them away his desire for liquidation was expressed so heartily that i went with him to a cafe down the street where we had some vile vermouth and bitters looking across that little table i had my first clear sight of francis kearny he was about five feet seven but as tough as a cypress knee his hair was darkest red his mouth such a mere slit that you wondered how the flood of his words came rushing from it his eyes were the brightest and lightest blue and the hopefulest that i ever saw he gave the double impression that he was at bay and that you had better not crowd him further just in from a gold hunting expedition on the coast of costa rica he explained second mate of a banana steamer told me the natives were panning out enough from the beach sands to buy all the rum red calico and parlour melodeons in the world the day i got there a syndicate named incorporated jones gets a government concession to all minerals from a given point for a next choice i take coast fever and count green and blue lizards for six weeks in a grass hut i had to be notified when i was well for the reptiles were actually there then i shipped back as third cook on a norwegian tramp that blew up her boiler two miles below quarantine i was due to bust through that cellar door here to night so i hurried the rest of the way up the river roustabouting on a lower coast packet that made up a landing for every fisherman that wanted a plug of tobacco and now i m here for what comes next and it ll be along it ll be along said this queer mr kearny it ll be along on the beams of my bright but not very particular star from the first the personality of kearny charmed me i saw in him the bold heart the restless nature and the valiant front against the buffets of fate that make his countrymen such valuable comrades in risk and adventure and just then i was wanting such men moored at a fruit company s pier i had a ton steamer ready to sail the next day with a cargo of sugar lumber and corrugated iron for a port in well let us call the country esperando it has not been long ago and the name of patricio malone is still spoken there when its unsettled politics are discussed beneath the sugar and iron were packed a thousand winchester rifles in aguas frias the capital don rafael valdevia minister of war esperando s greatest hearted and most able patriot awaited my coming no doubt you have heard with a smile of the insignificant wars and uprisings in those little tropic republics they make but a faint clamour against the din of great nations battles but down there under all the ridiculous uniforms and petty diplomacy and senseless countermarching and intrigue are to be found statesmen and patriots don rafael valdevia was one his great ambition was to raise esperando into peace and honest prosperity and the respect of the serious nations so he waited for my rifles in aguas frias but one would think i am trying to win a recruit in you no it was francis kearny i wanted and so i told him speaking long over our execrable vermouth breathing the stifling odour from garlic and tarpaulins which as you know is the distinctive flavour of cafes in the lower slant of our city i spoke of the tyrant president cruz and the burdens that his green and insolent cruelty laid upon the people and at that kearny s tears flowed and then i dried them with a picture of the fat rewards that would be ours when the oppressor should be overthrown and the wise and generous valdevia in his seat then kearny leaped to his feet and wrung my hand with the strength of a roustabout he was mine he said till the last minion of the hated despot was hurled from the highest peaks of the cordilleras into the sea i paid the score and we went out near the door kearny s elbow overturned an upright glass showcase smashing it into little bits i paid the storekeeper the price he asked come to my hotel for the night i said to kearny we sail to morrow at noon he agreed but on the sidewalk he fell to cursing again in the dull monotonous way that he had done when i pulled him out of the coal cellar captain said he before we go any further it s no more than fair to tell you that i m known from baffin s bay to terra del fuego as bad luck kearny and i m it everything i get into goes up in the air except a balloon every bet i ever made i lost except when i coppered it every boat i ever sailed on sank except the submarines everything i was ever interested in went to pieces except a patent bombshell that i invented everything i ever took hold of and tried to run i ran into the ground except when i tried to plough and that s why they call me bad luck kearny i thought i d tell you bad luck said i or what goes by that name may now and then tangle the affairs of any man but if it persists beyond the estimate of what we may call the averages there must be a cause for it there is said kearny emphatically and when we walk another square i will show it to you surprised i kept by his side until we came to canal street and out into the middle of its great width kearny seized me by an arm and pointed a tragic forefinger at a rather brilliant star that shone steadily about thirty degrees above the horizon that s saturn said he the star that presides over bad luck and evil and disappointment and nothing doing and trouble i was born under that star every move i make up bobs saturn and blocks it he s the hoodoo planet of the heavens they say he s miles in diameter and no solider of body than split pea soup and he s got as many disreputable and malignant rings as chicago now what kind of a star is that to be born under i asked kearny where he had obtained all this astonishing knowledge from azrath the great astrologer of cleveland ohio said he that man looked at a glass ball and told me my name before i d taken a chair he prophesied the date of my birth and death before i d said a word and then he cast my horoscope and the sidereal system socked me in the solar plexus it was bad luck for francis kearny from a to izard and for his friends that were implicated with him for that i gave up ten dollars this azrath was sorry but he respected his profession too much to read the heavens wrong for any man it was night time and he took me out on a balcony and gave me a free view of the sky and he showed me which saturn was and how to find it in different balconies and longitudes but saturn wasn t all he was only the man higher up he furnishes so much bad luck that they allow him a gang of deputy sparklers to help hand it out they re circulating and revolving and hanging around the main supply all the time each one throwing the hoodoo on his own particular district you see that ugly little red star about eight inches above and to the right of saturn kearny asked me well that s her that s phoebe she s got me in charge by the day of your birth says azrath to me your life is subjected to the influence of saturn by the hour and minute of it you must dwell under the sway and direct authority of phoebe the ninth satellite so said this azrath kearny shook his fist violently skyward curse her she s done her work well said he ever since i was astrologized bad luck has followed me like my shadow as i told you and for many years before now captain i ve told you my handicap as a man should if you re afraid this evil star of mine might cripple your scheme leave me out of it i reassured kearny as well as i could i told him that for the time we would banish both astrology and astronomy from our heads the manifest valour and enthusiasm of the man drew me let us see what a little courage and diligence will do against bad luck i said we will sail to morrow for esperando fifty miles down the mississippi our steamer broke her rudder we sent for a tug to tow us back and lost three days when we struck the blue waters of the gulf all the storm clouds of the atlantic seemed to have concentrated above us we thought surely to sweeten those leaping waves with our sugar and to stack our arms and lumber on the floor of the mexican gulf kearny did not seek to cast off one iota of the burden of our danger from the shoulders of his fatal horoscope he weathered every storm on deck smoking a black pipe to keep which alight rain and sea water seemed but as oil and he shook his fist at the black clouds behind which his baleful star winked its unseen eye when the skies cleared one evening he reviled his malignant guardian with grim humour on watch aren t you you red headed vixen out making it hot for little francis kearny and his friends according to hoyle twinkle twinkle little devil you re a lady aren t you dogging a man with your bad luck just because he happened to be born while your boss was floorwalker get busy and sink the ship you one eyed banshee phoebe h m sounds as mild as a milkmaid you can t judge a woman by her name why couldn t i have had a man star i can t make the remarks to phoebe that i could to a man oh phoebe you be blasted for eight days gales and squalls and waterspouts beat us from our course five days only should have landed us in esperando our jonah swallowed the bad credit of it with appealing frankness but that scarcely lessened the hardships our cause was made to suffer at last one afternoon we steamed into the calm estuary of the little rio escondido three miles up this we crept feeling for the shallow channel between the low banks that were crowded to the edge with gigantic trees and riotous vegetation then our whistle gave a little toot and in five minutes we heard a shout and carlos my brave carlos quintana crashed through the tangled vines waving his cap madly for joy a hundred yards away was his camp where three hundred chosen patriots of esperando were awaiting our coming for a month carlos had been drilling them there in the tactics of war and filling them with the spirit of revolution and liberty my captain compadre mio shouted carlos while yet my boat was being lowered you should see them in the drill by companies in the column wheel in the march by fours they are superb also in the manual of arms but alas performed only with sticks of bamboo the guns capitan say that you have brought the guns a thousand winchesters carlos i called to him and two gatlings valgame dios he cried throwing his cap in the air we shall sweep the world at that moment kearny tumbled from the steamer s side into the river he could not swim so the crew threw him a rope and drew him back aboard i caught his eye and his look of pathetic but still bright and undaunted consciousness of his guilty luck i told myself that although he might be a man to shun he was also one to be admired i gave orders to the sailing master that the arms ammunition and provisions were to be landed at once that was easy in the steamer s boats except for the two gatling guns for their transportation ashore we carried a stout flatboat brought for the purpose in the steamer s hold in the meantime i walked with carlos to the camp and made the soldiers a little speech in spanish which they received with enthusiasm and then i had some wine and a cigarette in carlos s tent later we walked back to the river to see how the unloading was being conducted the small arms and provisions were already ashore and the petty officers and squads of men conveying them to camp one gatling had been safely landed the other was just being hoisted over the side of the vessel as we arrived i noticed kearny darting about on board seeming to have the ambition of ten men and doing the work of five i think his zeal bubbled over when he saw carlos and me a rope s end was swinging loose from some part of the tackle kearny leaped impetuously and caught it there was a crackle and a hiss and a smoke of scorching hemp and the gatling dropped straight as a plummet through the bottom of the flatboat and buried itself in twenty feet of water and five feet of river mud i turned my back on the scene i heard carlos s loud cries as if from some extreme grief too poignant for words i heard the complaining murmur of the crew and the maledictions of torres the sailing master i could not bear to look by night some degree of order had been restored in camp military rules were not drawn strictly and the men were grouped about the fires of their several messes playing games of chance singing their native songs or discussing with voluble animation the contingencies of our march upon the capital to my tent which had been pitched for me close to that of my chief lieutenant came kearny indomitable smiling bright eyed bearing no traces of the buffets of his evil star rather was his aspect that of a heroic martyr whose tribulations were so high sourced and glorious that he even took a splendour and a prestige from them well captain said he i guess you realize that bad luck kearny is still on deck it was a shame now about that gun she only needed to be slewed two inches to clear the rail and that s why i grabbed that rope s end who d have thought that a sailor even a sicilian lubber on a banana coaster would have fastened a line in a bow knot don t think i m trying to dodge the responsibility captain it s my luck there are men kearny said i gravely who pass through life blaming upon luck and chance the mistakes that result from their own faults and incompetency i do not say that you are such a man but if all your mishaps are traceable to that tiny star the sooner we endow our colleges with chairs of moral astronomy the better it isn t the size of the star that counts said kearny it s the quality just the way it is with women that s why they give the biggest planets masculine names and the little stars feminine ones to even things up when it comes to getting their work in suppose they had called my star agamemnon or bill mccarty or something like that instead of phoebe every time one of those old boys touched their calamity button and sent me down one of their wireless pieces of bad luck i could talk back and tell em what i thought of em in suitable terms but you can t address such remarks to a phoebe it pleases you to make a joke of it kearny said i without smiling but it is no joke to me to think of my gatling mired in the river ooze as to that said kearny abandoning his light mood at once i have already done what i could i have had some experience in hoisting stone in quarries torres and i have already spliced three hawsers and stretched them from the steamer s stern to a tree on shore we will rig a tackle and have the gun on terra firma before noon to morrow one could not remain long at outs with bad luck kearny once more said i to him we will waive this question of luck have you ever had experience in drilling raw troops i was first sergeant and drill master said kearny in the chilean army for one year and captain of artillery for another what became of your command i asked shot down to a man said kearny during the revolutions against balmaceda somehow the misfortunes of the evil starred one seemed to turn to me their comedy side i lay back upon my goat s hide cot and laughed until the woods echoed kearny grinned i told you how it was he said to morrow i said i shall detail one hundred men under your command for manual of arms drill and company evolutions you rank as lieutenant now for god s sake kearny i urged him try to combat this superstition if it is one bad luck may be like any other visitor preferring to stop where it is expected get your mind off stars look upon esperando as your planet of good fortune i thank you captain said kearny quietly i will try to make it the best handicap i ever ran by noon the next day the submerged gatling was rescued as kearny had promised then carlos and manuel ortiz and kearny my lieutenants distributed winchesters among the troops and put them through an incessant rifle drill we fired no shots blank or solid for of all coasts esperando is the stillest and we had no desire to sound any warnings in the ear of that corrupt government until they should carry with them the message of liberty and the downfall of oppression in the afternoon came a mule rider bearing a written message to me from don rafael valdevia in the capital aguas frias whenever that man s name comes to my lips words of tribute to his greatness his noble simplicity and his conspicuous genius follow irrepressibly he was a traveller a student of peoples and governments a master of sciences a poet an orator a leader a soldier a critic of the world s campaigns and the idol of the people in esperando i had been honoured by his friendship for years it was i who first turned his mind to the thought that he should leave for his monument a new esperando a country freed from the rule of unscrupulous tyrants and a people made happy and prosperous by wise and impartial legislation when he had consented he threw himself into the cause with the undivided zeal with which he endowed all of his acts the coffers of his great fortune were opened to those of us to whom were entrusted the secret moves of the game his popularity was already so great that he had practically forced president cruz to offer him the portfolio of minister of war the time don rafael said in his letter was ripe success he prophesied was certain the people were beginning to clamour publicly against cruz s misrule bands of citizens in the capital were even going about of nights hurling stones at public buildings and expressing their dissatisfaction a bronze statue of president cruz in the botanical gardens had been lassoed about the neck and overthrown it only remained for me to arrive with my force and my thousand rifles and for himself to come forward and proclaim himself the people s saviour to overthrow cruz in a single day there would be but a half hearted resistance from the six hundred government troops stationed in the capital th country was ours he presumed that by this time my steamer had arrived at quintana s camp he proposed the eighteenth of july for the attack that would give us six days in which to strike camp and march to aguas frias in the meantime don rafael remained my good friend and compadre en la cause de la libertad on the morning of the th we began our march toward the sea following range of mountains over the sixty mile trail to the capital our small arms and provisions were laden on pack mules twenty men harnessed to each gatling gun rolled them smoothly along the flat alluvial lowlands our troops well shod and well fed moved with alacrity and heartiness i and my three lieutenants were mounted on the tough mountain ponies of the country a mile out of camp one of the pack mules becoming stubborn broke away from the train and plunged from the path into the thicket the alert kearny spurred quickly after it and intercepted its flight rising in his stirrups he released one foot and bestowed upon the mutinous animal a hearty kick the mule tottered and fell with a crash broadside upon the ground as we gathered around it it walled its great eyes almost humanly towards kearny and expired that was bad but worse to our minds was the concomitant disaster part of the mule s burden had been one hundred pounds of the finest coffee to be had in the tropics the bag burst and spilled the priceless brown mass of the ground berries among the dense vines and weeds of the swampy land mala suerte when you take away from an esperandan his coffee you abstract his patriotism and per cent of his value as a soldier the men began to rake up the precious stuff but i beckoned kearny back along the trail where they would not hear the limit had been reached i took from my pocket a wallet of money and drew out some bills mr kearny said i here are some funds belonging to don rafael valdevia which i am expending in his cause i know of no better service it can buy for him that this here is one hundred dollars luck or no luck we part company here star or no star calamity seems to travel by your side you will return to the steamer she touches at amotapa to discharge her lumber and iron and then puts back to new orleans hand this note to the sailing master who will give you passage i wrote on a leaf torn from my book and placed it and the money in kearny s hand good bye i said extending my own it is not that i am displeased with you but there is no place in this expedition for let us say the senorita phoebe i said this with a smile trying to smooth the thing for him may you have better luck companero kearny took the money and the paper it was just a little touch said he just a little lift with the toe of my boot but what s the odds that blamed mule would have died if i had only dusted his ribs with a powder puff it was my luck well captain i would have liked to be in that little fight with you over in aguas frias success to the cause adios he turned around and set off down the trail without looking back the unfortunate mule s pack saddle was transferred to kearny s pony and we again took up the march four days we journeyed over the foot hills and mountains fording icy torrents winding around the crumbling brows of ragged peaks creeping along rocky flanges that overlooked awful precipices crawling breathlessly over tottering bridges that crossed bottomless chasms on the evening of the seventeenth we camped by a little stream on the bare hills five miles from aguas frias at daybreak we were to take up the march again at midnight i was standing outside my tent inhaling the fresh cold air the stars were shining bright in the cloudless sky giving the heavens their proper aspect of illimitable depth and distance when viewed from the vague darkness of the blotted earth almost at its zenith was the planet saturn and with a half smile i observed the sinister red sparkle of his malignant attendant the demon star of kearny s ill luck and then my thoughts strayed across the hills to the scene of our coming triumph where the heroic and noble don rafael awaited our coming to set a new and shining star in the firmament of nations i heard a slight rustling in the deep grass to my right i turned and saw kearny coming toward me he was ragged and dew drenched and limping his hat and one boot were gone about one foot he had tied some makeshift of cloth and grass but his manner as he approached was that of a man who knows his own virtues well enough to be superior to rebuffs well sir i said staring at him coldly if there is anything in persistence i see no reason why you should not succeed in wrecking and ruining us yet i kept half a day s journey behind said kearny fishing out a stone from the covering of his lame foot so the bad luck wouldn t touch you i couldn t help it captain i wanted to be in on this game it was a pretty tough trip especially in the department of the commissary in the low grounds there were always bananas and oranges higher up it was worse but your men left a good deal of goat meat hanging on the bushes in the camps here s your hundred dollars you re nearly there now captain let me in on the scrapping to morrow not for a hundred times a hundred would i have the tiniest thing go wrong with my plans now i said whether caused by evil planets or the blunders of mere man but yonder is aguas frias five miles away and a clear road i am of the mind to defy saturn and all his satellites to spoil our success now at any rate i will not turn away to night as weary a traveller and as good a soldier as you are lieutenant kearny manuel ortiz s tent is there by the brightest fire rout him out and tell him to supply you with food and blankets and clothes we march again at daybreak kearny thanked me briefly but feelingly and moved away he had gone scarcely a dozen steps when a sudden flash of bright light illumined the surrounding hills a sinister growing hissing sound like escaping steam filled my ears then followed a roar as of distant thunder which grew louder every instant this terrifying noise culminated in a tremendous explosion which seemed to rock the hills as an earthquake would the illumination waxed to a glare so fierce that i clapped my hands over my eyes to save them i thought the end of the world had come i could think of no natural phenomenon that would explain it my wits were staggering the deafening explosion trailed off into the rumbling roar that had preceded it and through this i heard the frightened shouts of my troops as they stumbled from their resting places and rushed wildly about also i heard the harsh tones of kearny s voice crying they ll blame it on me of course and what the devil it is it s not francis kearny that can give you an answer i opened my eyes the hills were still there dark and solid it had not been then a volcano or an earthquake i looked up at the sky and saw a comet like trail crossing the zenith and extending westward a fiery trail waning fainter and narrower each moment a meteor i called aloud a meteor has fallen there is no danger and then all other sounds were drowned by a great shout from kearny s throat he had raised both hands above his head and was standing tiptoe phoebe s gone he cried with all his lungs she s busted and gone to hell look captain the little red headed hoodoo has blown herself to smithereens she found kearny too tough to handle and she puffed up with spite and meanness till her boiler blew up it s be bad luck kearny no more oh let us be joyful humpty dumpty sat on a wall humpty busted and that ll be all i looked up wondering and picked out saturn in his place but the small red twinkling luminary in his vicinity which kearny had pointed out to me as his evil star had vanished i had seen it there but half an hour before there was no doubt that one of those awful and mysterious spasms of nature had hurled it from the heavens i clapped kearny on the shoulder little man said i let this clear the way for you it appears that astrology has failed to subdue you your horoscope must be cast anew with pluck and loyalty for controlling stars i play you to win now get to your tent and sleep daybreak is the word at nine o clock on the morning of the eighteenth of july i rode into aguas frias with kearny at my side in his clean linen suit and with his military poise and keen eye he was a model of a fighting adventurer i had visions of him riding as commander of president valdevia s body guard when the plums of the new republic should begin to fall carlos followed with the troops and supplies he was to halt in a wood outside the town and remain concealed there until he received the word to advance kearny and i rode down the calle ancha toward the residencia of don rafael at the other side of the town as we passed the superb white buildings of the university of esperando i saw at an open window the gleaming spectacles and bald head of herr bergowitz professor of the natural sciences and friend of don rafael and of me and of the cause he waved his hand to me with his broad bland smile there was no excitement apparent in aguas frias the people went about leisurely as at all times the market was thronged with bare headed women buying fruit and carne we heard the twang and tinkle of string bands in the patios of the cantinas we could see that it was a waiting game that don rafael was playing his residencia as a large but low building around a great courtyard in grounds crowed with ornamental trees and tropic shrubs at his door an old woman who came informed us that don rafael had not yet arisen tell him said i that captain malone and a friend wish to see him at once perhaps he has overslept she came back looking frightened i have called she said and rung his bell many times but he does not answer i knew where his sleeping room was kearny and i pushed by her and went to it i put my shoulder against the thin door and forced it open in an armchair by a great table covered with maps and books sat don rafael with his eyes closed i touched his hand he had been dead many hours on his head above one ear was a wound caused by a heavy blow it had ceased to bleed long before i made the old woman call a mozo and dispatched him in haste to fetch herr bergowitz he came and we stood about as if we were half stunned by the awful shock thus can the letting of a few drops of blood from one man s veins drain the life of a nation presently herr bergowitz stooped and picked up a darkish stone the size of an orange which he saw under the table he examined it closely through his great glasses with the eye of science a fragment said he of a detonating meteor the most remarkable one in twenty years exploded above this city a little after midnight this morning the professor looked quickly up at the ceiling we saw the blue sky through a hole the size of an orange nearly above don rafael s chair i heard a familiar sound and turned kearny had thrown himself on the floor and was babbling his compendium of bitter blood freezing curses against the star of his evil luck undoubtedly phoebe had been feminine even when hurtling on her way to fiery dissolution and everlasting doom the last word had been hers captain malone was not unskilled in narrative he knew the point where a story should end i sat reveling in his effective conclusion when he aroused me by continuing of course said he our schemes were at an end there was no one to take don rafael s place our little army melted away like dew before the sun one day after i had returned to new orleans i related this story to a friend who holds a professorship in tulane university when i had finished he laughed and asked whether i had any knowledge of kearny s luck afterward i told him no that i had seen him no more but that when he left me he had expressed confidence that his future would be successful now that his unlucky star had been overthrown no doubt said the professor he is happier not to know one fact if he derives his bad luck from phoebe the ninth satellite of saturn that malicious lady is still engaged in overlooking his career the star close to saturn that he imagined to be her was near that planet simply by the chance of its orbit probably at different times he has regarded many other stars that happened to be in saturn s neighbourhood as his evil one the real phoebe is visible only through a very good telescope about a year afterward continued captain malone i was walking down a street that crossed the poydras market an immensely stout pink faced lacy in black satin crowded me from the narrow sidewalk with a frown behind her trailed a little man laden to the gunwales with bundles and bags of goods and vegetables it was kearny but changed i stopped and shook one of his hands which still clung to a bag of garlic and red peppers how is the luck old companero i asked him i had not the heart to tell him the truth about his star well said he i am married as you may guess francis called the big lady in deep tones are you going to stop in the street talking all day i am coming phoebe dear said kearny hastening after her captain malone ceased again after all do you believe in luck i asked do you answered the captain with his ambiguous smile shaded by the brim of his soft straw hat a double dyed deceiver the trouble began in laredo it was the llano kid s fault for he should have confined his habit of manslaughter to mexicans but the kid was past twenty and to have only mexicans to one s credit at twenty is to blush unseen on the rio grande border it happened in old justo valdos s gambling house there was a poker game at which sat players who were not all friends as happens often where men ride in from afar to shoot folly as she gallops there was a row over so small a matter as a pair of queens and when the smoke had cleared away it was found that the kid had committed an indiscretion and his adversary had been guilty of a blunder for the unfortunate combatant instead of being a greaser was a high blooded youth from the cow ranches of about the kid s own age and possessed of friends and champions his blunder in missing the kid s right ear only a sixteenth of an inch when he pulled his gun did not lessen the indiscretion of the better marksman the kid not being equipped with a retinue nor bountifully supplied with personal admirers and supporters on account of a rather umbrageous reputation even for the border considered it not incompatible with his indispensable gameness to perform that judicious tractional act known as pulling his freight quickly the avengers gathered and sought him three of them overtook him within a rod of the station the kid turned and showed his teeth in that brilliant but mirthless smile that usually preceded his deeds of insolence and violence and his pursuers fell back without making it necessary for him even to reach for his weapon but in this affair the kid had not felt the grim thirst for encounter that usually urged him on to battle it had been a purely chance row born of the cards and certain epithets impossible for a gentleman to brook that had passed between the two the kid had rather liked the slim haughty brown faced young chap whom his bullet had cut off in the first pride of manhood and now he wanted no more blood he wanted to get away and have a good long sleep somewhere in the sun on the mesquit grass with his handkerchief over his face even a mexican might have crossed his path in safety while he was in this mood the kid openly boarded the north bound passenger train that departed five minutes later but at webb a few miles out where it was flagged to take on a traveller he abandoned that manner of escape there were telegraph stations ahead and the kid looked askance at electricity and steam saddle and spur were his rocks of safety the man whom he had shot was a stranger to him but the kid knew that he was of the coralitos outfit from hidalgo and that the punchers from that ranch were more relentless and vengeful than kentucky feudists when wrong or harm was done to one of them so with the wisdom that has characterized many great farmers the kid decided to pile up as many leagues as possible of chaparral and pear between himself and the retaliation of the coralitos bunch near the station was a store and near the store scattered among the mesquits and elms stood the saddled horses of the customers most of them waited half asleep with sagging limbs and drooping heads but one a long legged roan with a curved neck snorted and pawed the turf him the kid mounted gripped with his knees and slapped gently with the owner s own quirt if the slaying of the temerarious card player had cast a cloud over the kid s standing as a good and true citizen this last act of his veiled his figure in the darkest shadows of disrepute on the rio grande border if you take a man s life you sometimes take trash but if you take his horse you take a thing the loss of which renders him poor indeed and which enriches you not if you are caught for the kid there was no turning back now with the springing roan under him he felt little care or uneasiness after a five mile gallop he drew it in to the plainsman s jogging trot and rode northeastward toward the nueces river bottoms he knew the country well its most tortuous and obscure trails through the great wilderness of brush and pear and its camps and lonesome ranches where one might find safe entertainment always he bore to the east for the kid had never seen the ocean and he had a fancy to lay his hand upon the mane of the great gulf the gamesome colt of the greater waters so after three days he stood on the shore at corpus christi and looked out across the gentle ripples of a quiet sea captain boone of the schooner flyaway stood near his skiff which one of his crew was guarding in the surf when ready to sail he had discovered that one of the necessaries of life in the parallelogrammatic shape of plug tobacco had been forgotten a sailor had been dispatched for the missing cargo meanwhile the captain paced the sands chewing profanely at his pocket store a slim wiry youth in high heeled boots came down to the water s edge his face was boyish but with a premature severity that hinted at a man s experience his complexion was naturally dark and the sun and wind of an outdoor life had burned it to a coffee brown his hair was as black and straight as an indian s his face had not yet upturned to the humiliation of a razor his eyes were a cold and steady blue he carried his left arm somewhat away from his body for pearl handled s are frowned upon by town marshals and are a little bulky when placed in the left armhole of one s vest he looked beyond captain boone at the gulf with the impersonal and expressionless dignity of a chinese emperor thinkin of buyin that ar gulf buddy asked the captain made sarcastic by his narrow escape from a tobaccoless voyage why no said the kid gently i reckon not i never saw it before i was just looking at it not thinking of selling it are you not this trip said the captain i ll send it to you c o d when i get back to buenas tierras here comes that capstanfooted lubber with the chewin i ought to ve weighed anchor an hour ago is that your ship out there asked the kid why yes answered the captain if you want to call a schooner a ship and i don t mind lyin but you better say miller and gonzales owners and ordinary plain billy be damned old samuel k boone skipper where are you going to asked the refugee buenas tierras coast of south america i forgot what they called the country the last time i was there cargo lumber corrugated iron and machetes what kind of a country is it asked the kid hot or cold warmish buddy said the captain but a regular paradise lost for elegance of scenery and be yooty of geography ye re wakened every morning by the sweet singin of red birds with seven purple tails and the sighin of breezes in the posies and roses and the inhabitants never work for they can reach out and pick steamer baskets of the choicest hothouse fruit without gettin out of bed and there s no sunday and no ice and no rent and no troubles and no use and no nothin it s a great country for a man to go to sleep with and wait for somethin to turn up the bananys and oranges and hurricanes and pineapples that ye eat comes from there that sounds to me said the kid at last betraying interest what ll the expressage be to take me out there with you twenty four dollars said captain boone grub and transportation second cabin i haven t got a first cabin you ve got my company said the kid pulling out a buckskin bag with three hundred dollars he had gone to laredo for his regular blowout the duel in valdos s had cut short his season of hilarity but it had left him with nearly for aid in the flight that it had made necessary all right buddy said the captain i hope your ma won t blame me for this little childish escapade of yours he beckoned to one of the boat s crew let sanchez lift you out to the skiff so you won t get your feet wet thacker the united states consul at buenas tierras was not yet drunk it was only eleven o clock and he never arrived at his desired state of beatitude a state wherein he sang ancient maudlin vaudeville songs and pelted his screaming parrot with banana peels until the middle of the afternoon so when he looked up from his hammock at the sound of a slight cough and saw the kid standing in the door of the consulate he was still in a condition to extend the hospitality and courtesy due from the representative of a great nation don t disturb yourself said the kid easily i just dropped in they told me it was customary to light at your camp before starting in to round up the town i just came in on a ship from texas glad to see you mr said the consul the kid laughed sprague dalton he said it sounds funny to me to hear it i m called the llano kid in the rio grande country i m thacker said the consul take that cane bottom chair now if you ve come to invest you want somebody to advise you these dingies will cheat you out of the gold in your teeth if you don t understand their ways try a cigar much obliged said the kid but if it wasn t for my corn shucks and the little bag in my back pocket i couldn t live a minute he took out his makings and rolled a cigarette they speak spanish here said the consul you ll need an interpreter if there s anything i can do why i d be delighted if you re buying fruit lands or looking for a concession of any sort you ll want somebody who knows the ropes to look out for you i speak spanish said the kid about nine times better than i do english everybody speaks it on the range where i come from and i m not in the market for anything you speak spanish said thacker thoughtfully he regarded the kid absorbedly you look like a spaniard too he continued and you re from texas and you can t be more than twenty or twenty one i wonder if you ve got any nerve you got a deal of some kind to put through asked the texan with unexpected shrewdness are you open to a proposition said thacker what s the use to deny it said the kid i got into a little gun frolic down in laredo and plugged a white man there wasn t any mexican handy and i come down to your parrot and monkey range just for to smell the morning glories and marigolds now do you sabe thacker got up and closed the door let me see your hand he said he took the kid s left hand and examined the back of it closely i can do it he said excitedly your flesh is as hard as wood and as healthy as a baby s it will heal in a week if it s a fist fight you want to back me for said the kid don t put your money up yet make it gun work and i ll keep you company but no barehanded scrapping like ladies at a tea party for me it s easier than that said thacker just step here will you through the window he pointed to a two story white stuccoed house with wide galleries rising amid the deep green tropical foliage on a wooded hill that sloped gently from the sea in that house said thacker a fine old castilian gentleman and his wife are yearning to gather you into their arms and fill your pockets with money old santos urique lives there he owns half the gold mines in the country you haven t been eating loco weed have you asked the kid sit down again said thacker and i ll tell you twelve years ago they lost a kid no he didn t die although most of em here do from drinking the surface water he was a wild little devil even if he wasn t but eight years old everybody knows about it some americans who were through here prospecting for gold had letters to senor urique and the boy was a favorite with them they filled his head with big stories about the states and about a month after they left the kid disappeared too he was supposed to have stowed himself away among the banana bunches on a fruit steamer and gone to new orleans he was seen once afterward in texas it was thought but they never heard anything more of him old urique has spent thousands of dollars having him looked for the madam was broken up worst of all the kid was her life she wears mourning yet but they say she believes he ll come back to her some day and never gives up hope on the back of the boy s left hand was tattooed a flying eagle carrying a spear in his claws that s old urique s coat of arms or something that he inherited in spain the kid raised his left hand slowly and gazed at it curiously that s it said thacker reaching behind the official desk for his bottle of smuggled brandy you re not so slow i can do it what was i consul at sandakan for i never knew till now in a week i ll have the eagle bird with the frog sticker blended in so you d think you were born with it i brought a set of the needles and ink just because i was sure you d drop in some day mr dalton oh hell said the kid i thought i told you my name all right kid then it won t be that long how does senorito urique sound for a change i never played son any that i remember of said the kid if i had any parents to mention they went over the divide about the time i gave my first bleat what is the plan of your round up thacker leaned back against the wall and held his glass up to the light we ve come now said he to the question of how far you re willing to go in a little matter of the sort i told you why i came down here said the kid simply a good answer said the consul but you won t have to go that far here s the scheme after i get the trademark tattooed on your hand i ll notify old urique in the meantime i ll furnish you with all of the family history i can find out so you can be studying up points to talk about you ve got the looks you speak the spanish you know the facts you can tell about texas you ve got the tattoo mark when i notify them that the rightful heir has returned and is waiting to know whether he will be received and pardoned what will happen they ll simply rush down here and fall on your neck and the curtain goes down for refreshments and a stroll in the lobby i m waiting said the kid i haven t had my saddle off in your camp long pardner and i never met you before but if you intend to let it go at a parental blessing why i m mistaken in my man that s all thanks said the consul i haven t met anybody in a long time that keeps up with an argument as well as you do the rest of it is simple if they take you in only for a while it s long enough don t give em time to hunt up the strawberry mark on your left shoulder old urique keeps anywhere from to in his house all the time in a little safe that you could open with a shoe buttoner get it my skill as a tattooer is worth half the boddle we go halves and catch a tramp steamer for rio janeiro let the united states go to pieces if it can t get along without my services que dice senor it sounds to me said the kid nodding his head i m out for the dust all right then said thacker you ll have to keep close until we get the bird on you you can live in the back room here i do my own cooking and i ll make you as comfortable as a parsimonious government will allow me thacker had set the time at a week but it was two weeks before the design that he patiently tattooed upon the kid s hand was to his notion and then thacker called a muchacho and dispatched this note to the intended victim el senor don santos urique la casa blanca my dear sir i beg permission to inform you that there is in my house as a temporary guest a young man who arrived in buenas tierras from the united states some days ago without wishing to excite any hopes that may not be realized i think there is a possibility of his being your long absent son it might be well for you to call and see him if he is it is my opinion that his intention was to return to his home but upon arriving here his courage failed him from doubts as to how he would be received your true servant thompson thacker half an hour afterward quick time for buenas tierras senor urique s ancient landau drove to the consul s door with the barefooted coachman beating and shouting at the team of fat awkward horses a tall man with a white moustache alighted and assisted to the ground a lady who was dressed and veiled in unrelieved black the two hastened inside and were met by thacker with his best diplomatic bow by his desk stood a slender young man with clear cut sun browned features and smoothly brushed black hair senora urique threw back her black veil with a quick gesture she was past middle age and her hair was beginning to silver but her full proud figure and clear olive skin retained traces of the beauty peculiar to the basque province but once you had seen her eyes and comprehended the great sadness that was revealed in their deep shadows and hopeless expression you saw that the woman lived only in some memory she bent upon the young man a long look of the most agonized questioning then her great black eyes turned and her gaze rested upon his left hand and then with a sob not loud but seeming to shake the room she cried hijo mio and caught the llano kid to her heart a month afterward the kid came to the consulate in response to a message sent by thacker he looked the young spanish caballero his clothes were imported and the wiles of the jewellers had not been spent upon him in vain a more than respectable diamond shone on his finger as he rolled a shuck cigarette what s doing asked thacker nothing much said the kid calmly i eat my first iguana steak to day they re them big lizards you sabe i reckon though that frijoles and side bacon would do me about as well do you care for iguanas thacker no nor for some other kinds of reptiles said thacker it was three in the afternoon and in another hour he would be in his state of beatitude it s time you were making good sonny he went on with an ugly look on his reddened face you re not playing up to me square you ve been the prodigal son for four weeks now and you could have had veal for every meal on a gold dish if you d wanted it now mr kid do you think it s right to leave me out so long on a husk diet what s the trouble don t you get your filial eyes on anything that looks like cash in the casa blanca don t tell me you don t everybody knows where old urique keeps his stuff it s u s currency too he don t accept anything else what s doing don t say nothing this time why sure said the kid admiring his diamond there s plenty of money up there i m no judge of collateral in bunches but i will undertake for to say that i ve seen the rise of at a time in that tin grub box that my adopted father calls his safe and he lets me carry the key sometimes just to show me that he knows i m the real francisco that strayed from the herd a long time ago well what are you waiting for asked thacker angrily don t you forget that i can upset your apple cart any day i want to if old urique knew you were an imposter what sort of things would happen to you oh you don t know this country mr texas kid the laws here have got mustard spread between em these people here d stretch you out like a frog that had been stepped on and give you about fifty sticks at every corner of the plaza and they d wear every stick out too what was left of you they d feed to alligators i might just as well tell you now pardner said the kid sliding down low on his steamer chair that things are going to stay just as they are they re about right now what do you mean asked thacker rattling the bottom of his glass on his desk the scheme s off said the kid and whenever you have the pleasure of speaking to me address me as don francisco urique i ll guarantee i ll answer to it we ll let colonel urique keep his money his little tin safe is as good as the time locker in the first national bank of laredo as far as you and me are concerned you re going to throw me down then are you said the consul sure said the kid cheerfully throw you down that s it and now i ll tell you why the first night i was up at the colonel s house they introduced me to a bedroom no blankets on the floor a real room with a bed and things in it and before i was asleep in comes this artificial mother and tucks in the covers panchito she says my little lost one god has brought you back to me i bless his name forever it was that or some truck like that she said and down comes a drop or two of rain and hits me on the nose and all that stuck by me mr thacker and it s been that way ever since and it s got to stay that way don t you think that it s for what s in it for me either that i say so if you have any such ideas keep em to yourself i haven t had much truck with women in my life and no mothers to speak of but here s a lady that we ve got to keep fooled once she stood it twice she won t i m a low down wolf and the devil may have sent me on this trail instead of god but i ll travel it to the end and now don t forget that i m don francisco urique whenever you happen to mention my name i ll expose you to day you you double dyed traitor stammered thacker the kid arose and without violence took thacker by the throat with a hand of steel and shoved him slowly into a corner then he drew from under his left arm his pearl handled and poked the cold muzzle of it against the consul s mouth i told you why i come here he said with his old freezing smile if i leave here you ll be the reason never forget it pardner now what is my name er don francisco urique gasped thacker from outside came a sound of wheels and the shouting of some one and the sharp thwacks of a wooden whipstock upon the backs of fat horses the kid put up his gun and walked toward the door but he turned again and came back to the trembling thacker and held up his left hand with its back toward the consul there s one more reason he said slowly why things have got to stand as they are the fellow i killed in laredo had one of them same pictures on his left hand outside the ancient landau of don santos urique rattled to the door the coachman ceased his bellowing senora urique in a voluminous gay gown of white lace and flying ribbons leaned forward with a happy look in her great soft eyes are you within dear son she called in the rippling castilian madre mia yo vengo mother i come answered the young don francisco urique the passing of black eagle for some months of a certain year a grim bandit infested the texas border along the rio grande peculiarly striking to the optic nerve was this notorious marauder his personality secured him the title of black eagle the terror of the border many fearsome tales are on record concerning the doings of him and his followers suddenly in the space of a single minute black eagle vanished from earth he was never heard of again his own band never even guessed the mystery of his disappearance the border ranches and settlements feared he would come again to ride and ravage the mesquite flats he never will it is to disclose the fate of black eagle that this narrative is written the initial movement of the story is furnished by the foot of a bartender in st louis his discerning eye fell upon the form of chicken ruggles as he pecked with avidity at the free lunch chicken was a hobo he had a long nose like the bill of a fowl an inordinate appetite for poultry and a habit of gratifying it without expense which accounts for the name given him by his fellow vagrants physicians agree that the partaking of liquids at meal times is not a healthy practice the hygiene of the saloon promulgates the opposite chicken had neglected to purchase a drink to accompany his meal the bartender rounded the counter caught the injudicious diner by the ear with a lemon squeezer led him to the door and kicked him into the street thus the mind of chicken was brought to realize the signs of coming winter the night was cold the stars shone with unkindly brilliancy people were hurrying along the streets in two egotistic jostling streams men had donned their overcoats and chicken knew to an exact percentage the increased difficulty of coaxing dimes from those buttoned in vest pockets the time had come for his annual exodus to the south a little boy five or six years old stood looking with covetous eyes in a confectioner s window in one small hand he held an empty two ounce vial in the other he grasped tightly something flat and round with a shining milled edge the scene presented a field of operations commensurate to chicken s talents and daring after sweeping the horizon to make sure that no official tug was cruising near he insidiously accosted his prey the boy having been early taught by his household to regard altruistic advances with extreme suspicion received the overtures coldly then chicken knew that he must make one of those desperate nerve shattering plunges into speculation that fortune sometimes requires of those who would win her favour five cents was his capital and this he must risk against the chance of winning what lay within the close grasp of the youngster s chubby hand it was a fearful lottery chicken knew but he must accomplish his end by strategy since he had a wholesome terror of plundering infants by force once in a park driven by hunger he had committed an onslaught upon a bottle of peptonized infant s food in the possession of an occupant of a baby carriage the outraged infant had so promptly opened its mouth and pressed the button that communicated with the welkin that help arrived and chicken did his thirty days in a snug coop wherefore he was as he said leary of kids beginning artfully to question the boy concerning his choice of sweets he gradually drew out the information he wanted mamma said he was to ask the drug store man for ten cents worth of paregoric in the bottle he was to keep his hand shut tight over the dollar he must not stop to talk to anyone in the street he must ask the drug store man to wrap up the change and put it in the pocket of his trousers indeed they had pockets two of them and he liked chocolate creams best chicken went into the store and turned plunger he invested his entire capital in c a n d y stocks simply to pave the way to the greater risk following he gave the sweets to the youngster and had the satisfaction of perceiving that confidence was established after that it was easy to obtain leadership of the expedition to take the investment by the hand and lead it to a nice drug store he knew of in the same block there chicken with a parental air passed over the dollar and called for the medicine while the boy crunched his candy glad to be relieved of the responsibility of the purchase and then the successful investor searching his pockets found an overcoat button the extent of his winter trousseau and wrapping it carefully placed the ostensible change in the pocket of confiding juvenility setting the youngster s face homeward and patting him benevolently on the back for chicken s heart was as soft as those of his feathered namesakes the speculator quit the market with a profit of per cent on his invested capital two hours later an iron mountain freight engine pulled out of the railroad yards texas bound with a string of empties in one of the cattle cars half buried in excelsior chicken lay at ease beside him in his nest was a quart bottle of very poor whisky and a paper bag of bread and cheese mr ruggles in his private car was on his trip south for the winter season for a week that car was trundled southward shifted laid over and manipulated after the manner of rolling stock but chicken stuck to it leaving it only at necessary times to satisfy his hunger and thirst he knew it must go down to the cattle country and san antonio in the heart of it was his goal there the air was salubrious and mild the people indulgent and long suffering the bartenders there would not kick him if he should eat too long or too often at one place they would swear at him as if by rote and without heat they swore so drawlingly and they rarely paused short of their full vocabulary which was copious so that chicken had often gulped a good meal during the process of the vituperative prohibition the season there was always spring like the plazas were pleasant at night with music and gaiety except during the slight and infrequent cold snaps one could sleep comfortably out of doors in case the interiors should develop inhospitability at texarkana his car was switched to the i and g n then still southward it trailed until at length it crawled across the colorado bridge at austin and lined out straight as an arrow for the run to san antonio when the freight halted at that town chicken was fast asleep in ten minutes the train was off again for laredo the end of the road those empty cattle cars were for distribution along the line at points from which the ranches shipped their stock when chicken awoke his car was stationary looking out between the slats he saw it was a bright moonlit night scrambling out he saw his car with three others abandoned on a little siding in a wild and lonesome country a cattle pen and chute stood on one side of the track the railroad bisected a vast dim ocean of prairie in the midst of which chicken with his futile rolling stock was as completely stranded as was robinson with his land locked boat a white post stood near the rails going up to it chicken read the letters at the top s a laredo was nearly as far to the south he was almost a hundred miles from any town coyotes began to yelp in the mysterious sea around him chicken felt lonesome he had lived in boston without an education in chicago without nerve in philadelphia without a sleeping place in new york without a pull and in pittsburg sober and yet he had never felt so lonely as now suddenly through the intense silence he heard the whicker of a horse the sound came from the side of the track toward the east and chicken began to explore timorously in that direction he stepped high along the mat of curly mesquit grass for he was afraid of everything there might be in this wilderness snakes rats brigands centipedes mirages cowboys fandangoes tarantulas tamales he had read of them in the story papers rounding a clump of prickly pear that reared high its fantastic and menacing array of rounded heads he was struck to shivering terror by a snort and a thunderous plunge as the horse himself startled bounded away some fifty yards and then resumed his grazing but here was the one thing in the desert that chicken did not fear he had been reared on a farm he had handled horses understood them and could ride approaching slowly and speaking soothingly he followed the animal which after its first flight seemed gentle enough and secured the end of the twenty foot lariat that dragged after him in the grass it required him but a few moments to contrive the rope into an ingenious nose bridle after the style of the mexican borsal in another he was upon the horse s back and off at a splendid lope giving the animal free choice of direction he will take me somewhere said chicken to himself it would have been a thing of joy that untrammelled gallop over the moonlit prairie even to chicken who loathed exertion but that his mood was not for it his head ached a growing thirst was upon him the somewhere whither his lucky mount might convey him was full of dismal peradventure and now he noted that the horse moved to a definite goal where the prairie lay smooth he kept his course straight as an arrow s toward the east deflected by hill or arroyo or impractical spinous brakes he quickly flowed again into the current charted by his unerring instinct at last upon the side of a gentle rise he suddenly subsided to a complacent walk a stone s cast away stood a little mott of coma trees beneath it a jacal such as the mexicans erect a one room house of upright poles daubed with clay and roofed with grass or tule reeds an experienced eye would have estimated the spot as the headquarters of a small sheep ranch in the moonlight the ground in the nearby corral showed pulverized to a level smoothness by the hoofs of the sheep everywhere was carelessly distributed the paraphernalia of the place ropes bridles saddles sheep pelts wool sacks feed troughs and camp litter the barrel of drinking water stood in the end of the two horse wagon near the door the harness was piled promiscuous upon the wagon tongue soaking up the dew chicken slipped to earth and tied the horse to a tree he halloed again and again but the house remained quiet the door stood open and he entered cautiously the light was sufficient for him to see that no one was at home the room was that of a bachelor ranchman who was content with the necessaries of life chicken rummaged intelligently until he found what he had hardly dared hope for a small brown jug that still contained something near a quart of his desire half an hour later chicken now a gamecock of hostile aspect emerged from the house with unsteady steps he had drawn upon the absent ranchman s equipment to replace his own ragged attire he wore a suit of coarse brown ducking the coat being a sort of rakish bolero jaunty to a degree boots he had donned and spurs that whirred with every lurching step buckled around him was a belt full of cartridges with a big six shooter in each of its two holsters prowling about he found blankets a saddle and bridle with which he caparisoned his steed again mounting he rode swiftly away singing a loud and tuneless song bud king s band of desperadoes outlaws and horse and cattle thieves were in camp at a secluded spot on the bank of the frio their depredations in the rio grande country while no bolder than usual had been advertised more extensively and captain kinney s company of rangers had been ordered down to look after them consequently bud king who was a wise general instead of cutting out a hot trail for the upholders of the law as his men wished to do retired for the time to the prickly fastnesses of the frio valley though the move was a prudent one and not incompatible with bud s well known courage it raised dissension among the members of the band in fact while they thus lay ingloriously perdu in the brush the question of bud king s fitness for the leadership was argued with closed doors as it were by his followers never before had bud s skill or efficiency been brought to criticism but his glory was wandering and such is glory s fate in the light of a newer star the sentiment of the band was crystallizing into the opinion that black eagle could lead them with more lustre profit and distinction this black eagle sub titled the terror of the border had been a member of the gang about three months one night while they were in camp on the san miguel water hole a solitary horseman on the regulation fiery steed dashed in among them the newcomer was of a portentous and devastating aspect a beak like nose with a predatory curve projected above a mass of bristling blue black whiskers his eye was cavernous and fierce he was spurred sombreroed booted garnished with revolvers abundantly drunk and very much unafraid few people in the country drained by the rio bravo would have cared thus to invade alone the camp of bud king but this fell bird swooped fearlessly upon them and demanded to be fed hospitality in the prairie country is not limited even if your enemy pass your way you must feed him before you shoot him you must empty your larder into him before you empty your lead so the stranger of undeclared intentions was set down to a mighty feast a talkative bird he was full of most marvellous loud tales and exploits and speaking a language at times obscure but never colourless he was a new sensation to bud king s men who rarely encountered new types they hung delighted upon his vainglorious boasting the spicy strangeness of his lingo his contemptuous familiarity with life the world and remote places and the extravagant frankness with which he conveyed his sentiments to their guest the band of outlaws seemed to be nothing more than a congregation of country bumpkins whom he was stringing for grub just as he would have told his stories at the back door of a farmhouse to wheedle a meal and indeed his ignorance was not without excuse for the bad man of the southwest does not run to extremes those brigands might justly have been taken for a little party of peaceable rustics assembled for a fish fry or pecan gathering gentle of manner slouching of gait soft voiced unpicturesquely clothed not one of them presented to the eye any witness of the desperate records they had earned for two days the glittering stranger within the camp was feasted then by common consent he was invited to become a member of the band he consented presenting for enrollment the prodigious name of captain montressor this name was immediately overruled by the band and piggy substituted as a compliment to the awful and insatiate appetite of its owner thus did the texas border receive the most spectacular brigand that ever rode its chaparral for the next three months bud king conducted business as usual escaping encounters with law officers and being content with reasonable profits the band ran off some very good companies of horses from the ranges and a few bunches of fine cattle which they got safely across the rio grande and disposed of to fair advantage often the band would ride into the little villages and mexican settlements terrorizing the inhabitants and plundering for the provisions and ammunition they needed it was during these bloodless raids that piggy s ferocious aspect and frightful voice gained him a renown more widespread and glorious than those other gentle voiced and sad faced desperadoes could have acquired in a lifetime the mexicans most apt in nomenclature first called him the black eagle and used to frighten the babes by threatening them with tales of the dreadful robber who carried off little children in his great beak soon the name extended and black eagle the terror of the border became a recognized factor in exaggerated newspaper reports and ranch gossip the country from the nueces to the rio grande was a wild but fertile stretch given over to the sheep and cattle ranches range was free the inhabitants were few the law was mainly a letter and the pirates met with little opposition until the flaunting and garish piggy gave the band undue advertisement then mckinney s ranger company headed for those precincts and bud king knew that it meant grim and sudden war or else temporary retirement regarding the risk to be unnecessary he drew off his band to an almost inaccessible spot on the bank of the frio wherefore as has been said dissatisfaction arose among the members and impeachment proceedings against bud were premeditated with black eagle in high favour for the succession bud king was not unaware of the sentiment and he called aside cactus taylor his trusted lieutenant to discuss it if the boys said bud ain t satisfied with me i m willing to step out they re buckin against my way of handlin em and specially because i concludes to hit the brush while sam kinney is ridin the line i saves em from bein shot or sent up on a state contract and they up and says i m no good it ain t so much that explained cactus as it is they re plum locoed about piggy they want them whiskers and that nose of his to split the wind at the head of the column there s somethin mighty seldom about piggy declared bud musingly i never yet see anything on the hoof that he exactly grades up with he can shore holler a plenty and he straddles a hoss from where you laid the chunk but he ain t never been smoked yet you know cactus we ain t had a row since he s been with us piggy s all right for skearin the greaser kids and layin waste a cross roads store i reckon he s the finest canned oyster buccaneer and cheese pirate that ever was but how s his appetite for fightin i ve knowed some citizens you d think was starvin for trouble get a bad case of dyspepsy the first dose of lead they had to take he talks all spraddled out said cactus bout the rookuses he s been in he claims to have saw the elephant and hearn the owl i know replied bud using the cowpuncher s expressive phrase of skepticism but it sounds to me this conversation was held one night in camp while the other members of the band eight in number were sprawling around the fire lingering over their supper when bud and cactus ceased talking they heard piggy s formidable voice holding forth to the others as usual while he was engaged in checking though never satisfying his ravening appetite wat s de use he was saying of chasin little red cowses and hosses round for t ousands of miles dere ain t nuttin in it gallopin t rough dese bushes and briers and gettin a t irst dat a brewery couldn t put out and missin meals say you know what i d do if i was main finger of dis bunch i d stick up a train i d blow de express car and make hard dollars where you guys get wind youse makes me tired dis sook cow kind of cheap sport gives me a pain later on a deputation waited on bud they stood on one leg chewed mesquit twigs and circumlocuted for they hated to hurt his feelings bud foresaw their business and made it easy for them bigger risks and larger profits was what they wanted the suggestion of piggy s about holding up a train had fired their imagination and increased their admiration for the dash and boldness of the instigator they were such simple artless and custom bound bush rangers that they had never before thought of extending their habits beyond the running off of live stock and the shooting of such of their acquaintances as ventured to interfere bud acted on the level agreeing to take a subordinate place in the gang until black eagle should have been given a trial as leader after a great deal of consultation studying of time tables and discussion of the country s topography the time and place for carrying out their new enterprise was decided upon at that time there was a feedstuff famine in mexico and a cattle famine in certain parts of the united states and there was a brisk international trade much money was being shipped along the railroads that connected the two republics it was agreed that the most promising place for the contemplated robbery was at espina a little station on the i and g n about forty miles north of laredo the train stopped there one minute the country around was wild and unsettled the station consisted of but one house in which the agent lived black eagle s band set out riding by night arriving in the vicinity of espina they rested their horses all day in a thicket a few miles distant the train was due at espina at p m they could rob the train and be well over the mexican border with their booty by daylight the next morning to do black eagle justice he exhibited no signs of flinching from the responsible honours that had been conferred upon him he assigned his men to their respective posts with discretion and coached them carefully as to their duties on each side of the track four of the band were to lie concealed in the chaparral gotch ear rodgers was to stick up the station agent bronco charlie was to remain with the horses holding them in readiness at a spot where it was calculated the engine would be when the train stopped bud king was to lie hidden on one side and black eagle himself on the other the two would get the drop on the engineer and fireman force them to descend and proceed to the rear then the express car would be looted and the escape made no one was to move until black eagle gave the signal by firing his revolver the plan was perfect at ten minutes to train time every man was at his post effectually concealed by the thick chaparral that grew almost to the rails the night was dark and lowering with a fine drizzle falling from the flying gulf clouds black eagle crouched behind a bush within five yards of the track two six shooters were belted around him occasionally he drew a large black bottle from his pocket and raised it to his mouth a star appeared far down the track which soon waxed into the headlight of the approaching train it came on with an increasing roar the engine bore down upon the ambushing desperadoes with a glare and a shriek like some avenging monster come to deliver them to justice black eagle flattened himself upon the ground the engine contrary to their calculations instead of stopping between him and bud king s place of concealment passed fully forty years farther before it came to a stand the bandit leader rose to his feet and peered through the bush his men all lay quiet awaiting the signal immediately opposite black eagle was a thing that drew his attention instead of being a regular passenger train it was a mixed one before him stood a box car the door of which by some means had been left slightly open black eagle went up to it and pushed the door farther open an odour came forth a damp rancid familiar musty intoxicating beloved odour stirring strongly at old memories of happy days and travels black eagle sniffed at the witching smell as the returned wanderer smells of the rose that twines his boyhood s cottage home nostalgia seized him he put his hand inside excelsior dry springy curly soft enticing covered the floor outside the drizzle had turned to a chilling rain the train bell clanged the bandit chief unbuckled his belt and cast it with its revolvers upon the ground his spurs followed quickly and his broad sombrero black eagle was moulting the train started with a rattling jerk the ex terror of the border scrambled into the box car and closed the door stretched luxuriously upon the excelsior with the black bottle clasped closely to his breast his eyes closed and a foolish happy smile upon his terrible features chicken ruggles started upon his return trip undisturbed with the band of desperate bandits lying motionless awaiting the signal to attack the train pulled out from espina as its speed increased and the black masses of chaparral went whizzing past on either side the express messenger lighting his pipe looked through his window and remarked feelingly what a jim dandy place for a hold up a retrieved reformation a guard came to the prison shoe shop where jimmy valentine was assiduously stitching uppers and escorted him to the front office there the warden handed jimmy his pardon which had been signed that morning by the governor jimmy took it in a tired kind of way he had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence he had expected to stay only about three months at the longest when a man with as many friends on the outside as jimmy valentine had is received in the stir it is hardly worth while to cut his hair now valentine said the warden you ll go out in the morning brace up and make a man of yourself you re not a bad fellow at heart stop cracking safes and live straight me said jimmy in surprise why i never cracked a safe in my life oh no laughed the warden of course not let s see now how was it you happened to get sent up on that springfield job was it because you wouldn t prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high toned society or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you it s always one or the other with you innocent victims me said jimmy still blankly virtuous why warden i never was in springfield in my life take him back cronin said the warden and fix him up with outgoing clothes unlock him at seven in the morning and let him come to the bull pen better think over my advice valentine at a quarter past seven on the next morning jimmy stood in the warden s outer office he had on a suit of the villainously fitting ready made clothes and a pair of the stiff squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests the clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity the warden gave him a cigar and shook hands valentine was chronicled on the books pardoned by governor and mr james valentine walked out into the sunshine disregarding the song of the birds the waving green trees and the smell of the flowers jimmy headed straight for a restaurant there he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him from there he proceeded leisurely to the depot he tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door and boarded his train three hours set him down in a little town near the state line he went to the cafe of one mike dolan and shook hands with mike who was alone behind the bar sorry we couldn t make it sooner jimmy me boy said mike but we had that protest from springfield to buck against and the governor nearly balked feeling all right fine said jimmy got my key he got his key and went upstairs unlocking the door of a room at the rear everything was just as he had left it there on the floor was still ben price s collar button that had been torn from that eminent detective s shirt band when they had overpowered jimmy to arrest him pulling out from the wall a folding bed jimmy slid back a panel in the wall and dragged out a dust covered suit case he opened this and gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar s tools in the east it was a complete set made of specially tempered steel the latest designs in drills punches braces and bits jimmies clamps and augers with two or three novelties invented by jimmy himself in which he took pride over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at a place where they make such things for the profession in half an hour jimmy went down stairs and through the cafe he was now dressed in tasteful and well fitting clothes and carried his dusted and cleaned suit case in his hand got anything on asked mike dolan genially me said jimmy in a puzzled tone i don t understand i m representing the new york amalgamated short snap biscuit cracker and frazzled wheat company this statement delighted mike to such an extent that jimmy had to take a seltzer and milk on the spot he never touched hard drinks a week after the release of valentine there was a neat job of safe burglary done in richmond indiana with no clue to the author a scant eight hundred dollars was all that was secured two weeks after that a patented improved burglar proof safe in logansport was opened like a cheese to the tune of fifteen hundred dollars currency securities and silver untouched that began to interest the rogue catchers then an old fashioned bank safe in jefferson city became active and threw out of its crater an eruption of bank notes amounting to five thousand dollars the losses were now high enough to bring the matter up into ben price s class of work by comparing notes a remarkable similarity in the methods of the burglaries was noticed ben price investigated the scenes of the robberies and was heard to remark that s dandy jim valentine s autograph he s resumed business look at that combination knob jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in wet weather he s got the only clamps that can do it and look how clean those tumblers were punched out jimmy never has to drill but one hole yes i guess i want mr valentine he ll do his bit next time without any short time or clemency foolishness ben price knew jimmy s habits he had learned them while working on the springfield case long jumps quick get aways no confederates and a taste for good society these ways had helped mr valentine to become noted as a successful dodger of retribution it was given out that ben price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman and other people with burglar proof safes felt more at ease one afternoon jimmy valentine and his suit case climbed out of the mail hack in elmore a little town five miles off the railroad down in the black jack country of arkansas jimmy looking like an athletic young senior just home from college went down the board side walk toward the hotel a young lady crossed the street passed him at the corner and entered a door over which was the sign the elmore bank jimmy valentine looked into her eyes forgot what he was and became another man she lowered her eyes and coloured slightly young men of jimmy s style and looks were scarce in elmore jimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if he were one of the stockholders and began to ask him questions about the town feeding him dimes at intervals by and by the young lady came out looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suit case and went her way isn that young lady polly simpson asked jimmy with specious guile naw said the boy she s annabel adams her pa owns this bank why d you come to elmore for is that a gold watch chain i m going to get a bulldog got any more dimes jimmy went to the planters hotel registered as ralph d spencer and engaged a room he leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the clerk he said he had come to elmore to look for a location to go into business how was the shoe business now in the town he had thought of the shoe business was there an opening the clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of jimmy he himself was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded youth of elmore but he now perceived his shortcomings while trying to figure out jimmy s manner of tying his four in hand he cordially gave information yes there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line there wasn t an exclusive shoe store in the place the dry goods and general stores handled them business in all lines was fairly good hoped mr spencer would decide to locate in elmore he would find it a pleasant town to live in and the people very sociable mr spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look over the situation no the clerk needn t call the boy he would carry up his suit case himself it was rather heavy mr ralph spencer the phoenix that arose from jimmy valentine s ashes ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love remained in elmore and prospered he opened a shoe store and secured a good run of trade socially he was also a success and made many friends and he accomplished the wish of his heart he met miss annabel adams and became more and more captivated by her charms at the end of a year the situation of mr ralph spencer was this he had won the respect of the community his shoe store was flourishing and he and annabel were engaged to be married in two weeks mr adams the typical plodding country banker approved of spencer annabel s pride in him almost equalled her affection he was as much at home in the family of mr adams and that of annabel s married sister as if he were already a member one day jimmy sat down in his room and wrote this letter which he mailed to the safe address of one of his old friends in st louis dear old pal i want you to be at sullivan s place in little rock next wednesday night at nine o clock i want you to wind up some little matters for me and also i want to make you a present of my kit of tools i know you ll be glad to get them you couldn t duplicate the lot for a thousand dollars say billy i ve quit the old

she s an angel she believes in me and i wouldn t do another crooked thing for the whole world be sure to be at sully s for i must see you i ll bring along the tools with me your old friend jimmy on the monday night after jimmy wrote this letter ben price jogged unobtrusively into elmore in a livery buggy he lounged about town in his quiet way until he found out what he wanted to know from the drug store across the street from spencer s shoe store he got a good look at ralph d spencer going to marry the banker s daughter are you jimmy said ben to himself softly well i don t know the next morning jimmy took breakfast at the adamses he was going to little rock that day to order his wedding suit and buy something nice for annabel that would be the first time he had left town since he came to elmore it had been more than a year now since those last professional jobs and he thought he could safely venture out after breakfast quite a family party went downtown together mr adams annabel jimmy and annabel s married sister with her two little girls aged five and nine they came by the hotel where jimmy still boarded and he ran up to his room and brought along his suit case then they went on to the bank there stood jimmy s horse and buggy and dolph gibson who was going to drive him over to the railroad station all went inside the high carved oak railings into the banking room jimmy included for mr adams s future son in law was welcome anywhere the clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good looking agreeable young man who was going to marry miss annabel jimmy set his suit case down annabel whose heart was bubbling with happiness and lively youth put on jimmy s hat and picked up the suit case wouldn t i make a nice drummer said annabel my ralph how heavy it is feels like it was full of gold bricks lot of nickel plated shoe horns in there said jimmy coolly that i m going to return thought i d save express charges by taking them up i m getting awfully economical the elmore bank had just put in a new safe and vault mr adams was very proud of it and insisted on an inspection by every one the vault was a small one but it had a new patented door it fastened with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single handle and had a time lock mr adams beamingly explained its workings to mr spencer who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest the two children may and agatha were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs while they were thus engaged ben price sauntered in and leaned on his elbow looking casually inside between the railings he told the teller that he didn t want anything he was just waiting for a man he knew suddenly there was a scream or two from the women and a commotion unperceived by the elders may the nine year old girl in a spirit of play had shut agatha in the vault she had then shot the bolts and turned the knob of the combination as she had seen mr adams do the old banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment the door can t be opened he groaned the clock hasn t been wound nor the combination set agatha s mother screamed again hysterically hush said mr adams raising his trembling hand all be quite for a moment agatha he called as loudly as he could listen to me during the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror my precious darling wailed the mother she will die of fright open the door oh break it open can t you men do something there isn t a man nearer than little rock who can open that door said mr adams in a shaky voice my god spencer what shall we do that child she can t stand it long in there there isn t enough air and besides she ll go into convulsions from fright agatha s mother frantic now beat the door of the vault with her hands somebody wildly suggested dynamite annabel turned to jimmy her large eyes full of anguish but not yet despairing to a woman nothing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she worships can t you do something ralph try won t you he looked at her with a queer soft smile on his lips and in his keen eyes annabel he said give me that rose you are wearing will you hardly believing that she heard him aright she unpinned the bud from the bosom of her dress and placed it in his hand jimmy stuffed it into his vest pocket threw off his coat and pulled up his shirt sleeves with that act ralph d spencer passed away and jimmy valentine took his place get away from the door all of you he commanded shortly he set his suit case on the table and opened it out flat from that time on he seemed to be unconscious of the presence of any one else he laid out the shining queer implements swiftly and orderly whistling softly to himself as he always did when at work in a deep silence and immovable the others watched him as if under a spell in a minute jimmy s pet drill was biting smoothly into the steel door in ten minutes breaking his own burglarious record he threw back the bolts and opened the door agatha almost collapsed but safe was gathered into her mother s arms jimmy valentine put on his coat and walked outside the railings towards the front door as he went he thought he heard a far away voice that he once knew call ralph but he never hesitated at the door a big man stood somewhat in his way hello ben said jimmy still with his strange smile got around at last have you well let s go i don t know that it makes much difference now and then ben price acted rather strangely guess you re mistaken mr spencer he said don t believe i recognize you your buggy s waiting for you ain t it and ben price turned and strolled down the street cherchez la femme robbins reporter for the picayune and dumars of l abeille the old french newspaper that has buzzed for nearly a century were good friends well proven by years of ups and downs together they were seated where they had a habit of meeting in the little creole haunted cafe of madame tibault in dumaine street if you know the place you will experience a thrill of pleasure in recalling it to mind it is small and dark with six little polished tables at which you may sit and drink the best coffee in new orleans and concoctions of absinthe equal to sazerac s best madame tibault fat and indulgent presides at the desk and takes your money nicolette and meme madame s nieces in charming bib aprons bring the desirable beverages dumars with true creole luxury was sipping his absinthe with half closed eyes in a whirl of cigarette smoke robbins was looking over the morning pic detecting as young reporters will the gross blunders in the make up and the envious blue pencilling his own stuff had received this item in the advertising columns caught his eye and with an exclamation of sudden interest he read it aloud to his friend public auction at three o clock this afternoon there will be sold to the highest bidder all the common property of the little sisters of samaria at the home of the sisterhood in bonhomme street the sale will dispose of the building ground and the complete furnishings of the house and chapel without reserve this notice stirred the two friends to a reminiscent talk concerning an episode in their journalistic career that had occurred about two years before they recalled the incidents went over the old theories and discussed it anew from the different perspective time had brought there were no other customers in the cafe madame s fine ear had caught the line of their talk and she came over to their table for had it not been her lost money her vanished twenty thousand dollars that had set the whole matter going the three took up the long abandoned mystery threshing over the old dry chaff of it it was in the chapel of this house of the little sisters of samaria that robbins and dumars had stood during that eager fruitless news search of theirs and looked upon the gilded statue of the virgin thass so boys said madame summing up thass ver wicked man m sieur morin everybody shall be cert he steal those money i plaze in his hand for keep safe yes he s boun spend that money somehow madame turned a broad and contemplative smile upon dumars i ond stand you m sieur dumars those day you come ask fo tell ev ything i know bout m sieur morin ah yes i know most time when those men lose

statue of virgin mary that m sieur morin present at those p tite soeurs as try find one femme at madame tibault s last words robbins started slightly and cast a keen sidelong glance at dumars the creole sat unmoved dreamily watching the spirals of his cigarette smoke it was then nine o clock in the morning and a few minutes later the two friends separated going different ways to their day s duties and now follows the brief story of madame tibault s vanished thousands new orleans will readily recall to mind the circumstances attendant upon the death of mr gaspard morin in that city mr morin was an artistic goldsmith and jeweller in the old french quarter and a man held in the highest esteem he belonged to one of the oldest french families and was of some distinction as an antiquary and historian he was a bachelor about fifty years of age he lived in quiet comfort at one of those rare old hostelries in royal street he was found in his rooms one morning dead from unknown causes when his affairs came to be looked into it was found that he was practically insolvent his stock of goods and personal property barely but nearly enough to free him from censure covering his liabilities following came the disclosure that he had been entrusted with the sum of twenty thousand dollars by a former upper servant in the morin family one madame tibault which she had received as a legacy from relatives in france the most searching scrutiny by friends and the legal authorities failed to reveal the disposition of the money it had vanished and left no trace some weeks before his death mr morin had drawn the entire amount in gold coin from the bank where it had been placed while he looked about he told madame tibault for a safe investment therefore mr morin s memory seemed doomed to bear the cloud of dishonesty while madame was of course disconsolate then it was that robbins and dumars representing their respective journals began one of those pertinacious private investigations which of late years the press has adopted as a means to glory and the satisfaction of public curiosity cherchez la femme said dumars that s the ticket agreed robbins all roads lead to the eternal feminine we will find the woman they exhausted the knowledge of the staff of mr morin s hotel from the bell boy down to the proprietor they gently but inflexibly pumped the family of the deceased as far as his cousins twice removed they artfully sounded the employees of the late jeweller and dogged his customers for information concerning his habits like bloodhounds they traced every step of the supposed defaulter as nearly as might be for years along the limited and monotonous paths he had trodden at the end of their labours mr morin stood an immaculate man not one weakness that might be served up as a criminal tendency not one deviation from the path of rectitude not even a hint of a predilection for the opposite sex was found to be placed in his debit his life had been as regular and austere as a monk s his habits simple and unconcealed generous charitable and a model in propriety was the verdict of all who knew him what now asked robbins fingering his empty notebook cherchez la femme said dumars lighting a cigarette try lady bellairs this piece of femininity was the race track favourite of the season being feminine she was erratic in her gaits and there were a few heavy losers about town who had believed she could be true the reporters applied for information mr morin certainly not he was never even a spectator at the races not that kind of a man surprised the gentlemen should ask shall we throw it up suggested robbins and let the puzzle department have a try cherchez la femme hummed dumars reaching for a match try the little sisters of what d you call em it had developed during the investigation that mr morin had held this benevolent order in particular favour he had contributed liberally toward its support and had chosen its chapel as his favourite place of private worship it was said that he went there daily to make his devotions at the altar indeed toward the last of his life his whole mind seemed to have fixed itself upon religious matters perhaps to the detriment of his worldly affairs thither went robbins and dumars and were admitted through the narrow doorway in the blank stone wall that frowned upon bonhomme street an old woman was sweeping the chapel she told them that sister felicite the head of the order was then at prayer at the altar in the alcove in a few moments she would emerge heavy black curtains screened the alcove they waited soon the curtains were disturbed and sister felicite came forth she was tall tragic bony and plain featured dressed in the black gown and severe bonnet of the sisterhood robbins a good rough and tumble reporter but lacking the delicate touch began to speak they represented the press the lady had no doubt heard of the morin affair it was necessary in justice to that gentleman s memory to probe the mystery of the lost money it was known that he had come often to this chapel any information now concerning mr morin s habits tastes the friends he had and so on would be of value in doing him posthumous justice sister felicite had heard whatever she knew would be willingly told but it was very little monsieur morin had been a good friend to the order sometimes contributing as much as a hundred dollars the sisterhood was an independent one depending entirely upon private contributions for the means to carry on its charitable work mr morin had presented the chapel with silver candlesticks and an altar cloth he came every day to worship in the chapel sometimes remaining for an hour he was a devout catholic consecrated to holiness yes and also in the alcove was a statue of the virgin that he had himself modeled cast and presented to the order oh it was cruel to cast a doubt upon so good a man robbins was also profoundly grieved at the imputation but until it was found what mr morin had done with madame tibault s money he feared the tongue of slander would not be stilled sometimes in fact very often in affairs of the kind there was er as the saying goes er a lady in the case in absolute confidence now if perhaps sister felicite s large eyes regarded him solemnly there was one woman she said slowly to whom he bowed to whom he gave his heart robbins fumbled rapturously for his pencil behold the woman said sister felicite suddenly in deep tones she reached a long arm and swept aside the curtain of the alcove in there was a shrine lit to a glow of soft colour by the light pouring through a stained glass window within a deep niche in the bare stone wall stood an image of the virgin mary the colour of pure gold dumars a conventional catholic succumbed to the dramatic in the act he bowed his head for an instant and made the sign of the cross the somewhat abashed robbins murmuring an indistinct apology backed awkwardly away sister felicite drew back the curtain and the reporters departed on the narrow sidewalk of bonhomme street robbins turned to dumars with unworthy sarcasm well what next churchy law fem absinthe said dumars with the history of the missing money thus partially related some conjecture may be formed of the sudden idea that madame tibault s words seemed to have suggested to robbins s brain was it so wild a surmise that the religious fanatic had offered up his wealth or rather madame tibault s in the shape of a material symbol of his consuming devotion stranger things have been done in the name of worship was it not possible that the lost thousands were molded into that lustrous image that the goldsmith had formed it of the pure and precious metal and set it there through some hope of a perhaps disordered brain to propitiate the saints and pave the way to his own selfish glory that afternoon at five minutes to three robbins entered the chapel door of the little sisters of samaria he saw in the dim light a crowd of perhaps a hundred people gathered to attend the sale most of them were members of various religious orders priests and churchmen come to purchase the paraphernalia of the chapel lest they fall into desecrating hands others were business men and agents come to bid upon the realty a clerical looking brother had volunteered to wield the hammer bringing to the office of auctioneer the anomaly of choice diction and dignity of manner a few of the minor articles were sold and then two assistants brought forward the image of the virgin robbins started the bidding at ten dollars a stout man in an ecclesiastical garb went to fifteen a voice from another part of the crowd raised to twenty the three bid alternately raising by bids of five until the offer was fifty dollars then the stout man dropped out and robbins as a sort of coup de main went to a hundred one hundred and fifty said the other voice two hundred bid robbins boldly two fifty called his competitor promptly the reporter hesitated for the space of a lightning flash estimating how much he could borrow from the boys in the office and screw from the business manager from his next month s salary three hundred he offered three fifty spoke up the other in a louder voice a voice that sent robbins diving suddenly through the crowd in its direction to catch dumars its owner ferociously by the collar you unconverted idiot hissed robbins close to his ear pool agreed said dumars coolly i couldn t raise three hundred and fifty dollars with a search warrant but i can stand half what you come bidding against me for i thought i was the only fool in the crowd explained robbins no one else bidding the statue was knocked down to the syndicate at their last offer dumars remained with the prize while robbins hurried forth to wring from the resources and credit of both the price he soon returned with the money and the two musketeers loaded their precious package into a carriage and drove with it to dumars s room in old chartres street nearby they lugged it covered with a cloth up the stairs and deposited it on a table a hundred pounds it weighed if an ounce and at that estimate according to their calculation if their daring theory were correct it stood there worth twenty thousand golden dollars robbins removed the covering and opened his pocket knife sacre muttered dumars shuddering it is the mother of christ what would you do shut up judas said robbins coldly it s too late for you to be saved now with a firm hand he chipped a slice from the shoulder of the image the cut showed a dull grayish metal with a thin coating of gold leaf lead announced robbins hurling his knife to the floor gilded to the devil with it said dumars forgetting his scruples i must have a drink together they walked moodily to the cafe of madame tribault two squares away it seemed that madame s mind had been stirred that day to fresh recollections of the past services of the two young men in her behalf you mustn t sit by those table she interposed as they were about to drop into their accustomed seats thass so boys but no i mek you come at this room like my tres bon amis yes i goin mek for you myself one anisette and one cafe royale ver fine ah i lak treat my fren nize yes plis come in this way madame led them into the little back room into which she sometimes invited the especially favoured of her customers in two comfortable armchairs by a big window that opened upon the courtyard she placed them with a low table between bustling hospitably about she began to prepare the promised refreshments it was the first time the reporters had been honoured with admission to the sacred precincts the room was in dusky twilight flecked with gleams of the polished fine woods and burnished glass and metal that the creoles love from the little courtyard a tiny fountain sent in an insinuating sound of trickling waters to which a banana plant by the window kept time with its tremulous leaves robbins an investigator by nature sent a curious glance roving about the room from some barbaric ancestor madame had inherited a penchant for the crude in decoration the walls were adorned with cheap lithographs florid libels upon nature addressed to the taste of the bourgeoisie birthday cards garish newspaper supplements and specimens of art advertising calculated to reduce the optic nerve to stunned submission a patch of something unintelligible in the midst of the more candid display puzzled robbins and he rose and took a step nearer to interrogate it at closer range then he leaned weakly against the wall and called out madame tibault oh madame since when oh since when have you been in the habit of papering your walls with five thousand dollar united states four per cent gold bonds tell me is this a grimm s fairy tale or should i consult an oculist at his words madame tibault and dumars approached h what you say said madame cheerily h what you say m sieur robbin bon ah those

strike you allons said dumars cherchez la femme friends in san rosario the west bound train stopped at san rosario on time at a m a man with a thick black leather wallet under his arm left the train and walked rapidly up the main street of the town there were other passengers who also got off at san rosario but they either slouched limberly over to the railroad eating house or the silver dollar saloon or joined the groups of idlers about the station indecision had no part in the movements of the man with the wallet he was short in stature but strongly built with very light closely trimmed hair smooth determined face and aggressive gold rimmed nose glasses he was well dressed in the prevailing eastern style his air denoted a quiet but conscious reserve force if not actual authority after walking a distance of three squares he came to the centre of the town s business area here another street of importance crossed the main one forming the hub of san rosario s life and commerce upon one corner stood the post office upon another rubensky s clothing emporium the other two diagonally opposing corners were occupied by the town s two banks the first national and the stockmen s national into the first national bank of san rosario the newcomer walked never slowing his brisk step until he stood at the cashier s window the bank opened for business at nine and the working force was already assembled each member preparing his department for the day s business the cashier was examining the mail when he noticed the stranger standing at his window bank doesn t open til nine he remarked curtly but without feeling he had had to make that statement so often to early birds since san rosario adopted city banking hours i am well aware of that said the other man in cool brittle tones will you kindly receive my card the cashier drew the small spotless parallelogram inside the bars of his wicket and read j f c nettlewick national bank examiner oh er will you walk around inside mr er nettlewick your first visit didn t know your business of course walk right around please the examiner was quickly inside the sacred precincts of the bank where he was ponderously introduced to each employee in turn by mr edlinger the cashier a middle aged gentleman of deliberation discretion and method i was kind of expecting sam turner round again pretty soon said mr edlinger sam s been examining us now for about four years i guess you ll find us all right though considering the tightness in business not overly much money on hand but able to stand the storms sir stand the storms mr turner and i have been ordered by the comptroller to exchange districts said the examiner in his decisive formal tones he is covering my old territory in southern illinois and indiana i will take the cash first please perry dorsey the teller was already arranging his cash on the counter for the examiner s inspection he knew it was right to a cent and he had nothing to fear but he was nervous and flustered so was every man in the bank there was something so icy and swift so impersonal and uncompromising about this man that his very presence seemed an accusation he looked to be a man who would never make nor overlook an error mr nettlewick first seized the currency and with a rapid almost juggling motion counted it by packages then he spun the sponge cup toward him and verified the count by bills his thin white fingers flew like some expert musician s upon the keys of a piano he dumped the gold upon the counter with a crash and the coins whined and sang as they skimmed across the marble slab from the tips of his nimble digits the air was full of fractional currency when he came to the halves and quarters he counted the last nickle and dime he had the scales brought and he weighed every sack of silver in the vault he questioned dorsey concerning each of the cash memoranda certain checks charge slips etc carried over from the previous day s work with unimpeachable courtesy yet with something so mysteriously momentous in his frigid manner that the teller was reduced to pink cheeks and a stammering tongue this newly imported examiner was so different from sam turner it had been sam s way to enter the bank with a shout pass the cigars and tell the latest stories he had picked up on his rounds his customary greeting to dorsey had been hello perry haven t skipped out with the boodle yet i see turner s way of counting the cash had been different too he would finger the packages of bills in a tired kind of way and then go into the vault and kick over a few sacks of silver and the thing was done halves and quarters and dimes not for sam turner no chicken feed for me he would say when they were set before him i m not in the agricultural department but then turner was a texan an old friend of the bank s president and had known dorsey since he was a baby while the examiner was counting the cash major thomas b kingman known to every one as major tom the president of the first national drove up to the side door with his old dun horse and buggy and came inside he saw the examiner busy with the money and going into the little pony corral as he called it in which his desk was railed off he began to look over his letters earlier a little incident had occurred that even the sharp eyes of the examiner had failed to notice when he had begun his work at the cash counter mr edlinger had winked significantly at roy wilson the youthful bank messenger and nodded his head slightly toward the front door roy understood got his hat and walked leisurely out with his collector s book under his arm once outside he made a bee line for the stockmen s national that bank was also getting ready to open no customers had as yet presented themselves say you people cried roy with the familiarity of youth and long acquaintance you want to get a move on you there s a new bank examiner over at the first and he s a stem winder he s counting nickles on perry and he s got the whole outfit bluffed mr edlinger gave me the tip to let you know mr buckley president of the stockmen s national a stout elderly man looking like a farmer dressed for sunday heard roy from his private office at the rear and called him has major kingman come down to the bank yet he asked of the boy yes sir he was just driving up as i left said roy i want you to take him a note put it into his own hands as soon as you get back mr buckley sat down and began to write roy returned and handed to major kingman the envelope containing the note the major read it folded it and slipped it into his vest pocket he leaned back in his chair for a few moments as if he were meditating deeply and then rose and went into the vault he came out with the bulky old fashioned leather note case stamped on the back in gilt letters bills discounted in this were the notes due the bank with their attached securities and the major in his rough way dumped the lot upon his desk and began to sort them over by this time nettlewick had finished his count of the cash his pencil fluttered like a swallow over the sheet of paper on which he had set his figures he opened his black wallet which seemed to be also a kind of secret memorandum book made a few rapid figures in it wheeled and transfixed dorsey with the glare of his spectacles that look seemed to say you re safe this time but cash all correct snapped the examiner he made a dash for the individual bookkeeper and for a few minutes there was a fluttering of ledger leaves and a sailing of balance sheets through the air how often do you balance your pass books he demanded suddenly er once a month faltered the individual bookkeeper wondering how many years they would give him all right said the examiner turning and charging upon the general bookkeeper who had the statements of his foreign banks and their reconcilement memoranda ready everything there was found to be all right then the stub book of the certificates of deposit flutter flutter zip zip check all right list of over drafts please thanks h m m unsigned bills of the bank next all right then came the cashier s turn and easy going mr edlinger rubbed his nose and polished his glasses nervously under the quick fire of questions concerning the circulation undivided profits bank real estate and stock ownership presently nettlewick was aware of a big man towering above him at his elbow a man sixty years of age rugged and hale with a rough grizzled beard a mass of gray hair and a pair of penetrating blue eyes that confronted the formidable glasses of the examiner without a flicker er major kingman our president er mr nettlewick said the cashier two men of very different types shook hands one was a finished product of the world of straight lines conventional methods and formal affairs the other was something freer wider and nearer to nature tom kingman had not been cut to any pattern he had been mule driver cowboy ranger soldier sheriff prospector and cattleman now when he was bank president his old comrades from the prairies of the saddle tent and trail found no change in him he had made his fortune when texas cattle were at the high tide of value and had organized the first national bank of san rosario in spite of his largeness of heart and sometimes unwise generosity toward his old friends the bank had prospered for major tom kingman knew men as well as he knew cattle of late years the cattle business had known a depression and the major s bank was one of the few whose losses had not been great and now said the examiner briskly pulling out his watch the last thing is the loans we will take them up now if you please he had gone through the first national at almost record breaking speed but thoroughly as he did everything the running order of the bank was smooth and clean and that had facilitated his work there was but one other bank in the town he received from the government a fee of twenty five dollars for each bank that he examined he should be able to go over those loans and discounts in half an hour if so he could examine the other bank immediately afterward and catch the the only other train that day in the direction he was working otherwise he would have to spend the night and sunday in this uninteresting western town that was why mr nettlewick was rushing matters come with me sir said major kingman in his deep voice that united the southern drawl with the rhythmic twang of the west we will go over them together nobody in the bank knows those notes as i do some of em are a little wobbly on their legs and some are mavericks without extra many brands on their backs but they ll most all pay out at the round up the two sat down at the president s desk first the examiner went through the notes at lightning speed and added up their total finding it to agree with the amount of loans carried on the book of daily balances next he took up the larger loans inquiring scrupulously into the condition of their endorsers or securities the new examiner s mind seemed to course and turn and make unexpected dashes hither and thither like a bloodhound seeking a trail finally he pushed aside all the notes except a few which he arranged in a neat pile before him and began a dry formal little speech i find sir the condition of your bank to be very good considering the poor crops and the depression in the cattle interests of your state the clerical work seems to be done accurately and punctually your past due paper is moderate in amount and promises only a small loss i would recommend the calling in of your large loans and the making of only sixty and ninety day or call loans until general business revives and now there is one thing more and i will have finished with the bank here are six notes aggregating something like they are secured according to their faces by various stocks bonds shares etc to the value of those securities are missing from the notes to which they should be attached i suppose you have them in the safe or vault you will permit me to examine them major tom s light blue eyes turned unflinchingly toward the examiner no sir he said in a low but steady tone those securities are neither in the safe nor in the vault i have taken them you may hold me personally responsible for their absence nettlewick felt a slight thrill he had not expected this he had struck a momentous trail when the hunt was drawing to a close ah said the examiner he waited a moment and then continued may i ask you to explain more definitely the securities were taken by me repeated the major it was not for my own use but to save an old friend in trouble come in here sir and we ll talk it over he led the examiner into the bank s private office at the rear and closed the door there was a desk and a table and half a dozen leather covered chairs on the wall was the mounted head of a texas steer with horns five feet from tip to tip opposite hung the major s old cavalry saber that he had carried at shiloh and fort pillow placing a chair for nettlewick the major seated himself by the window from which he could see the post office and the carved limestone front of the stockmen s national he did not speak at once and nettlewick felt perhaps that the ice could be broken by something so near its own temperature as the voice of official warning your statement he began since you have failed to modify it amounts as you must know to a very serious thing you are aware also of what my duty must compel me to do i shall have to go before the united states commissioner and make i know i know said major tom with a wave of his hand you don t suppose i d run a bank without being posted on national banking laws and the revised statutes do your duty i m not asking any favours but i spoke of my friend i did want you to hear me tell you about bob nettlewick settled himself in his chair there would be no leaving san rosario for him that day he would have to telegraph to the comptroller of the currency he would have to swear out a warrant before the united states commissioner for the arrest of major kingman perhaps he would be ordered to close the bank on account of the loss of the securities it was not the first crime the examiner had unearthed once or twice the terrible upheaval of human emotions that his investigations had loosed had almost caused a ripple in his official calm he had seen bank men kneel and plead and cry like women for a chance an hour s time the overlooking of a single error one cashier had shot himself at his desk before him none of them had taken it with the dignity and coolness of this stern old westerner nettlewick felt that he owed it to him at least to listen if he wished to talk with his elbow on the arm of his chair and his square chin resting upon the fingers of his right hand the bank examiner waited to hear the confession of the president of the first national bank of san rosario when a man s your friend began major tom somewhat didactically for forty years and tried by water fire earth and cyclones when you can do him a little favour you feel like doing it embezzle for him worth of securities thought the examiner we were cowboys together bob and i continued the major speaking slowly and deliberately and musingly as if his thoughts were rather with the past than the critical present and we prospected together for gold and silver over arizona new mexico and a good part of california we were both in the war of sixty one but in different commands we ve fought indians and horse thieves side by side we ve starved for weeks in a cabin in the arizona mountains buried twenty feet deep in snow we ve ridden herd together when the wind blew so hard the lightning couldn t strike well bob and i have been through some rough spells since the first time we met in the branding camp of the old anchor bar ranch and during that time we ve found it necessary more than once to help each other out of tight places in those days it was expected of a man to stick to his friend and he didn t ask any credit for it probably next day you d need him to get at your back and help stand off a band of apaches or put a tourniquet on your leg above a rattlesnake bite and ride for whisky so after all it was give and take and if you didn t stand square with your pardner why you might be shy one when you needed him but bob was a man who was willing to go further than that he never played a limit twenty years ago i was sheriff of this country and i made bob my chief deputy that was before the boom in cattle when we both made our stake i was sheriff and collector and it was a big thing for me then i was married and we had a boy and a girl a four and a six year old there was a comfortable house next to the courthouse furnished by the county rent free and i was saving some money bob did most of the office work both of us had seen rough times and plenty of rustling and danger and i tell you it was great to hear the rain and the sleet dashing against the windows of nights and be warm and safe and comfortable and know you could get up in the morning and be shaved and have folks call you mister and then i had the finest wife and kids that ever struck the range and my old friend with me enjoying the first fruits of prosperity and white shirts and i guess i was happy yes i was happy about that time the major sighed and glanced casually out of the window the bank examiner changed his position and leaned his chin upon his other hand one winter continued the major the money for the county taxes came pouring in so fast that i didn t have time to take the stuff to the bank for a week i just shoved the checks into a cigar box and the money into a sack and locked them in the big safe that belonged to the sheriff s office i had been overworked that week and was about sick anyway my nerves were out of order and my sleep at night didn t seem to rest me the doctor had some scientific name for it and i was taking medicine and so added to the rest i went to bed at night with that money on my mind not that there was much need of being worried for the safe was a good one and nobody but bob and i knew the combination on friday night there was about in cash in the bag on saturday morning i went to the office as usual the safe was locked and bob was writing at his desk i opened the safe and the money was gone i called bob and roused everybody in the court house to announce the robbery it struck me that bob took it pretty quiet considering how much it reflected upon both him and me two days went by and we never got a clew it couldn t have been burglars for the safe had been opened by the combination in the proper way people must have begun to talk for one afternoon in comes alice that s my wife and the boy and girl and alice stamps her foot and her eyes flash and she cries out the lying wretches tom tom and i catch her in a faint and bring her round little by little and she lays her head down and cries and cries for the first time since she took tom kingman s name and fortunes and jack and zilla the youngsters they were always wild as tiger cubs to rush over bob and climb all over him whenever they were allowed to come to the court house they stood and kicked their little shoes and herded together like scared partridges they were having their first trip down into the shadows of life bob was working at his desk and he got up and went out without a word the grand jury was in session then and the next morning bob went before them and confessed that he stole the money he said he lost it in a poker game in fifteen minutes they had found a true bill and sent me the warrant to arrest the man with whom i d been closer than a thousand brothers for many a year i did it and then i said to bob pointing there s my house and here s my office and up there s maine and out that way is california and over there is florida and that s your range til court meets you re in my charge and i take the responsibility you be here when you re wanted thanks tom he said kind of carelessly i was sort of hoping you wouldn t lock me up court meets next monday so if you don t object i ll just loaf around the office until then i ve got one favour to ask if it isn t too much if you d let the kids come out in the yard once in a while and have a romp i d like it why not i answered him they re welcome and so are you and come to my house the same as ever you see mr nettlewick you can t make a friend of a thief but neither can you make a thief of a friend all at once the examiner made no answer at that moment was heard the shrill whistle of a locomotive pulling into the depot that was the train on the little narrow gauge road that struck into san rosario from the south the major cocked his ear and listened for a moment and looked at his watch the narrow gauge was in on time the major continued so bob hung around the office reading the papers and smoking i put another deputy to work in his place and after a while the first excitement of the case wore off one day when we were alone in the office bob came over to where i was sitting he looked sort of grim and blue the same look he used to get when he d been up watching for indians all night or herd riding tom says he it s harder than standing off redskins it s harder than lying in the lava desert forty miles from water but i m going to stick it out to the end you know that s been my style but if you d tip me the smallest kind of a sign if you d just say bob i understand why it would make it lots easier i was surprised i don t know what you mean bob i said of course you know that i d do anything under the sun to help you that i could but you ve got me guessing all right tom was all he said and he went back to his newspaper and lit another cigar it was the night before court met when i found out what he meant i went to bed that night with that same old light headed nervous feeling come back upon me i dropped off to sleep about midnight when i awoke i was standing half dressed in one of the court house corridors bob was holding one of my arms our family doctor the other and alice was shaking me and half crying she had sent for the doctor without my knowing it and when he came they had found me out of bed and missing and had begun a search sleep walking said the doctor all of us went back to the house and the doctor told us some remarkable stories about the strange things people had done while in that condition i was feeling rather chilly after my trip out and as my wife was out of the room at the time i pulled open the door of an old wardrobe that stood in the room and dragged out a big quilt i had seen in there with it tumbled out the bag of money for stealing which bob was to be tried and convicted in the morning how the jumping rattlesnakes did that get there i yelled and all hands must have seen how surprised i was bob knew in a flash you darned old snoozer he said with the old time look on his face i saw you put it there i watched you open the safe and take it out and i followed you i looked through the window and saw you hide it in that wardrobe then you blankety blank flop eared sheep headed coyote what did you say you took it for because said bob simply i didn t know you were asleep i saw him glance toward the door of the room where jack and zilla were and i knew then what it meant to be a man s friend from bob s point of view major tom paused and again directed his glance out of the window he saw some one in the stockmen s national bank reach and draw a yellow shade down the whole length of its plate glass big front window although the position of the sun did not seem to warrant such a defensive movement against its rays nettlewick sat up straight in his chair he had listened patiently but without consuming interest to the major s story it had impressed him as irrelevant to the situation and it could certainly have no effect upon the consequences those western people he thought had an exaggerated sentimentality they were not business like they needed to be protected from their friends evidently the major had concluded and what he had said amounted to nothing may i ask said the examiner if you have anything further to say that bears directly upon the question of those abstracted securities abstracted securities sir major tom turned suddenly in his chair his blue eyes flashing upon the examiner what do you mean sir he drew from his coat pocket a batch of folded papers held together by a rubber band tossed them into nettlewick s hands and rose to his feet you ll find those securities there sir every stock bond and share of em i took them from the notes while you were counting the cash examine and compare them for yourself the major led the way back into the banking room the examiner astounded perplexed nettled at sea followed he felt that he had been made the victim of something that was not exactly a hoax but that left him in the shoes of one who had been played upon used and then discarded without even an inkling of the game perhaps also his official position had been irreverently juggled with but there was nothing he could take hold of an official report of the matter would be an absurdity and somehow he felt that he would never know anything more about the matter than he did then frigidly mechanically nettlewick examined the securities found them to tally with the notes gathered his black wallet and rose to depart i will say he protested turning the indignant glare of his glasses upon major kingman that your statements your misleading statements which you have not condescended to explain do not appear to be quite the thing regarded either as business or humour i do not understand such motives or actions major tom looked down at him serenely and not unkindly son he said there are plenty of things in the chaparral and on the prairies and up the canyons that you don t understand but i want to thank you for listening to a garrulous old man s prosy story we old texans love to talk about our adventures and our old comrades and the home folks have long ago learned to run when we begin with once upon a time so we have to spin our yarns to the stranger within our gates the major smiled but the examiner only bowed coldly and abruptly quitted the bank they saw him travel diagonally across the street in a straight line and enter the stockmen s national bank major tom sat down at his desk and drew from his vest pocket the note roy had given him he had read it once but hurriedly and now with something like a twinkle in his eyes he read it again these were the words he read dear tom i hear there s one of uncle sam s grayhounds going through you and that means that we ll catch him inside of a couple of hours maybe now i want you to do something for me we ve got just in the bank and the law requires that we have i let ross and fisher have late yesterday afternoon to buy up that gibson bunch of cattle they ll realise in less than thirty days on the transaction but that won t make my cash on hand look any prettier to that bank examiner now i can t show him those notes for they re just plain notes of hand without any security in sight but you know very well that pink ross and jim fisher are two of the finest white men god ever made and they ll do the square thing you remember jim fisher he was the one who shot that faro dealer in el paso i wired sam bradshaw s bank to send me and it will get in on the narrow gauge at you can t let a bank examiner in to count and close your doors tom you hold that examiner hold him hold him if you have to rope him and sit on his head watch our front window after the narrow gauge gets in and when we ve got the cash inside we ll pull down the shade for a signal don t turn him loose till then i m counting on you tom your old pard bob buckly prest stockmen s national the major began to tear the note into small pieces and throw them into his waste basket he gave a satisfied chuckle as he did so confounded old reckless cowpuncher he growled contentedly that pays him some on account for what he tried to do for me in the sheriff s office twenty years ago the fourth in salvador on a summer s day while the city was rocking with the din and red uproar of patriotism billy casparis told me this story in his way billy is ulysses jr like satan he comes from going to and fro upon the earth and walking up and down in it to morrow morning while you are cracking your breakfast egg he may be off with his little alligator grip to boom a town site in the middle of lake okeechobee or to trade horses with the patagonians we sat at a little round table and between us were glasses holding big lumps of ice and above us leaned an artificial palm and because our scene was set with the properties of the one they recalled to his mind billy was stirred to narrative it reminds me said he of a fourth i helped to celebrate down in salvador twas while i was running an ice factory down there after i unloaded that silver mine i had in colorado i had what they called a conditional concession they made me put up a thousand dollars cash forfeit that i would make ice continuously for six months if i did that i could draw down my ante if i failed to do so the government took the pot so the inspectors kept dropping in trying to catch me without the goods one day when the thermometer was at the clock at half past one and the calendar at july third two of the little brown oily nosers in red trousers slid in to make an inspection now the factory hadn t turned out a pound of ice in three weeks for a couple of reasons the salvador heathen wouldn t buy it they said it make things cold they put it in and i couldn t make any more because i was broke all i was holding on for was to get down my thousand so i could leave the country the six months would be up on the sixth of july well i showed em all the ice i had i raised the lid of a darkish vat and there was an elegant pound block of ice beautiful and convincing to the eye i was about to close down the lid again when one of those brunette sleuths flops down on his red knees and lays a slanderous and violent hand on my guarantee of good faith and in two minutes more they had dragged out on the floor that fine chunk of molded glass that had cost me fifty dollars to have shipped down from frisco ice y says the fellow that played me the dishonourable trick verree warm ice y yes the day is that hot senor yes maybeso it is of desirableness to leave him out to get the cool yes yes says i yes for i knew they had me touching s believing ain t it boys yes now there s some might say the seats of your trousers are sky blue but tis my opinion they are red let s apply the tests of the laying on of hands and feet and so i hoisted both those inspectors out the door on the toe of my shoe and sat down to cool off on my block of disreputable glass and as i live without oats while i sat there homesick for money and without a cent to my ambition there came on the breeze the most beautiful smell my nose had entered for a year god knows where it came from in that backyard of a country it was a bouquet of soaked lemon peel cigar stumps and stale beer exactly the smell of goldbrick charley s place on fourteenth street where i used to play pinochle of afternoons with the third rate actors and that smell drove my troubles through me and clinched em at the back i began to long for my country and feel sentiments about it and i said words about salvador that you wouldn t think could come legitimate out of an ice factory and while i was sitting there down through the blazing sunshine in his clean white clothes comes maximilian jones an american interested in rubber and rosewood great carrambos says i when he stepped in for i was in a bad temper didn t i have catastrophes enough i know what you want you want to tell me that story again about johnny ammiger and the widow on the train you ve told it nine times already this month it must be the heat says jones stopping in at the door amazed poor billy he s got bugs sitting on ice and calling his best friends pseudonyms hi muchacho jones called my force of employees who was sitting in the sun playing with his toes and told him to put on his trousers and run for the doctor come back says i sit down maxy and forget it tis not ice you see nor a lunatic upon it tis only an exile full of homesickness sitting on a lump of glass that s just cost him a thousand dollars now what was it johnny said to the widow first i d like to hear it again maxy honest don t mind what i said maximilian jones and i sat down and talked he was about as sick of the country as i was for the grafters were squeezing him for half the profits of his rosewood and rubber down in the bottom of a tank of water i had a dozen bottles of sticky frisco beer and i fished these up and we fell to talking about home and the flag and hail columbia and home fried potatoes and the drivel we contributed would have sickened any man enjoying those blessings but at that time we were out of em you can t appreciate home till you ve left it money till it s spent your wife till she s joined a woman s club nor old glory till you see it hanging on a broomstick on the shanty of a consul in a foreign town and sitting there me and maximilian jones scratching at our prickly heat and kicking at the lizards on the floor became afflicted with a dose of patriotism and affection for our country there was me billy casparis reduced from a capitalist to a pauper by over addiction to my glass in the lump declares my troubles off for the present and myself to be an uncrowned sovereign of the greatest country on earth and maximilian jones pours out whole drug stores of his wrath on oligarchies and potentates in red trousers and calico shoes and we issues a declaration of interference in which we guarantee that the fourth day of july shall be celebrated in salvador with all the kinds of salutes explosions honours of war oratory and liquids known to tradition yes neither me nor jones breathed with soul so dead there shall be rucuses in salvador we say and the monkeys had better climb the tallest cocoanut trees and the fire department get out its red sashes and two tin buckets about this time into the factory steps a native man incriminated by the name of general mary esperanza dingo he was some pumpkin both in politics and colour and the friend of me and jones he was full of politeness and a kind of intelligence having picked up the latter and managed to preserve the former during a two years residence in philadelphia studying medicine for a salvadorian he was not such a calamitous little man though he always would play jack queen king ace deuce for a straight general mary sits with us and has a bottle while he was in the states he had acquired a synopsis of the english language and the art of admiring our institutions by and by the general gets up and tiptoes to the doors and windows and other stage entrances remarking hist at each one they all do that in salvador before they ask for a drink of water or the time of day being conspirators from the cradle and matinee idols by proclamation hist says general dingo again and then he lays his chest on the table quite like gaspard the miser good friends senores to morrow will be the great day of liberty and independence the hearts of americans and salvadorians should beat together of your history and your great washington i know is it not so now me and jones thought that nice of the general to remember when the fourth came it made us feel good he must have heard the news going round in philadelphia about that disturbance we had with england yes says me and maxy together we knew it we were talking about it when you came in and you can bet your bottom concession that there ll be fuss and feathers in the air to morrow we are few in numbers but the welkin may as well reach out to push the button for it s got to ring i too shall assist says the general thumping his collar bone i too am on the side of liberty noble americans we will make the day one to be never forgotten for us american whisky says jones none of your scotch smoke or anisada or three star hennessey to morrow we ll borrow the consul s flag old man billfinger shall make orations and we ll have a barbecue on the plaza fireworks says i will be scarce but we ll have all the cartridges in the shops for our guns i ve got two navy sixes i brought from denver there is one cannon said the general one big cannon that will go boom and three hundred men with rifles to shoot oh say says jones generalissimo you re the real silk elastic we ll make it a joint international celebration please general get a white horse and a blue sash and be grand marshal with my sword says the general rolling his eyes i shall ride at the head of the brave men who gather in the name of liberty and you might we suggest see the commandante and advise him that we are going to prize things up a bit we americans you know are accustomed to using municipal regulations for gun wadding when we line up to help the eagle scream he might suspend the rules for one day we don t want to get in the calaboose for spanking his soldiers if they get in our way do you see hist says general mary the commandant is with us heart and soul he will aid us he is one of us we made all the arrangements that afternoon there was a buck coon from georgia in salvador who had drifted down there from a busted up coloured colony that had been started on some possumless land in mexico as soon as he heard us say barbecue he wept for joy and groveled on the ground he dug his trench on the plaza and got half a beef on the coals for an all night roast me and maxy went to see the rest of the americans in the town and they all sizzled like a seidlitz with joy at the idea of solemnizing an old time fourth there were six of us all together martin dillard a coffee planter henry barnes a railroad man old man billfinger an educated tintype taker me and jonesy and jerry the boss of the barbecue there was also an englishman in town named sterrett who was there to write a book on domestic architecture of the insect world we felt some bashfulness about inviting a britisher to help crow over his own country but we decided to risk it out of our personal regard for him we found sterrett in pajamas working at his manuscript with a bottle of brandy for a paper weight englishman says jones let us interrupt your disquisition on bug houses for a moment to morrow is the fourth of july we don t want to hurt your feelings but we re going to commemorate the day when we licked you by a little refined debauchery and nonsense something that can be heard above five miles off if you are broad gauged enough to taste whisky at your own wake we d be pleased to have you join us do you know says sterrett setting his glasses on his nose i like your cheek in asking me if i ll join you blast me if i don t you might have known i would without asking not as a traitor to my own country but for the intrinsic joy of a blooming row on the morning of the fourth i woke up in that old shanty of an ice factory feeling sore i looked around at the wreck of all i possessed and my heart was full of bile from where i lay on my cot i could look through the window and see the consul s old ragged stars and stripes hanging over his shack you re all kinds of a fool billy casparis i said to myself and of all your crimes against sense it does look like this idea of celebrating the fourth should receive the award of demerit your business is busted up your thousand dollars is gone into the kitty of this corrupt country on that last bluff you made you ve got just fifteen chili dollars left worth forty six cents each at bedtime last night and steadily going down to day you ll blow in your last cent hurrahing for that flag and to morrow you ll be living on bananas from the stalk and screwing your drinks out of your friends what s the flag done for you while you were under it you worked for what you got you wore your finger nails down skinning suckers and salting mines and driving bears and alligators off your town lot additions how much does patriotism count for on deposit with the little man with the green eye shade in the savings bank adds up your book suppose you were to get pinched over here in this irreligious country for some little crime or other and appealed to your country for protection what would it do for you turn your appeal over to a committee of one railroad man an army officer a member of each labour union and a coloured man to investigate whether any of your ancestors were ever related to a cousin of mark hanna and then file the papers in the smithsonian institution until after the next election that s the kind of a sidetrack the stars and stripes would switch you onto you can see that i was feeling like an indigo plant but after i washed my face in some cool water and got out my navys and ammunition and started up to the saloon of the immaculate saints where we were to meet i felt better and when i saw those other american boys come swaggering into the trysting place cool easy conspicuous fellows ready to risk any kind of a one card draw or to fight grizzlies fire or extradition i began to feel glad i was one of em so i says to myself again billy you ve got fifteen dollars and a country left this morning blow in the dollars and blow up the town as an american gentleman should on independence day it is my recollection that we began the day along conventional lines the six of us for sterrett was along made progress among the cantinas divesting the bars as we went of all strong drink bearing american labels we kept informing the atmosphere as to the glory and preeminence of the united states and its ability to subdue outjump and eradicate the other nations of the earth and as the findings of american labels grew more plentiful we became more contaminated with patriotism maximilian jones hopes that our late foe mr sterrett will not take offense at our enthusiasm he sets down his bottle and shakes sterrett s hand as white man to white man says he denude our uproar of the slightest taint of personality excuse us for bunker hill patrick henry and waldorf astor and such grievances as might lie between us as nations fellow hoodlums says sterrett on behalf of the queen i ask you to cheese it it is an honour to be a guest at disturbing the peace under the american flag let us chant the passionate strains of yankee doodle while the senor behind the bar mitigates the occasion with another round of cochineal and aqua fortis old man billfinger being charged with a kind of rhetoric makes speeches every time we stop we explained to such citizens as we happened to step on that we were celebrating the dawn of our own private brand of liberty and to please enter such inhumanities as we might commit on the list of unavoidable casualties about eleven o clock our bulletins read a considerable rise in temperature accompanied by thirst and other alarming symptoms we hooked arms and stretched our line across the narrow streets all of us armed with winchesters and navys for purposes of noise and without malice we stopped on a street corner and fired a dozen or so rounds and began a serial assortment of united states whoops and yells probably the first ever heard in that town when we made that noise things began to liven up we heard a pattering up a side street and here came general mary esperanza dingo on a white horse with a couple of hundred brown boys following him in red undershirts and bare feet dragging guns ten feet long jones and me had forgot all about general mary and his promise to help us celebrate we fired another salute and gave another yell while the general shook hands with us and waved his sword oh general shouts jones this is great this will be a real pleasure to the eagle get down and have a drink drink says the general no there is no time to drink vive la libertad don t forget e pluribus unum says henry barnes viva it good and strong says i likewise viva george washington god save the union and i says bowing to sterrett don t discard the queen thanks says sterrett the next round s mine all in to the bar army too but we were deprived of sterrett s treat by a lot of gunshots several square sway which general dingo seemed to think he ought to look after he spurred his old white plug up that way and the soldiers scuttled along after him mary is a real tropical bird says jones he s turned out the infantry to help us to honour to the fourth we ll get that cannon he spoke of after a while and fire some window breakers with it but just now i want some of that barbecued beef let us on to the plaza there we found the meat gloriously done and jerry waiting anxious we sat around on the grass and got hunks of it on our tin plates maximilian jones always made tender hearted by drink cried some because george washington couldn t be there to enjoy the day there was a man i love billy he says weeping on my shoulder poor george to think he s gone and missed the fireworks a little more salt please jerry from what we could hear general dingo seemed to be kindly contributing some noise while we feasted there were guns going off around town and pretty soon we heard that cannon go boom just as he said it would and then men began to skin along the edge of the plaza dodging in among the orange trees and houses we certainly had things stirred up in salvador we felt proud of the occasion and grateful to general dingo sterrett was about to take a bite off a juicy piece of rib when a bullet took it away from his mouth somebody s celebrating with ball cartridges says he reaching for another piece little over zealous for a non resident patriot isn t it don t mind it i says to him twas an accident they happen you know on the fourth after one reading of the declaration of independence in new york i ve known the s r o sign to be hung out at all the hospitals and police stations but then jerry gives a howl and jumps up with one hand clapped to the back of his leg where another bullet has acted over zealous and then comes a quantity of yells and round a corner and across the plaza gallops general mary esperanza dingo embracing the neck of his horse with his men running behind him mostly dropping their guns by way of discharging ballast and chasing em all is a company of feverish little warriors wearing blue trousers and caps assistance amigos the general shouts trying to stop his horse assistance in the name of liberty that s the campania azul the president s bodyguard says jones what a shame they ve jumped on poor old mary just because he was helping us to celebrate come on boys it s our fourth do we let that little squad of a d t s break it up i vote no says martin dillard gathering his winchester it s the privilege of an american citizen to drink drill dress up and be dreadful on the fourth of july no matter whose country he s in fellow citizens says old man billfinger in the darkest hour of freedom s birth when our brave forefathers promulgated the principles of undying liberty they never expected that a bunch of blue jays like that should be allowed to bust up an anniversary let us preserve and protect the constitution we made it unanimous and then we gathered our guns and assaulted the blue troops in force we fired over their heads and then charged em with a yell and they broke and ran we were irritated at having our barbecue disturbed and we chased em a quarter of a mile some of em we caught and kicked hard the general rallied his troops and joined in the chase finally they scattered in a thick banana grove and we couldn t flush a single one so we sat down and rested if i were to be put severe through the third degree i wouldn t be able to tell much about the rest of the day i mind that we pervaded the town considerable calling upon the people to bring out more armies for us to destroy i remember seeing a crowd somewhere and a tall man that wasn t billfinger making a fourth of july speech from a balcony and that was about all somebody must have hauled the old ice factory up to where i was and put it around me for there s where i was when i woke up the next morning as soon as i could recollect by name and address i got up and held an inquest my last cent was gone i was all in and then a neat black carriage drives to the door and out steps general dingo and a bay man in a silk hat and tan shoes yes says i to myself i see it now you re the chief de policeos and high lord chamberlain of the calaboosum and you want billy casparis for excess of patriotism and assault with intent all right might as well be in jail anyhow but it seems that general mary is smiling and the bay man shakes my hand and speaks in the american dialect general dingo has informed me senor casparis of your gallant service in our cause i desire to thank you with my person the bravery of you and the other senores americanos turned the struggle for liberty in our favour our party triumphed the terrible battle will live forever in history battle says i what battle and i ran my mind back along history trying to think senor casparis is modest says general dingo he led his brave compadres into the thickest of the fearful conflict yes without their aid the revolution would have failed why now says i don t tell me there was a revolution yesterday that was only a fourth of but right there i abbreviated it seemed to me it might be best after the terrible struggle says the bay man president bolano was forced to fly to day caballo is president by proclamation ah yes beneath the new administration i am the head of the department of mercantile concessions on my file i find one report senor casparis that you have not made ice in accord with your contract and here the bay man smiles at me cute oh well says i i guess the report s straight i know they caught me that s all there is to it do not say so says the bay man he pulls off a glove and goes over and lays his hand on that chunk of glass ice says he nodding his head solemn general dingo also steps over and feels of it ice says the general i ll swear to it if senor casparis says the bay man will present himself to the treasury on the sixth day of this month he will receive back the thousand dollars he did deposit as a forfeit adios senor the general and the bay man bowed themselves out and i bowed as often as they did and when the carriage rolls away through the sand i bows once more deeper than ever till my hat touches the ground but this time twas not intended for them for over their heads i saw the old flag fluttering in the breeze above the consul s roof and twas to it i made my profoundest salute the emancipation of billy in the old old square porticoed mansion with the wry window shutters and the paint peeling off in discoloured flakes lived one of the last war governors the south has forgotten the enmity of the great conflict but it refuses to abandon its old traditions and idols in governor pemberton as he was still fondly called the inhabitants of elmville saw the relic of their state s ancient greatness and glory in his day he had been a man large in the eye of his country his state had pressed upon him every honour within its gift and now when he was old and enjoying a richly merited repose outside the swift current of public affairs his townsmen loved to do him reverence for the sake of the past the governor s decaying mansion stood upon the main street of elmville within a few feet of its rickety paling fence every morning the governor would descend the steps with extreme care and deliberation on account of his rheumatism and then the click of his gold headed cane would be heard as he slowly proceeded up the rugged brick sidewalk he was now nearly seventy eight but he had grown old gracefully and beautifully his rather long smooth hair and flowing parted whiskers were snow white his full skirted frock croak was always buttoned snugly about his tall spare figure he wore a high well kept silk hat known as a plug in elmville and nearly always gloves his manners were punctilious and somewhat overcharged with courtesy the governor s walks up lee avenue the principal street developed in their course into a sort of memorial triumphant procession everyone he met saluted him with profound respect many would remove their hats those who were honoured with his personal friendship would pause to shake hands and then you would see exemplified the genuine beau ideal southern courtesy upon reaching the corner of the second square from the mansion the governor would pause another street crossed the venue there and traffic to the extent of several farmers wagons and a peddler s cart or two would rage about the junction then the falcon eye of general deffenbaugh would perceive the situation and the general would hasten with ponderous solicitude from his office in the first national bank building to the assistance of his old friend when the two exchanged greetings the decay of modern manners would become accusingly apparent the general s bulky and commanding figure would bend lissomely at a point where you would have regarded its ability to do so with incredulity the governor would take the general s arm and be piloted safely between the hay wagons and the sprinkling cart to the other side of the street proceeding to the post office in the care of his friend the esteemed statesmen would there hold an informal levee among the citizens who were come for their morning mail here gathering two or three prominent in law politics or family the pageant would make a stately progress along the avenue stopping at the palace hotel where perhaps would be found upon the register the name of some guest deemed worthy of an introduction to the state s venerable and illustrious son if any such were found an hour or two would be spent in recalling the faded glories of the governor s long vanished administration on the return march the general would invariably suggest that his excellency being no doubt fatigued it would be wise to recuperate for a few minutes at the drug emporium of mr appleby r fentress an elegant gentleman sir one of the chatham county fentresses so many of our best blooded families have had to go into trade sir since the war mr appleby r fentress was a connoisseur in fatigue indeed if he had not been his memory alone should have enabled him to prescribe for the majestic invasion of his pharmacy was a casual happening that had surprised him almost daily for years mr fentress knew the formula of and possessed the skill to compound a certain potion antagonistic to fatigue the salient ingredient of which he described no doubt in pharmaceutical terms as genuine old hand made clover leaf private stock nor did the ceremony of administering the potion ever vary mr fentress would first compound two of the celebrated mixtures one for the governor and the other for the general to sample then the governor would make this little speech in his high piping quavering voice no sir not one drop until you have prepared one for yourself and join us mr fentress your father sir was one of my most valued supporters and friends during my administration and any mark of esteem i can confer upon his son is not only a pleasure but a duty sir blushing with delight at the royal condescension the druggist would obey and all would drink to the general s toast the prosperity of our grand old state gentlemen the memory of her glorious past the health of her favourite son some one of the old guard was always at hand to escort the governor home sometimes the general s business duties denied him the privilege and then judge broomfield or colonel titus or one of the ashford county slaughters would be on hand to perform the rite such were the observances attendant upon the governor s morning stroll to the post office how much more magnificent impressive and spectacular then was the scene at public functions when the general would lead forth the silver haired relic of former greatness like some rare and fragile waxwork figure and trumpet his pristine eminence to his fellow citizens general deffenbaugh was the voice of elmville some said he was elmville at any rate he had no competitor as the mouthpiece he owned enough stock in the daily banner to dictate its utterance enough shares in the first national bank to be the referee of its loans and a war record that left him without a rival for first place at barbecues school commencements and decoration days besides these acquirements he was possessed with endowments his personality was inspiring and triumphant undisputed sway had moulded him to the likeness of a fatted roman emperor the tones of his voice were not otherwise than clarion to say that the general was public spirited would fall short of doing him justice he had spirit enough for a dozen publics and as a sure foundation for it all he had a heart that was big and stanch yes general deffenbaugh was elmville one little incident that usually occurred during the governor s morning walk has had its chronicling delayed by more important matters the procession was accustomed to halt before a small brick office on the avenue fronted by a short flight of steep wooden steps a modest tin sign over the door bore the words wm b pemberton attorney at law looking inside the general would roar hello billy my boy the less distinguished members of the escort would call morning billy the governor would pipe good morning william then a patient looking little man with hair turning gray along the temples would come down the steps and shake hands with each one of the party all elmville shook hands when it met the formalities concluded the little man would go back to his table heaped with law books and papers while the procession would proceed billy pemberton was as his sign declared a lawyer by profession by occupation and common consent he was the son of his father this was the shadow in which billy lived the pit out of which he had unsuccessfully striven for years to climb and he had come to believe the grave in which his ambitions were destined to be buried filial respect and duty he paid beyond the habit of most sons but he aspired to be known and appraised by his own deeds and worth after many years of tireless labour he had become known in certain quarters far from elmville as a master of the principles of the law twice he had gone to washington and argued cases before the highest tribunal with such acute logic and learning that the silken gowns on the bench had rustled from the force of it his income from his practice had grown until he was able to support his father in the old family mansion which neither of them would have thought of abandoning rickety as it was in the comfort and almost the luxury of the old extravagant days yet he remained to elmville as only billy pemberton the son of our distinguished and honoured fellow townsman ex governor pemberton thus was he introduced at public gatherings where he sometimes spoke haltingly and prosily for his talents were too serious and deep for extempore brilliancy thus was he presented to strangers and to the lawyers who made the circuit of the courts and so the daily banner referred to him in print to be the son of was his doom what ever he should accomplish would have to be sacrificed upon the altar of this magnificent but fatal parental precedence the peculiarity and the saddest thing about billy s ambition was that the only world he thirsted to conquer was elmville his nature was diffident and unassuming national or state honours might have oppressed him but above all things he hungered for the appreciation of the friends among whom he had been born and raised he would not have plucked one leaf from the garlands that were so lavishly bestowed upon his father he merely rebelled against having his own wreathes woven from those dried and self same branches but elmville billied and sonned him to his concealed but lasting chagrin until at length he grew more reserved and formal and studious than ever there came a morning when billy found among his mail a letter from a very high source tendering him the appointment to an important judicial position in the new island possessions of our country the honour was a distinguished one for the entire nation had discussed the probable recipients of these positions and had agreed that the situation demanded only men of the highest character ripe learning and evenly balanced mind billy could not subdue a certain exultation at this token of the success of his long and arduous labours but at the same time a whimsical smile lingered around his mouth for he foresaw in which column elmville would place the credit we congratulate governor pemberton upon the mark of appreciation conferred upon his son elmville rejoices with our honoured citizen governor pemberton at his son s success put her there billy judge billy pemberton sir son of our state s war hero and the people s pride these were the phrases printed and oral conjured up by billy s prophetic fancy grandson of his state and stepchild to elmville thus had fate fixed his kinship to the body politic billy lived with his father in the old mansion the two and an elderly lady a distant relative comprised the family perhaps though old jeff the governor s ancient coloured body servant should be included without doubt he could have claimed the honour there were other servants but thomas jefferson pemberton sah was a member of de fambly jeff was the one elmvillian who gave to billy the gold of approval unmixed with the alloy of paternalism to him mars william was the greatest man in talbot county beaten upon though he was by the shining light that emanates from an ex war governor and loyal as he remained to the old regime his faith and admiration were billy s as valet to a hero and a member of the family he may have had superior opportunities for judging jeff was the first one to whom bill revealed the news when he reached home for supper jeff took his plug hat and smoothed it before hanging it upon the hall rack dar now said the old man i knowed it was er comin i knowed it was gwine ter happen er judge you says mars william dem yankees done made you er judge it s high time sah dey was doin somep n to make up for dey rascality endurin de war i boun dey holds a confab and says le s make mars william pemberton er judge and dat ll settle it does you have to go way down to dem fillypines mars william or kin you judge em from here i d have to live there most of the time of course said billy i wonder what de gubnor gwine say bout dat speculated jeff billy wondered too after supper when the two sat in the library according to their habit the governor smoking his clay pipe and billy his cigar the son dutifully confessed to having been tendered the appointment for a long time the governor sat smoking without making any comment billy reclined in his favourite rocker waiting perhaps still flushed with satisfaction over the tender that had come to him unsolicited in his dingy little office above the heads of the intriguing time serving clamorous multitude at last the governor spoke and though his words were seemingly irrelevant they were to the point his voice had a note of martyrdom running through its senile quaver my rheumatism has been growing steadily worse these past months william i am sorry father said billy gently and i am nearly seventy eight i am getting to be an old man i can recall the names of but two or three who were in public life during my administration what did you say is the nature of this position that is offered you william a federal judgeship father i believe it is considered to be a somewhat flattering tender it is outside of politics and wire pulling you know no doubt no doubt few of the pembertons have engaged in professional life for nearly a century none of them have ever held federal positions they have been land holders slave owners and planters on a large scale one of two of the derwents your mother s family were in the law have you decided to accept this appointment william i am thinking it over said billy slowly regarding the ash of his cigar you have been a good son to me continued the governor stirring his pipe with the handle of a penholder i ve been your son all my life said billy darkly i am often gratified piped the governor betraying a touch of complacency by being congratulated upon having a son with such sound and sterling qualities especially in this our native town is your name linked with mine in the talk of our citizens i never knew anyone to forget the vindculum murmured billy unintelligibly whatever prestige pursued the parent i may be possessed of by virtue of my name and services to the state has been yours to draw upon freely i have not hesitated to exert it in your behalf whenever opportunity offered and you have deserved it william you ve been the best of sons and now this appointment comes to take you away from me i have but a few years left to live i am almost dependent upon others now even in walking and dressing what would i do without you my son the governor s pipe dropped to the floor a tear trickled from his eye his voice had risen and crumbled to a weakling falsetto and ceased he was an old old man about to be bereft of a son that cherished him billy rose and laid his hand upon the governor s shoulder don t worry father he said cheerfully i m not going to accept elmville is good enough for me i ll write to night and decline it at the next interchange of devoirs between the governor and general deffenbaugh on lee avenue his excellency with a comfortable air of self satisfaction spoke of the appointment that had been tendered to billy the general whistled that s a plum for billy he shouted who d have thought that billy but confound it it s been in him all the time it s a boost for elmville it ll send real estate up it s an honour to our state it s a compliment to the south we ve all been blind about billy when does he leave we must have a reception great gatlings that job s eight thousand a year there s been a car load of lead pencils worn to stubs figuring on those appointments think of it our little wood sawing mealy mouthed billy angel unawares doesn t begin to express it elmville is disgraced forever until she lines up in a hurry for ratification and apology the venerable moloch smiled fatuously he carried the fire with which to consume all these tributes to billy the smoke of which would ascend as an incense to himself william said the governor with modest pride has declined the appointment he refuses to leave me in my old age he is a good son the general swung round and laid a large forefinger upon the bosom of his friend much of the general s success had been due to his dexterity in establishing swift lines of communication between cause and effect governor he said with a keen look in his big ox like eyes you ve been complaining to billy about your rheumatism my dear general replied the governor stiffly my son is forty two he is quite capable of deciding such questions for himself and i as his parent feel it my duty to state that your remark about er rheumatism is a mighty poor shot from a very small bore sir aimed at a purely personal and private affliction if you will allow me retorted the general you ve afflicted the public with it for some time and twas no small bore at that this first tiff between the two old comrades might have grown into something more serious but for the fortunate interruption caused by the ostentatious approach of colonel titus and another one of the court retinue from the right county to whom the general confided the coddled statesman and went his way after billy had so effectually entombed his ambitions and taken the veil so to speak in a sonnery he was surprised to discover how much lighter of heart and happier he felt he realized what a long restless struggle he had maintained and how much he had lost by failing to cull the simple but wholesome pleasures by the way his heart warmed now to elmville and the friends who had refused to set him upon a pedestal it was better he began to think to be billy and his father s son and to be hailed familiarly by cheery neighbours and grown up playmates than to be your honour and sit among strangers hearing maybe through the arguments of learned counsel that old man s feeble voice crying what would i do without you my son billy began to surprise his acquaintances by whistling as he walked up the street others he astounded by slapping them disrespectfully upon their backs and raking up old anecdotes he had not had the time to recollect for years though he hammered away at his law cases as thoroughly as ever he found more time for relaxation and the company of his friends some of the younger set were actually after him to join the golf club a striking proof of his abandonment to obscurity was his adoption of a most undignified rakish little soft hat reserving the plug for sundays and state occasions billy was beginning to enjoy elmville though that irreverent burgh had neglected to crown him with bay and myrtle all the while uneventful peace pervaded elmville the governor continued to make his triumphal parades to the post office with the general as chief marshal for the slight squall that had rippled their friendship had to all indications been forgotten by both but one day elmville woke to sudden excitement the news had come that a touring presidential party would honour elmville by a twenty minute stop the executive had promised a five minute address from the balcony of the palace hotel elmville rose as one man that man being of course general deffenbaugh to receive becomingly the chieftain of all the clans the train with the tiny stars and stripes fluttering from the engine pilot arrived elmville had done her best there were bands flowers carriages uniforms banners and committees without end high school girls in white frocks impeded the steps of the party with roses strewn nervously in bunches the chieftain had seen it all before scores of times he could have pictured it exactly in advance from the blue and gray speech down to the smallest rosebud yet his kindly smile of interest greeted elmville s display as if it had been the only and original in the upper rotunda of the palace hotel the town s most illustrious were assembled for the honour of being presented to the distinguished guests previous to the expected address outside elmville s inglorious but patriotic masses filled the streets here in the hotel general deffenbaugh was holding in reserve elmville s trump card elmville knew for the trump was a fixed one and its lead consecrated by archaic custom at the proper moment governor pemberton beautifully venerable magnificently antique tall paramount stepped forward upon the arm of the general elmville watched and harked with bated breath never until now when a northern president of the united states should clasp hands with ex war governor pemberton would the breach be entirely closed would the country be made one and indivisible no north not much south very little east and no west to speak of so elmville excitedly scraped kalsomine from the walls of the palace hotel with its sunday best and waited for the voice to speak and billy we had nearly forgotten billy he was cast for son and he waited patiently for his cue he carried his plug in his hand and felt serene he admired his father s striking air and pose after all it was a great deal to be a son of a man who could so gallantly hold the position of a cynosure for three generations general deffenbaugh cleared his throat elmville opened its mouth and squirmed the chieftain with the kindly fateful face was holding out his hand smiling ex war governor pemberton extended his own across the chasm but what was this the general was saying mr president allow me to present to you one who has the honour to be the father of our foremost distinguished citizen learned and honoured jurist beloved townsman and model southern gentleman the honourable william b pemberton the enchanted kiss but a clerk in the cut rate drug store was samuel tansey yet his slender frame was a pad that enfolded the passion of romeo the gloom of laura the romance of d artagnan and the desperate inspiration of melnotte pity then that he had been denied expression that he was doomed to the burden of utter timidity and diffidence that fate had set him tongue tied and scarlet before the muslin clad angels whom he adored and vainly longed to rescue clasp comfort and subdue the clock s hands were pointing close upon the hour of ten while tansey was playing billiards with a number of his friends on alternate evenings he was released from duty at the store after seven o clock even among his fellow men tansey was timorous and constrained in his imagination he had done valiant deeds and performed acts of distinguished gallantry but in fact he was a sallow youth of twenty three with an over modest demeanour and scant vocabulary when the clock struck ten tansey hastily laid down his cue and struck sharply upon the show case with a coin for the attendant to come and receive the pay for his score what s your hurry tansey called one got another engagement tansey got an engagement echoed another not on your life tansey s got to get home at motten by her peek s orders it s no such thing chimed in a pale youth taking a large cigar from his mouth tansey s afraid to be late because miss katie might come down stairs to unlock the door and kiss him in the hall this last delicate piece of raillery sent a fiery tingle into tansey s blood for the indictment was true barring the kiss that was a thing to dream of to wildly hope for but too remote and sacred a thing to think of lightly casting a cold and contemptuous look at the speaker a punishment commensurate with his own diffident spirit tansey left the room descending the stairs into the street for two years he had silently adored miss peek worshipping her from a spiritual distance through which her attractions took on stellar brightness and mystery mrs peek kept a few choice boarders among whom was tansey the other young men romped with katie chased her with crickets in their fingers and jollied her with an irreverent freedom that turned tansey s heart into cold lead in his bosom the signs of his adoration were few a tremulous good morning stealthy glances at her during meals and occasionally oh rapture a blushing delirious game of cribbage with her in the parlour on some rare evening when a miraculous lack of engagement kept her at home kiss him in the hall aye he feared it but it was an ecstatic fear such as elijah must have felt when the chariot lifted him into the unknown but to night the gibes of his associates had stung him to a feeling of forward lawless mutiny a defiant challenging atavistic recklessness spirit of corsair adventurer lover poet bohemian possessed him the stars he saw above him seemed no more unattainable no less high than the favour of miss peek or the fearsome sweetness of her delectable lips his fate seemed to him strangely dramatic and pathetic and to call for a solace consonant with its extremity a saloon was near by and to this he flitted calling for absinthe beyond doubt the drink most adequate to his mood the tipple of the roue the abandoned the vainly sighing lover once he drank of it and again and then again until he felt a strange exalted sense of non participation in worldly affairs pervade him tansey was no drinker his consumption of three absinthe anisettes within almost as few minutes proclaimed his unproficiency in the art tansey was merely flooding with unproven liquor his sorrows which record and tradition alleged to be drownable coming out upon the sidewalk he snapped his fingers defiantly in the direction of the peek homestead turned the other way and voyaged columbus like into the wilds of an enchanted street nor is the figure exorbitant for beyond his store the foot of tansey had scarcely been set for years store and boarding house between these ports he was charted to run and contrary currents had rarely deflected his prow tansey aimlessly protracted his walk and whether it was his unfamiliarity with the district his recent accession of audacious errantry or the sophistical whisper of a certain green eyed fairy he came at last to tread a shuttered blank and echoing thoroughfare dark and unpeopled and suddenly this way came to an end as many streets do in the spanish built archaic town of san antone butting its head against an imminent high brick wall no the street still lived to the right and to the left it breathed through slender tubes of exit narrow somnolent ravines cobble paved and unlighted accommodating a rise in the street to the right was reared a phantom flight of five luminous steps of limestone flanked by a wall of the same height and of the same material upon one of these steps tansey seated himself and bethought him of his love and how she might never know she was his love and of mother peek fat vigilant and kind not unpleased tansey thought that he and katie should play cribbage in the parlour together for the cut rate had not cut his salary which sordidly speaking ranked him star boarder at the peek s and he thought of captain peek katie s father a man he dreaded and abhorred a genteel loafer and spendthrift battening upon the labour of his women folk a very queer fish and according to repute not of the freshest the night had turned chill and foggy the heart of the town with its noises was left behind reflected from the high vapours its distant lights were manifest in quivering cone shaped streamers in questionable blushes of unnamed colours in unstable ghostly waves of far electric flashes now that the darkness was become more friendly the wall against which the street splintered developed a stone coping topped with an armature of spikes beyond it loomed what appeared to be the acute angles of mountain peaks pierced here and there by little lambent parallelograms considering this vista tansey at length persuaded himself that the seeming mountains were in fact the convent of santa mercedes with which ancient and bulky pile he was better familiar from different coigns of view a pleasant note of singing in his ears reinforced his opinion high sweet holy carolling far and harmonious and uprising as of sanctified nuns at their responses at what hour did the sisters sing he tried to think was it six eight twelve tansey leaned his back against the limestone wall and wondered strange things followed the air was full of white fluttering pigeons that circled about and settled upon the convent wall the wall blossomed with a quantity of shining green eyes that blinked and peered at him from the solid masonry a pink classic nymph came from an excavation in the cavernous road and danced barefoot and airy upon the ragged flints the sky was traversed by a company of beribboned cats marching in stupendous aerial procession the noise of singing grew louder an illumination of unseasonable fireflies danced past and strange whispers came out of the dark without meaning or excuse without amazement tansey took note of these phenomena he was on some new plane of understanding though his mind seemed to him clear and indeed happily tranquil a desire for movement and exploration seized him he rose and turned into the black gash of street to his right for a time the high wall formed one of its boundaries but further on two rows of black windowed houses closed it in here was the city s quarter once given over to the spaniard here were still his forbidding abodes of concrete and adobe standing cold and indomitable against the century from the murky fissure the eye saw flung against the sky the tangled filigree of his moorish balconies through stone archways breaths of dead vault chilled air coughed upon him his feet struck jingling iron rings in staples stone buried for half a cycle along these paltry avenues had swaggered the arrogant don had caracoled and serenaded and blustered while the tomahawk and the pioneer s rifle were already uplifted to expel him from a continent and tansey stumbling through this old world dust looked up dark as it was and saw andalusian beauties glimmering on the balconies some of them were laughing and listening to the goblin music that still followed others harked fearfully through the night trying to catch the hoof beats of caballeros whose last echoes from those stones had died away a century ago those women were silent but tansey heard the jangle of horseless bridle bits the whirr of riderless rowels and now and then a muttered malediction in a foreign tongue but he was not frightened shadows nor shadows of sounds could daunt him afraid no afraid of mother peek afraid to face the girl of his heart afraid of tipsy captain peek nay nor of these apparitions nor of that spectral singing that always pursued him singing he would show them he lifted up a strong and untuneful voice when you hear them bells go tingalingling serving notice upon those mysterious agencies that if it should come to a face to face encounter there ll be a hot time in the old town to night how long tansey consumed in treading this haunted byway was not clear to him but in time he emerged into a more commodious avenue when within a few yards of the corner he perceived through a window that a small confectionary of mean appearance was set in the angle his same glance that estimated its meagre equipment its cheap soda water fountain and stock of tobacco and sweets took cognizance of captain peek within lighting a cigar at a swinging gaslight as tansey rounded the corner captain peek came out and they met vis a vis an exultant joy filled tansey when he found himself sustaining the encounter with implicit courage peek indeed he raised his hand and snapped his fingers loudly it was peek himself who quailed guiltily before the valiant mien of the drug clerk sharp surprise and a palpable fear bourgeoned upon the captain s face and verily that face was one to rather call up such expressions on the faces of others the face of a libidinous heathen idol small eyed with carven folds in the heavy jowls and a consuming pagan license in its expression in the gutter just beyond the store tansey saw a closed carriage standing with its back toward him and a motionless driver perched in his place why it s tansey exclaimed captain peek how are you tansey h have a cigar tansey why it s peek cried tansey jubilant at his own temerity what deviltry are you up to now peek back streets and a closed carriage fie peek there s no one in the carriage said the captain smoothly everybody out of it is in luck continued tansey aggressively i d love for you to know peek that i m not stuck on you you re a bottle nosed scoundrel why the little rat s drunk cried the captain joyfully only drunk and i thought he was on go home tansey and quit bothering grown persons on the street but just then a white clad figure sprang out of the carriage and a shrill voice katie s voice sliced the air sam sam help me sam tansey sprung toward her but captain peek interposed his bulky form wonder of wonders the whilom spiritless youth struck out with his right and the hulking captain went over in a swearing heap tansey flew to katie and took her in his arms like a conquering knight she raised her face and he kissed her violets electricity caramels champagne here was the attainment of a dream that brought no disenchantment oh sam cried katie when she could i knew you would come to rescue me what do you suppose the mean things were going to do with me have your picture taken said tansey wondering at the foolishness of his remark no they were going to eat me i heard them talking about it eat you said tansey after pondering a moment that can t be there s no plates but a sudden noise warned him to turn down upon him were bearing the captain and a monstrous long bearded dwarf in a spangled cloak and red trunk hose the dwarf leaped twenty feet and clutched them the captain seized katie and hurled her shrieking back into the carriage himself followed and the vehicle dashed away the dwarf lifted tansey high above his head and ran with him into the store holding him with one hand he raised the lid of an enormous chest half filled with cakes of ice flung tansey inside and closed down the cover the force of the fall must have been great for tansey lost consciousness when his faculties revived his first sensation was one of severe cold along his back and limbs opening his eyes he found himself to be seated upon the limestone steps still facing the wall and convent of santa mercedes his first thought was of the ecstatic kiss from katie the outrageous villainy of captain peek the unnatural mystery of the situation his preposterous conflict with the improbable dwarf these things roused and angered him but left no impression of the unreal i ll go back there to morrow he grumbled aloud and knock the head off that comic opera squab running out and picking up perfect strangers and shoving them into cold storage but the kiss remained uppermost in his mind i might have done that long ago he mused she liked it too she called me sam four times i ll not go up that street again too much scrapping guess i ll move down the other way wonder what she meant by saying they were going to eat her tansey began to feel sleepy but after a while he decided to move along again this time he ventured into the street to his left it ran level for a distance and then dipped gently downward opening into a vast dim barren space the old military plaza to his left some hundred yards distant he saw a cluster of flickering lights along the plaza s border he knew the locality at once huddled within narrow confines were the remnants of the once famous purveyors of the celebrated mexican national cookery a few years before their nightly encampments upon the historic alamo plaza in the heart of the city had been a carnival a saturnalia that was renowned throughout the land then the caterers numbered hundreds the patrons thousands drawn by the coquettish senoritas the music of the weird spanish minstrels and the strange piquant mexican dishes served at a hundred competing tables crowds thronged the alamo plaza all night travellers rancheros family parties gay gasconading rounders sightseers and prowlers of polyglot owlish san antone mingled there at the centre of the city s fun and frolic the popping of corks pistols and questions the glitter of eyes jewels and daggers the ring of laughter and coin these were the order of the night but now no longer to some half dozen tents fires and tables had dwindled the picturesque festival and these had been relegated to an ancient disused plaza often had tansey strolled down to these stands at night to partake of the delectable chili con carne a dish evolved by the genius of mexico composed of delicate meats minced with aromatic herbs and the poignant chili colorado a compound full of singular flavour and a fiery zest delightful to the southron s palate the titillating odour of this concoction came now on the breeze to the nostrils of tansey awakening in him hunger for it as he turned in that direction he saw a carriage dash up to the mexicans tents out of the gloom of the plaza some figures moved back and forward in the uncertain light of the lanterns and then the carriage was driven swiftly away tansey approached and sat at one of the tables covered with gaudy oil cloth traffic was dull at the moment a few half grown boys noisily fared at another table the mexicans hung listless and phlegmatic about their wares and it was still the night hum of the city crowded to the wall of dark buildings surrounding the plaza and subsided to an indefinite buzz through which sharply perforated the crackle of the languid fires and the rattle of fork and spoon a sedative wind blew from the southeast the starless firmament pressed down upon the earth like a leaden cover in all that quiet tansey turned his head suddenly and saw without disquietude a troop of spectral horsemen deploy into the plaza and charge a luminous line of infantry that advanced to sustain the shock he saw the fierce flame of cannon and small arms but heard no sound the careless victuallers lounged vacantly not deigning to view the conflict tansey mildly wondered to what nations these mute combatants might belong turned his back to them and ordered his chili and coffee from the mexican woman who advanced to serve him this woman was old and careworn her face was lined like the rind of a cantaloupe she fetched the viands from a vessel set by the smouldering fire and then retired to a tent dark within that stood near by presently tansey heard a turmoil in the tent a wailing broken hearted pleading in the harmonious spanish tongue and then two figures tumbled out into the light of the lanterns one was the old woman the other was a man clothed with a sumptuous and flashing splendour the woman seemed to clutch and beseech from him something against his will the man broke from her and struck her brutally back into the tent where she lay whimpering and invisible observing tansey he walked rapidly to the table where he sat tansey recognized him to be ramon torres a mexican the proprietor of the stand he was patronizing torres was a handsome nearly full blooded descendant of the spanish seemingly about thirty years of age and of a haughty but extremely courteous demeanour to night he was dressed with signal magnificence his costume was that of a triumphant matador made of purple velvet almost hidden by jeweled embroidery diamonds of enormous size flashed upon his garb and his hands he reached for a chair and seating himself at the opposite side of the table began to roll a finical cigarette ah meester tanse he said with a sultry fire in his silky black eyes i give myself pleasure to see you this evening meester tansee you have many times come to eat at my table i theenk you a safe man a verree good friend how much would it please you to leeve forever not come back any more inquired tansey no not leave leeve the not to die i would call that said tansey a snap torres leaned his elbows upon the table swallowed a mouthful of smoke and spake each word being projected in a little puff of gray how old do you theenk i am meester tansee oh twenty eight or thirty thees day said the mexican ees my

americano i have bought a verree tip top man el capitan peek que es senor for tansey had sprung to his feet upsetting the chair the words of katie reverberated in his ears they re going to eat me sam this then was the monstrous fate to which she had been delivered by her unnatural parent the carriage he had seen drive up from the plaza was captain peek s where was katie perhaps already before he could decide what to do a loud scream came from the tent the old mexican woman ran out a flashing knife in her hand i have released her she cried you shall kill no more they will hang you ingrato encatador torres with a hissing exclamation sprang at her ramoncito she shrieked once you loved me the mexican s arm raised and descended you are old he cried and she fell and lay motionless another scream the flaps of the tent were flung aside and there stood katie white with fear her wrists still bound with a cruel cord sam she cried save me again tansey rounded the table and flung himself with superb nerve upon the mexican just then a clangour began the clocks of the city were tolling the midnight hour tansey clutched at torres and for a moment felt in his grasp the crunch of velvet and the cold facets of the glittering gems the next instant the bedecked caballero turned in his hands to a shrunken leather visaged white bearded old old screaming mummy sandalled ragged and four hundred and three the mexican woman was crawling to her feet and laughing she shook her brown hand in the face of the whining viejo go now she cried and seek your senorita it was i ramoncito who brought you to this within each moon you eat of the life giving chili it was i that kept the wrong time for you you should have eaten yesterday instead of to morrow it is too late off with you hombre you are too old for me this decided tansey releasing his hold of the gray beard is a private family matter concerning age and no business of mine with one of the table knives he hastened to saw asunder the fetters of the fair captive and then for the second time that night he kissed katie peek tasted again the sweetness the wonder the thrill of it attained once more the maximum of his incessant dreams the next instant an icy blade was driven deep between his shoulders he felt his blood slowly congeal heard the senile cackle of the perennial spaniard saw the plaza rise and reel till the zenith crashed into the horizon and knew no more when tansey opened his eyes again he was sitting upon those self same steps gazing upon the dark bulk of the sleeping convent in the middle of his back was still the acute chilling pain how had he been conveyed back there again he got stiffly to his feet and stretched his cramped limbs supporting himself against the stonework he revolved in his mind the extravagant adventures that had befallen him each time he had strayed from the

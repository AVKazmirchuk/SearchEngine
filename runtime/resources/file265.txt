up this er way yes yes uncle jake said john briskly my cousin and i have just been notified to expect you we are both carterets you know although one of us said blandford was born and raised in the north so if you will hand over the watch said john my cousin and i said blandford will then see to it said john that comfortable quarters are found for you said blandford with creditable ingenuity old jake set up a cackling high pitched protracted laugh he beat his knee picked up his hat and bent the brim in an apparent paroxysm of humorous appreciation the seizure afforded him a mask behind which he could roll his eyes impartially between above and beyond his two tormentors i sees what he chuckled after a while you gen lemen is tryin to have fun with the po old nigger but you can t fool old jake i knowed you marse blandford the minute i sot eyes on you you was a po skimpy little boy no mo than about fo teen when you lef home to come no th but i knowed you the minute i sot eyes on you you is the mawtal image of old marster the other gen leman resembles you mightily suh but you can t fool old jake on a member of the old vi ginia family no suh at exactly the same time both carterets smiled and extended a hand for the watch uncle jake s wrinkled black face lost the expression of amusement to which he had vainly twisted it he knew that he was being teased and that it made little real difference as far as its safety went into which of those outstretched hands he placed the family treasure but it seemed to him that not only his own pride and loyalty but much of the virginia carterets was at stake he had heard down south during the war about that other branch of the family that lived in the north and fought on the yuther side and it had always grieved him he had followed his old marster s fortunes from stately luxury through war to almost poverty and now with the last relic and reminder of him blessed by old missus and intrusted implicitly to his care he had come ten thousand miles as it seemed to deliver it into the hands of the one who was to wear it and wind it and cherish it and listen to it tick off the unsullied hours that marked the lives of the carterets of virginia his experience and conception of the yankees had been an impression of tyrants low down common trash in blue laying waste with fire and sword he had seen the smoke of many burning homesteads almost as grand as carteret hall ascending to the drowsy southern skies and now he was face to face with one of them and he could not distinguish him from his young marster whom he had come to find and bestow upon him the emblem of his kingship even as the arm clothed in white samite mystic wonderful laid excalibur in the right hand of arthur he saw before him two young men easy kind courteous welcoming either of whom might have been the one he sought troubled bewildered sorely grieved at his weakness of judgment old jake abandoned his loyal subterfuges his right hand sweated against the buckskin cover of the watch he was deeply humiliated and chastened seriously now his prominent yellow white eyes closely scanned the two young men at the end of his scrutiny he was conscious of but one difference between them one wore a narrow black tie with a white pearl stickpin the other s four in hand was a narrow blue one pinned with a black pearl and then to old jake s relief there came a sudden distraction drama knocked at the door with imperious knuckles and forced comedy to the wings and drama peeped with a smiling but set face over the footlights percival the hater of mill supplies brought in a card which he handed with the manner of one bearing a cartel to blue tie olivia de ormond read blue tie from the card he looked inquiringly at his cousin why not have her in said black tie and bring matters to a conclusion uncle jake said one of the young men would you mind taking that chair over there in the corner for a while a lady is coming in on some business we ll take up your case afterward the lady whom percival ushered in was young and petulantly decidedly freshly consciously and intentionally pretty she was dressed with such expensive plainness that she made you consider lace and ruffles as mere tatters and rags but one great ostrich plume that she wore would have marked her anywhere in the army of beauty as the wearer of the merry helmet of navarre miss de ormond accepted the swivel chair at blue tie s desk then the gentlemen drew leather upholstered seats conveniently near and spoke of the weather yes said she i noticed it was warmer but i mustn t take up too much of your time during business hours that is she continued unless we talk business she addressed her words to blue tie with a charming smile very well said he you don t mind my cousin being present do you we are generally rather confidential with each other especially in business matters oh no caroled miss de ormond i d rather he did hear he knows all about it anyhow in fact he s quite a material witness because he was present when you when it happened i thought you might want to talk things over before well before any action is taken as i believe the lawyers say have you anything in the way of a proposition to make asked black tie miss de ormond looked

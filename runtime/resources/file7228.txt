blinker in a tone that made her look at him in frank surprise why shouldn t i say it she asked calmly they all do who are they he asked jealous for the first time in his existence why the fellows i know do you know so many oh well i m not a wall flower she answered with modest complacency where do you see these these men at your home of course not i meet them just as i did you sometimes on the boat sometimes in the park sometimes on the street i m a pretty good judge of a man i can tell in a minute if a fellow is one who is likely to get fresh what do you mean by fresh why try to kiss you me i mean do any of them try that asked blinker clenching his teeth sure all men do you know that do you allow them some not many they won t take you out anywhere unless you do she turned her head and looked searchingly at blinker her eyes were as innocent as a child s there was a puzzled look in them as though she did not understand him what s wrong about my meeting fellows she asked wonderingly everything he answered almost savagely why don t you entertain your company in the house where you live is it necessary to pick up tom dick and harry on the streets she kept her absolutely ingenuous eyes upon his if you could see the place where i live you wouldn t ask that i live in brickdust row they call it that because there s red dust from the bricks crumbling over everything i ve lived there for more than four years there s no place to receive company you can t have anybody come to your room what else is there to do a girl has got to meet the men hasn t she yes he said hoarsely a girl has got to meet a has got to meet the men the first time one spoke to me on the street she continued i ran home and cried all night but you get used to it i meet a good many nice fellows at church i go on rainy days and stand in the vestibule until one comes up with an umbrella i wish there was a parlor so i could ask you to call mr blinker are you really sure it isn t smith now the boat landed safely blinker had a confused impression of walking with the girl through quiet crosstown streets until she stopped at a corner and held out her hand i live just one more block over she said thank you for a very pleasant afternoon blinker muttered something and plunged northward till he found a cab a big gray church loomed slowly at his right blinker shook his fist at it through the window i gave you a thousand dollars last week he cried under his breath and she meets them in your very doors there is something wrong there is something wrong at eleven the next day blinker signed his name thirty times with a new pen provided by lawyer oldport now let me go to the woods he said surlily you are not looking well said lawyer oldport the trip will do you good but listen if you will to that little matter of business of which i spoke to you yesterday and also five years ago there are some buildings fifteen in number of which there are new five year leases to be signed your father contemplated a change in the lease provisions but never made it he intended that the parlors of these houses should not be sub let but that the tenants should be allowed to use them for reception rooms these houses are in the shopping district and are mainly tenanted by young working girls as it is they are forced to seek companionship outside this row of red brick blinker interrupted him with a loud discordant laugh brickdust row for an even hundred he cried and i own it have i guessed right the tenants have some such name for it said lawyer oldport blinker arose and jammed his hat down to his eyes do what you please with it he said harshly remodel it burn it raze it to the ground but man it s too late i tell you it s too late it s too late it s too late the making of a new yorker besides many other things raggles was a poet he was called a tramp but that was only an elliptical way of saying that he was a philosopher an artist a traveller a naturalist and a discoverer but most of all he was a poet in all his life he never wrote a line of verse he lived his poetry his odyssey would have been a limerick had it been written but to linger with the primary proposition raggles was a poet raggles s specialty had he been driven to ink and paper would have been sonnets to the cities he studied cities as women study their reflections in mirrors as children study the glue and sawdust of a dislocated doll as the men who write about wild animals study the cages in the zoo a city to raggles was not merely a pile of bricks and mortar peopled by a certain number of inhabitants it was a thing with a soul characteristic and distinct an individual conglomeration of life with its own peculiar essence flavor and feeling two thousand miles to the north and south east and west raggles wandered in poetic fervor taking the cities to his breast he footed it on dusty roads or sped magnificently in freight cars counting time as of no account and when he had found the heart of a city and listened to its secret confession he strayed on restless to another fickle raggles but perhaps he had not met the civic corporation that could engage and hold his critical fancy through the ancient poets we have learned that the cities are feminine so they were to poet raggles and his mind carried a concrete and clear conception of the figure that symbolized and typified each one that he had wooed chicago seemed to swoop down upon him with a breezy suggestion of mrs partington plumes and patchouli and to disturb his rest with a soaring and beautiful song of future promise but raggles would awake to a sense of shivering cold and a haunting impression of ideals lost in a depressing aura of potato salad and fish thus chicago affected him perhaps there is a vagueness and inaccuracy in the description but that is raggles s fault he should have recorded his sensations in magazine poems pittsburg impressed hint as the play of othello performed in the russian language in a railroad station by dockstader s minstrels a royal and generous lady this pittsburg though homely hearty with flushed face washing the dishes in a silk dress and white kid slippers and bidding raggles sit before the roaring fireplace and drink champagne with his pigs feet and fried potatoes new orleans had simply gazed down upon him from a balcony he could see her pensive starry eves and catch the flutter of her fan and that was all only once he came face to face with her it was at dawn when she was flushing the red bricks of the banquette with a pail of water she laughed and hummed a chansonette and filled raggles s shoes with ice cold water allons boston construed herself to the poetic raggles in an erratic and singular way it seemed to him that he had drunk cold tea and that the city was a white cold cloth that had been bound tightly around his brow to spur him to some unknown but tremendous mental effort and after all he came to shovel snow for a livelihood and the cloth becoming wet tightened its knots and could not be removed indefinite and unintelligible ideas you will say but your disapprobation should be tempered with gratitude for these are poets fancies and suppose you had come upon them in verse one day raggles came and laid siege to the heart of the great city of manhattan she was the greatest of all and he wanted to learn her note in the scale to taste and appraise and classify and solve and label her and arrange her with the other cities that had given him up the secret of their individuality and here we cease to be raggles s translator and become his chronicler raggles landed from a ferry boat one morning and walked into the core of the town with the blase air of a cosmopolite he was dressed with care to play the role of an unidentified man no country race class clique union party clan or bowling association could have claimed him his clothing which had been donated to him piece meal by citizens of different height but same number of inches around the heart was not yet as uncomfortable to his figure as those speciments of raiment self measured that are railroaded to you by transcontinental tailors with a suit case suspenders sills handkerchief and pearl studs as a bonus without money as a poet should be but with the ardor of an astronomer discovering a new star in the chorus of the milky way or a man who has seen ink suddenly flow from his fountain pen raggles wandered into the great city late in the afternoon he drew out of the roar and commotion with a look of dumb terror on his countenance he was defeated puzzled discomfited frightened other cities had been to him as long primer to read as country maidens quickly to fathom as send price of subscription with answer rebuses to solve as oyster cocktails to swallow but here was one as cold glittering serene impossible as a four carat diamond in a window to a lover outside fingering damply in his pocket his ribbon counter salary the greetings of the other cities he had known their homespun kindliness their human gamut of rough charity friendly curses garrulous curiosity and easily estimated credulity or indifference this city of manhattan gave him no clue it was walled against him like a river of adamant it flowed past him in the streets never an eye was turned upon him no voice spoke to him his heart yearned for the clap of pittsburg s sooty hand on his shoulder for chicago s menacing but social yawp in his ear for the pale and eleemosynary stare through the bostonian eyeglass even for the precipitate but unmalicious boot toe of louisville or st louis on broadway raggles successful suitor of many cities stood bashful like any country swain for the first time he experienced the poignant humiliation of being ignored and when he tried to reduce this brilliant swiftly changing ice cold city to a formula he failed utterly poet though he was it offered him no color similes no points of comparison no flaw in its polished facets no handle by which he could hold it up and view its shape and structure as he familiarly and often contemptuously had done with other towns the houses were interminable ramparts loopholed for defense the people were bright but bloodless spectres passing in sinister and selfish array the thing that weighed heaviest on raggles s soul and clogged his poet s fancy was the spirit of absolute egotism that seemed to saturate the people as toys are saturated with paint each one that he considered appeared a monster of abominable and insolent conceit humanity was gone from them they were toddling idols of stone and varnish worshipping themselves and greedy for though oblivious of worship from their fellow graven images frozen cruel implacable impervious cut to an identical pattern they hurried on their ways like statues brought by some miracles to motion while soul and feeling lay unaroused in the reluctant marble gradually raggles became conscious of certain types one was an elderly gentleman with a snow white short beard pink unwrinkled face and stony sharp blue eyes attired in the fashion of a gilded youth who seemed to personify the city s wealth ripeness and frigid unconcern another type was a woman tall beautiful clear as a steel engraving goddess like calm clothed like the princesses of old with eyes as coldly blue as the reflection of sunlight on a glacier and another was a by product of this town of marionettes a broad swaggering grim threateningly sedate fellow with a jowl as large as a harvested wheat field the complexion of a baptized infant and the knuckles of a prize fighter this type leaned against cigar signs and viewed the world with frapped contumely a poet is a sensitive creature and raggles soon shrivelled in the bleak embrace of the undecipherable the chill sphinx like ironical illegible unnatural ruthless expression of the city left him downcast and bewildered had it no heart better the woodpile the scolding of vinegar faced housewives at back doors the kindly spleen of bartenders behind provincial free lunch counters the amiable truculence of rural constables the kicks arrests and happy go lucky chances of the other vulgar loud crude cities than this freezing heartlessness raggles summoned his courage and sought alms from the populace unheeding regardless they passed on without the wink of an eyelash to testify that they were conscious of his existence and then he said to himself that this fair but pitiless city of manhattan was without a soul that its inhabitants were manikins moved by wires and springs and that he was alone in a great wilderness raggles started to cross the street there was a blast a roar a hissing and a crash as something struck him and hurled him over and over six yards from where he had been as he was coming down like the stick of a rocket the earth and all the cities thereof turned to a fractured dream raggles opened his eyes first an odor made itself known to him an odor of the earliest spring flowers of paradise and then a hand soft as a falling petal touched his brow bending over him was the woman clothed like the princess of old with blue eyes now soft and humid with human sympathy under his head on the pavement were silks and furs with raggles s hat in his hand and with his face pinker than ever from a vehement burst of oratory against reckless driving stood the elderly gentleman who personified the city s wealth and ripeness from a nearby cafe hurried the by product with the vast jowl and baby complexion bearing a glass full of a crimson fluid that suggested delightful possibilities drink dis sport said the by product holding the glass to raggles s lips hundreds of people huddled around in a moment their faces wearing the deepest concern two flattering and gorgeous policemen got into the circle and pressed back the overplus of samaritans an old lady in a black shawl spoke loudly of camphor a newsboy slipped one of his papers beneath raggles s elbow where it lay on the muddy pavement a brisk young man with a notebook was asking for names a bell clanged importantly and the ambulance cleaned a lane through the crowd a cool surgeon slipped into the midst of affairs how do you feel old man asked the surgeon stooping easily to his task the princess of silks and satins wiped a red drop or two from raggles s brow with a fragrant cobweb me said raggles with a seraphic smile i feel fine he had found the heart of his new city in three days they let him leave his cot for the convalescent ward in the hospital he had been in there an hour when the attendants heard sounds of conflict upon investigation they found that raggles had assaulted and damaged a brother convalescent a glowering transient whom a freight train collision had sent in to be patched up what s all this about inquired the head nurse he was runnin down me town said raggles what town asked the nurse noo york said raggles vanity and some sables when kid brady was sent to the rope by molly mckeever s blue black eyes he withdrew from the stovepipe gang so much for the power of a colleen s blanderin tongue and stubborn true heartedness if you are a man who read this may such an influence be sent you before o clock to morrow if you are a woman may your pomeranian greet you this morning with a cold nose a sign of doghealth and your happiness the stovepipe gang borrowed its name from a sub district of the city called the stovepipe which is a narrow and natural extension of the familiar district known as hell s kitchen the stovepipe strip of town runs along eleventh and twelfth avenues on the river and bends a hard and sooty elbow around little lost homeless dewitt clinton park consider that a stovepipe is an important factor in any kitchen and the situation is analyzed tae chefs in hell s kitchen are many and the stovepipe gang wears the cordon blue the members of this unchartered but widely known brotherhood appeared to pass their time on street corners arrayed like the lilies of the conservatory and busy with nail files and penknives thus displayed as a guarantee of good faith they carried on an innocuous conversation in a word vocabulary to the casual observer as innocent and immaterial as that heard in clubs seven blocks to the east but off exhibition the stovepipes were not mere street corner ornaments addicted to posing and manicuring their serious occupation was the separating of citizens from their coin and valuables preferably this was done by weird and singular tricks without noise or bloodshed but whenever the citizen honored by their attentions refused to impoverish himself gracefully his objections came to be spread finally upon some police station blotter or hospital register the police held the stovepipe gang in perpetual suspicion and respect as the nightingale s liquid note is heard in the deepest shadows so along the stovepipe s dark and narrow confess the whistle for reserves punctures the dull ear of night whenever there was smoke in the stovepipe the tasselled men in blue knew there was fire in hell s kitchen kid brady promised molly to be good kid was the vainest the strongest the wariest and the most successful plotter in the gang therefore the boys were sorry to give him up but they witnessed his fall to a virtuous life with out protest for in the kitchen it is considered neither unmanly nor improper for a guy to do as his girl advises black her eye for love s sake if you will but it is all to the good business to do a thing when she wants you to do it turn off the hydrant said the kid one night when molly tearful besought him to amend his ways i m going to cut out the gang you for mine and the simple life on the side i ll tell you moll i ll get work and in a year we ll get married i ll do it for you we ll get a flat and a flute and a sewing machine and a rubber plant and live as honest as we can oh kid sighed molly wiping the powder off his shoulder with her handkerchief i d rather hear you say that than to own all of new york and we can be happy on so little the kid looked down at his speckless cuffs and shining patent leathers with a suspicion of melancholy it ll hurt hardest in the rags department said he i ve kind of always liked to rig out swell when i could you know how i hate cheap things moll this suit set me back sixty five anything in the wearing apparel line has got to be just so or it s to the misfit parlors for it for mine if i work i won t have so much coin to hand over to the little roan with the big shears never mind kid i ll like you just as much in a blue jumper as i would in a red automobile before the kid had grown large enough to knock out his father he had been compelled to learn the plumber s art so now back to this honorable and useful profession he returned but it was as an assistant that he engaged himself and it is the master plumber and not the assistant who wears diamonds as large as hailstones and looks contemptuously upon the marble colonnades of senator clark s mansion eight months went by as smoothly and surely as though they had elapsed on a theater program the kid worked away at his pipes and solder with no symptoms of backsliding the stovepipe gang continued its piracy on the high avenues cracked policemen s heads held up late travelers invented new methods of peaceful plundering copied fifth avenue s cut of clothes and neckwear fancies and comported itself according to its lawless bylaws but the kid stood firm and faithful to his molly even though the polish was gone from his fingernails and it took him minutes to tie his purple silk ascot so that the worn places would not show one evening he brought a mysterious bundle with him to molly s house open that moll he said in his large quiet way it s for you molly s eager fingers tore off the wrappings she shrieked aloud and in rushed a sprinkling of little mckeevers and ma mckeever dishwashy but an undeniable relative of the late mrs eve again molly shrieked and something dark and long and sinuous flew and enveloped her neck like an anaconda russian sables said the kid pridefully enjoying the sight of molly s round cheek against the clinging fur the real thing they don t grow anything in russia too good for you moll molly plunged her hands into the muff overturned a row of the family infants and flew to the mirror hint for the beauty column to make bright eyes rosy checks and a bewitching smile recipe one set russian sables apply when they were alone molly became aware of a small cake of the ice of common sense floating down the full tide of her happiness you re a bird all right kid she admitted gratefully i never had any furs on before in my life but ain t russian sables awful expensive seems to me i ve heard they were have i ever chucked any bargain sale stuff at you moll asked the kid with calm dignity did you ever notice me leaning on the remnant counter or peering in the window of the five and ten call that scarf and the muff and you won t make any mistake about the price of russian sables the swell goods for me say they look fine on you moll molly hugged the sables to her bosom in rapture and then her smile went away little by little and she looked the kid straight in the eye sadly and steadily he knew what every look of hers meant and he laughed with a faint flush upon his face cut it out he said with affectionate roughness i told you i was done with that i bought em and paid for em all right with my own money out of the money you worked for kid out of a month sure i been saving up let s see saved in eight months kid ah let up said the kid with some heat i had some money when i went to work do you think i ve been holding em up again i told you i d quit they re paid for on the square put em on and come out for a walk molly calmed her doubts sables are soothing proud as a queen she went forth in the streets at the kid s side in all that region of low lying streets russian sables had never been seen before the word sped and doors and windows blossomed with heads eager to see the swell furs kid brady had given his girl all down the street there were oh s and ah s and the reported fabulous sum paid for the sables was passed from lip to lip increasing as it went at her right elbow sauntered the kid with the air of princes work had not diminished his love of pomp and show and his passion for the costly and genuine on a corner they saw a group of the stovepipe gang loafing immaculate they raised their hats to the kid s girl and went on with their calm unaccented palaver three blocks behind the admired couple strolled detective ransom of the central office ransom was the only detective on the force who could walk abroad with safety in the stovepipe district he was fair dealing and unafraid and went there with the hypothesis that the inhabitants were human many liked him and now and then one would tip off to him something that he was

empty street near the river bank he touched the kid s arm from behind let me see you a moment brady he said quietly his eye rested for a second on the long fur scarf thrown stylishly back over molly s

pipe asked ransom i did said the kid what of it the lady s set of russian sables went out of the house about the same time you did the description fits the ones this lady has on to h harlem with you

too good for you if they cost a million molly with anguish in her face hung upon the kid s arm oh kiddy you ve broke my heart she said i was so proud of you and now they ll do you and where s our

said policeman kohen to ransom come on away the social triangle at the stroke of six ikey snigglefritz laid down his goose ikey was a tailor s apprentice are there tailor s apprentices nowadays at any rate ikey toiled and snipped and basted and pressed and patched and sponged all day in the steamy fetor of a tailor shop but when work was done ikey hitched his wagon to such stars as his firmament let shine it was saturday night and the boss laid twelve begrimed and begrudged dollars in his hand ikey dabbled discreetly in water donned coat hat and collar with its frazzled tie and chalcedony pin and set forth in pursuit of his ideals for each of us when our day s work is done must seek our ideal whether it be love or pinochle or lobster a la newburg or the sweet silence of the musty bookshelves behold ikey as he ambles up the street beneath the roaring el between the rows of reeking sweatshops pallid stooping insignificant squalid doomed to exist forever in penury of body and mind yet as he swings his cheap cane and projects the noisome inhalations from his cigarette you perceive that he nurtures in his narrow bosom the bacillus of society ikey s legs carried him to and into that famous place of entertainment known as the cafe maginnis famous because it was the rendezvous of billy mcmahan the greatest man the most wonderful man ikey thought that the world had ever produced billy mcmahan was the district leader upon him the tiger purred and his hand held manna to scatter now as ikey entered mcmahan stood flushed and triumphant and mighty the centre of a huzzaing concourse of his lieutenants and constituents it seems there had been an election a signal victory had been won the city had been swept back into line by a resistless besom of ballots ikey slunk along the bar and gazed breath quickened at his idol how magnificent was billy mcmahan with his great smooth laughing face his gray eye shrewd as a chicken hawk s his diamond ring his voice like a bugle call his prince s air his plump and active roll of money his clarion call to friend and comrade oh what a king of men he was how he obscured his lieutenants though they themselves loomed large and serious blue of chin and important of mien with hands buried deep in the pockets of their short overcoats but billy oh what small avail are words to paint for you his glory as seen by ikey snigglefritz the cafe maginnis rang to the note of victory the white coated bartenders threw themselves featfully upon bottle cork and glass from a score of clear havanas the air received its paradox of clouds the leal and the hopeful shook billy mcmahan s hand and there was born suddenly in the worshipful soul of ikey snigglefritz an audacious thrilling impulse he stepped forward into the little cleared space in which majesty moved and held out his hand billy mcmahan grasped it unhesitatingly shook it and smiled made mad now by the gods who were about to destroy him ikey threw away his scabbard and charged upon olympus have a drink with me billy he said familiarly you and your friends don t mind if i do old man said the great leader just to keep the ball rolling the last spark of ikey s reason fled wine he called to the bartender waving a trembling hand the corks of three bottles were drawn the champagne bubbled in the long row of glasses set upon the bar billy mcmahan took his and nodded with his beaming smile at ikey the lieutenants and satellites took theirs and growled here s to you ikey took his nectar in delirium all drank ikey threw his week s wages in a crumpled roll upon the bar c rect said the bartender smoothing the twelve one dollar notes the crowd surged around billy mcmahan again some one was telling how brannigan fixed em over in the eleventh ikey leaned against the bar a while and then went out he went down hester street and up chrystie and down delancey to where he lived and there his women folk a bibulous mother and three dingy sisters pounced upon him for his wages and at his confession they shrieked and objurgated him in the pithy rhetoric of the locality but even as they plucked at him and struck him ikey remained in his ecstatic trance of joy his head was in the clouds the star was drawing his wagon compared with what he had achieved the loss of wages and the bray of women s tongues were slight affairs he had shaken the hand of billy mcmahan billy mcmahan had a wife and upon her visiting cards was engraved the name mrs william darragh mcmahan and there was a certain vexation attendant upon these cards for small as they were there were houses in which they could not be inserted billy mcmahan was a dictator in politics a four walled tower in business a mogul dreaded loved and obeyed among his own people he was growing rich the daily papers had a dozen men on his trail to chronicle his every word of wisdom he had been honored in caricature holding the tiger cringing in leash but the heart of billy was sometimes sore within him there was a race of men from which he stood apart but that he viewed with the eye of moses looking over into the promised land he too had ideals even as had ikey snigglefritz and sometimes hopeless of attaining them his own solid success was as dust and ashes in his mouth and mrs william darragh mcmahan wore a look of discontent upon her plump but pretty face and the very rustle of her silks seemed a sigh there was a brave and conspicuous assemblage in the dining saloon of a noted hostelry where fashion loves to display her charms at one table sat billy mcmahan and his wife mostly silent they were but the accessories they enjoyed little needed the indorsement of speech mrs mcmahan s diamonds were outshone by few in the room the waiter bore the costliest brands of wine to their table in evening dress with an expression of gloom upon his smooth and massive countenance you would look in vain for a more striking figure than billy s four tables away sat alone a tall slender man about thirty with thoughtful melancholy eyes a van dyke beard and peculiarly white thin hands he was dining on filet mignon dry toast and apollinaris that man was cortlandt van duyckink a man worth eighty millions who inherited and held a sacred seat in the exclusive inner circle of society billy mcmahan spoke to no one around him because he knew no one van duyckink kept his eyes on his plate because he knew that every one present was hungry to catch his he could bestow knighthood and prestige by a nod and he was chary of creating a too extensive nobility and then billy mcmahan conceived and accomplished the most startling and audacious act of his life he rose deliberately and walked over to cortlandt van duyckink s table and held out his hand say mr van duyckink he said i ve heard you was talking about starting some reforms among the poor people down in my district i m mcmahan you know say now if that s straight i ll do all i can to help you and what i says goes in that neck of the woods don t it oh say i rather guess it does van duyckink s rather sombre eyes lighted up he rose to his lank height and grasped billy mcmahan s hand thank you mr mcmahan he said in his deep serious tones i have been thinking of doing some work of that sort i shall be glad of your assistance it pleases me to have become acquainted with you billy walked back to his seat his shoulder was tingling from the accolade bestowed by royalty a hundred eyes were now turned upon him in envy and new admiration mrs william darragh mcmahan trembled with ecstasy so that her diamonds smote the eye almost with pain and now it was apparent that at many tables there were those who suddenly remembered that they enjoyed mr mcmahan s acquaintance he saw smiles and bows about him he became enveloped in the aura of dizzy greatness his campaign coolness deserted him wine for that gang he commanded the waiter pointing with his finger wine over there wine to those three gents by that green bush tell em it s on me d n it wine for everybody the waiter ventured to whisper that it was perhaps inexpedient to carry out the order in consideration of the dignity of the house and its custom all right said billy if it s against the rules i wonder if twould do to send my friend van duyckink a bottle no well it ll flow all right at the caffy to night just the same it ll be rubber boots for anybody who comes in there any time up to a m billy mcmahan was happy he had shaken the hand of cortlandt van duyckink the big pale gray auto with its shining metal work looked out of place moving slowly among the push carts and trash heaps on the lower east side so did cortlandt van duyckink with his aristocratic face and white thin hands as he steered carefully between the groups of ragged scurrying youngsters in the streets and so did miss constance schuyler with her dim ascetic beauty seated at his side oh cortlandt she breathed isn t it sad that human beings have to live in such wretchedness and poverty and you how noble it is of you to think of them to give your time and money to improve their condition van duyckink turned his solemn eyes upon her it is little he said sadly that i can do the question is a large one and belongs to society but even individual effort is not thrown away look constance on this street i have arranged to build soup kitchens where no one who is hungry will be turned away and down this other street are the old buildings that i shall cause to be torn down and there erect others in place of those death traps of fire and disease down delancey slowly crept the pale gray auto away from it toddled coveys of wondering tangle haired barefooted unwashed children it stopped before a crazy brick structure foul and awry van duyckink alighted to examine at a better perspective one of the leaning walls down the steps of the building came a young man who seemed to epitomize its degradation squalor and infelicity a narrow chested pale unsavory young man puffing at a cigarette obeying a sudden impulse van duyckink stepped out and warmly grasped the hand of what seemed to him a living rebuke i want to know you people he said sincerely i am going to help you as much as i can we shall be friends as the auto crept carefully away cortlandt van duyckink felt an unaccustomed glow about his heart he was near to being a happy man he had shaken the hand of ikey snigglefritz the purple dress we are to consider the shade known as purple it is a color justly in repute among the sons and daughters of man emperors claim it for their especial dye good fellows everywhere seek to bring their noses to the genial hue that follows the commingling of the red and blue we say of princes that they are born to the purple and no doubt they are for the colic tinges their faces with the royal tint equally with the snub nosed countenance of a woodchopper s brat all women love it when it is the fashion and now purple is being worn you notice it on the streets of course other colors are quite stylish as well in fact i saw a lovely thing the other day in olive green albatross with a triple lapped flounce skirt trimmed with insert squares of silk and a draped fichu of lace opening over a shirred vest and double puff sleeves with a lace band holding two gathered frills but you see lots of purple too oh yes you do just take a walk down twenty third street any afternoon therefore maida the girl with the big brown eyes and cinnamon colored hair in the bee hive store said to grace the girl with the rhinestone brooch and peppermint pepsin flavor to her speech i m going to have a purple dress a tailor made purple dress for thanksgiving oh are you said grace putting away some gloves into the box well it s me for red you see more red on fifth avenue and the men all seem to like it i like purple best said maida and old schlegel has promised to make it for it s going to be lovely i m going to have a plaited skirt and a blouse coat trimmed with a band of galloon under a white cloth collar with two rows of sly boots said grace with an educated wink soutache braid over a surpliced white vest and a plaited basque and sly boots sly boots repeated grace plaited gigot sleeves with a drawn velvet ribbon over an inside cuff what do you mean by saying that you think mr ramsay likes purple i heard him say yesterday he thought some of the dark shades of red were stunning i don t care said maida i prefer purple and them that don t like it can just take the other side of the street which suggests the thought that after all the followers of purple may be subject to slight delusions danger is near when a maiden thinks she can wear purple regardless of complexions and opinions and when emperors think their purple robes will wear forever maida had saved after eight months of economy and this had bought the goods for the purple dress and paid schlegel on the making of it on the day before thanksgiving she would have just enough to pay the remaining and then for a holiday in a new dress can earth offer anything more enchanting old bachman the proprietor of the bee hive store always gave a thanksgiving dinner to his employees on every one of the subsequent days excusing sundays he would remind them of the joys of the past banquet and the hopes of the coming ones thus inciting them to increased enthusiasm in work the dinner was given in the store on one of the long tables in the middle of the room they tacked wrapping paper over the front windows and the turkeys and other good things were brought in the back way from the restaurant on the corner you will perceive that the bee hive was not a fashionable department store with escalators and pompadours it was almost small enough to be called an emporium and you could actually go in there and get waited on and walk out again and always at the thanksgiving dinners mr ramsay oh bother i should have mentioned mr ramsay first of all he is more important than purple or green or even the red cranberry sauce mr ramsay was the head clerk and as far as i am concerned i am for him he never pinched the girls arms when he passed them in dark corners of the store and when he told them stories when business was dull and the girls giggled and said oh pshaw it wasn t g bernard they meant at all besides being a gentleman mr ramsay was queer and original in other ways he was a health crank and believed that people should never eat anything that was good for them he was violently opposed to anybody being comfortable and coming in out of snow storms or wearing overshoes or taking medicine or coddling themselves in any way every one of the ten girls in the store had little pork chop and fried onion dreams every night of becoming mrs ramsay for next year old bachman was going to take him in for a partner and each one of them knew that if she should catch him she would knock those cranky health notions of his sky high before the wedding cake indigestion was over mr ramsay was master of ceremonies at the dinners always they had two italians in to play a violin and harp and had a little dance in the store and here were two dresses being conceived to charm ramsay one purple and the other red of course the other eight girls were going to have dresses too but they didn t count very likely they d wear some shirt waist and black skirt affairs nothing as resplendent as purple or red grace had saved her money too she was going to buy her dress ready made oh what s the use of bothering with a tailor when you ve got a figger it s easy to get a fit the ready made are intended for a perfect figger except i have to have em all taken in at the waist the average figger is so large waisted the night before thanksgiving came maida hurried home keen and bright with the thoughts of the blessed morrow her thoughts were of purple but they were white themselves the joyous enthusiasm of the young for the pleasures that youth must have or wither she knew purple would become her and for the thousandth time she tried to assure herself that it was purple mr ramsay said he liked and not red she was going home first to get the wrapped in a piece of tissue paper in the bottom drawer of her dresser and then she was going to pay schlegel and take the dress home herself grace lived in the same house she occupied the hall room above maida s at home maida found clamor and confusion the landlady s tongue clattering sourly in the halls like a churn dasher dabbing in buttermilk and then grace come down to her room crying with eyes as red as any dress she says i ve got to get out said grace the old beast because i owe her she s put my trunk in the hall and locked the door i can t go anywhere else i haven t got a cent of money you had some yesterday said maida i paid it on my dress said grace i thought she d wait till next week for the rent sniffle sniffle sob sniffle out came out it had to come maida s you blessed darling cried grace now a rainbow instead of sunset i ll pay the mean old thing and then i m going to try on my dress i think it s heavenly come up and look at it i ll pay the money back a dollar a week honest i will thanksgiving the dinner was to be at noon at a quarter to twelve grace switched into maida s room yes she looked charming red was her color maida sat by the window in her old cheviot skirt and blue waist darning a st oh doing fancy work why goodness me ain t you dressed yet shrilled the red one how does it fit in the back don t you think these velvet tabs look awful swell why ain t you dressed maida my dress didn t get finished in time said maida i m not going to the dinner that s too bad why i m awfully sorry maida why don t you put on anything and come along it s just the store folks you know and they won t mind i was set on my purple said maida if i can t have it i won t go at all don t bother about me run along or you ll be late you look awful nice in red at her window maida sat through the long morning and past the time of the dinner at the store in her mind she could hear the girls shrieking over a pull bone could hear old bachman s roar over his own deeply concealed jokes could see the diamonds of fat mrs bachman who came to the store only on thanksgiving days could see mr ramsay moving about alert kindly looking to the comfort of all at four in the afternoon with an expressionless face and a lifeless air she slowly made her way to schlegel s shop and told him she could not pay the due on the dress gott cried schlegel angrily for what do you look so glum take him away he is ready pay me some time haf i not seen you pass mine shop every day in two years if i make clothes is it that i do not know how to read beoples because you will pay me some time when you can take him away he is made goot and if you look bretty in him all right so pay me when you can maida breathed a millionth part of the thanks in her heart and hurried away with her dress as she left the shop a smart dash of rain struck upon her face she smiled and did not feel it ladies who shop in carriages you do not understand girls whose wardrobes are charged to the old man s account you cannot begin to comprehend you could not understand why maida did not feel the cold dash of the thanksgiving rain at five o clock she went out upon the street wearing her purple dress the rain had increased and it beat down upon her in a steady wind blown pour people were scurrying home and to cars with close held umbrellas and tight buttoned raincoats many of them turned their heads to marvel at this beautiful serene happy eyed girl in the purple dress walking through the storm as though she were strolling in a garden under summer skies i say you do not understand it ladies of the full purse and varied wardrobe you do not know what it is to live with a perpetual longing for pretty things to starve eight months in order to bring a purple dress and a holiday together what difference if it rained hailed blew snowed cycloned maida had no umbrella nor overshoes she had her purple dress and she walked abroad let the elements do their worst a starved heart must have one crumb during a year the rain ran down and dripped from her fingers some one turned a corner and blocked her way she looked up into mr ramsay s eyes sparkling with admiration and interest why miss maida said he you look simply magnificent in your new dress i was greatly disappointed not to see you at our dinner and of all the girls i ever knew you show the greatest sense and intelligence there is nothing more healthful and invigorating than braving the weather as you are doing may i walk with you and maida blushed and sneezed the foreign policy of company john byrnes hose cart driver of engine company no was afflicted with what his comrades called japanits byrnes had a war map spread permanently upon a table in the second story of the engine house and he could explain to you at any hour of the day or night the exact positions conditions and intentions of both the russian and japanese armies he had little clusters of pins stuck in the map which represented the opposing forces and these be moved about from day to day in conformity with the war news in the daily papers wherever the japs won a victory john byrnes would shift his pins and then he would execute a war dance of delight and the other firemen would hear him yell go it you blamed little sawed off huckleberry eyed monkey faced hot tamales eat em up you little sleight o hand bow legged bull terriers give em another of them yalu looloos and you ll eat rice in st petersburg talk about your russians say wouldn t they give you a painsky when it comes to a scrapovitch not even on the fair island of nippon was there a more enthusiastic champion of the mikado s men supporters of the russian cause did well to keep clear of engine house no sometimes all thoughts of the japs left john byrnes s head that was when the alarm of fire had sounded and he was strapped in his driver s seat on the swaying cart guilding erebus and joe the finest team in the whole department according to the crew of of all the codes adopted by man for regulating his actions toward his fellow mortals the greatest are these the code of king arthur s knights of the round table the constitution of the united states and the unwritten rules of the new york fire department the round table methods are no longer practicable since the invention of street cars and breach of promise suits and our constitution is being found more and more unconstitutional every day so the code of our firemen must be considered in the lead with the golden rule and jeffries s new punch trying for place and show the constitution says that one man is as good as another but the fire department says he is better this is a too generous theory but the law will not tallow itself to be construed otherwise all of which comes perilously near to being a paradox and commends itself to the attention of the s p c a one of the transatlantic liners dumped out at ellis island a lump of protozoa which was expected to evolve into an american citizen a steward kicked him down the gangway a doctor pounced upon his eyes like a raven seeking for trachoma or ophthalmia he was hustled ashore and ejected into the city in the name of liberty perhaps theoretically thus inoculating against kingocracy with a drop of its own virus this hypodermic injection of europeanism wandered happily into the veins of the city with the broad grin of a pleased child it was not burdened with baggage cares or ambitions its body was lithely built and clothed in a sort of foreign fustian its face was brightly vacant with a small flat nose and was mostly covered by a thick ragged curling beard like the coat of a spaniel in the pocket of the imported thing were a few coins denarii sendi kopecks pfennigs pilasters whatever the financial nomenclature of his unknown country nay have been prattling to himself always broadly grinning pleased by the roar and movement of the barbarous city into which the steamship cut rates had shunted him the alien strayed away from the sea which he hated as far as the district covered by engine company no light as a cork he was kept bobbing along by the human tide the cruelest atom in all the silt of the stream that emptied into the reservoir of liberty while crossing third avenue he slowed his steps enchanted by the thunder of the elevated trains above him and the soothing crash of the wheels on the cobbles and then there was a new delightful chord in the uproar the musical clanging of a gong and a great shining juggernaut belching fire and smoke that people were hurrying to see this beautiful thing entrancing to the eye dashed past and the protoplasmic immigrant stepped into the wake of it with his broad enraptured uncomprehending grin and so stepping stepped into the path of no s flying hose cart with john byrnes gripping with arms of steel the reins over the plunging backs of erebus and joe the unwritten constitutional code of the fireman has no exceptions or amendments it is a simple thing as simple as the rule of three there was the heedless unit in the right of way there was the hose cart and the iron pillar of the elevated railroad john byrnes swung all his weight and muscle on the left rein the team and cart swerved that way and crashed like a torpedo into the pillar the men on the cart went flying like skittles the driver s strap burst the pillar rang with the shock and john byrnes fell on the car track with a broken shoulder twenty feet away while erebus beautiful raven black best loved erebus lay whickering in his harness with a broken leg in consideration for the feelings of engine company no the details will be lightly touched the company does not like to be reminded of that day there was a great crowd and hurry calls were sent in and while the ambulance gong was clearing the way the men of no heard the crack of the s p c a agent s pistol and turned their heads away not daring to look toward erebus again when the firemen got back to the engine house they found that one of them was dragging by the

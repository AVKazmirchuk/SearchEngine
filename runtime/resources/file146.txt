idly scrawling letters in the sand with the staff of her silken parasol the beauty of her face is audacious her languid pose is one that you feel to be impermanent you wait expectant for her to spring or glide or crawl like a panther that has unaccountably become stock still she idly scrawls in the sand and the word that she always writes is isabel a man sits a few yards away you can see that they are companions ever if no longer comrades his face is dark and smooth and almost inscrutable but not quite the two speak little together the man also scratches on the sand with his cane and the word that he writes is anchuria and then he looks out where the mediterranean and the sky intermingle with death in his gaze the wilderness and thou scene the borders of a gentleman s estate in a tropical land an old indian with a mahogany colored face is trimming the grass on a grave by a mangrove swamp presently he rises to his feet and walks slowly toward a grove that is shaded by the gathering brief twilight in the edge of the grove stands a man who is stalwart with a kind and courteous air and a woman of a serene and clear cut loveliness when the old indian comes up to them the man drops money in his hand the grave tender with the stolid pride of his race takes it as his due and goes his way the two in the edge of the grove turn back along the dim pathway and walk close close for

for there was katie mahorner his sweetheart of county sligo lost since she started for america three months before with two hundred dollars her own savings and one hundred dollars from the sale of tobin s inherited estate a fine cottage and pig on the bog shannaugh and since the letter that tobin got saying that she had started to come to him not a bit of news had he heard or seen of katie mahorner tobin advertised in the papers but nothing could be found of the colleen so to coney me and tobin went thinking that a turn at the chutes and the smell of the popcorn might raise the heart in his bosom but tobin was a hardheaded man and the sadness stuck in his skin he ground his teeth at the crying balloons he cursed the moving pictures and though he would drink whenever asked he scorned punch and judy and was for licking the tintype men as they came so i gets him down a side way on a board walk where the attractions were some less violent at a little six by eight stall tobin halts with a more human look in his eye tis here says he i will be diverted i ll have the palm of me hand investigated by the wonderful palmist of the nile and see if what is to be will be tobin was a believer in signs and the unnatural in nature he possessed illegal convictions in his mind along the subjects of black cats lucky numbers and the weather predictions in the papers we went into the enchanted chicken coop which was fixed mysterious with red cloth and pictures of hands with lines crossing em like a railroad centre the sign over the door says it is madame zozo the egyptian palmist there was a fat woman inside in a red jumper with pothooks and beasties embroidered upon it tobin gives her ten cents and extends one of his hands she lifts tohin s hand which is own brother to the hoof of a drayhorse and examines it to see whether tis a stone in the frog or a cast shoe he has come for man says this madame zozo the line of your fate shows tis not me foot at all says tobin

square with the accumulations of b a and two years of europe thick upon him he took a filial look at septimus kinsolving s elaborate tombstone in greenwood and a tedious excursion through typewritten documents with the family lawyer and then feeling himself a lonely and hopeless millionaire hurried down to the old jewelry store across sixth avenue kenwitz unscrewed a magnifying glass from his eye routed out his parent from a dingy rear room and abandoned the interior of watches for outdoors he went with dan and they sat on a bench in washington square dan had not changed much he was stalwart and had a dignity that was inclined to relax into a grin kenwitz was more serious more intense more learned philosophical and socialistic i know about it now said dan finally i pumped it out of the eminent legal lights that turned over to me poor old dad s collections of bonds and boodle it amounts to ken and i am told that he squeezed it out of the chaps that pay their pennies for loaves of bread at little bakeries around the corner you ve studied economics dan and you know all about monopolies and the masses and octopuses and the rights of laboring people i never thought about those things before football and trying to be white to my fellowman were about the extent of my college curriculum but since i came back and found out how dad made his money i ve been thinking i d like awfully well to pay back those chaps who had to give up too much money for bread i know it would buck the line of my income for a good many yards but i d like to make it square with em is there any way it can be done old ways and means kenwitz s big black eyes glowed fierily his thin intellectual face took on almost a sardonic cast he caught dan s arm with the grip of a friend and a judge you can t do it he said emphatically one of the chief punishments of you men of ill gotten wealth is that when you do repent you find that you have lost the power to make reparation or restitution i admire your good intentions dan but you can t do anything those people were robbed of their precious pennies it s too late to remedy the evil you can t pay them back of course said dan lighting his pipe we couldn t hunt up every one of the duffers and hand em back the right change there s an awful lot of em buying bread all the time funny taste they have i never cared for bread especially except for a toasted cracker with the roquefort but we might find a few of em and chuck some of dad s cash back where it came from i d feel better if i could it seems tough for people to be held up for a soggy thing like bread one wouldn t mind standing a rise in broiled lobsters or deviled crabs get to work and think ken i want to pay back all that money i can there are plenty of charities said kenwitz mechanically easy enough said dan in a cloud of smoke i suppose i could give the city a park or endow an asparagus bed in a hospital but i don t want paul to get away with the proceeds of the gold brick we sold peter it s the bread shorts i want to cover ken the thin fingers of kenwitz moved rapidly do you know how much money it would take to pay back the losses of consumers during that corner in flour he asked i do not said dan stoutly my lawyer tells me that i have two millions if you had a hundred millions said kenwitz vehemently you couldn t repair a thousandth part of the damage that has been done you cannot conceive of the accumulated evils produced by misapplied wealth each penny that was wrung from the lean purses of the poor reacted a thousandfold to their harm you do not understand you do not see how hopeless is your desire to make restitution not in a single instance can it be done back up philosopher said dan the penny has no sorrow that the dollar cannot heal not in one instance repeated kenwitz i will give you one and let us see thomas boyne had a little bakery over there in varick street he sold bread to the poorest people when the price of flour went up he had to raise the price of bread his customers were too poor to pay it boyne s business failed and he lost his capital all he had in the world dan kinsolving struck the park bench a mighty blow with his fist i accept the instance he cried take me to boyne i will repay his thousand dollars and buy him a new bakery write your check said kenwitz without moving and then begin to write checks in payment of the train of consequences draw the next one for boyne went insane after his failure and set fire to the building from which he was about to be evicted the loss amounted to that much boyne died in an asylum stick to the instance said dan i haven t noticed any insurance companies on my charity list draw your next check for went on kenwitz boyne s son fell into bad way after the bakery closed and was accused of murder he was acquitted last week after a three years legal battle and the state draws upon taxpayers for that much expense back to the bakery exclaimed dan impatiently the government doesn t need to stand in the bread line the last item of the instance is come and i will show you said kenwitz rising the socialistic watchmaker was happy he

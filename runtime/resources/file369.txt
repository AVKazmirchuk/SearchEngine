would and then men began to skin along the edge of the plaza dodging in among the orange trees and houses we certainly had things stirred up in salvador we felt proud of the occasion and grateful to general dingo sterrett was about to take a bite off a juicy piece of rib when a bullet took it away from his mouth somebody s celebrating with ball cartridges says he reaching for another piece little over zealous for a non resident patriot isn t it don t mind it i says to him twas an accident they happen you know on the fourth after one reading of the declaration of independence in new york i ve known the s r o sign to be hung out at all the hospitals and police stations but then jerry gives a howl and jumps up with one hand clapped to the back of his leg where another bullet has acted over zealous and then comes a quantity of yells and round a corner and across the plaza gallops general mary esperanza dingo embracing the neck of his horse with his men running behind him mostly dropping their guns by way of discharging ballast and chasing em all is a company of feverish little warriors wearing blue trousers and caps assistance amigos the general shouts trying to stop his horse assistance in the name of liberty that s the campania azul the president s bodyguard says jones what a shame they ve jumped on poor old mary just because he was helping us to celebrate come on boys it s our fourth do we let that little squad of a d t s break it up i vote no says martin dillard gathering his winchester it s the privilege of an american citizen to drink drill dress up and be dreadful on the fourth of july no matter whose country he s in fellow citizens says old man billfinger in the darkest hour of freedom s birth when our brave forefathers promulgated the principles of undying liberty they never expected that a bunch of blue jays like that should be allowed to bust up an anniversary let us preserve and protect the constitution we made it unanimous and then we gathered our guns and assaulted the blue troops in force we fired over their heads and then charged em with a yell and they broke and ran we were irritated at having our barbecue disturbed and we chased em a quarter of a mile some of em we caught and kicked hard the general rallied his troops and joined in the chase finally they scattered in a thick banana grove and we couldn t flush a single one so we sat down and rested if i were to be put severe through the third degree i wouldn t be able to tell much about the rest of the day i mind that we pervaded the town considerable calling upon the people to bring out more armies for us to destroy i remember seeing a crowd somewhere and a tall man that wasn t billfinger making a fourth of july speech from a balcony and that was about all somebody must have hauled the old ice factory up to where i was and put it around me for there s where i was when i woke up the next morning as soon as i could recollect by name and address i got up and held an

on my file i find one report senor casparis that you have not made ice in accord with your contract and here the bay man smiles at me cute oh well says i i guess the report s straight i know they caught me that s all there is to it do not say so says the bay man he pulls off a glove and goes over and lays his hand on that chunk of glass ice says he nodding his head solemn general dingo also steps over and feels of it ice says the general i ll swear to it if senor casparis says the bay man will present himself to the treasury on the sixth day of this month he will receive back the

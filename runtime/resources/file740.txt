s instinct guided only by an occasional glimpse of a far distant hilltop a peculiarly shaped knot of trees or the position of the sun sam rode down the sloping hill and plunged into the great pear flat that lies between the quintanilla and the piedra in about two hours he discovered that he was lost then came the usual confusion of mind and the hurry to get somewhere mexico was anxious to redeem the situation twisting with alacrity along the tortuous labyrinths of the jungle at the moment his master s sureness of the route had failed his horse had divined the fact there were no hills now that they could climb to obtain a view of the country they came upon a few but so dense and interlaced was the brush that scarcely could a rabbit penetrate the mass they were in the great lonely thicket of the frio bottoms it was a mere nothing for a cattleman or a sheepman to be lost for a day or a night the thing often happened it was merely a matter of missing a meal or two and sleeping comfortably on your saddle blankets on a soft mattress of mesquite grass but in sam s case it was different he had never been away from his ranch at night marthy was afraid of the country afraid of mexicans of snakes of panthers even of sheep so he had never left her alone it must have been about four in the afternoon when sam s conscience awoke he was limp and drenched rather from anxiety than the heat or fatigue until now he had been hoping to strike the trail that led to the frio crossing and the chapman ranch he must have crossed it at some dim part of it and ridden beyond if so he was now something like fifty miles from home if he could strike a ranch a camp any place where he could get a fresh horse and inquire the road he would ride all night to get back to marthy and the kid so i have hinted sam was seized bv remorse there was a big lump in his throat as he thought of the cross words he had spoken to his wife surely it was hard enough for her to live in that horrible country witnout having to bear the burden of his abuse he cursed himself grimly and felt a sudden flush of shame that over glowed the summer heat as he remembered the many times he had flouted and railed at her because she had a liking for reading fiction ther only so ce ov amusement ther po gal s got said sam aloud with a sob which unaccustomed sound caused mexico to shy a bit a livin with a sore headed kiote like me a low down skunk that ought to be licked to death with a saddle cinch a cookin and a washin and a livin on mutton and beans and me abusin her fur takin a squint or two in a little book he thought of marthy as she had been when he first met her in dogtown smart pretty and saucy before the sun had turned the roses in her cheeks brown and the silence of the chaparral had tamed her ambitions ef i ever speaks another hard word to ther little gal muttered sam or fails in the love and affection that s coming to her in the deal i hopes a wildcat ll t ar me to pieces he knew what he would do he would write to garcia jones his san antonio merchants where he bought his supplies and sold his wool and have them send down a big box of novels and reading matter for marthy things were going to be different he wondered whether a little piano could be placed in one of the rooms of the ranch house without the family having to move out of doors in nowise calculated to allay his self reproach was the thought that marthy and randy would have to pass the night alone in spite of their bickerings when night came marthy was wont to dismiss her fears of the country and rest her head upon sam s strong arm with a sigh of peaceful content and dependence and were her fears so groundless sam thought of roving marauding mexicans of stealthy cougars that sometimes invaded the ranches of rattlesnakes centipedes and a dozen possible dangers marthy would be frantic with fear randy would cry and call for dada to come still the interminable succession of stretches of brush cactus and mesquite hollow after hollow slope after slope all exactly alike all familiar by constant repetition and yet all strange and new if he could only arrive somewhere the straight line is art nature moves in circles a straightforward man is more an artificial product than a diplomatist is men lost in the snow travel in exact circles until they sink exhausted as their footprints have attested also travellers in philosophy and other mental processes frequently wind up at their starting point it was when sam webber was fullest of contrition and good resolves that mexico with a heavy sigh subsided from his regular brisk trot into a slow complacent walk they were winding up an easy slope covered with brush ten or twelve feet high i say now mex demurred sam this here won t do i know you re plumb tired out but we got ter git along oh lordy ain t there no mo houses in the world he gave mexico a smart kick with his heels mexico gave a protesting grunt as if to say what s the use of that now we

tub i had a pretty good idea where old wahrfield that was his name j churchill wahrfield would head for at that time we had a treaty with about every foreign country except belgium and that banana republic anchuria there wasn t a photo of old wahrfield to be had in new york he had been foxy there but i had his description and besides the lady with him would be a dead give away anywhere she was one of the high flyers in society not the kind that have their pictures in the sunday papers but the real sort that open chrysanthemum shows and christen battleships well sir we never got a sight of that fruit tub on the road the ocean is a pretty big place and i guess we took different paths across it but we kept going toward this anchuria where the fruiter was bound for we struck the monkey coast one afternoon about four there was a ratty looking steamer off shore taking on bananas the monkeys were loading her up with big barges it might be the one the old man had taken and it might not i went ashore to look around the scenery was pretty good i never saw any finer on the new york stage i struck an american on shore a big cool chap standing around with the monkeys he showed me the consul s office the consul was a nice young fellow he said the fruiter was the karlsefin running generally to new orleans but took her last cargo to new york then i was sure my people were on board although everybody told me that no passengers had landed i didn t think they would land until after dark for they might have been shy about it on account of seeing that yacht of mine hanging around so all i had to do was to wait and nab em when they came ashore i couldn t arrest old wahrfield without extradition papers but my play was to get the cash they generally give up if you strike em when they re tired and rattled and short on nerve after dark i sat under a coconut tree on the beach for a while and then i walked around and investigated that town some and it was enough to give you the lions if a man could stay in new york and be honest he d better do it than to hit that monkey town with a million dinky little mud houses grass over your shoe tops in the streets ladies in low neck and short sleeves walking around smoking cigars tree frogs rattling like a hose cart going to a ten blow big mountains dropping gravel in the back yards and the sea licking the paint off in front no sir a man had better be in god s country living on free lunch than there the main street ran along the beach and i walked down it and then turned up a kind of lane where the houses were made of poles and straw i wanted to see what the monkeys did when they weren t climbing coconut trees the very first shack i looked in i saw my people they must have come ashore while i was promenading a man about fifty smooth face heavy eyebrows dressed in black broadcloth looking like he was just about to say can any little boy in the sunday school answer that he was freezing on to a grip that weighed like a dozen gold bricks and a swell girl a regular peach with a fifth avenue cut was sitting on a wooden chair an old black woman was fixing some coffee and beans on a table the light they had come from a lantern hung on a nail i went and stood in the door and they looked at me and i said mr wahrfield you are my prisoner i hope for the lady s sake you will take the matter sensibly you know why i want you who are you says the old gent o day says i of the columbia detective agency and now sir let me give you a piece of good advice you go back and take your medicine like a man hand em back the boodle and maybe they ll let you off light go back easy and i ll put in a word for you i ll give you five minutes to decide i pulled out my watch and waited then the young lady chipped in she was one of the genuine high steppers you could tell by the way her clothes fit and the style she had that fifth avenue was made for her come inside she says don t stand in the door and disturb the whole street with that suit of clothes now what is it you want three minutes gone i said i ll tell you again while the other two tick off you ll admit being the president of the republic won t you i am says he well then says i it ought to be plain to you wanted in new york j churchill wahrfield president of the republic insurance company also the funds belonging to said company now in that grip in the unlawful possession of said j churchill wahrfield oh h h h says the young lady as if she was thinking you want to take us back to new york to take mr wahrfield there s no charge against you miss there ll be no objection of course to your returning with your father of a sudden the girl gave a tiny scream and grabbed the old boy around the neck oh father father she says kind of contralto can this be true have you taken money that is not yours speak father it made you shiver to hear the tremolo stop she put on her voice the old boy looked pretty bughouse when she

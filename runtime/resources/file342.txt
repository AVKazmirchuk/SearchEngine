sooner we endow our colleges with chairs of moral astronomy the better it isn t the size of the star that counts said kearny it s the quality just the way it is with women that s why they give the biggest planets masculine names and the little stars feminine ones to even things up when it comes to getting their work in suppose they had called my star agamemnon or bill mccarty or something like that instead of phoebe every time one of those old boys touched their calamity button and sent me down one of their wireless pieces of bad luck i could talk back and tell em what i thought of em in suitable terms but you can t address such remarks to a phoebe it pleases you to make a joke of it kearny said i without smiling but it is no joke to me to think of my gatling mired in the river ooze as to that said kearny abandoning his light mood at once i have already done what i could i have had some experience in hoisting stone in quarries torres and i have already spliced three hawsers and stretched them from the steamer s stern to a tree on shore we will rig a tackle and have the gun on terra firma before noon to morrow one could not remain long at outs with bad luck kearny once more said i to him we will waive this question of luck have you ever had experience in drilling raw troops i was first sergeant and drill master said kearny in the chilean army for one year and captain of artillery for another what became of your command i asked shot down to a man said kearny during the revolutions against balmaceda somehow the misfortunes of the evil starred one seemed to turn to me their comedy side i lay back upon my goat s hide cot and laughed until the woods echoed kearny grinned i told you how it was he said to morrow i said i shall detail one hundred men under your command for manual of arms drill and company evolutions you rank as lieutenant now for god s sake kearny i urged him try to combat this superstition if it is one bad luck may be like any other visitor preferring to stop where it is expected get your mind off stars look upon esperando as your planet of good fortune i thank you captain said kearny quietly i will try to make it the best handicap i ever ran by noon the next day the submerged gatling was rescued as kearny had promised then carlos and manuel ortiz and kearny my lieutenants distributed winchesters among the troops and put them through an incessant rifle drill we fired no shots blank or solid for of all coasts esperando is the stillest and we had no desire to sound any warnings in the ear of that corrupt government until they should carry with them the message of liberty and the downfall of oppression in the afternoon came a mule rider bearing a written message to me from don rafael valdevia in the capital aguas frias whenever that man s name comes to my lips words of tribute to his greatness his noble simplicity and his conspicuous genius follow irrepressibly he was a traveller a student of peoples and governments a master of sciences a poet an orator a leader a soldier a critic of the world s campaigns and the idol of the people in esperando i had been honoured by his friendship for years it was i who first

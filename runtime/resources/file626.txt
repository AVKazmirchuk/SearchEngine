not without excuse for the bad man of the southwest does not run to extremes those brigands might justly have been taken for a little party of peaceable rustics assembled for a fish fry or pecan gathering gentle of manner slouching of gait soft voiced unpicturesquely clothed not one of them presented to the eye any witness of the desperate records they had earned for two days the glittering stranger within the camp was feasted then by common consent he was invited to become a member of the band he consented presenting for enrollment the prodigious name of captain montressor this name was immediately overruled by the band and piggy substituted as a compliment to the awful and insatiate appetite of its owner thus did the texas border receive the most spectacular brigand that ever rode its chaparral for the next three months bud king conducted business as usual escaping encounters with law officers and being content with reasonable profits the band ran off some very good companies of horses from the ranges and a few bunches of fine cattle which they got safely across the rio grande and disposed of to fair advantage often the band would ride into the little villages and mexican settlements terrorizing the inhabitants and plundering for the provisions and ammunition they needed it was during these bloodless raids that piggy s ferocious aspect and frightful voice gained him a renown more widespread and glorious than those other gentle voiced and sad faced desperadoes could have acquired in a lifetime the mexicans most apt in nomenclature first called him the black eagle and used to frighten the babes by threatening them with tales of the dreadful robber who carried off little children in his great beak soon the name extended and black eagle the terror of the border became a recognized factor in exaggerated newspaper reports and ranch gossip the country from the nueces to the rio grande was a wild but fertile stretch given over to the sheep and cattle ranches range was free the inhabitants were few the law was mainly a letter and the pirates met with little opposition until the flaunting and garish piggy gave the band undue advertisement then mckinney s ranger company headed for those precincts and bud king knew that it meant grim and sudden war or else temporary retirement regarding the risk to be unnecessary he drew off his band to an almost inaccessible spot on the bank of the frio wherefore as has been said dissatisfaction arose among the members and impeachment proceedings against bud were premeditated with black eagle in high favour for the succession bud king was not unaware of the sentiment and he called aside cactus taylor his trusted lieutenant to discuss it if the boys said bud ain t satisfied with me i m willing to step out they re buckin against my way of handlin em and specially because i concludes to hit the brush while sam kinney is ridin the line i saves em from bein shot or sent up on a state contract and they up and says i m no good it ain t so much that explained cactus as it is they re plum locoed about piggy they want them whiskers and that nose of his to split the wind at the head of the column there s somethin mighty seldom about piggy declared bud musingly i never yet see anything on the hoof that he exactly grades up with he can shore holler a plenty and he straddles a hoss from where you laid the chunk but he ain t never been smoked yet you know cactus we ain t had a row since he s been with us piggy s all right for skearin the greaser kids and layin waste a cross roads store i reckon he s the finest canned oyster buccaneer and cheese pirate that ever was but how s his appetite for fightin i ve knowed some citizens you d think was starvin for trouble get a bad case of dyspepsy the first dose of lead they had to take he talks all spraddled out said cactus bout the rookuses he s been in he claims to have saw the elephant and hearn the owl i know replied bud using the cowpuncher s expressive phrase of skepticism but it sounds to me this conversation was held one night in camp while the other members of the band eight in number were sprawling around the fire lingering over their supper when bud and cactus ceased talking they heard piggy s formidable voice holding forth to the others as usual while he was engaged in checking though never satisfying his ravening appetite wat s de use he was saying of chasin little red cowses and hosses round for t ousands of miles dere ain t nuttin in it gallopin t rough dese bushes and briers and gettin a t irst dat a brewery couldn t put out and missin meals say you know what i d do if i was main finger of dis bunch i d stick up a train i d blow de express car and make hard dollars where you guys get wind youse makes me tired dis sook cow kind of cheap sport gives me a pain later on a deputation waited on bud they stood on one leg chewed mesquit twigs and circumlocuted for they hated to hurt his feelings bud foresaw their business and made it easy for them bigger risks and larger profits was what they wanted the suggestion of piggy s about holding up a train had fired their imagination and increased their admiration for the dash and boldness of the instigator they were such simple artless and custom bound bush rangers that they had never before thought of extending their habits beyond the running off of live stock and the shooting of such of their acquaintances as ventured to interfere bud acted on the level agreeing to take a subordinate place in the gang until black eagle should have been given a trial as leader after a great deal of consultation studying of time tables and discussion of the country s topography the time and place for carrying out their new enterprise was decided upon at that time there was a feedstuff famine in mexico and a cattle famine in certain parts of the united states and there was a brisk international trade much money was being shipped along the railroads that connected the two republics it was agreed that the most promising place for the contemplated robbery was at espina a little station on the i and g n about forty miles north of laredo the train stopped there one minute the country around was wild and unsettled the station consisted of but one house in which the agent lived black eagle s band set out riding by night arriving in the vicinity of espina they rested their horses all day in a thicket a few miles distant the train was due at espina at p m they could rob the train and be well over the mexican border with their booty by daylight the next morning to do black eagle justice he exhibited no signs of flinching from the responsible honours that had been conferred upon him he assigned his men to their respective posts with discretion and coached them carefully as to their duties on each side of the track four of the band were to lie concealed in the chaparral gotch ear rodgers was to stick up the station agent bronco charlie was to remain with the horses holding them in readiness at a spot where it was calculated the engine would be when the train stopped bud king was to lie hidden on one side and black eagle himself on the other the two would get the drop on the engineer and fireman force them to descend and proceed to the rear then the express car would be looted and the escape made no one was to move until black eagle gave the signal by firing his revolver the plan was perfect at ten minutes to train time every man was at his post effectually concealed by the thick chaparral that grew almost to the rails the night was dark and lowering with a fine drizzle falling from the flying gulf clouds black eagle crouched behind a bush within five yards of the track two six shooters were belted around him occasionally he drew a large black bottle from his pocket and raised it to his mouth a star appeared far down the track which soon waxed into the headlight of the approaching train it came on with an increasing roar the engine bore down upon the ambushing desperadoes with a glare and a shriek like some avenging monster come to deliver them to justice black eagle flattened himself upon the ground the engine contrary to their calculations instead of stopping between him and bud king s place of concealment passed fully forty years farther before it came to a stand the bandit leader rose to his feet and peered through the bush his men all lay quiet awaiting the signal immediately opposite black eagle was a thing that drew his attention instead of being a regular passenger train it was a mixed one before him stood a box car the door of which by some means had been left slightly open black eagle went up to it and pushed the door farther open an odour came forth a damp rancid familiar musty intoxicating beloved odour stirring strongly at old memories of happy days and travels black eagle sniffed at the witching smell as the returned wanderer smells of the rose that twines his boyhood s cottage home nostalgia seized him he put his hand inside excelsior dry springy curly soft enticing covered the floor outside the drizzle had turned to a chilling rain the train bell clanged the bandit chief unbuckled his belt and cast it with its revolvers upon the ground his spurs followed quickly and his broad sombrero black eagle was moulting the train started with a rattling jerk the ex terror of the border scrambled into the box car and closed the door stretched luxuriously upon the excelsior with the black bottle clasped closely to his breast his eyes closed and a foolish happy smile upon his terrible features chicken ruggles started upon his return trip undisturbed with the band of desperate bandits lying motionless awaiting the signal to attack the train pulled out from espina as its speed increased and the black masses of chaparral went whizzing past on either side the express messenger lighting his pipe looked through his window and remarked feelingly what a jim dandy place for a hold up a retrieved reformation a guard came to the prison shoe shop where jimmy valentine was assiduously stitching uppers and escorted him to the front office there the warden handed jimmy his pardon which had been signed that morning by the governor jimmy took it in a tired kind of way he had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence he had expected to stay only about three months at the longest when a man with as many friends on the outside as jimmy valentine had is received in the stir it is hardly worth while to cut his hair now valentine said the warden you ll go out in the morning brace up and make a man of yourself you re not a bad fellow at heart stop cracking safes and live straight me said jimmy in surprise why i never cracked a safe in my life oh no laughed the warden of course not let s see now how was it you happened to get sent up on that springfield job was it because you wouldn t prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high toned society or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you it s always one or the other with you innocent victims me said jimmy still blankly virtuous why warden i never was in springfield in my life take him back cronin said the warden and fix him up with outgoing clothes unlock him at seven in the morning and let him come to the bull pen better think over my advice valentine at a quarter past seven on the next morning jimmy stood in the warden s outer office he had on a suit of the villainously fitting ready made clothes and a pair of the stiff squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests the clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity the warden gave him a cigar and shook hands valentine was chronicled on the books pardoned by governor and mr james valentine walked out into the sunshine disregarding the song of the birds the waving green trees and the smell of the flowers jimmy headed straight for a restaurant there he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him from there he proceeded leisurely to the depot he tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door and boarded his train three hours set him down in a little town near the state line he went to the cafe of one mike dolan and shook hands with mike who was alone behind the bar sorry we couldn t make it sooner jimmy me boy said mike but we had that protest from springfield to buck against and the governor nearly balked feeling all right fine said jimmy got my key he got his key and went upstairs unlocking the door of a room at the rear everything was just as he had left it there on the floor was still ben price s collar button that had been torn from that eminent detective s shirt band when they had overpowered jimmy to arrest him pulling out from the wall a folding bed jimmy slid back a panel in the wall and dragged out a dust covered suit case he opened this and gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar s tools in the east it was a complete set made of specially tempered steel the latest designs in drills punches braces and bits jimmies clamps and augers with two or three novelties invented by jimmy himself in which he took pride over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at a place where they make such things for the profession in half an hour jimmy went down stairs and through the cafe he was now dressed in tasteful and well fitting clothes and carried his dusted and cleaned suit case in his hand got anything on asked mike dolan genially me said jimmy in a puzzled tone i don t understand i m representing the new york amalgamated short snap biscuit cracker and frazzled wheat company this statement delighted mike to such an extent that jimmy had to take a seltzer and milk on the spot he never touched hard drinks a week after the release of valentine there was a neat job of safe burglary done in richmond indiana with no clue to the author a scant eight hundred dollars was all that was secured two weeks after that a patented improved burglar proof safe in logansport was opened like a cheese to the tune of fifteen hundred dollars currency securities and silver untouched that began to interest the rogue catchers then an old fashioned bank safe in jefferson city became active and threw out of its crater an eruption of bank notes amounting to five thousand dollars the losses were now high enough to bring the matter up into ben price s class of work by comparing notes a remarkable similarity in the methods of the burglaries was noticed ben price investigated the scenes of the robberies and was heard to remark that s dandy jim valentine s autograph he s resumed business look at that combination knob jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in wet weather he s got the only clamps that can do it and look how clean those tumblers were punched out jimmy never has to drill but one hole yes i guess i want mr valentine he ll do his bit next time without any short time or clemency foolishness ben price knew jimmy s habits he had learned them while working on the springfield case long jumps quick get aways no confederates and a taste for good society these ways had helped mr valentine to become noted as a successful dodger of retribution it was given out that ben price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman and other people with burglar proof safes felt more at ease one afternoon jimmy valentine and his suit case climbed out of the mail hack in elmore a little town five miles off the railroad down in the black jack country of arkansas jimmy looking like an athletic young senior just home from college went down the board side walk toward the hotel a young lady crossed the street passed him at the corner and entered a door over which was the sign the elmore bank jimmy valentine looked into her eyes forgot what he was and became another man she lowered her eyes and coloured slightly young men of jimmy s style and looks were scarce in elmore jimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if he were one of the stockholders and began to ask him questions about the town feeding him dimes at intervals by and by the young lady came out looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suit case and went her way isn that young lady polly simpson asked jimmy with specious guile naw said the boy she s annabel adams her pa owns this bank why d you come to elmore for is that a gold watch chain i m going to get a bulldog got any more dimes jimmy went to the planters hotel registered as ralph d spencer and engaged a room he leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the clerk he said he had come to elmore to look for a location to go into business how was the shoe business now in the town he had thought of the shoe business was there an opening the clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of jimmy he himself was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded youth of elmore but he now perceived his shortcomings while trying to figure out jimmy s manner of tying his four in hand he cordially gave information yes there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line there wasn t an exclusive shoe store in the place the dry goods and general stores handled them business in all lines was fairly good hoped mr spencer would decide to locate in elmore he would find it a pleasant town to live in and the people very sociable mr spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look over the situation no the clerk needn t call the boy he would carry up his suit case himself it was rather heavy mr ralph spencer the phoenix that arose from jimmy valentine s ashes ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love remained in elmore and prospered he opened a shoe store and secured a good run of trade socially he was also a success and made many friends and he accomplished the wish of his heart he met miss annabel adams and became more and more captivated by her charms at the end of a year the situation of mr ralph spencer was this he had won the respect of the community his shoe store was flourishing and he and annabel were engaged to be married in two weeks mr adams the typical plodding country banker approved of spencer annabel s pride in him almost equalled her affection he was as much at home in the family of mr adams and that of annabel s married sister as if he were already a member one day jimmy sat down in his room and wrote this letter which he mailed to the safe address of one of his old friends in st louis dear old pal i want you to be at sullivan s place in little rock next wednesday night at nine o clock i want you to wind up some little matters for me and also i

wouldn t do another crooked thing for the whole world be sure to be at sully s for i must see you i ll bring along the tools with me your old friend jimmy on the monday night after jimmy wrote this letter ben price jogged unobtrusively into elmore in a livery buggy he lounged about town in his quiet way until he found out what he wanted to know from the drug store across the street from spencer s shoe store he got a good look at ralph d spencer going to marry the banker s daughter are you jimmy said ben to himself softly well i don t know the next morning jimmy took breakfast at the adamses he was going to little rock that day to order his wedding suit and buy something nice for annabel that would be the first time he had left town since he came to elmore it had been more than a year now since those last professional jobs and he thought he could safely venture out after breakfast quite a family party went downtown together mr adams annabel jimmy and annabel s married sister with her two little girls aged five and nine they came by the hotel where jimmy still boarded and he ran up to his room and brought along his suit case then they went on to the bank there stood jimmy s horse and buggy and dolph gibson who was going to drive him over to the railroad station all went inside the high carved oak railings into the banking room jimmy included for mr adams s future son in law was welcome anywhere the clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good looking agreeable young man who was going to marry miss annabel jimmy set his suit case down annabel whose heart was bubbling with happiness and lively youth put on jimmy s hat and picked up the suit case wouldn t i make a nice drummer said annabel my ralph how heavy it is feels like it was full of gold bricks lot of nickel plated shoe horns in there said jimmy coolly that i m going to return thought i d save express charges by taking them up i m getting awfully economical the elmore bank had just put in a new safe and vault mr adams was very proud of it and insisted on an inspection by every one the vault was a small one but it had a new patented door it fastened with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single handle and had a time lock mr adams beamingly explained its workings to mr spencer who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest the two children may and agatha were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs while they were thus engaged ben price sauntered in and leaned on his elbow looking casually inside between the railings he told the teller that he didn t want anything he was just waiting for a man he knew suddenly there was a scream or two from the women and a commotion unperceived by the elders may the nine year old girl in a spirit of play had shut agatha in the vault she had then shot the bolts and turned the knob of the combination as she had seen mr adams do the old banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment the door can t be opened he groaned the clock hasn t been wound nor the combination set agatha s mother screamed again hysterically hush said mr adams raising his trembling hand all be quite for a moment agatha he called as loudly as he could listen to me during the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror my precious darling wailed the mother she will die of fright open the door oh break it open can t you men do something there isn t a man nearer than little rock who can open that door said mr adams in a shaky voice my god spencer what shall we do that child she can t stand it long in there there isn t enough air and besides she ll go into convulsions from fright agatha s mother frantic now beat the door of the vault with her hands somebody wildly suggested dynamite annabel turned to jimmy her large eyes full of anguish but not yet despairing to a woman nothing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she worships can t you do something ralph try won t you he looked at her with a queer soft smile on his lips and in his keen eyes annabel he said give me that rose you are wearing will you hardly believing that she heard him aright she unpinned the bud from the bosom of her dress and placed it in his hand jimmy stuffed it into his vest pocket threw off his coat and pulled up his shirt sleeves with that act ralph d spencer passed away and jimmy valentine took his place get away from the door all of you he commanded shortly he set his suit case on the table and opened it out flat from that time on he seemed to be unconscious of the presence of any one else he laid out the shining queer implements swiftly and orderly whistling softly to himself as he always did when at work in a deep silence and immovable the others watched him as if under a spell in a minute jimmy s pet drill was biting smoothly into the steel door in ten minutes breaking his own burglarious record he threw back the bolts and opened the door agatha almost collapsed but safe was gathered into her mother s arms jimmy valentine put on his coat and walked outside the railings towards the front door as he went he thought he heard a far away voice that he once knew call ralph but he never hesitated at the door a big man stood somewhat in his way hello ben said jimmy still with his strange smile got around at last have you well let s go i don t know that it makes much difference now and then ben price acted rather strangely guess you re mistaken mr spencer he said don t believe i recognize you your buggy s waiting for you ain t it and ben price turned and strolled down the street cherchez la femme robbins reporter for the picayune and dumars of l abeille the old french newspaper that has buzzed for nearly a century were good friends well proven by years of ups and downs together they were seated where they had a habit of meeting in the little creole haunted cafe of madame tibault in dumaine street if you know the place you will experience a thrill of pleasure in recalling it to mind it is small and dark with six little polished tables at which you may sit and drink the best coffee in new orleans and concoctions of absinthe equal to sazerac s best madame tibault fat and indulgent presides at the desk and takes your money nicolette and meme madame s nieces in charming bib aprons bring the desirable beverages dumars with true creole luxury was sipping his absinthe with half closed eyes in a whirl of cigarette smoke robbins was looking over the morning pic detecting as young reporters will the gross blunders in the make up and the envious blue pencilling his own stuff had received this item in the advertising columns caught his eye and with an exclamation of sudden interest he read it aloud to his friend public auction at three o clock this afternoon there will be sold to the highest bidder all the common property of the little sisters of samaria at the home of the sisterhood in bonhomme street the sale will dispose of the building ground and the complete furnishings of the house and chapel without reserve this notice stirred the two friends to a reminiscent talk concerning an episode in their journalistic career that had occurred about two years before they recalled the incidents went over the old theories and discussed it anew from the different perspective time had brought there were no other customers in the cafe madame s fine ear had caught the line of their talk and she came over to their table for had it not been her lost money her vanished twenty thousand dollars that had set the whole matter going the three took up the long abandoned mystery threshing over the old dry chaff of it it was in the chapel of this house of the little sisters of samaria that robbins and dumars had stood during that eager fruitless news search of theirs and looked upon the gilded statue of the virgin thass so boys said madame summing up thass ver wicked man m sieur morin everybody shall be cert he steal those money i plaze in his hand for keep safe yes he s boun spend that money somehow madame turned a broad and contemplative smile upon dumars i ond stand you m sieur dumars those day you come ask fo tell ev ything i know bout m sieur morin ah yes i know most time when those men lose money you say cherchez la femme there is somewhere the woman but not for m sieur morin no boys before he shall die he is like one saint you might s well m sieur dumars go try find those money in the statue of virgin mary that m sieur morin present at those p tite soeurs as try find one femme at madame tibault s last words robbins started slightly and cast a keen sidelong glance at dumars the creole sat unmoved dreamily watching the spirals of his cigarette smoke it was then nine o clock in the morning and a few minutes later the two friends separated going different ways to their day s duties and now follows the brief story of madame tibault s vanished thousands new orleans will readily recall to mind the circumstances attendant upon the death of mr gaspard morin in that city mr morin was an artistic goldsmith and jeweller in the old french quarter and a man held in the highest esteem he belonged to one of the oldest french families and was of some distinction as an antiquary and historian he was a bachelor about fifty years of age he lived in quiet comfort at one of those rare old hostelries in royal street he was found in his rooms one morning dead from unknown causes when his affairs came to be looked into it was found that he was practically insolvent his stock of goods and personal property barely but nearly enough to free him from censure covering his liabilities following came the disclosure that he had been entrusted with the sum of twenty thousand dollars by a former upper servant in the morin family one madame tibault which she had received as a legacy from relatives in france the most searching scrutiny by friends and the legal authorities failed to reveal the disposition of the money it had vanished and left no trace some weeks before his death mr morin had drawn the entire amount in gold coin from the bank where it had been placed while he looked about he told madame tibault for a safe investment therefore mr morin s memory seemed doomed to bear the cloud of dishonesty while madame was of course disconsolate then it was that robbins and dumars representing their respective journals began one of those pertinacious private investigations which of late years the press has adopted as a means to glory and the satisfaction of public curiosity cherchez la femme said dumars that s the ticket agreed robbins all roads lead to the eternal feminine we will find the woman they exhausted the knowledge of the staff of mr morin s hotel from the bell boy down to the proprietor they gently but inflexibly pumped the family of the deceased as far as his cousins twice removed they artfully sounded the employees of the late jeweller and dogged his customers for information concerning his habits like bloodhounds they traced every step of the supposed defaulter as nearly as might be for years along the limited and monotonous paths he had trodden at the end of their labours mr morin stood an immaculate man not one weakness that might be served up as a criminal tendency not one deviation from the path of rectitude not even a hint of a predilection for the opposite sex was found to be placed in his debit his life had been as regular and austere as a monk s his habits simple and unconcealed generous charitable and a model in propriety was the verdict of all who knew him what now asked robbins fingering his empty notebook cherchez la femme said dumars lighting a cigarette try lady bellairs this piece of femininity was the race track favourite of the season being feminine she was erratic in her gaits and there were a few heavy losers about town who had believed she could be true the reporters applied for information mr morin certainly not he was never even a spectator at the races not that kind of a man surprised the gentlemen should ask shall we throw it up suggested robbins and let the puzzle department have a try cherchez la femme hummed dumars reaching for a match try the little sisters of what d you call em it had developed during the investigation that mr morin had held this benevolent order in particular favour he had contributed liberally toward its support and had chosen its chapel as his favourite place of private worship it was said that he went there daily to make his devotions at the altar indeed toward the last of his life his whole mind seemed to have fixed itself upon religious matters perhaps to the detriment of his worldly affairs thither went robbins and dumars and were admitted through the narrow doorway in the blank stone wall that frowned upon bonhomme street an old woman was sweeping the chapel she told them that sister felicite the head of the order was then at prayer at the altar in the alcove in a few moments she would emerge heavy black curtains screened the alcove they waited soon the curtains were disturbed and sister felicite came forth she was tall tragic bony and plain featured dressed in the black gown and severe bonnet of the sisterhood robbins a good rough and tumble reporter but lacking the delicate touch began to speak they represented the press the lady had no doubt heard of the morin affair it was necessary in justice to that gentleman s memory to probe the mystery of the lost money it was known that he had come often to this chapel any information now concerning mr morin s habits tastes the friends he had and so on would be of value in doing him posthumous justice sister felicite had heard whatever she knew would be willingly told but it was very little monsieur morin had been a good friend to the order sometimes contributing as much as a hundred dollars the sisterhood was an independent one depending entirely upon private contributions for the means to carry on its charitable work mr morin had presented the chapel with silver candlesticks and an altar cloth he came every day to worship in the chapel sometimes remaining for an hour he was a devout catholic consecrated to holiness yes and also in the alcove was a statue of the virgin that he had himself modeled cast and presented to the order oh it was cruel to cast a doubt upon so good a man robbins was also profoundly grieved at the imputation but until it was found what mr morin had done with madame tibault s money he feared the tongue of slander would not be stilled sometimes in fact very often in affairs of the kind there was er as the saying goes er a lady in the case in absolute confidence now if perhaps sister felicite s large eyes regarded him solemnly there was one woman she said slowly to whom he bowed to whom he gave his heart robbins fumbled rapturously for his pencil behold the woman said sister felicite suddenly in deep tones she reached a long arm and swept aside the curtain of the alcove in there was a shrine lit to a glow of soft colour by the light pouring through a stained glass window within a deep niche in the bare stone wall stood an image of the virgin mary the colour of pure gold dumars a conventional catholic succumbed to the dramatic in the act he bowed his head for an instant and made the sign of the cross the somewhat abashed robbins murmuring an indistinct apology backed awkwardly away sister felicite drew back the curtain and the reporters departed on the narrow sidewalk of bonhomme street robbins turned to dumars with unworthy sarcasm well what next churchy law fem absinthe said dumars with the history of the missing money thus partially related some conjecture may be formed of the sudden idea that madame tibault s words seemed to have suggested to robbins s brain was it so wild a surmise that the religious fanatic had offered up his wealth or rather madame tibault s in the shape of a material symbol of his consuming devotion stranger things have been done in the name of worship was it not possible that the lost thousands were molded into that lustrous image that the goldsmith had formed it of the pure and precious metal and set it there through some hope of a perhaps disordered brain to propitiate the saints and pave the way to his own selfish glory that afternoon at five minutes to three robbins entered the chapel door of the little sisters of samaria he saw in the dim light a crowd of perhaps a hundred people gathered to attend the sale most of them were members of various religious orders priests and churchmen come to purchase the paraphernalia of the chapel lest they fall into desecrating hands others were business men and agents come to bid upon the realty a clerical looking brother had volunteered to wield the hammer bringing to the office of auctioneer the anomaly of choice diction and dignity of manner a few of the minor articles were sold and then two assistants brought forward the image of the virgin robbins started the bidding at ten dollars a stout man in an ecclesiastical garb went to fifteen a voice from another part of the crowd raised to twenty the three bid alternately raising by bids of five until the offer was fifty dollars then the stout man dropped out and robbins as a sort of coup de main went to a hundred one hundred and fifty said the other voice two hundred bid robbins boldly two fifty called his competitor promptly the reporter hesitated for the space of a lightning flash estimating how much he could borrow from the boys in the office and screw from the business manager from his next month s salary three hundred he offered three fifty spoke up the other in a louder voice a voice that sent robbins diving suddenly through the crowd in its direction to catch dumars its owner ferociously by the collar you unconverted idiot hissed robbins close to his ear pool agreed said dumars coolly i couldn t raise three hundred and fifty dollars with a search warrant but i can stand half what you come bidding against me for i thought i was the only fool in the crowd explained robbins no one else bidding the statue was knocked down to the syndicate at their last offer dumars remained with the prize while robbins hurried forth to wring from the resources and credit of both the price he soon returned with the money and the two musketeers loaded their precious package into a carriage and drove with it to dumars s room in old chartres street nearby they lugged it covered with a cloth up the stairs and deposited it on a table a hundred pounds it weighed if an ounce and at that estimate according to their calculation if their daring theory were correct it stood there worth twenty thousand golden dollars robbins removed the covering and opened his pocket knife sacre muttered dumars shuddering it is the mother of christ what would you do shut up judas said robbins coldly it s too late for you to be saved now with a firm hand he chipped a slice from the shoulder of the image the cut showed a dull grayish metal with a thin coating of gold leaf lead announced robbins hurling his knife to the floor gilded to the devil with it said dumars forgetting his scruples i must have a drink together they walked moodily to the cafe of madame tribault two squares away it seemed that madame s mind had been stirred that day to fresh recollections of the past services of the two young men in her behalf you mustn t sit by those table she interposed as they were about

that opened upon the courtyard she placed them with a low table between bustling hospitably about she began to prepare the promised refreshments it was the first time the reporters had been honoured with admission to the sacred precincts the room was in dusky twilight flecked with gleams of the polished fine woods and burnished glass and metal that the creoles love from the little courtyard a tiny fountain sent in an insinuating sound of trickling waters to which a banana plant by the window kept time with its tremulous leaves robbins an investigator by nature sent a curious glance roving about the room from some barbaric ancestor madame had inherited a penchant for the crude in decoration the walls were adorned with cheap lithographs florid libels upon nature addressed to the taste of the bourgeoisie birthday cards garish newspaper supplements and specimens of art advertising calculated to reduce the optic nerve to stunned submission a patch of something unintelligible in the midst of the more candid display puzzled robbins and he rose and took a step nearer to interrogate it at closer range then he leaned weakly against the wall and called out madame tibault oh madame since

that is guaranteed to produce the desired results her name is belle of kentucky twelve year old bourbon in quarts how does the idea strike you allons said dumars cherchez la femme friends in san rosario the west bound train stopped at san rosario on time at a m a man with a thick black leather wallet under his arm left the train and walked rapidly up the main street of the town there were other passengers who also got off at san rosario but they either slouched limberly over to the railroad eating house or the silver dollar saloon or joined the groups of idlers about the station indecision had no part in the movements of the man with the wallet he was short in stature but strongly built with very light closely trimmed hair smooth determined face and aggressive gold rimmed nose glasses he was well dressed in the prevailing eastern style his air denoted a quiet but conscious reserve force if not actual authority after walking a distance of three squares he came to the centre of the town s business area here another street of importance crossed the main one forming the hub of san rosario s life and commerce upon one corner stood the post office upon another rubensky s clothing emporium the other two diagonally opposing corners were occupied by the town s two banks the first national and the stockmen s national into the first national bank of san rosario the newcomer walked never slowing his brisk step until he stood at the cashier s window the bank opened for business at nine and the working force was already assembled each member preparing his department for the day s business the cashier was examining the mail when he noticed the stranger standing at his window bank doesn t open til nine he remarked curtly but without feeling he had had to make that statement so often to early birds since san rosario adopted city banking hours i am well aware of that said the other man in cool brittle tones will you kindly receive my card the cashier drew the small spotless parallelogram inside the bars of his wicket and read j f c nettlewick national bank examiner oh er will you walk around inside mr er nettlewick your first visit didn t know your business of course walk right around please the examiner was quickly inside the sacred precincts of the bank where he was ponderously introduced to each employee in turn by mr edlinger the cashier a middle aged gentleman of deliberation discretion and method i was kind of expecting sam turner round again pretty soon said mr edlinger sam s been examining us now for about four years i guess you ll find us all right though considering the tightness in business not overly much money on hand but able to stand the storms sir stand the storms mr turner and i have been ordered by the comptroller to exchange districts said the examiner in his decisive formal tones he is covering my old territory in southern illinois and indiana i will take the cash first please perry dorsey the teller was already arranging his cash on the counter for the examiner s inspection he knew it was right to a cent and he had nothing to fear but he was nervous and flustered so was every man in the bank there was something so icy and swift so impersonal and uncompromising about this man that his very presence seemed an accusation he looked to be a man who would never make nor overlook an error mr nettlewick first seized the currency and with a rapid almost juggling motion counted it by packages then he spun the sponge cup toward him and verified the count by bills his thin white fingers flew like some expert musician s upon the keys of a piano he dumped the gold upon the counter with a crash and the coins whined and sang as they skimmed across the marble slab from the tips of his nimble digits the air was full of fractional currency when he came to the halves and quarters he counted the last nickle and dime he had the scales brought and he weighed every sack of silver in the vault he questioned dorsey concerning each of the cash memoranda certain checks charge slips etc carried over from the previous day s work with unimpeachable courtesy yet with something so mysteriously momentous in his frigid manner that the teller was reduced to pink cheeks and a stammering tongue this newly imported examiner was so different from sam turner it had been sam s way to enter the bank with a shout pass the cigars and tell the latest stories he had picked up on his rounds his customary greeting to dorsey had been hello perry haven t skipped out with the boodle yet i see turner s way of counting the cash had been different too he would finger the packages of bills in a tired kind of way and then go into the vault and kick over a few sacks of silver and the thing was done halves and quarters and dimes not for sam turner no chicken feed for me he would say when they were set before him i m not in the agricultural department but then turner was a texan an old friend of the bank s president and had known dorsey since he was a baby while the examiner was counting the cash major thomas b kingman known to every one as major tom the president of the first national drove up to the side door with his old dun horse and buggy and came inside he saw the examiner busy with the money and going into the little pony corral as he called it in which his desk was railed off he began to look over his letters earlier a little incident had occurred that even the sharp eyes of the examiner had failed to notice when he had begun his work at the cash counter mr edlinger had winked significantly at roy wilson the youthful bank messenger and nodded his head slightly toward the front door roy understood got his hat and walked leisurely out with his collector s book under his arm once outside he made a bee line for the stockmen s national that bank was also getting ready to open no customers had as yet presented themselves say you people cried roy with the familiarity of youth and long acquaintance you want to get a move on you there s a new bank examiner over at the first and he s a stem winder he s counting nickles on perry and he s got the whole outfit bluffed mr edlinger gave me the tip to let you know mr buckley president of the stockmen s national a stout elderly man looking like a farmer dressed for sunday heard roy from his private office at the rear and called him has major kingman come down to the bank yet he asked of the boy yes sir he was just driving up as i left said roy i want you to take him a note put it into his own hands as soon as you get back mr buckley sat down and began to write roy returned and handed to major kingman the envelope containing the note the major read it folded it and slipped it into his vest pocket he leaned back in his chair for a few moments as if he were meditating deeply and then rose and went into the vault he came out with the bulky old fashioned leather note case stamped on the back in gilt letters bills discounted in this were the notes due the bank with their attached securities and the major in his rough way dumped the lot upon his desk and began to sort them over by this time nettlewick had finished his count of the cash his pencil fluttered like a swallow over the sheet of paper on which he had set his figures he opened his black wallet which seemed to be also a kind of secret memorandum book made a few rapid figures in it wheeled and transfixed dorsey with the glare of his spectacles that look seemed to say you re safe this time but cash all correct snapped the examiner he made a dash for the individual bookkeeper and for a few minutes there was a fluttering of ledger leaves and a sailing of balance sheets through the air how often do you balance your pass books he demanded suddenly er once a month faltered the individual bookkeeper wondering how many years they would give him all right said the examiner turning and charging upon the general bookkeeper who had the statements of his foreign banks and their reconcilement memoranda ready everything there was found to be all right then the stub book of the certificates of deposit flutter flutter zip zip check all right list of over drafts please thanks h m m unsigned bills of the bank next all right then came the cashier s turn and easy going mr edlinger rubbed his nose and polished his glasses nervously under the quick fire of questions concerning the circulation undivided profits bank real estate and stock ownership presently nettlewick was aware of a big man towering above him at his elbow a man sixty years of age rugged and hale with a rough grizzled beard a mass of gray hair and a pair of penetrating blue eyes that confronted the formidable glasses of the examiner without a flicker er major kingman our president er mr nettlewick said the cashier two men of very different types shook hands one was a finished product of the world of straight lines conventional methods and formal affairs the other was something freer wider and nearer to nature tom kingman had not been cut to any pattern he had been mule driver cowboy ranger soldier sheriff prospector and cattleman now when he was bank president his old comrades from the prairies of the saddle tent and trail found no change in him he had made his fortune when texas cattle were at the high tide of value and had organized the first national bank of san rosario in spite of his largeness of heart and sometimes unwise generosity toward his old friends the bank had prospered for major tom kingman knew men as well as he knew cattle of late years the cattle business had known a depression and the major s bank was one of the few whose losses had not been great and now said the examiner briskly pulling out his watch the last thing is the loans we will take them up now if you please he had gone through the first national at almost record breaking speed but thoroughly as he did everything the running order of the bank was smooth and clean and that had facilitated his work there was but one other bank in the town he received from the government a fee of twenty five dollars for each bank that he examined he should be able to go over those loans and discounts in half an hour if so he could examine the other bank immediately afterward and catch the the only other train that day in the direction he was working otherwise he would have to spend the night and sunday in this uninteresting western town that was why mr nettlewick was rushing matters come with me sir said major kingman in his deep voice that united the southern drawl with the rhythmic twang of the west we will go over them together nobody in the bank knows those notes as i do some of em are a little wobbly on their legs and some are mavericks without extra many brands on their backs but they ll most all pay out at the round up the two sat down at the president s desk first the examiner went through the notes at lightning speed and added up their total finding it to agree with the amount of loans carried on the book of daily balances next he took up the larger loans inquiring scrupulously into the condition of their endorsers or securities the new examiner s mind seemed to course and turn and make unexpected dashes hither and thither like a bloodhound seeking a trail finally he pushed aside all the

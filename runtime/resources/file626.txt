of the millionaires i suppose that you and lou were forever busying your brains about for the first time nancy quailed before a man she laid her hand that trembled slightly on dan s sleeve you ve no right to say such a thing to me dan as if i had anything to do with it i didn t mean it that way said dan softening he fumbled in his vest pocket i ve got the tickets for the show to night he said with a gallant show of lightness if you nancy admired pluck whenever she saw it i ll go with you dan she said three months went by before nancy saw lou again at twilight one evening the shop girl was hurrying home along the border of a little quiet park she heard her name called and wheeled about in time to catch lou rushing into her arms after the first embrace they drew their heads back as serpents do ready to attack or to charm with a thousand questions trembling on their swift tongues and then nancy noticed that prosperity had descended upon lou manifesting itself in costly furs flashing gems and creations of the tailors art you little fool cried lou loudly and affectionately i see you are still working in that store and as shabby as ever and how about that big catch you were going to make nothing doing yet i suppose and then lou looked and saw that something better than prosperity lead descended upon nancy something that shone brighter than gems in her eyes and redder than a rose in her cheeks and that danced like electricity anxious to be loosed from the tip of her tongue yes i m still in the store said nancy but i m going to leave it next week i ve made my catch the biggest catch in the world you won t mind now lou will you i m going to be married to dan to dan he s my dan now why lou around the corner of the park strolled one of those new crop smooth faced young policemen that are making the force more endurable at least to the eye he saw a woman with an expensive fur coat and diamond ringed hands crouching down against the iron fence of the park sobbing turbulently while a slender plainly dressed working girl leaned close trying to console her but the gibsonian cop being of the new order passed on pretending not to notice for he was wise enough to know that these matters are beyond help so far as the power he represents is concerned though he rap the pavement with his nightstick till the sound goes up to the furthermost stars a madison square arabian night to carson chalmers in his apartment near the square phillips brought the evening mail beside the routine correspondence there were two items bearing the same foreign postmark one of the incoming parcels contained a photograph of a woman the other contained an interminable letter over which chalmers hung absorbed for a long time the letter was from another woman and it contained poisoned barbs sweetly dipped in honey and feathered with innuendoes concerning the photographed woman chalmers tore this letter into a thousand bits and began to wear out his expensive rug by striding back and forth upon it thus an animal from the jungle acts when it is caged and thus a caged man acts when he is housed in a jungle of doubt by and by the restless mood was overcome the rug was not an enchanted one for sixteen feet he could travel along it three thousand miles was beyond its power to aid phillips appeared he never entered he invariably appeared like a well oiled genie will you dine here sir or out he asked here said chalmers and in half an hour he listened glumly to the january blasts making an aeolian trombone of the empty street wait he said to the disappearing genie as i came home across the end of the square i saw many men standing there in rows there was one mounted upon something talking why do those men stand in rows and why are they there they are homeless men sir said phillips the man standing on the box tries to get lodging for them for the night people come around to listen and give him money then he sends as many as the money will pay for to some lodging house that is why they stand in rows they get sent to bed in order as they come by the time dinner is served said chalmers have one of those men here he will dine with me w w which began phillips stammering for the first time during his service choose one at random said chalmers you might see that he is reasonably sober and a certain amount of cleanliness will not be held against him that is all it was an unusual thing for carson chalmers to play the caliph but on that night he felt the inefficacy of conventional antidotes to melancholy something wanton and egregious something high flavored and arabian he must have to lighten his mood on the half hour phillips had finished his duties as slave of the lamp the waiters from the restaurant below had whisked aloft the delectable dinner the dining table laid for two glowed cheerily in the glow of the pink shaded candles and now phillips as though he ushered a cardinal or held in charge a burglar wafted in the shivering guest who had been haled from the line of mendicant lodgers it is a common thing to call such men wrecks if the comparison be used here it is the specific one of a derelict come to grief

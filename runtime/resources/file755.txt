smiling calmly and we continued our walk ten steps and we met a policeman running toward the spot where the shot had been fired avery knight stopped him i have just killed a man he announced seriously and robbed him of his possessions g wan said the policeman angrily or i ll run yez in want yer name in the papers don t yez i never knew the cranks to come around so quick after a shootin before out of th park now for yours or i ll fan yez what you have done i said argumentatively as knight and i walked on was easy but when you come to the task of hunting down the detective that they send upon your trail you will find that you have undertaken a difficult feat perhaps so said knight lightly i will admit that my success depends in a degree upon the sort of man they start after me if it should be an ordinary plain clothes man i might fail to gain a sight of him if they honor me by giving the case to some one of their celebrated sleuths i do not fear to match my cunning and powers of induction against his on the next afternoon knight entered my office with a satisfied look on his keen countenance how goes the mysterious murder i asked as usual said knight smilingly i have put in the morning at the police station and at the inquest it seems that a card case of mine containing cards with my name and address was found near the body they have three witnesses who saw the shooting and gave a description of me the case has been placed in the hands of shamrock jolnes the famous detective he left headquarters at on the assignment i waited at my address until two thinking he might call there i laughed tauntingly you will never see jolnes i continued until this murder has been forgotten two or three weeks from now i had a better opinion of your shrewdness knight during the three hours and a half that you waited he has got out of your ken he is after you on true induction theories now and no wrongdoer has yet been known to come upon him while thus engaged i advise you to give it up doctor said knight with a sudden glint in his keen gray eye and a squaring of his chin in spite of the record your city holds of something like a dozen homicides without a subsequent meeting of the perpetrator and the sleuth in charge of the case i will undertake to break that record to morrow i will take you to shamrock jolnes i will unmask him before you and prove to you that it is not an impossibility for an officer of the law and a manslayer to stand face to face in your city do it said i and you ll have the sincere thanks of the police department on the next day knight called for me in a cab i ve been on one or two false scents doctor he admitted i know something of detectives methods and i followed out a few of them expecting to find jolnes at the other end the pistol being a caliber i thought surely i would find him at work on the clue in forty fifth street then again i looked for the detective at the columbia university as the man s being shot in the back naturally suggested hazing but i could not find a trace of him nor will you i said emphatically not by ordinary methods said knight i might walk up and down broadway for a month without success but you have aroused my pride doctor and if i fail to show you shamrock jolnes this day i promise you i will never kill or rob in your city again nonsense man i replied when our burglars walk into our houses and politely demand thousands of dollars worth of jewels and then dine and bang the piano an hour or two before leaving how do you a mere murderer expect to come in contact with the detective that is looking for you avery knight sat lost in thought for a while at length he looked up brightly doc said he i have it put on your hat and come with me in half an hour i guarantee that you shall stand in the presence of shamrock jolnes i entered a cab with avery knight i did not hear his instructions to the driver but the vehicle set out at a smart pace up broadway turning presently into fifth avenue and proceeding northward again it was with a rapidly beating heart that i accompanied this wonderful and gifted assassin whose analytical genius and superb self confidence had prompted him to make me the tremendous promise of bringing me into the presence of a murderer and the new york detective in pursuit of him simultaneously even yet i could not believe it possible are you sure that you are not being led into some trap i asked suppose that your clue whatever it is should bring us only into the presence of the commissioner of police and a couple of dozen cops my dear doctor said knight a little stiffly i would remind you that i am no gambler i beg your pardon said i but i do not think you will find jolnes the cab stopped before one of the handsomest residences on the avenue walking up and down in front of the house was a man with long red whiskers with a detective s badge showing on the lapel of his coat now and then the man would remove his whiskers to wipe his face and then i would recognize at once the well known features of the great new york detective jolnes was keeping a sharp watch upon the doors and windows of the

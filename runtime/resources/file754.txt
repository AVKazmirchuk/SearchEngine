the sportive youth of fishampton and distributed themselves shouting about the diamond there said the sociologist pointing there is young van plushvelt i raised myself so far a cosycophant with mary ann and gazed young van plushvelt sat upon the ground he was dressed in a ragged red sweater wrecked and weather worn golf cap run over shoes and trousers of the ser viceable brand dust clinging to the moisture induced by free exercise darkened wide areas of his face that is he repeated the sociologist if he had said him i could have been less vindictive on a bench with an air sat the young millionaire s chum he was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge a neat white straw hat neat low cut tan shoes linen of the well known immaculate trade mark a neat narrow four in hand tie and carried a slender neat bamboo cane i laughed loudly and vulgarly what you want to do said i to the sociologist is to establish a reformatory for the logical vicious circle or else i ve got wheels it looks to me as if things are running round and round in circles instead of getting anywhere what do you mean asked the man of progress why look what he has done to smoky i replied you will always be a fool said my friend the sociologist getting up and walking away the ransom of red chief it looked like a good thing but wait till i tell you we were down south in alabama bill driscoll and myself when this kidnapping idea struck us it was as bill afterward expressed it during a moment of temporary mental apparition but we didn t find that out till later there was a town down there as flat as a flannel cake and called summit of course it contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and self satisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a maypole bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town lot scheme in western illinois with we talked it over on the front steps of the hotel philoprogenitiveness says we is strong in semi rural communities therefore and for other reasons a kidnapping project ought to do better there than in the radius of newspapers that send reporters out in plain clothes to stir up talk about such things we knew that summit couldn t get after us with anything stronger than constables and maybe some lackadaisical blood hounds and a diatribe or two in the weekly farmers budget so it looked good we selected for our victim the only child of a prominent citizen named ebenezer dorset the father was respect able and tight a mortgage fancier and a stern upright collection plate passer and forecloser the kid was a boy of ten with bas relief freckles and hair the colour of the cover of the magazine you buy at the news stand when you want to catch a train bill and me figured that ebenezer would melt down for a ransom of two thousand dollars to a cent but wait till i tell you about two miles from summit was a little mountain covered with a dense cedar brake on the rear elevation of this mountain was a cave there we stored provisions one evening after sundown we drove in a buggy past old dorset s house the kid was in the street throw ing rocks at a kitten on the opposite fence hey little boy says bill would you like to have a bag of candy and a nice ride the boy catches bill neatly in the eye with a piece of brick that will cost the old man an extra five hundred dollars says bill climbing over the wheel that boy put up a fight like a welter weight cinnamon bear but at last we got him down in the bottom of the buggy and drove away we took him up to the cave and i hitched the horse in the cedar brake after dark i drove the buggy to the little village three miles away where we had hired it and walked back to the moun tain bill was pasting court plaster over the scratches and bruises on his features there was a burning behind the big rock at the entrance of the cave and the boy was watching a pot of boiling coffee with two buzzard tail feathers stuck in his red hair he points a stick at me when i come up and says ha cursed paleface do you dare to enter the camp of red chief the terror of the plains he s all right now says bill rolling up his trousers and examining some bruises on his shins we re playing indian we re making buffalo bill s show look like magic lantern views of palestine in the town hall i m old hank the trapper red chief s captive and i m to be scalped at daybreak by geronimo that kid can kick hard yes sir that boy seemed to be having the time of his life the fun of camping out in a cave had made him forget that he was a captive himself he immediately christened me snake eye the spy and announced that when his braves returned from the warpath i was to be broiled at the stake at the rising of the sun then we had supper and he filled his mouth full of bacon and bread and gravy and began to talk he made a during dinner speech something like this i like this fine i never camped out before but i had a pet possum once and i was nine last birthday i hate to go to school rats ate up sixteen of jimmy talbot s aunt s speckled hen s eggs are there any real indians in these woods i want some more gravy does the trees moving make the wind blow we had five puppies what makes your nose so red hank my father has lots of money are the stars hot i whipped ed walker twice saturday i don t like girls you dassent catch toads unless with a string do oxen make any noise why are oranges round have you got beds to sleep on in this cave amos murray has got six toes a parrot can talk but a monkey or a fish can t how many does it take to make twelve every few minutes he would remember that he was a pesky redskin and pick up his stick rifle and tiptoe to the mouth of the cave to rubber for the scouts of the hated paleface now and then he would let out a war whoop that made old hank the trapper shiver that boy had bill terrorized from the start red chief says i to the kid would you like to go home aw what for says he i don t have any fun at home i hate to go to school i like to camp out you won t take me back home again snake eye will you not right away says i we ll stay here in the cave a while all right says he that ll be fine i never had such fun in all my life we went to bed about eleven o clock we spread down some wide blankets and quilts and put red chief between us we weren t afraid he d run away he kept us awake for three hours jumping up and reaching for his rifle and screeching hist pard in mine and bill s ears as the fancied crackle of a twig or the rustle of a leaf revealed to his young imagination the stealthy approach of the outlaw band at last i fell into a troubled sleep and dreamed that i had been kidnapped and chained to a tree by a ferocious pirate with red hair just at daybreak i was awakened by a series of awful screams from bill they weren t yells or howls or shouts or whoops or yalps such as you d expect from a manly set of vocal organs they were simply indecent terrifying humiliating screams such as women emit when they see ghosts or caterpillars it s an awful thing to hear a strong desperate fat man scream incontinently in a cave at daybreak i jumped up to see what the matter was red chief was sitting on bill s chest with one hand twined in bill s hair in the other he had the sharp case knife we used for slicing bacon and he was industriously and realistically trying to take bill s scalp according to the sentence that had been pronounced upon him the evening before i got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again but from that moment bill s spirit was broken he laid down on his side of the bed but he never closed an eye again in sleep as long as that boy was with us i dozed off for a while but along toward sun up i remem bered that red chief had said i was to be burned at the stake at the rising of the sun i wasn t nervous or afraid but i sat up and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock what you getting up so soon for sam asked bill me says i oh i got a kind of a pain in my shoulder i thought sitting up would rest it you re a liar says bill you re afraid you was to be burned at sunrise and you was afraid he d do it and he would too if he could find a match ain t it awful sam do you think anybody will pay out money to get a little imp like that back home sure said i a rowdy kid like that is just the kind that parents dote on now you and the chief get up and cook breakfast while i go up on the top of this mountain and reconnoitre i went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the contiguous vicinity over toward summit i expected to see the sturdy yeomanry of the village armed with scythes and pitchforks beating the countryside for the dastardly kidnappers but what i saw was a peaceful landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule nobody was dragging the creek no couriers dashed hither and yon bringing tidings of no news to the distracted parents there was a sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness pervading that section of the external outward surface of alabama that lay exposed to my view perhaps says i to myself it has not yet been discov ered that the wolves have home away the tender lambkin from the fold heaven help the wolves says i and i went down the mountain to breakfast when i got to the cave i found bill backed up against the side of it breathing hard and the boy threatening to smash him with a rock half as big as a cocoanut he put a red hot boiled potato down my back explained bill and the mashed it with his foot and i boxed his ears have you got a gun about you sam i took the rock away from the boy and kind of patched up the argument i ll fix you says the kid to bill no man ever yet struck the red chief but what he got paid for it you better beware after breakfast the kid takes a piece of leather with strings wrapped around it out of his pocket and goes out side the cave unwinding it what s he up to now says bill anxiously you don t think he ll run away do you sam no fear of it says i he don t seem to be much of a home body but we ve got to fix up some plan about the ransom there don t seem to be much excitement around summit on account of his disappearance but maybe they haven t realized yet that he s gone his folks may think he s spending the night with aunt jane or one of the neighbours anyhow he ll be missed to day to night we must get a message to his father demanding the two thousand dollars for his return just then we heard a kind of war whoop such as david might have emitted when he knocked out the champion goliath it was a sling that red chief had pulled out of his pocket and he was whirling it around his head i dodged and heard a heavy thud and a kind of a sigh from bill like a horse gives out when you take his saddle off a niggerhead rock the size of an egg had caught bill just behind his left ear he loosened himself all over and fell in the fire across the frying pan of hot water for washing the dishes i dragged him out and poured cold water on his head for half an hour by and by bill sits up and feels behind his ear and says sam do you know who my favourite biblical character is take it easy says i you ll come to your senses presently king herod says he you won t go away and leave me here alone will you sam i went out and caught that boy and shook him until his freckles rattled if you don t behave says i i ll take you straight home now are you going to be good or not i was only funning says he sullenly i didn t mean to hurt old hank but what did he hit me for i ll behave snake eye if you won t send me home and if you ll let me play the black scout to day i don t know the game says i that s for you and mr bill to decide he s your playmate for the day i m going away for a while on business now you come in and make friends with him and say you are sorry for hurting him or home you go at once i made him and bill shake hands and then i took bill aside and told him i was going to poplar cove a little village three miles from the cave and find out what i could about how the kidnapping had been regarded in summit also i thought it best to send a peremptory letter to old man dorset that day demanding the ransom and dictating how it should be paid you know sam says bill i ve stood by you with out batting an eye in earthquakes fire and flood in poker games dynamite outrages police raids train robberies and cyclones i never lost my nerve yet till we kidnapped that two legged skyrocket of a kid he s got me going you won t leave me long with him will you sam i ll be back some time this afternoon says i you must keep the boy amused and quiet till i return and now we ll write the letter to old dorset bill and i got paper and pencil and worked on the letter while red chief with a blanket wrapped around him strutted up and down guarding the mouth of the cave bill begged me tearfully to make the ransom fifteen hundred dollars instead of two thousand i ain t attempting says he to decry the celebrated moral aspect of parental affection but we re dealing with humans and it ain t human for anybody to give up two thousand dollars for that forty pound chunk of freckled wildcat i m willing to take a chance at fifteen hundred dollars you can charge the difference up to me so to relieve bill i acceded and we collaborated a letter that ran this way ebenezer dorset esq we have your boy concealed in a place far from summit it is useless for you or the most skilful detectives to attempt to find him absolutely the only terms on which you can have him restored to you are these we demand fifteen hundred dollars in large bills for his return the money to be left at midnight to night at the same spot and in the same box as your reply as hereinafter described if you agree to these terms send your answer in writing by a solitary messenger to night at half past eight o clock after crossing owl creek on the road to poplar cove there are three large trees about a hundred yards apart close to the fence of the wheat field on the right hand side at the bottom of the fence post opposite the third tree will be found a small pasteboard box the messenger will place the answer in this box and return immediately to summit if you attempt any treachery or fail to comply with our demand as stated you will never see your boy again if you pay the money as demanded he will be returned to you safe and well within three hours these terms are final and if you do not accede to them no further coin munication will be attempted two desperate men i addressed this letter to dorset and put it in my pocket as i was about to start the kid comes up to me and says aw snake eye you said i could play the black scout while you was gone play it of course says i mr bill will play with you what kind of a game is it i m the black scout says red chief and i have to ride to the stockade to warn the settlers that the indians are coming i m tired of playing indian myself i want to be the black scout all right says i it sounds harmless to me i guess mr bill will help you foil the pesky savages what am i to do asks bill looking at the kid suspiciously you are the hoss says black scout get down on your hands and knees how can i ride to the stockade without a hoss you d better keep him interested said i till we get the scheme going loosen up bill gets down on his all fours and a look comes in his eye like a rabbit s when you catch it in a trap how far is it to the stockade kid he asks in a husky manner of voice ninety miles says the black scout and you have to hump yourself to get there on time whoa now the black scout jumps on bill s back and digs his heels in his side for heaven s sake says bill hurry back sam as soon as you can i wish we hadn t made the ransom more than a thousand say you quit kicking me or i ll get up and warm you good i walked over to poplar cove and sat around the post office and store talking with the chawbacons that came in to trade one whiskerando says that he hears summit is all upset on account of elder ebenezer dorset s boy having been lost or stolen that was all i wanted to know i bought some smoking tobacco referred casually to the price of black eyed peas posted my letter surreptitiously and came away the postmaster said the mail carrier would come by in an hour to take the mail on to summit when i got back to the cave bill and the boy were not to be found i explored the vicinity of the cave and risked a yodel or two but there was no response so i lighted my pipe and sat down on a mossy bank to await developments in about half an hour i heard the bushes rustle and bill wabbled out into the little glade in front of the cave behind him was the kid stepping softly like a scout with a broad grin on his face bill stopped took off his hat and wiped his face with a red handkerchief the kid stopped about eight feet behind him sam says bill i suppose you ll think i m a rene gade but i couldn t help it i m a grown person with masculine proclivities and habits of self defense but there is a time when all systems of egotism and predominance fail the boy is gone i have sent him home all is off there was martyrs in old times goes on bill that suffered death rather than give up the particular graft they enjoyed none of em ever was subjugated to such supernatural tortures as i have been i tried to be faithful to our articles of depredation but there came a limit what s the trouble bill i asks him i was rode says bill the ninety miles to the stockade not barring an inch then when the settlers was rescued i was given oats sand ain t a palatable substitute and then for an hour i had to try to explain to him why there was nothin in holes how a road can run both ways and what makes the grass green i tell you sam a human can only stand so much i takes him by the neck of his clothes and drags him down the mountain on the way he kicks my legs black and blue from the knees down and i ve got to have two or three bites on my thumb and hand cauterized but he s gone continues bill gone home i showed him the road to summit and kicked him about eight feet nearer there at one kick i m sorry we lose the ransom but it was either that or bill driscoll to the madhouse bill is puffing and blowing but there is a look of ineffable peace and growing content on his rose pink features bill says i there isn t any heart disease in your family is there no says bill nothing chronic except malaria and accidents why then you might turn around says i and have a took behind you bill turns and sees the boy and loses his complexion and sits down plump on the round and begins to pluck aimlessly at grass and little sticks for an hour i was afraid for his mind and then i told him that my scheme was to put the whole job through immediately and that we would get the ransom and be off with it by midnight if old dorset fell in with our proposition so bill braced up enough to give the kid a weak sort of a smile and a promise to play the russian in a japanese war with him is soon as he felt a little better i had a scheme for collecting that ransom without danger of being caught by counterplots that ought to commend itself to professional kidnappers the tree under which the answer was to be left and the money later on was close to the road fence with big bare fields on all sides if a gang of constables should be watching for any one to come for the note they could see him a long way off crossing the fields or in the road but no sirree at half past eight i was up in that tree as well hidden as a tree toad waiting for the messenger to arrive exactly on time a half grown boy rides up the road on a bicycle locates the pasteboard box at the foot of the fence post slips a folded piece of paper into it and pedals away again back toward summit i waited an hour and then concluded the thing was square i slid down the tree got the note slipped along the fence till i struck the woods and was back at the cave in another half an hour i opened the note got near the lantern and read it to bill it was written with a pen in a crabbed hand and the sum and substance of it was this two desperate men gentlemen i received your letter to day by post in regard to the ransom you ask for the return of my son i think you are a little high in your demands and i hereby make you a counter proposition which i am inclined to believe you will accept you bring johnny home and pay me two hundred and fifty dollars in cash and i agree to take him off your hands you had better come at night for the neighbours believe he is lost and i couldn t be responsible for what they would do to anybody they saw bringing him back very respectfully ebenezer dorset great pirates of penzance says i of all the impudent but i glanced at bill and hesitated he had the most appealing look in his eyes i ever saw on the face of a dumb or a talking brute sam says he what s two hundred and fifty dollars after all we ve got the money one more night of this kid will send me to a bed in bedlam besides being a thorough gentleman i think mr dorset is a spend thrift for making us such a liberal offer you ain t going to let the chance go are you tell you the truth bill says i this little he ewe lamb has somewhat got on my nerves too we ll take him home pay the ransom and make our get away we took him home that night we got him to go by telling him that his father had bought a silver mounted rifle and a pair of moccasins for him and we were going to hunt bears the next day it was just twelve o clock when we knocked at ebene zer s front door just at the moment when i should have been abstracting the fifteen hundred dollars from the box under the tree according to the original proposition bill was counting out two hundred and fifty dollars into dorset s hand when the kid found out we were going to leave him at home he started up a howl like a calliope and fastened himself as tight as a leech to bill s leg his father peeled him away gradually like a porous plaster how long can you hold him asks bill i m not as strong as i used to be says old dorset but i think i can promise you ten minutes enough says bill in ten minutes i shall cross the central southern and middle western states and be legging it trippingly for the canadian border and as dark as it was and as fat as bill was and as good a runner as i am he was a good mile and a half out of summit before i could catch up with him the marry month of may prithee smite the poet in the eye when he would sing to

honour of the fair d butante sum mer puts the kibosh on us all old mr coulson groaned a little and then sat up straight in his invalid s chair he had the gout very bad in one foot a house near gramercy park half a million dollars and a daughter and he had a house keeper mrs widdup the fact and the name deserve a sentence each they have it when may poked mr coulson he became elder brother to the turtle dove in the window near which he sat were boxes of jonquils of hyacinths geraniums and pansies the breeze brought their odour into the room immediately there was a well contested round between the breath of the flowers and the able and active effluvium from gout liniment the liniment won easily but not before the flowers got an uppercut to old mr coulson s nose the deadly work of the implacable false enchant ress may was done across the park to the olfactories of mr coulson came other unmistakable characteristic copyrighted smells of spring that belong to the big city above the subway alone the smells of hot asphalt underground caverns gasoline patchouli orange peel sewer gas albany grabs egyptian cigarettes mortar and the undried ink on news papers the inblowing air was sweet and mild sparrows wrangled happily everywhere outdoors never trust may mr coulson twisted the ends of his white mustache cursed his foot and pounded a bell on the table by his side in came mrs widdup she was comely to the eye fair flustered forty and foxy higgins is out sir she said with a smile suggestive of vibratory massage he went to post a letter can i do anything for you sir it s time for my aconite said old mr coulson drop it for me the bottle s there three drops in water d that is confound higgins there s nobody in this house cares if i die here in this chair for want of attention mrs widdup sighed deeply don t be saying that sir she said there s them that would care more than any one knows thirteen drops you said sir three said old man coulson he took his dose and then mrs widdup s hand she blushed oh yes it can be done just hold your breath and compress the diaphragm mrs widdup said mr coulson the springtime s full upon us ain t that right said mrs widdup the air s real warm and there s bock beer signs on every corner and the park s all yaller and pink and blue with flowers and i have such shooting pains up my legs and body in the spring quoted mr coulson curling his mustache a y that is a man s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love lawsy now exclaimed mrs widdup ain t that right seems like it s in the air in the spring continued old mr coulson a livelier iris shines upon the burnished dove they do be lively the irish sighed mrs widdup pensively mrs widdup said mr coulson making a face at a twinge of his gouty foot this would be a lonesome house without you i m an that is i m an elderly man but i m worth a comfortable lot of money if half a million dollars worth of government bonds and the true affection of a heart that though no longer beating with the first ardour of youth can still throb with genuine the loud noise of an overturned chair near the porti res of the adjoining room interrupted the venerable and scarcely suspecting victim of may in stalked miss van meeker constantia coulson bony durable tall high nosed frigid well bred thirty five in the neighbourhood of gramercy parkish she put up a lorgnette mrs widdup hastily stooped and arranged the bandages on mr coulson s gouty foot i thought higgins was with you said miss van meeker constantia higgins went out explained her father and mrs widdup answered the bell that is better now mrs widdup thank you no there is nothing else i require the housekeeper retired pink under the cool inquiring stare of miss coulson this spring weather is lovely isn t it daughter said the old man consciously conscious that s just it replied miss van meeker constantia coulson somewhat obscurely when does mrs wid dup start on her vacation papa i believe she said a week from to day said mr coulson miss van meeker constantia stood for a minute at the window gazing toward the little park flooded with the mellow afternoon sunlight with the eye of a botanist she viewed the flowers most potent weapons of insid ious may with the cool pulses of a virgin of cologne she withstood the attack of the ethereal mildness the arrows of the pleasant sunshine fell back frostbitten from the cold panoply of her unthrilled bosom the odour of the flowers waked no soft sentiments in the unexplored recesses of her dormant heart the chirp of the sparrows gave her a pain she mocked at may but although miss coulson was proof against the season she was keen enough to estimate its power she knew that elderly men and thick waisted women jumped as educated fleas in the ridiculous train of may the merry mocker of the months she had heard of foolish old gentlemen marrying their housekeepers before what a humiliating thing after all was this feeling called love the next morning at o clock when the iceman called the cook told him that miss coulson wanted to see him in the basement well ain t i the olcott and depew not mentioning the first name at all said the iceman admiringly of himself as a concession he rolled his sleeves down dropped his icehooks on a syringe and went back when miss van meeker constantia coulson addressed him he took off his bat there is a rear entrance to this basement said miss coulson which can be reached by driving into the vacant lot next door where they are excavating for a building i want you to bring in that way within two hours pounds of ice you may have to bring another man or two to help you i will show you where i want it placed i also want pounds a day delivered the same way for the next four days your company may charge the ice on our regular bill this is for your extra trouble miss coulson tendered a ten dollar bill the iceman bowed and held his hat in his two hands behind him not if you ll excuse me lady it ll be a pleasure to fix things up for you any way you please alas for may about noon mr coulson knocked two glasses off his table broke the spring of his bell and yelled for higgins at the same time bring an axe commanded mr coulson sardoni cally or send out for a quart of prussic acid or have a policeman come in and shoot me i d rather that than be frozen to death it does seem to be getting cool sir said higgins i hadn t noticed it before i ll close the window sir do said mr coulson they call this spring do they if it keeps up long i ll go back to palm beach house feels like a morgue later miss coulson dutifully came in to inquire how the gout was progressing stantia said the old man how is the weather out doors bright answered miss coulson but chilly feels like the dead of winter to me said mr coulson an instance said constantia gazing abstractedly out the window of winter lingering in the lap of spring though the metaphor is not in the most refined taste a little later she walked down by the side of the little park and on westward to broadway to accomplish a little shopping a little later than that mrs widdup entered the invalid s room did you ring sir she asked dimpling in many places i asked higgins to go to the drug store and i thought i heard your bell i did not said mr coulson i m afraid said mrs widdup i interrupted you sir yesterday when you were about to say something how comes it mrs widdup said old man coulson sternly that i find it so cold in this house cold sir said the housekeeper why now since you speak of it it do seem cold in this room but out doors it s as warm and fine as june sir and how this weather do seem to make one s heart jump out of one s shirt waist sir and the ivy all leaved out on the side of the house and the hand organs playing and the children dancing on the sidewalk tis a great time for speaking out what s in the heart you were saying yesterday sir woman roared mr coulson you are a fool i pay you to take care of this house i am freezing to death in my own room and you come in and drivel to me about ivy and hand organs get me an overcoat at once see that all doors and windows are closed below an old fat irresponsible one sided object like you prat ing about springtime and flowers in the middle of winter when higgins comes back tell him to bring me a hot rum punch and now get out but who shall shame the bright face of may rogue though she be and disturber of sane men s peace no wise virgins cunning nor cold storage shall make her bow her head in the bright galaxy of months oh yes the story was not quite finished a night passed and higgins helped old man coulson in the morning to his chair by the window the cold of the room was gone heavenly odours and fragrant mild ness entered in hurried mrs widdup and stood by his chair mr coulson reached his bony hand and grasped her plump one mrs widdup he said this house would be no home without you i have half a million dollars if that and the true affection of a heart no lonoer in its youthful prime but still not cold could i found out what made it cold said mrs widdup leanin against his chair twas ice tons of it in the basement and in the furnace room everywhere i shut off the registers that it was coming through into your room mr coulson poor soul and now it s maytime again a true heart went on old man coulson a little wanderingly that the springtime has brought to life again and but what will my daughter say mrs widdup never fear sir said mrs widdup cheerfully miss coulson she ran away with the iceman last night sir a technical error i never cared especially for feuds believing them to be even more overrated products of our country than grapefruit scrapple or honeymoons nevertheless if i may be allowed i will tell you of an indian territory feud of which i was press agent camp follower and inaccessory during the fact i was on a visit to sam durkee s ranch where i had a great time falling off unmanicured ponies and waving my bare hand at the lower jaws of wolves about two miles away sam was a hardened person of about twenty five with a reputation for going home in the dark with perfect equanimity though often with reluctance over in the creek nation was a family bearing the name of tatum i was told that the durkees and tatums had been feuding for years several of each family had bitten the grass and it was expected that more nebuchad nezzars would follow a younger generation of each family was growing up and the grass was keeping pace with them but i gathered that they had fought fairly that they had not lain in cornfields and aimed at the division of their enemies suspenders in the back partly perhaps because there were no cornfields and nobody wore more than one suspender nor had any woman or child of either house ever been harmed in those days and you will find it so yet their women were safe sam durkee had a girl if it were an all fiction magazine that i expect to sell this story to i should say mr durkee rejoiced in a fianc e her name was ella baynes they appeared to be devoted to each other and to have perfect confidence in each other as all couples do who are and have or aren t and haven t she was tolerably pretty with a heavy mass of brown hair that helped her along he introduced me to her which seemed not to lessen her preference for him so i reasoned that they were surely soul mates miss baynes lived in kingfisher twenty miles from the ranch sam lived on a gallop between the two places one day there came to kingfisher a courageous young man rather small with smooth face and regular features he made many inquiries about the business of the town and especially of the inhabitants cognominally he said he was from muscogee and he looked it with his yellow shoes and crocheted four in hand i met him once when i rode in for the mail he said his name was beverly travers which seemed rather improbable there were active times on the ranch just then and sam was too busy to go to town often as an incom petent and generally worthless guest it devolved upon me to ride in for little things such as post cards barrels of flour baking powder smoking tobacco and letters from ella one day when i was messenger for half a gross of cigarette papers and a couple of wagon tires i saw the alleged beverly travers in a yellow wheeled buggy with ella baynes driving about town as ostentatiously as the black waxy mud would permit i knew that this infor mation would bring no balm of gilead to sam s soul so i refrained from including it in the news of the city that i retailed on my return but on the next afternoon an elongated ex cowboy of the name of simmons an old time pal of sam s who kept a feed store in kingfisher rode out to the ranch and rolled and burned many cigar ettes before he would talk when he did make oration his words were these say sam there s been a description of a galoot miscallin himself bevel edged travels impairing the atmospheric air of kingfisher for the past two weeks you know who he was he was not otherwise than ben tatum from the creek nation son of old gopher tatum that your uncle newt shot last february you know what he done this morning he killed your brother lester shot him in the co t house yard i wondered if sam had heard he pulled a twig from a mesquite bush chewed it gravely and said he did did he he killed lester the same said simmons and he did more he run away with your girl the same as to say miss ella baynes i thought you might like to know so i rode out to impart the information i am much obliged jim said sam taking the chewed twig from his mouth yes i m glad you rode out yes i m right glad well i ll be ridin back i reckon that boy i left in the feed store don t know hay from oats he shot lester in the back shot him in the back yes while he was hitchin his hoss i m much obliged jim i kind of thought you d like to know as soon as you could come in and have some coffee before you ride back jim why no i reckon not i must get back to the store and you say yes sam everybody seen em drive away together in a buckboard with a big bundle like clothes tied up in the back of it he was drivin the team he brought over with him from muscogee they ll be hard to over take right away and which i was goin on to tell you they left on the guthrie road but there s no tellin which forks they ll take you know that all right jim much obliged you re welcome sam simmons rolled a cigarette and stabbed his pony with both heels twenty yards away he reined up and called back you don t want no assistance as you might say not any thanks i didn t think you would well so long sam took out and opened a bone handled pocket knife and scraped a dried piece of mud from his left boot i thought at first he was going to swear a vendetta on the blade of it or recite the gipsy s curse the few feuds i had ever seen or read about usually opened that way this one seemed to be presented with a new treat ment thus offered on the stage it would have been hissed off and one of belasco s thrilling melodramas demanded instead i wonder said sam with a profoundly thoughtful expression if the cook has any cold beans left over he called wash the negro cook and finding that he had some ordered him to heat up the pot and make some strong coffee then we went into sam s private room where he slept and kept his armoury dogs and the sad dles of his favourite mounts he took three or four six shooters out of a bookcase and began to look them over whistling the cowboy s lament abstractedly after ward he ordered the two best horses on the ranch saddled and tied to the hitching post now in the feud business in all sections of the country i have observed that in one particular there is a delicate but strict etiquette belonging you must not mention the word or refer to the subject in the presence of a feudist it would be more reprehensible than commenting upon the mole on the chin of your rich aunt i found later on that there is another unwritten rule but i think that belongs solely to the west it yet lacked two hours to supper time but in twenty minutes sam and i were plunging deep into the reheated beans hot coffee and cold beef nothing like a good meal before a long ride said sam eat hearty i had a sudden suspicion why did you have two horses saddled i asked one two one two said sam you can count can t you his mathematics carried with it a momentary qualm and a lesson the thought had not occurred to him that the thought could possibly occur to me not to ride at his side on that red road to revenge and justice it was the higher calculus i was booked for the trail i began to eat more beans in an hour we set forth at a steady gallop eastward our horses were kentucky bred strengthened by the mesquite grass of the west ben tatum s steeds may have been swifter and he had a good lead but if he had heard the punctual thuds of the hoofs of those trailers of ours born in the heart of feudland he might have felt that retribution was creeping up on the hoof prints of his dapper nags i knew that ben tatum s card to play was flight flight until he came within the safer territory of his own henchmen and supporters he knew that the man pur suing him would follow the trail to any end where it might lead during the ride sam talked of the prospect for rain of the price of beef and of the musical glasses you would have thought he had never had a brother or a sweetheart or an enemy on earth there are some sub jects too big even for the words in the unabridged knowing this phase of the feud code but not having practised it sufficiently i overdid the thing by telling some slightly funny anecdotes sam laughed at exactly the right place laughed with his mouth when i caught sight of his mouth i wished i had been blessed with enough sense of humour to have suppressed those anecdotes our first sight of them we had in guthrie tired and hungry we stumbled unwashed into a little yellow pine hotel and sat at a table in the opposite corner we saw the fugitives they were bent upon their meal but looked around at times uneasily the girl was dressed in brown one of these smooth half shiny silky looking affairs with lace collar and cuffs and what i believe they call an accordion plaited skirt she wore a thick brown veil down to her nose and a broad brimmed straw hat with some kind of feathers adorning it the man wore plain dark clothes and his hair was trimmed very short he was such a man as you might see anywhere there they were the murderer and the woman he had stolen there we were the rightful avenger according to the code and the supernumerary who writes these words for one time at least in the heart of the supernumerary there rose the killing instinct for one moment he joined the force of combatants orally what are you waiting for sam i said in a whisper let him have it now sam gave a melancholy sigh you don t understand but he does he said he knows mr tenderfoot there s a rule out here among white men in the nation that you can t shoot a man when he s with a woman i never knew it to be broke yet you can t do it you ve got to get him in a gang of men or by himself that s why he knows it too we all know so that s mr ben tatum one of the pretty men i ll cut him out of the herd before they leave the hotel and regulate his account after supper the flying pair disappeared quickly although sam haunted lobby and stairway and halls half the night in some mysterious way the fugitives eluded him and in the morning the veiled lady in the brown dress with the accordion plaited skirt and the dapper young man with the close clipped hair and the buckboard with the prancing nags were gone it is a monotonous story that of the ride so it shall be curtailed once again we overtook them on a road we were about fifty yards behind they turned in the buckboard and looked at us then drove on without whipping up their horses their safety no longer lay in speed ben tatum knew he knew that the only rock of safety left to him was the code there is no doubt that had he been alone the matter would have been settled quickly with sam durkee in the usual way but he had something at his side that kept still the trigger finger of both it seemed likely that he was no coward so you may perceive that woman on occasions may postpone instead of precipitating conflict between man and man but not willingly or consciously she is oblivious of codes five miles farther we came upon the future great western city of chandler the horses of pursuers and pursued were starved and weary there was one hotel that offered danger to man and entertainment to beast so the four of us met again in the dining room at the ringing of a bell so resonant and large that it had cracked the welkin long ago the dining room was not as large as the one at guthrie just as we were eating apple pie how ben davises and tragedy impinge upon each other i noticed sam looking with keen intentness at our quarry where they were seated at a table across the room the girl still wore the brown dress with lace collar and cuffs and the veil drawn down to her nose the man bent over his plate with his close cropped head held low there s a code i heard sam say either to me or to himself that won t let you shoot a man in the company of a woman but by thunder there ain t one to keep you from killing a woman in the company of a man and quicker than my mind could follow his argument he whipped a colt s automatic from under his left arm and pumped six bullets into the body that the brown dress covered the brown dress with the lace collar and cuffs and the accordion plaited skirt the young person in the dark sack suit from whose head and from whose life a woman s glory had been clipped laid her head on her arms stretched upon the table while people came running to raise ben tatum from the floor in his feminine masquerade that had given sam the opportunity to set aside technically the obliga tions of the code suite homes and their romance few young couples in the big city of bluff began their married existence with greater promise of happiness than did mr and mrs claude turpin they felt no especial animosity toward each other they were comfort ably established in a handsome apartment house that had a name and accommodations like those of a sleeping car they were living as expensively as the couple on the next floor above who had twice their income and their marriage had occurred on a wager a ferry boat and first acquaintance thus securing a sensational newspaper notice with their names attached to pictures of the queen of roumania and m santos dumont turpin s income was per month on pay day after calculating the amounts due for rent instalments on furniture and piano gas and bills owed to the florist confectioner milliner tailor wine merchant and cab company the turpins would find that they still had left to spend how to do this is one of the secrets of metropolitan life the domestic life of the turpins was a beautiful picture to see but you couldn t gaze upon it as you could at an oleograph of don t wake grandma or brook lyn by moonlight you had to blink when looked at it and you heard a fizzing sound just like the machine with a scope at the end of it yes there wasn t much repose about the picture of the turpins domestic life it was something like spearing salmon in the columbia river or jap anese artillery in action every day was just like another as the days are in new york in the morning turpin would take bromo seltzer his pocket change from under the clock his hat no breakfast and his departure for the office at noon mrs turpin would get out of bed and humour put on a kimono airs and the water to boil for coffee turpin lunched downtown he came home at to dress for dinner they always dined out they strayed from the chop house to chop sueydom from terrace to table d h te from rathskeller to roadhouse from caf to casino from maria s to the martha wash ington such is domestic life in the great city your vine is the mistletoe your fig tree bears dates your household gods are mercury and john howard payne for the wedding march you now hear only come with the gypsy bride you rarely dine at the same place twice in succession you tire of the food and besides you want to give them time for the question of that souve nir silver sugar bowl to blow over the turpins were therefore happy they made many warm and delightful friends some of whom they remem bered the next day their home life was an ideal one according to the rules and regulations of the book of bluff there came a time when it dawned upon turpin that his wife was getting away with too much money if you belong to the near swell class in the big city and your income is per month and you find at the end of the month after looking over the bills for current expenses that you yourself have spent you very naturally wonder what has become of the other so you suspect your wife and perhaps you give her a hint that something needs explanation i say vivien said turpin one afternoon when they were enjoying in rapt silence the peace and quiet of their cozy apartment you ve been creating a hiatus big enough for a dog to crawl through in this month s hon orarium you haven t been paying your dressmaker anything on account have you there was a moment s silence no sounds could be heard except the breathing of the fox terrier and the subdued monotonous sizzling of vivien s fulvous locks against the insensate curling irons claude turpin sitting upon a pillow that he had thoughtfully placed upon the convolutions of the apartment sofa narrowly watched the riante lovely face of his wife claudie dear said she touching her finger to her ruby tongue and testing the unresponsive curling irons you do me an injustice mme toinette has not seen a cent of mine since the day you paid your tailor ten dollars on account turpin s suspicions were allayed for the time but one day soon there came an anonymous letter to him that read watch your wife she is blowing in your money secretly i was a sufferer just as you are the place is no blank street a word to the wise etc a man who knows turpin took this letter to the captain of police of the precinct that he lived in my precinct is as clean as a hound s tooth said the captain the lid s shut down as close there as it is over the eye of a williamsburg girl when she s kissed at a party but if you think there s anything queer at the address i ll go there with ye on the next afternoon at turpin and the captain crept softly up the stairs of no blank street a dozen plain clothes men dressed in full police uniforms so as to allay suspicion waited in the hall below at the top of the stairs was a door which was found to be locked the captain took a key from his pocket and unlocked it the two men entered they found themselves in a large room occupied by twenty or twenty five elegantly clothed ladies racing charts hung against the walls a ticker clicked in one corner with a telephone receiver to his ear a man was calling

so childlike and worshipful and he would once have sworn so sincere she had invested him with an almost supernatural number of high attributes and excellencies and talents and he had absorbed the oblation as a desert drinks the rain that can coax from it no promise of blossom or fruit as trysdale grimly wrenched apart the seam of his last glove the crowning instance of his fatuous and tardily mourned egoism came vividly back to him the scene was the night when he had asked her to come up on his pedestal with him and share his greatness he could not now for the pain of it allow his mind to dwell upon the memory of her convincing beauty that night the careless wave of her hair the tenderness and virginal charm of her looks and words but they had been enough and they had brought him to speak during their conversation she had said and captain carruthers tells me that you speak the spanish language like a native why have you hidden this accomplishment from me is there anything you do not know now carruthers was an idiot no doubt he trysdale had been guilty he sometimes did such things of airing at the club some old canting castilian proverb dug from the hotchpotch at the back of dictionaries carruthers who was one of his incontinent admirers was the very man to have magnified this exhibition of doubtful erudition but alas the incense of her admiration had been so sweet and flattering he allowed the imputation to pass without denial without protest he allowed her to twine about his brow this spurious bay of spanish scholarship he let it grace his conquering head and among its soft convolutions he did not feel the prick of the thorn that was to pierce him later how glad how shy how tremulous she was how she fluttered like a snared bird when he laid his mightiness at her feet he could have sworn and he could swear now that unmistakable consent was in her eyes but coyly she would give him no direct answer i will send you my answer to morrow she said and he the indulgent confident victor smilingly granted the delay the next day he waited impatient in his rooms for the word at noon her groom came to the door and left the strange cactus in the red earthen jar there was no note no message merely a tag upon the plant bearing a barbarous foreign or botanical name he waited until night but her answer did not come his large pride and hurt vanity kept him from seeking her two evenings later they met at a dinner their greetings were conventional but she looked at him breathless wondering eager he was courteous adamant waiting her explanation with womanly swiftness she took her cue from his manner and turned to snow and ice thus and wider from this on they had drifted apart where was his fault who had been to blame humbled now he sought the answer amid the ruins of his self conceit if the voice of the other man in the room querulously intruding upon his thoughts aroused him i say trysdale what the deuce is the matter with you you look unhappy as if you yourself had been married instead of having acted merely as an accomplice look at me another accessory come two thousand miles on a garlicky cockroachy banana steamer all the way from south america to connive at the sacrifice please to observe how lightly my guilt rests upon my shoulders only little sister i had too and now she s gone come now take something to ease your conscience i don t drink just now thanks said trysdale your brandy resumed the other coming over and joining him is abominable run down to see me some time at punta redonda and try some of our stuff that old garcia smuggles in it s worth the trip hallo here s an old acquaintance wherever did you rake up this cactus trysdale a present said trysdale from a friend know the species very well it s a tropical concern see hundreds of em around punta every day here s the name on this tag tied to it know any spanish trysdale no said trysdale with the bitter wraith of a smile is it spanish yes the natives imagine the leaves are reaching out and beckoning to you they call it by this name ventomarme name means in english come and take me the detective detector i was walking in central park with avery knight the great new york burglar highwayman and murderer but my dear knight said i it sounds incredible you have undoubtedly performed some of the most wonderful feats in your profession known to modern crime you have committed some marvellous deeds under the very noses of the police you have boldly entered the homes of millionaires and held them up with an empty gun while you made free with their silver and jewels you have sandbagged citizens in the glare of broadway s electric lights you have killed and robbed with superb openness and absolute impunity but when you boast that within forty eight hours after committing a murder you can run down and actually bring me face to face with the detective assigned to apprehend you i must beg leave to express my doubts remember you are in new york avery knight smiled indulgently you pique my professional pride doctor he said in a nettled tone i will convince you about twelve yards in advance of us a prosperous looking citizen was rounding a clump of bushes where the walk curved knight suddenly drew a revolver and shot the man in the back his victim fell and lay without moving the great murderer went up to him leisurely and took from his clothes his money watch and a valuable ring and cravat pin he then rejoined me

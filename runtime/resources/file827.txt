children the oldest fifteen years i work all day and half the night to till what little land i can and keep us in clothes and books i teach my children too my neighbours is all poor and has big families the drought kills the crops every two or three years and then we has hard times to get enough to eat there is ten families on this land what the land sharks is trying to rob us of and all of them got titles from me i sold to them cheap and they aint paid out yet but part of them is and if their land should be took from them i would die my grandfather was an honest man and he helped to build up this state and he taught his children to be honest and how could i make it up to them who bought me mr commissioner if you let them land sharks take the roof from over my children and the little from them as they has to live on whoever again calls this state great or its government just will have a lie in their mouths the commissioner laid this letter aside with a sigh many many such letters he had received he had never been hurt by them nor had he ever felt that they appealed to him personally he was but the state s servant and must follow its laws and yet somehow this reflection did not always eliminate a certain responsible feeling that hung upon him of all the state s officers he was supremest in his department not even excepting the governor broad general land laws he followed it was true but he had a wide latitude in particular ramifica tions rather than law what he followed was rulings office rulings and precedents in the complicated and new questions that were being engendered by the state s development the commissioner s ruling was rarely appealed from even the courts sustained it when its equity was apparent the commissioner stepped to the door and spoke to a clerk in the other room spoke as he always did as if he were addressing a prince of the blood mr weldon will you be kind enough to ask mr ashe the state school land appraiser to please come to my office as soon as convenient ashe came quickly from the big table where he was arranging his reports mr ashe said the commissioner you worked along the chiquito river in salado colinty during your last trip i believe do you remember anything of the elias denny three league survey yes sir i do the blunt breezy surveyor answered i crossed it on my way to block h on the north side of it the road runs with the chiquito river along the valley the denny survey fronts three miles on the chiquito it is claimed continued the commissioner that it fails to reach the river by as much as a mile the appraiser shrugged his shoulder he was by birth and instinct an actual settler and the natural foe of the land shark it has always been considered to extend to the river he said dryly but that is not the point i desired to discuss said the commissioner what kind of country is this valley portion of let us say then the denny tract the spirit of the actual settler beamed in ashe s face beautiful he said with enthusiasm valley as level as this floor with just a little swell on like the sea and rich as cream just enough brakes to shelter the cattle in winter black loamy soil for six feet and then clay holds water a dozen nice little houses on it with windmills and gardens people pretty poor i guess too far from market but comfortable never saw so many kids in my life they raise flocks inquired the commissioner ho ho i mean two legged kids lauched the surveyor two legged and bare legged and tow headed children oh children mused the commissioner as though a new view had opened to him they raise children it s a lonesome country commissioner said the surveyor can you blame em i suppose continued the commissioner slowly as one carefully pursues deductions from a new stupendous theory not all of them are tow headed it would not be unreasonable mr ashe i conjecture to believe that a portion of them have brown or even black hair brown and black sure said ashe also red no doubt said the commissioner well i thank you for your courtesy in informing me mr ashe i will not detain you any longer from your duties later in the afternoon came hamlin and avery big handsome genial sauntering men clothed in white duck and low cut shoes they permeated the whole office with an aura of debonair prosperity they passed among the clerks and left a wake of abbreviated given names and fat brown cigars these were the aristocracy of the land sharks who went in for big things full of serene confidence in them selves there was no corporation no syndicate no rail road company or attorney general too big for them to tackle the peculiar smoke of their rare fat brown cigars was to be perceived in the sanctum of every department of state in every committee room of the legislature in every bank parlour and every private caucus room in the state capital always pleasant never in a hurry in seeming to possess unlimited leisure people wondered when they gave their attention to the many audacious enterprises in which they were knnown to be engaged by and by the two dropped carelessly into the com missioner s room and reclined lazily in the big leather upholstered arm chairs they drawled a good natured complaint of the weather and hamlin told the com missioner an excellent story he had amassed that morn ing from the secretary of state but the commissioner knew

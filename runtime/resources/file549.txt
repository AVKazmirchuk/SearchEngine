of life he had not learned that although the world was made round the circle has been squared and that it s true interest is to be in what s around the corner forster walked abroad aimlessly from the powhatan trying not to tax either his judgment or his desire as to what streets he traveled he would have been glad to lose his way if it were possible but he had no hope of that adventure and fortune move at your beck and call in the greater city but chance is oriental she is a veiled lady in a sedan chair protected by a special traffic squad of dragonians crosstown uptown and downtown you may move without seeing her at the end of an hour s stroll forster stood on a corner of a broad smooth avenue looking disconsolately across it at a picturesque old hotel softly but brilliantly lit disconsolately because he knew that he must dine and dining in that hotel was no venture it was one of his favorite caravansaries and so silent and swift would be the service and so delicately choice the food that he regretted the hunger that must be appeased by the dead perfection of the place s cuisine even the music there seemed to be always playing da capo fancy came to him that he would dine at some cheap even dubious restaurant lower down in the city where the erratic chefs from all countries of the world spread their national cookery for the omnivorous american something might happen there out of the routine he might come upon a subject without a predicate a road without an end a question without an answer a cause without an effect a gulf stream in life s salt ocean he had not dressed for evening he wore a dark business suit that would not be questioned even where the waiters served the spaghetti in their shirt sleeves so john reginald forster began to search his clothes for money because the more cheaply you dine the more surely must you pay all of the thirteen pockets large and small of his business suit he explored carefully and found not a penny his bank book showed a balance of five figures to his credit in the old ironsides trust company but forster became aware of a man nearby at his left hand who was really regarding him with some amusement he looked like any business man of thirty or so neatly dressed and standing in the attitude of one waiting for a street car but there was no car line on that avenue so his proximity and unconcealed curiosity seemed to forster to partake of the nature of a personal intrusion but as he was a consistent seeker after what s around the corner instead of manifesting resentment he only turned a half embarrassed smile upon the other s grin of amusement all in asked the intruder drawing nearer seems so said forster now i thought there was a dollar in oh i know said the other man with a laugh but there wasn t i ve just been through the same process myself as i was coming around the corner i found in an upper vest pocket i don t know how they got there exactly two pennies you know what kind of a dinner exactly two pennies will buy you haven t dined then asked forster i have not but i would like to now i ll make you a proposition you look like a man who would take up one your clothes look neat and respectable excuse personalities i think mine will pass the scrutiny of a head waiter also suppose we go over to that hotel and dine together we will choose from the menu like millionaires or if you prefer like gentlemen in moderate circumstances dining extravagantly for once when we have finished we will match with my two pennies to see which of us will stand the brunt of the house s displeasure and vengeance my name is ives i think we have lived in the same station of life before our money took wings you re on said forster joyfully here was a venture at least within the borders of the mysterious country of change anyhow it promised something better than the stale infestivity of a table d h ote the two were soon seated at a corner table in the hotel dining room ives chucked one of his pennies across the table to forster match for which of us gives the order he said forster lost ives laughed and began to name liquids and viands to the waiter with the absorbed but calm deliberation of one who was to the menu born forster listening gave his admiring approval of the order i am a man said ives during the oysters who has made a lifetime search after the to be continued in our next i am not like the ordinary adventurer who strikes for a coveted prize nor yet am i like a gambler who knows he is either to win or lose a certain set stake what i want is to encounter an adventure to which i can predict no conclusion it is the breath of existence to me to dare fate in its blindest manifestations the world has come to run so much by rote and gravitation that you can enter upon hardly any footpath of chance in which you do not find signboards informing you of what you may expect at its end i am like the clerk in the circumlocution office who always complained bitterly when any one came in to ask information he wanted to know you know was the kick he made to his fellow clerks well i don t want to know i don t want to reason i don t want to guess i want to bet my hand without seeing it i understand said forster delightedly i ve often

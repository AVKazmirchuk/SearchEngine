further down the frio many years of living face to face with sheep on their own terms wearied dry valley johnson so he sold his ranch for eighteen thousand dollars and moved to santa rosa to live a life of gentlemanly ease being a silent and melancholy person of thirty five or perhaps thirty eight he soon became that cursed and earth cumbering thing an elderlyish bachelor with a hobby some one gave him his first strawberry to eat and he was done for dry valley bought a four room cottage in the village and a library on strawberry culture behind the cottage was a garden of which he made a strawberry patch in his old grey woolen shirt his brown duck trousers and high heeled boots he sprawled all day on a canvas cot under a live oak tree at his back door studying the history of the seductive scarlet berry the school teacher miss de witt spoke of him as a fine presentable man for all his middle age but the focus of dry valley s eyes embraced no women they were merely beings who flew skirts as a signal for him to lift awkwardly his heavy round crowned broad brimmed felt stetson whenever he met them and then hurry past to get back to his beloved berries and all this recitative by the chorus is only to bring us to the point where you may be told why dry valley shook up the insoluble sulphur in the bottle so long drawn and inconsequential a thing is history the anamorphous shadow of a milestone reaching down the road between us and the setting sun when his strawberries were beginning to ripen dry valley bought the heaviest buggy whip in the santa rosa store he sat for many hours under the live oak tree plaiting and weaving in an extension to its lash when it was done he could snip a leaf from a bush twenty feet away with the cracker for the bright predatory eyes of santa rosa youth were watching the ripening berries and dry valley was arming himself against their expected raids no greater care had he taken of his tender lambs during his ranching days than he did of his cherished fruit warding it from the hungry wolves that whistled and howled and shot their marbles and peered through the fence that surrounded his property in the house next to dry valley s lived a widow with a pack of children that gave the husbandman frequent anxious misgivings in the woman there was a strain of the spanish she had wedded one of the name of o brien dry valley was a connoisseur in cross strains and he foresaw trouble in the offspring of this union between the two homesteads ran a crazy picket fence overgrown with morning glory and wild gourd vines often he could see little heads with mops of black hair and flashing dark eyes dodging in and out between the pickets keeping tabs on the reddening berries late one afternoon dry valley went to the post office when he came back like mother hubbard he found the deuce to pay the descendants of iberian bandits and hibernian cattle raiders had swooped down upon his strawberry patch to the outraged vision of dry valley there seemed to be a sheep corral full of them perhaps they numbered five or six between the rows of green plants they were stooped hopping about like toads gobbling silently and voraciously his finest fruit dry valley slipped into the house got his whip and charged the marauders the lash curled about the legs of the nearest a greedy ten year old before they knew they were discovered his screech gave warning and the flock scampered for the fence like a drove of javelis flushed in the chaparral dry valley s whip drew a toll of two more elfin shrieks before they dived through the vine clad fence and disappeared dry valley less fleet followed them nearly to the pickets checking his useless pursuit he rounded a bush dropped his whip and stood voiceless motionless the capacity of his powers consumed by the act of breathing and preserving the perpendicular behind the bush stood panchita o brien scorning to fly she was nineteen the oldest of the raiders her night black hair was gathered back in a wild mass and tied with a scarlet ribbon she stood with reluctant feet yet nearer the brook than to the river for childhood had environed and detained her she looked at dry valley johnson for a moment with magnificent insolence and before his eyes slowly crunched a luscious berry between her white teeth then she turned and walked slowly to the fence with a swaying conscious motion such as a duchess might make use of in leading a promenade there she turned again and grilled dry valley johnson once more in the dark flame of her audacious eyes laughed a trifle school girlishly and twisted herself with pantherish quickness between the pickets to the o brien side of the wild gourd vine dry valley picked up his whip and went into his house he stumbled as he went up the two wooden steps the old mexican woman who cooked his meals and swept his house called him to supper as he went through the rooms dry valley went on stumbled down the front steps out the gate and down the road into a mesquite thicket at the edge of town he sat down in the grass and laboriously plucked the spines from a prickly pear one by one this was his attitude of thought acquired in the days when his problems were only those of wind and wool and water a thing had happened to the man a thing that if you are eligible you must pray may pass you by he had become enveloped in the indian summer of the soul dry valley had had no youth even his childhood had been one of dignity and seriousness at six he had viewed the frivolous gambols of the lambs on his father s ranch with silent disapproval his life as a young man had been wasted the divine fires and impulses the glorious exaltations and despairs the glow and enchantment of youth had passed above his head never a thrill of romeo had he known he was but a melancholy jaques of the forest with a ruder philosophy lacking the bitter sweet flavour of experience that tempered the veteran years of the rugged ranger of arden and now in his sere and yellow leaf one scornful look from the eyes of panchita o brien had flooded the autumnal landscape with a tardy and delusive summer heat but a sheepman is a hardy animal dry valley johnson had weathered too many northers to turn his back on a late summer spiritual or real old he would show them by the next mail went an order to san antonio for an outfit of the latest clothes colours and styles and prices no object the next day went the recipe for the hair restorer clipped from a newspaper for dry valley s sunburned auburn hair was beginning to turn silvery above his ears dry valley kept indoors closely for a week except for frequent sallies after youthful strawberry snatchers then a few days later he suddenly emerged brilliantly radiant in the hectic glow of his belated midsummer madness a jay bird blue tennis suit covered him outwardly almost as far as his wrists and ankles his shirt was ox blood his collar winged and tall his necktie a floating oriflamme his shoes a venomous bright tan pointed and shaped on penitential lasts a little flat straw hat with a striped band desecrated his weather beaten head lemon coloured kid gloves protected his oak tough hands from the benignant may sunshine this sad and optic smiting creature teetered out of its den smiling foolishly and smoothing its gloves for men and angels to see to such a pass had dry valley johnson been brought by cupid who always shoots game that is out of season with an arrow from the quiver of momus reconstructing mythology he had risen a prismatic macaw from the ashes of the grey brown phoenix that had folded its tired wings to roost under the trees of santa rosa dry valley paused in the street to allow santa rosans within sight of him to be stunned and then deliberately and slowly as his shoes required entered mrs o brien s gate not until the eleven months drought did santa rosa cease talking about dry valley johnson s courtship of panchita o brien it was an unclassifiable procedure something like a combination of cake walking deaf and dumb oratory postage stamp flirtation and parlour charades it lasted two weeks and then came to a sudden end of course mrs o brien favoured the match as soon as dry valley s intentions were disclosed being the mother of a woman child and therefore a charter member of the ancient order of the rat trap she joyfully decked out panchita for the sacrifice the girl was temporarily dazzled by having her dresses lengthened and her hair piled up on her head and came near forgetting that she was only a slice of cheese it was nice too to have as good a match as mr johnson paying you attentions and to see the other girls fluttering the curtains at their windows to see you go by with him dry valley bought a buggy with yellow wheels and a fine trotter in san antonio every day he drove out with panchita he was never seen to speak to her when they were walking or driving the consciousness of his clothes kept his mind busy the knowledge that he could say nothing of interest kept him dumb the feeling that panchita was there kept him happy he took her to parties and dances and to church he tried oh no man ever tried so hard to be young as dry valley did he could not dance but he invented a smile which he wore on these joyous occasions a smile that in him was as great a concession to mirth and gaiety as turning hand springs would be in another he began to seek the company of the young men in the town even of the boys they accepted him as a decided damper for his attempts at sportiveness were so forced that they might as well have essayed their games in a cathedral neither he nor any other could estimate what progress he had made with panchita the end came suddenly in one day as often disappears the false afterglow before a november sky and wind dry valley was to call for the girl one afternoon at six for a walk an afternoon walk in santa rosa was a feature of social life that called for the pink of one s wardrobe so dry valley began gorgeously to array himself and so early that he finished early and went over to the o brien cottage as he neared the porch on the crooked walk from the gate he heard sounds of revelry within he stopped and looked through the honeysuckle vines in the open door panchita was amusing her younger brothers and sisters she wore a man s clothes no doubt those of the late mr o brien on her head was the smallest brother s straw hat decorated with an ink striped paper band on her hands were flapping yellow cloth gloves roughly cut out and sewn for the masquerade the same material covered her shoes giving them the semblance of tan leather high collar and flowing necktie were not omitted panchita was an actress dry valley saw his affectedly youthful gait his limp where the right shoe hurt him his forced smile his awkward simulation of a gallant air all reproduced with startling fidelity for the first time a mirror had been held up to him the corroboration of one of the youngsters calling mamma come and see pancha do like mr johnson was not needed as softly as the caricatured tans would permit dry valley tiptoed back to the gate and home again twenty minutes after the time appointed for the walk panchita tripped demurely out of her gate in a thin trim white lawn and sailor hat she strolled up the sidewalk and slowed her steps at dry valley s gate her manner expressing wonder at his unusual delinquency then out of his door and down the walk strode not the polychromatic victim of a lost summertime but the sheepman rehabilitated he wore his old grey woolen shirt open at the throat his brown duck trousers stuffed into his run over boots and his white felt sombrero on the back of his head twenty years or fifty he might look dry valley cared not his light blue eyes met panchita s dark ones with a cold flash in them he came as far as the gate he pointed with his long arm to her house go home said dry valley go home to your mother i wonder lightnin don t strike a fool like me go home and play in the sand what business have you got cavortin around with grown men i reckon i was locoed to be makin a he poll parrot out of myself for a kid like you go home and don t let me see you no more why i done it will somebody tell me go home and let me try and forget it panchita obeyed and walked slowly toward her home saying nothing for some distance she kept her head turned and her large eyes fixed intrepidly upon dry valley s at her gate she stood for a moment looking back at him then ran suddenly and swiftly into the house old antonia was building a fire in the kitchen stove dry valley stopped at the door and laughed harshly i m a pretty looking old rhinoceros to be gettin stuck on a kid ain t i tonia said he not verree good thing agreed antonia sagely for too much old man to likee muchacha you bet it ain t said dry valley grimly it s dum foolishness and besides it hurts he brought at one armful the regalia of his aberration the blue tennis suit shoes hat gloves and all and threw them in a pile at antonia s feet give them to your old man said he to hunt antelope in just as the first star presided palely over the twilight dry valley got his biggest strawberry book and sat on the back steps to catch the last of the reading light he thought he saw the figure of someone in his strawberry patch he laid aside the book got his whip and hurried forth to see it was panchita she had slipped through the picket fence and was half way across the patch she stopped when she saw him and looked at him without wavering a sudden rage a humiliating flush of unreasoning wrath came over dry valley for this child he had made himself a motley to the view he had tried to bribe time to turn backward for himself he had been made a fool of at last he had seen his folly there was a gulf between him and youth over which he could not build a bridge even with yellow gloves to protect his hands and the sight of his torment coming to pester him with her elfin pranks coming to plunder his strawberry vines like a mischievous schoolboy roused all his anger i told you to keep away from here said dry valley go back to your home panchita moved slowly toward him dry valley cracked his whip go back home said dry valley savagely and play theatricals some more you d make a fine man you ve made a fine one of me she came a step nearer silent and with that strange defiant steady shine in her eyes that had always puzzled him now it stirred his wrath his whiplash whistled through the air he saw a red streak suddenly come out through her white dress above her knee where it had struck without flinching and with the same unchanging dark glow in her eyes panchita came steadily toward him through the strawberry vines dry valley s trembling hand released his whip handle when within a yard of him panchita stretched out her arms god kid stammered dry valley do you mean but the seasons are versatile and it may have been springtime after all instead of indian summer that struck dry valley johnson christmas by injunction cherokee was the civic father of yellowhammer yellowhammer was a new mining town constructed mainly of canvas and undressed pine cherokee was a prospector one day while his burro was eating quartz and pine burrs cherokee turned up with his pick a nugget weighing thirty ounces he staked his claim and then being a man of breadth and hospitality sent out invitations to his friends in three states to drop in and share his luck not one of the invited guests sent regrets they rolled in from the gila country from salt river from the pecos from albuquerque and phoenix and santa fe and from the camps intervening when a thousand citizens had arrived and taken up claims they named the town yellowhammer appointed a vigilance committee and presented cherokee with a watch chain made of nuggets three hours after the presentation ceremonies cherokee s claim played out he had located a pocket instead of a vein he abandoned it and staked others one by one luck had kissed her hand to him never afterward did he turn up enough dust in yellowhammer to pay his bar bill but his thousand invited guests were mostly prospering and cherokee smiled and congratulated them yellowhammer was made up of men who took off their hats to a smiling loser so they invited cherokee to say what he wanted me said cherokee oh grubstakes will be about the thing i reckon i ll prospect along up in the mariposas if i strike it up there i will most certainly let you all know about the facts i never was any hand to hold out cards on my friends in may cherokee packed his burro and turned its thoughtful mouse coloured forehead to the north many citizens escorted him to the undefined limits of yellowhammer and bestowed upon him shouts of commendation and farewells five pocket flasks without an air bubble between contents and cork were forced upon him and he was bidden to consider yellowhammer in perpetual commission for his bed bacon and eggs and hot water for shaving in the event that luck did not see fit to warm her hands by his campfire in the mariposas the name of the father of yellowhammer was given him by the gold hunters in accordance with their popular system of nomenclature it was not necessary for a citizen to exhibit his baptismal certificate in order to acquire a cognomen a man s name was his personal property for convenience in calling him up to the bar and in designating him among other blue shirted bipeds a temporary appellation title or epithet was conferred upon him by the public personal peculiarities formed the source of the majority of such informal baptisms many were easily dubbed geographically from the regions from which they confessed to have hailed some announced themselves to be thompsons and adamses and the like with a brazenness and loudness that cast a cloud upon their titles a few vaingloriously and shamelessly uncovered their proper and indisputable names this was held to be unduly arrogant and did not win popularity one man who said he was chesterton l c belmont and proved it by letters was given till sundown to leave the town such names as shorty bow legs texas lazy bill thirsty rogers limping riley the judge and california ed were in favour cherokee derived his title from the fact that he claimed to have lived for a time with that tribe in the indian nation on the twentieth day of december baldy the mail rider brought yellowhammer a piece of news what do i see in albuquerque said baldy to the patrons of the bar but cherokee all embellished and festooned up like the czar of turkey and lavishin money in bulk him and me seen the elephant and the owl and we had specimens of this seidlitz powder wine and cherokee he audits all the bills c o d his pockets looked like a pool table s after a fifteen ball run cherokee must have struck pay ore remarked california ed well he s white i m much obliged to him for his success seems like cherokee would ramble down to yellowhammer and see his friends said another slightly aggrieved but that s the way prosperity is the finest cure there is for lost forgetfulness you wait said baldy i m comin to that cherokee strikes a three foot vein up in the mariposas that assays a trip to europe to the ton and he closes it out to a syndicate outfit for a hundred thousand hasty dollars in cash then he buys himself a baby sealskin overcoat and a red sleigh and what do you think he takes it in his head to do next chuck a luck said texas whose ideas of recreation were the gamester s come and kiss me ma honey sang shorty who carried tintypes in his pocket and wore a red necktie while working on his claim bought a saloon suggested thirsty rogers cherokee took me to a room continued baldy and showed me he s got that room full of drums and dolls and skates and bags of candy and jumping jacks and toy lambs and whistles and such infantile truck and what do you think he s goin to do with them inefficacious knick knacks don t surmise none cherokee told me he s goin to lead em up in his red sleigh and wait a minute don t order no drinks yet he s goin to drive down here to yellowhammer and give the kids the kids of this here town the biggest christmas tree and the biggest cryin doll and little giant boys tool chest blowout that was ever seen west of the cape hatteras two minutes of absolute silence ticked away in the wake of baldy s words it was broken by the house who happily conceiving the moment to be ripe for extending hospitality sent a dozen whisky glasses spinning down the bar with the slower travelling bottle bringing up the rear didn t you tell him asked the miner called trinidad well no answered baldy pensively i never exactly seen my way to you see cherokee had this christmas mess already bought and paid for and he was all flattered up with self esteem over his idea and we had in a way flew the flume with that fizzy wine i speak of so i never let on i cannot refrain from a certain amount of surprise said the judge as he hung his ivory handled cane on the bar that our friend cherokee should possess such an erroneous conception of ah his as it were own town oh it ain t the eighth wonder of the terrestrial world said baldy cherokee s been gone from yellowhammer over seven months lots of things could happen in that time how s he to know that there ain t a single kid in this town and so far as emigration is concerned none expected come to think of it remarked california ed it s funny some ain t drifted in town ain t settled enough yet for to bring in the rubber ring brigade i reckon to top off this christmas tree splurge of cherokee s went on baldy he s goin to give an imitation of santa claus he s got a white wig and whiskers that disfigure him up exactly like the pictures of this william cullen longfellow in the books and a red suit of fur trimmed outside underwear and eight ounce gloves and a stand up lay down croshayed red cap ain t it a shame that a outfit like that can t get a chance to connect with a annie and willie s prayer layout when does cherokee allow to come over with his truck inquired trinidad mornin before christmas said baldy and he wants you folks to have a room fixed up and a tree hauled and ready and such ladies to assist as can stop breathin long enough to let it be a surprise for the kids the unblessed condition of yellowhammer had been truly described the voice of childhood had never gladdened its flimsy structures the patter of restless little feet had never consecrated the one rugged highway between the two rows of tents and rough buildings later they would come but now yellowhammer was but a mountain camp and nowhere in it were the roguish expectant eyes opening wide at dawn of the enchanting day the eager small hands to reach for santa s bewildering hoard the elated childish voicings of the season s joy such as the coming good things of the warm hearted cherokee deserved of women there were five in yellowhammer the assayer s wife the proprietress of the lucky strike hotel and a laundress whose washtub panned out an ounce of dust a day these were the permanent feminines the remaining two were the spangler sisters misses fanchon and erma of the transcontinental comedy company then playing in repertoire at the improvised empire theatre but of children there were none sometimes miss fanchon enacted with spirit and address the part of robustious childhood but between her delineation and the visions of adolescence that the fancy offered as eligible recipients of cherokee s holiday stores there seemed to be fixed a gulf christmas would come on thursday on tuesday morning trinidad instead of going to work sought the judge at the lucky strike hotel it ll be a disgrace to yellowhammer said trinidad if it throws cherokee down on his christmas tree blowout you might say that that man made this town for one i m goin to see what can be done to give santa claus a square deal my co operation said the judge would be gladly forthcoming i am indebted to cherokee for past favours but i do not see i have heretofore regarded the absence of children rather as a luxury but in this instance still i do not see look at me said trinidad and you ll see old ways and means with the fur on i m goin to hitch up a team and rustle a load of kids for cherokee s santa claus act if i have to rob an orphan asylum eureka cried the judge enthusiastically no you didn t said trinidad decidedly i found it myself i learned about that latin word at school i will accompany you declared the judge waving his cane perhaps such eloquence and gift of language as i possess will be of benefit in persuading our young friends to lend themselves to our project within an hour yellowhammer was acquainted with the scheme of trinidad and the judge and approved it citizens who knew of families with offspring within a forty mile radius of yellowhammer came forward and contributed their information trinidad made careful notes of all such and then hastened to secure a vehicle and team the first stop scheduled was at a double log house fifteen miles out from yellowhammer a man opened the door at trinidad s hail and then came down and leaned upon the rickety gate the doorway was filled with a close mass of youngsters some ragged all full of curiosity and health it s this way explained trinidad we re from yellowhammer and we come kidnappin in a gentle kind of a way one of our leading citizens is stung with the santa claus affliction and he s due in town to morrow with half the folderols that s painted red and made in germany the youngest kid we got in yellowhammer packs a forty five and a safety razor consequently we re mighty shy on anybody to say oh and ah when we light the candles on the christmas tree now partner if you ll loan us a few kids we guarantee to return em safe and sound on christmas day and they ll come back loaded down with a good time and swiss family robinsons and cornucopias and red drums and similar testimonials what do you say in other words said the judge we have discovered for the first time in our embryonic but progressive little city the inconveniences of the absence of adolescence the season of the year having approximately arrived during which it is a custom to bestow frivolous but often appreciated gifts upon the young and tender i understand said the parent packing his pipe with a forefinger i guess i needn t detain you gentlemen me and the old woman have got seven kids so to speak and runnin my mind over the bunch i don t appear to hit upon none that we could spare for you to take over to your doin s the old woman has got some popcorn candy and rag dolls hid in the clothes chest and we allow to give christmas a little whirl of our own in a insignificant sort of style no i couldn t with any degree of avidity seem to fall in with the idea of lettin none of em go thank you kindly gentlemen down the slope they drove and up another foothill to the ranch house of wiley wilson trinidad recited his appeal and the judge boomed out his ponderous antiphony mrs wiley gathered her two rosy cheeked youngsters close to her skirts and did not smile until she had seen wiley laugh and shake his head again a refusal trinidad and the judge vainly exhausted more than half their list before twilight set in among the hills they spent the night at a stage road hostelry and set out again early the next morning the wagon had not acquired a single passenger it s creepin upon my faculties remarked trinidad that borrowin kids at christmas is somethin like tryin to steal butter from a man that s got hot pancakes a comin it is undoubtedly an indisputable fact said the judge that the ah family ties seem to be more coherent and assertive at that period of the year on the day before christmas they drove thirty miles making four fruitless halts and appeals everywhere they found kids at a premium the sun was low when the wife of a section boss on a lonely railroad huddled her unavailable progeny behind her and said there s a woman that s just took charge of the railroad eatin house down at granite junction i hear she s got a little boy maybe she might let him go trinidad pulled up his mules at granite junction at five o clock in the afternoon the train had just departed with its load of fed and appeased passengers on the steps of the eating house they found a thin and glowering boy of ten smoking a cigarette the dining room had been left in chaos by the peripatetic appetites a youngish woman reclined exhausted in a chair her face wore sharp lines of worry she had once possessed a certain style of beauty that would never wholly leave her and would never wholly return trinidad set forth his mission i d count it a mercy if you d take bobby for a while she said wearily i m on the go from morning till night and i don t have time to tend to him he s learning bad habits from the men it ll be the only chance he ll have to get any christmas the men went outside and conferred with bobby trinidad pictured the glories of the christmas tree and presents in lively colours and moreover my young friend added the judge santa claus himself will personally distribute the offerings that will typify the gifts conveyed by the shepherds of bethlehem to aw come off said the boy squinting his small eyes i ain t no kid there ain t any santa claus it s your folks that buys toys and sneaks em in when you re asleep and they make marks in the soot in the chimney with the tongs to look like santa s sleigh tracks that might be so argued trinidad but christmas trees ain t no fairy tale this one s goin to look like the ten cent store in albuquerque all strung up in a redwood there s tops and drums and noah s arks and oh rats said bobby wearily i cut them out long ago i d like to have a rifle not a target one a real one to shoot wildcats with but i guess you won t have any of them on your old tree well i can t say for sure said trinidad diplomatically it might be you go along with us and see the hope thus held out though faint won the boy s hesitating consent to go with this solitary beneficiary for cherokee s holiday bounty the canvassers spun along the homeward road in yellowhammer the empty storeroom had been transformed into what might have passed as the bower of an arizona fairy the ladies had done their work well a tall christmas tree covered to the topmost branch with candles spangles and toys sufficient for more than a score of children stood in the centre of the floor near sunset anxious eyes had begun to scan the street for the returning team of the child providers at noon that day cherokee had dashed into town with his new sleigh piled high with bundles and boxes and bales of all sizes and shapes so intent was he upon the arrangements for his altruistic plans that the dearth of children did not receive his notice no one gave away the humiliating state of yellowhammer for the efforts of trinidad and the judge were expected to supply the deficiency when the sun went down cherokee with many wings and arch grins on his seasoned face went into retirement with the bundle containing the santa claus raiment and a pack containing special and undisclosed gifts when the kids are rounded up he instructed the volunteer arrangement committee light up the candles on the tree and set em to playin pussy wants a corner and king william when they get good and at it why old santa ll slide in the door i reckon there ll be plenty of gifts to go round the ladies were flitting about the tree giving it final touches that were never final the spangled sisters were there in costume as lady violet de vere and marie the maid in their new drama the miner s bride the theatre did not open until nine and they were welcome assistants of the christmas tree committee every minute heads would pop out the door to look and listen for the approach of trinidad s team and now this became an anxious function for night had fallen and it would soon be necessary to light the candles on the tree and cherokee was apt to make an irruption at any time in his kriss kringle garb at length the wagon of the child rustlers rattled down the street to the door the ladies with little screams of excitement flew to the lighting of the candles the men of yellowhammer passed in and out restlessly or stood about the room in embarrassed groups trinidad and the judge bearing the marks of protracted travel entered conducting between them a single impish boy who stared with sullen pessimistic eyes at the gaudy tree where are the other children asked the assayer s wife the acknowledged leader of all social functions ma am said trinidad with a sigh prospectin for kids at christmas time is like huntin in a limestone for silver this parental business is one that i haven t no chance to comprehend it seems that fathers and mothers are willin for their offsprings to be drownded stole fed on poison oak and et by catamounts days in the year but on christmas day they insists on enjoyin the exclusive mortification of their company this here young biped ma am is all that washes out of our two days manoeuvres oh the sweet little boy cooed miss erma trailing her de vere robes to centre of stage aw shut up said bobby with a scowl who s a kid you ain t you bet fresh brat breathed miss erma beneath her enamelled smile we done the best we could said trinidad it s tough on cherokee but it can t be helped then the door opened and cherokee entered in the conventional dress of saint nick a white rippling beard and flowing hair covered his face almost to his dark and shining eyes over his shoulder he carried a pack no one stirred as he came in even the spangler sisters ceased their coquettish poses and stared curiously at the tall figure bobby stood with his hands in his pockets gazing gloomily at the effeminate and childish tree cherokee put down his pack and looked wonderingly about the room perhaps he fancied that a bevy of eager children were being herded somewhere to be loosed upon his entrance he went up to bobby and extended his red mittened hand merry christmas little boy said cherokee anything on the tree you want they ll get it down for you won t you shake hands with santa claus there ain t any santa claus whined the boy you ve got old false billy goat s whiskers on your face i ain t no kid what do i want with dolls and tin horses the driver said you d have a rifle and you haven t i want to go home trinidad stepped into the breach he shook cherokee s hand in warm greeting i m sorry cherokee he explained there never was a kid in yellowhammer we tried to rustle a bunch of em for your swaree but this sardine was all we could catch he s a atheist and he don t believe in santa claus it s a shame for you to be out all this truck but me and the judge was sure we could round up a wagonful of candidates for your gimcracks that s all right said cherokee gravely the expense don t amount to nothin worth mentionin we can dump the stuff down a shaft or throw it away i don t know what i was thinkin about but it never occurred to my cogitations that there wasn t any kids in yellowhammer meanwhile the company had relaxed into a hollow but praiseworthy imitation of a pleasure gathering bobby had retreated to a distant chair and was coldly regarding the scene with ennui plastered thick upon him cherokee lingering with his original idea went over and sat beside him where do you live little boy he asked respectfully granite junction said bobby without emphasis the room was warm cherokee took off his cap and then removed his beard and wig say exclaimed bobby with a show of interest i know your mug all right did you ever see me before asked cherokee i don t know but i ve seen your picture lots of times where the boy hesitated on the bureau at home he answered let s have your name if you please buddy robert lumsden the picture belongs to my mother she puts it under her pillow of nights and once i saw her kiss it i wouldn t but women are that way cherokee rose and beckoned to trinidad keep this boy by you till i come back he said i m goin to shed these christmas duds and hitch up my sleigh i m goin to take this kid home well infidel said trinidad taking cherokee s vacant chair and so you are too superannuated and effete to yearn for such mockeries as candy and toys it seems i don t like you said bobby with acrimony you said there would be a rifle a fellow can t even smoke i wish i was at home cherokee drove his sleigh to the door and they lifted bobby in beside him the team of fine horses sprang away prancingly over the hard snow cherokee had on his overcoat of baby sealskin the laprobe that he drew about them was as warm as velvet bobby slipped a cigarette from his pocket and was trying to snap a match throw that cigarette away said cherokee in a quiet but new voice bobby hesitated and then dropped the cylinder overboard throw the box too commanded the new voice more reluctantly the boy obeyed say said bobby presently i like you i don t know why nobody never made me do anything i didn t want to do before tell me kid said cherokee not using his new voice are you sure your mother kissed that picture that looks like me dead sure i seen her do it didn t you remark somethin a while ago about wanting a rifle you bet i did will you get me one to morrow silver mounted cherokee took out his watch half past nine we ll hit the junction plumb on time with christmas day are you cold sit closer son a chaparral prince nine o clock at last and the drudging toil of the day was ended lena climbed to her room in the third half story of the quarrymen s hotel since daylight she had slaved doing the work of a full grown woman scrubbing the floors washing the heavy ironstone plates and cups making the beds and supplying the insatiate demands for wood and water in that turbulent and depressing hostelry the din of the day s quarrying was over the blasting and drilling the creaking of the great cranes the shouts of the foremen the backing and shifting of the flat cars hauling the heavy blocks of limestone down in the hotel office three or four of the labourers were growling and swearing over a belated game of checkers heavy odours of stewed meat hot grease and cheap coffee hung like a depressing fog about the house lena lit the stump of a candle and sat limply upon her wooden chair she was eleven years old thin and ill nourished her back and limbs were sore and aching but the ache in her heart made the biggest trouble the last straw had been added to the burden upon her small shoulders they had taken away grimm always at night however tired she might be she had turned to grimm for comfort and hope each time had grimm whispered to her that the prince or the fairy would come and deliver her out of the wicked enchantment every night she had taken fresh courage and strength from grimm to whatever tale she read she found an analogy in her own condition the woodcutter s lost child the unhappy goose girl the persecuted stepdaughter the little maiden imprisoned in the witch s hut all these were but transparent disguises for lena the overworked kitchenmaid in the quarrymen s hotel and always when the extremity was direst came the good fairy or the gallant prince to the rescue so here in the ogre s castle enslaved by a wicked spell lena had leaned upon grimm and waited longing for the powers of goodness to prevail but on the day before mrs maloney had found the book in her room and had carried it away declaring sharply that it would not do for servants to read at night they lost sleep and did not work briskly the next day can one only eleven years old living away from one s mamma and never having any time to play live entirely deprived of grimm just try it once and you will see what a difficult thing it is lena s home was in texas away up among the little mountains on the pedernales river in a little town called fredericksburg they are all german people who live in fredericksburg of evenings they sit at little tables along the sidewalk and drink beer and play pinochle and scat they are very thrifty people thriftiest among them was peter hildesmuller lena s father and that is why lena was sent to work in the hotel at the quarries thirty miles away she earned three dollars every week there and peter added her wages to his well guarded store peter had an ambition to become as rich as his neighbour hugo heffelbauer who smoked a meerschaum pipe three feet long and had wiener schnitzel and hassenpfeffer for dinner every day in the week and now lena was quite old enough to work and assist in the accumulation of riches but conjecture if you can what it means to be sentenced at eleven years of age from a home in the pleasant little rhine village to hard labour in the ogre s castle where you must fly to serve the ogres while they devour cattle and sheep growling fiercely as they stamp white limestone dust from their great shoes for you to sweep and scour with your weak aching fingers and then to have grimm taken away from you lena raised the lid of an old empty case that had once contained canned corn and got out a sheet of paper and a piece of pencil she was going to write a letter to her mamma tommy ryan was going to post it for her at ballinger s tommy was seventeen worked in the quarries went home to ballinger s every night and was now waiting in the shadows under lena s window for her to throw the letter out to him that was the only way she could send a letter to fredericksburg mrs maloney did not like for her to write letters the stump of the candle was burning low so lena hastily bit the wood from around the lead of her pencil and began this is the letter she wrote dearest mamma i want so much to see you and gretel and claus and heinrich and little adolf i am so tired i want to see you to day i was slapped by mrs maloney and had no supper i could not bring in enough wood for my hand hurt she took my book yesterday i mean grimm s fairy tales which uncle leo gave me it did not hurt any one for me to read the book i try to work as well as i can but there is so much to do i read only a little bit every night dear mamma i shall tell you what i am going to do unless you send for me to morrow to bring me home i shall go to a deep place i know in the river and drown it is wicked to drown i suppose but i wanted to see you and there is no one else i am very tired and tommy is waiting for the letter you will excuse me mamma if i do it your respectful and loving daughter lena tommy was still waiting faithfully when the letter was concluded and when lena dropped it out she saw him pick it up and start up the steep hillside without undressing she blew out the candle and curled herself upon the mattress on the floor at o clock old man ballinger came out of his house in his stocking feet and leaned over the gate smoking his pipe he looked down the big road white in the moonshine and rubbed one ankle with the toe of his other foot it was time for the fredericksburg mail to come pattering up the road old man ballinger had waited only a few minutes when he heard the lively hoofbeats of fritz s team of little black mules and very soon afterward his covered spring wagon stood in front of the gate fritz s big spectacles flashed in the moonlight and his tremendous voice shouted a greeting to the postmaster of ballinger s the mail carrier jumped out and took the bridles from the mules for he always fed them oats at ballinger s while the mules were eating from their feed bags old man ballinger brought out the mail sack and threw it into the wagon fritz bergmann was a man of three sentiments or to be more accurate four the pair of mules deserving to be reckoned individually those mules were the chief interest and joy of his existence next came the emperor of germany and lena hildesmuller tell me said fritz when he was ready to start contains the sack a letter to frau hildesmuller from the little lena at the quarries one came in the last mail to say that she is a little sick already her mamma is very anxious to hear again yes said old man ballinger thar s a letter for mrs helterskelter or some sich name tommy ryan brung it over when he come her little gal workin over thar you say in the hotel shouted fritz as he gathered up the lines eleven years old and not bigger as a frankfurter the close fist of a peter hildesmuller some day i shall with a big club pound that man s dummkopf all in and out the town perhaps in this letter lena will say that she is yet feeling better so her mamma will be glad auf wiedersehen herr ballinger your feets will take cold out in the night air so long fritzy said old man ballinger you got a nice cool night for your drive up the road went the little black mules at their steady trot while fritz thundered at them occasional words of endearment and cheer these fancies occupied the mind of the mail carrier until he reached the big post oak forest eight miles from ballinger s here his ruminations were scattered by the sudden flash and report of pistols and a whooping as if from a whole tribe of indians a band of galloping centaurs closed in around the mail wagon one of them leaned over the front wheel covered the driver with his revolver and ordered him to stop others caught at the bridles of donder and blitzen donnerwetter shouted fritz with all his tremendous voice wass ist release your hands from dose mules ve vas der united states mail hurry up dutch drawled a melancholy voice don t you know when you re in a stick up reverse your mules and climb out of the cart it is due to the breadth of hondo bill s demerit and the largeness of his achievements to state that the holding up of the fredericksburg mail was not perpetrated by way of an exploit as the lion while in the pursuit of prey commensurate to his prowess might set a frivolous foot upon a casual rabbit in his path so hondo bill and his gang had swooped sportively upon the pacific transport of meinherr fritz the real work of their sinister night ride was over fritz and his mail bag and his mules came as gentle relaxation grateful after the arduous duties of their profession twenty miles to the southeast stood a train with a killed engine hysterical passengers and a looted express and mail car that represented the serious occupation of hondo bill and his gang with a fairly rich prize of currency and silver the robbers were making a wide detour to the west through the less populous country intending to seek safety in mexico by means of some fordable spot on the rio grande the booty from the train had melted the desperate bushrangers to jovial and happy skylarkers trembling with outraged dignity and no little personal apprehension fritz climbed out to the road after replacing his suddenly removed spectacles the band had dismounted and were singing capering and whooping thus expressing their satisfied delight in the life of a jolly outlaw rattlesnake rogers who stood at the heads of the mules jerked a little too vigorously at the rein of the tender mouthed donder who reared and emitted a loud protesting snort of pain instantly fritz with a scream of anger flew at the bulky rogers and began to assiduously pummel that surprised freebooter with his fists villain shouted fritz dog bigstiff dot mule he has a soreness by his mouth i vill knock off your shoulders mit your head robbermans yi yi howled rattlesnake roaring with laughter and ducking his head somebody git this here sour krout off n me one of the band yanked fritz back by the coat tail and the woods rang with rattlesnake s vociferous comments the dog goned little wienerwurst he yelled amiably he s not so much of a skunk for a dutchman took up for his animile plum quick didn t he i like to see a man like his hoss even if it is a mule the dad blamed little limburger he went for me didn t he whoa now muley i ain t a goin to hurt your mouth agin any more perhaps the mail would not have been tampered with had not ben moody the lieutenant possessed certain wisdom that seemed to promise more spoils say cap he said addressing hondo bill there s likely to be good pickings in these mail sacks i ve done some hoss tradin with these dutchmen around fredericksburg and i know the style of the varmints there s big money goes through the mails to that town them dutch risk a thousand dollars sent wrapped in a piece of paper before they d pay the banks to handle the money hondo bill six feet two gentle of voice and impulsive in action was dragging the sacks from the rear of the wagon before moody had finished his speech a knife shone in his hand and they heard the ripping sound as it bit through the tough canvas the outlaws crowded around and began tearing open letters and packages enlivening their labours by swearing affably at the writers who seemed to have conspired to confute the prediction of ben moody not a dollar was found in the fredericksburg mail you ought to be ashamed of yourself said hondo bill to the mail carrier in solemn tones to be packing around such a lot of old trashy paper as this what d you mean by it anyhow where do you dutchers keep your money at the ballinger mail sack opened like a cocoon under hondo s knife it contained but a handful of mail fritz had been fuming with terror and excitement until this sack was reached he now remembered lena s letter he addressed the leader of the band asking that that particular missive be spared much obliged dutch he said to the disturbed carrier i guess that s the letter we want got spondulicks in it ain t it here she is make a light boys hondo found and tore open the letter to mrs hildesmuller the others stood about lighting twisted up letters one from another hondo gazed with mute disapproval at the single sheet of paper covered with the angular german script whatever is this you ve humbugged us with dutchy you call this here a valuable letter that s a mighty low down trick to play on your friends what come along to help you distribute your mail that s chiny writin said sandy grundy peering over hondo s shoulder you re off your kazip declared another of the gang an effective youth covered with silk handkerchiefs and nickel plating that s shorthand i see em do it once in court ach no no no dot is german said fritz it is no more as a little girl writing a letter to her mamma one poor little girl sick and vorking hard avay from home ach it is a shame good mr robberman you vill please let me have dot letter what the devil do you take us for old pretzels said hondo with sudden and surprising severity you ain t presumin to insinuate that we gents ain t possessed of sufficient politeness for to take an interest in the miss s health are you now you go on and you read that scratchin out loud and in plain united states language to this here company of educated society hondo twirled his six shooter by its trigger guard and stood towering above the little german who at once began to read the letter translating the simple words into english the gang of rovers stood in absolute silence listening intently how old is that kid asked hondo when the letter was done eleven said fritz and where is she at at dose rock quarries working ach mein gott little lena she speak of drowning i do not know if she vill do it but if she shall i schwear i vill dot peter hildesmuller shoot mit a gun you dutchers said hondo bill his voice swelling with fine contempt make me plenty tired hirin out your kids to work when they ought to be playin dolls in the sand you re a hell of a sect of people i reckon we ll fix your clock for a while just to show what we think of your old cheesy nation here boys hondo bill parleyed aside briefly with his band and then they seized fritz and conveyed him off the road to one side here they bound him fast to a tree with a couple of lariats his team they tied to another tree near by we ain t going to hurt you bad said hondo reassuringly twon t hurt you to be tied up for a while we will now pass you the time of day as it is up to us to depart ausgespielt nixcumrous dutchy don t get any more impatience fritz heard a great squeaking of saddles as the men mounted their horses then a loud yell and a great clatter of hoofs as they galloped pell mell back along the fredericksburg road for more than two hours fritz sat against his tree tightly but not painfully bound then from the reaction after his exciting adventure he sank into slumber how long he slept he knew not but he was at last awakened by a rough shake hands were untying his ropes he was lifted to his feet dazed confused in mind and weary of body rubbing his eyes he looked and saw that he was again in the midst of the same band of terrible bandits they shoved him up to the seat of his wagon and placed the lines in his hands hit it out for home dutch said hondo bill s voice commandingly you ve given us lots of trouble and we re pleased to see the back of your neck spiel zwei bier vamoose hondo reached out and gave blitzen a smart cut with his quirt the little mules sprang ahead glad to be moving again fritz urged them along himself dizzy and muddled over

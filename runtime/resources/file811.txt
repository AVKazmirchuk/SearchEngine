sandwich tastes yancey to a hungry fisherman evidently the colonel did not believe the story of his lost wealth so goree retired again into brooding silence by late afternoon they had travelled ten of the twelve miles between bethel and laurel half a mile this side of laurel lay the old goree place a mile or two beyond the village lived the coltranes the road was now steep and laborious but the compensations were many the tilted aisles of the forest were opulent with leaf and bird and bloom the tonic air put to shame the pharma cop ia the glades were dark with mossy shade and bright with shy rivulets winking from the ferns and laurels on the lower side they viewed framed in the near foilage exquisite sketches of the far valley swooning in its opal haze coltrane was pleased to see that his companion was yielding to the spell of the hills and woods for now they had but to skirt the base of painter s cliff to cross elder branch and mount the hill beyond and goree would have to face the squandered home of his fathers every rock he passed every tree every foot of the rocky way was familiar to him though he hid forgotten the woods they thrilled him like the music of home sweet home they rounded the cliff decended into elder branch and paused there to let the horses drink and splash in the swift water on the right was a rail fence that cornered there and followed the road and stream inclosed by it was the old apple orchard of the home place the house was yet concealed by the brow of the steep hill inside and along the fence pokeberries elders sassafras and sumac grew high and dense at a rustle of their branches both goree and coltrane glanced up and saw a long yellow wolfish face above the fence staring at them with pale unwinking eyes the head quicky disappeared there was a violent swaying of the bushes and an ungainly figure ran up through the apple orchard in the direction of the house zigzagging among the trees that s garvey said coltrane the man you sold out to there s no doubt but he s considerably cracked i had to send him up for moonshining once several years ago in spite of the fact that i believed him irresponsible why what s the matter yancey goree was wiping his forehead and his face had lost its colour do i look queer too he asked trying to smile i m just remembering a few more things some of the alcohol had evaporated from his brain i recollect now where i got that two hundred dollars don t think of it said coltrane cheerfully later on we ll figure it all out together they rode out of the branch and when they reached the foot of the hill goree stopped again did you ever suspect i was a very vain kind of fellow colonel he asked sort of foolish proud about appearances the colonel s eyes refused to wander to the soiled sag ging suit of flax and the faded slouch hat it seems to me he replied mystified but humouring him i remember a young buck about twenty with the tightest coat the sleekest hair and the prancingest saddle horse in the blue ridge right you are said goree eagerly and it s in me yet though it don t show oh i m as vain as a turkey gobbler and as proud as lucifer i m going to ask you to indulge this weakness of mine in a little matter speak out yancey we ll create you duke of laurel and baron of blue ridge if you choose and you shall have a feather out of stella s peacock s tail to wear in your hat i m in earnest in a few minutes we ll pass the house up there on the hill where i was born and where my people have lived for nearly a century strangers live there now and look at me i am about to show myself to them ragged and poverty stricken a wastrel and a beggar colonel coltrane i m ashamed to do it i want you to let me wear your coat and hat until we are out of sight beyond i know you think it a foolish pride but i want to make as good a showing as i can when i pass the old place now what does this mean said coltrane to him self as he compared his companion s sane looks and quiet demeanour with his strange request but he was already unbuttoning the coat assenting readily as if the fancy were in no wise to be considered strange the coat and hat fitted goree well he buttoned the former about him with a look of satisfaction and dignity he and coltrane were nearly the same size rather tall portly and erect twenty five years were between them but in appearance they might have been brothers goree looked older than his age his face was puffy and lined the colonel had the smooth fresh complexion of a temperate liver he put on goree s disreputable old flax coat and faded slouch hat now said goree taking up the reins i m all right i want you to ride about ten feet in the rear as we go by colonel so that they can get a good look at me they ll see i m no back number yet by any means i guess i ll show up pretty well to them once more any how let s ride on he set out up the hill at a smart trot the colonel fol lowing as he had been requested goree sat straight in the saddle with head erect but his eyes were turned to the right sharply scanning every shrub and fence and hiding place in

a lonesome lady s hand by being on the spot to pick up her glove and be quick with her cloak when the wind blew the man i am to like best whoever he shall be must show his love in little ways he must never forget after hearing it once that i do not like to have any one walk at my left side that i detest bright colored neckties that i prefer to sit with my back to a light that i like candied violets that i must not be talked to when i am looking at the moonlight shining on water and that i very very often long for dates stuffed with english walnuts frivolity i said with a frown any well trained servant would be equal to such details and he must remember went on chloe to remind me of what i want when i do not know myself what i want you re rising in the scale i said what you seem to need is a first class clairvoyant and if i say that i am dying to hear a beethoven sonata and stamp my foot when i say it he must know by that that what my soul craves is salted almonds and he will have them ready in his pocket now said i i am at a loss i do not know whether your soul s affinity is to be an impresario or a fancy grocer chole turned her pearly smile upon me take less than half of what i said as a jest she went on and don t think too lightly of the little things boy be a paladin if you must but don t let it show on you most women are only very big children and most men are only very little ones please us don t try to overpower us when we want a hero we can make one out of even a plain grocer the third time he catches our handkerchief before it falls to the ground that evening i was taken down with pernicious fever that is a kind of coast fever with improvements and high geared attachments your temperature goes up among the threes and fours and remains there laughing scornfully and feverishly at the cinchona trees and the coal tar derivatives pernicious fever is a case for a simple mathematician instead of a doctor it is merely this formula vitality the desire to live the duration of the fever the result i took to my bed in the two roomed thatched hut where i had been comfortably established and sent for a gallon of rum that was not for myself drunk stamford was the best doctor between the andes and the pacific he came sat at my bedside and drank himself into condition my boy said he my lily white and reformed romeo medicine will do you no good but i will give you quinine which being bitter will arouse in you hatred and anger two stimulants that will add ten per cent to your chances you are as strong as a caribou calf and you will get well if the fever doesn t get in a knockout blow when you re off your guard for two weeks i lay on my back feeling like a hindoo widow on a burning ghat old atasca an untrained indian nurse sat near the door like a petrified statue of what s the use attending to her duties which were mainly to see that time went by without slipping a cog sometimes i would fancy myself back in the philippines or at worse times sliding off the horsehair sofa in sleepytown one afternoon i ordered atasca to vamose and got up and dressed carefully i took my temperature which i was pleased to find i paid almost dainty attention to my dress choosing solicitously a necktie of a dull and subdued hue the mirror showed that i was looking little the worse from my illness the fever gave brightness to my eyes and color to my face and while i looked at my reflection my color went and came again as i thought of chloe greene and the millions of eons that had passed since i d seen her and of louis devoe and the time he had gained on me i went straight to her house i seemed to float rather than walk i hardly felt the ground under my feet i thought pernicious fever must be a great boon to make one feel so strong i found chloe and louis devoe sitting under the awning in front of the house she jumped up and met me with a double handshake i m glad glad glad to see you out again she cried every word a pearl strung on the string of her sentence you are well tommy or better of course i wanted to come to see you but they wouldn t let me oh yes said i carelessly it was nothing merely a little fever i am out again as you see we three sat there and talked for half an hour or so then chloe looked out yearningly and almost piteously across the ocean i could see in her sea blue eyes some deep and intense desire devoe curse him saw it too what is it we asked in unison cocoanut pudding said chloe pathetically i ve wanted some oh so badly for two days it s got beyond a wish it s an obsession the cocoanut season is over said devoe in that voice of his that gave thrilling interest to his most commonplace words i hardly think one could be found in mojada the natives never use them except when they are green and the milk is fresh they sell all the ripe ones to the fruiterers wouldn t a broiled lobster or a welsh rabbit do as well i remarked with the engaging idiocy of a pernicious fever convalescent chloe came as near to pouting as a sweet disposition and a perfect profile would allow her to come the reverend homer poked his ermine lined face through the doorway and added a concordance to the conversation sometimes said he old campos keeps the dried nuts in his little store on the hill but it would be far better my daughter to restrain unusual desires and partake thankfully of the daily dishes that the lord has set before us stuff said i how was that asked the reverend homer sharply i say it s tough said i to drop into the vernacular that miss greene should be deprived of the food she desires a simple thing like kalsomine pudding perhaps i continued solicitously some pickled walnuts or a fricassee of hungarian butternuts would do as well every one looked at me with a slight exhibition of curiosity louis devoe arose and made his adieus i watched him until he had sauntered slowly and grandiosely to the corner around which he turned to reach his great warehouse and store chloe made her excuses and went inside for a few minutes to attend to some detail affecting the seven o clock dinner she was a passed mistress in housekeeping i had tasted her puddings and bread with beatitude when all had gone i turned casually and saw a basket made of plaited green withes hanging by a nail outside the door jamb with a rush that made my hot temples throb there came vividly to my mind recollections of the head hunters those grim flinty relentless little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed presence from time to time as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move him one creeps forth with his snickersnee and takes up the silent trail back he comes triumphant bearing the severed gory head of his victim his particular brown or white maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft tiger s eyes at the evidence of his love for her i stole softly from the house and returned to my hut from its supporting nails in the wall i took a machete as heavy as a butcher s cleaver and sharper than a safety razor and then i chuckled softly to myself and set out to the fastidiously appointed private office of monsieur louis devoe usurper to the hand of the pearl of the pacific he was never slow at thinking he gave one look at my face and another at the weapon in my hand as i entered his door and then he seemed to fade from my sight i ran to the back door kicked it open and saw him running like a deer up the road toward the wood that began two hundred yards away i was after him with a shout i remember hearing children and women screaming and seeing them flying from the road he was fleet but i was stronger a mile and i had almost come up with him he doubled cunningly and dashed into a brake that extended into a small canon i crashed through this after him and in five minutes had him cornered in an angle of insurmountable cliffs there his instinct of self preservation steadied him as it will steady even animals at bay he turned to me quite calm with a ghastly smile oh rayburn he said with such an awful effort at ease that i was impolite enough to laugh rudely in his face oh rayburn said he come let s have done with this nonsense of course i know it s the fever and you re not yourself but collect yourself man give me that ridiculous weapon now and let s go back and talk it over i will go back said i carrying your head with me we will see how charmingly it can discourse when it lies in the basket at her door come said he persuasively i think better of you than to suppose that you try this sort of thing as a joke but even the vagaries of a fever crazed lunatic come some time to a limit what is this talk about heads and baskets get yourself together and throw away that absurd cane chopper what would miss greene think of you he ended with the silky cajolery that one would use toward a fretful child listen said i at last you have struck upon the right note what would she think of me listen i repeated there are women i said who look upon horsehair sofas and currant wine as dross to them even the calculated modulation of your well trimmed talk sounds like the dropping of rotten plums from a tree in the night they are the maidens who walk back and forth in the villages scorning the emptiness of the baskets at the doors of the young men who would win them one such as they i said is waiting only a fool would try to win a woman by drooling like a braggart in her doorway or by waiting upon her whims like a footman they are all daughters of herodias and to gain their hearts one must lay the heads of his enemies before them with his own hands now bend your neck louis devoe do not be a coward as well as a chatterer at a lady s tea table there there said devoe falteringly you know me don t you rayburn oh yes i said i know you i know you i know you but the basket is empty the old men of the village and the young men and both the dark maidens and the ones who are as fair as pearls walk back and forth and see its emptiness will you kneel now or must we have a scuffle it is not like you to make things go roughly and with bad form but the basket is waiting for your head with that he went to pieces i had to catch him as he tried to scamper past me like a scared rabbit i stretched him out and got a foot on his chest but he squirmed like a worm although i appealed repeatedly to his sense of propriety and the duty he owed to himself as a gentleman not to make a row but at last he gave me the chance and i swung the machete it was not hard work he flopped like a chicken during the six or seven blows that it took to sever his head but finally he lay still and i tied his head in my handkerchief the eyes opened and shut thrice while i walked a hundred yards i was red to my feet with the drip but what did that matter with delight i felt under my hands the crisp touch of his short thick brown hair and close trimmed beard i reached the house of the greenes and dumped the head of louis devoe into the basket that still hung by the nail in the door jamb i sat in a chair under the awning and waited the sun was within two hours of setting chloe came out and looked surprised where have you been tommy she asked you were gone when i came out look in the basket i said rising to my feet she looked and gave a little scream of delight i was pleased to note oh tommy she said it was just what i wanted you to do it s leaking a little but that doesn t matter wasn t i telling you it s the little things that count and you remembered little things she held the ensanguined head of louis devoe in her white apron tiny streams of red widened on her apron and dripped upon the floor her face was bright and tender little things indeed i thought again the head hunters are right these are the things that women like you to do for them chloe came close to me there was no one in sight she looked tip at me with sea blue eyes that said things they had never said before you think of me she said you are the man i was describing you think of the little things and they are what make the world worth living in the man for me must consider my little wishes and make me happy in small ways he must bring me little red peaches in december if i wish for them and then i will love him till june i will have no knight in armor slaying his rival or killing dragons for me you please me very well tommy i stooped and kissed her then a moisture broke out on my forehead and i began to feel weak i saw the red stains vanish from chloe s apron and the head of louis devoe turn to a brown dried cocoanut there will be cocoanut pudding for dinner tommy boy said chloe gayly and you must come i must go in for a little while she vanished in a delightful flutter dr stamford tramped up hurriedly he seized my pulse as though it were his own property that i had escaped with you are the biggest fool outside of any asylum he said angrily why did you leave your bed and the idiotic things you ve been doing and no wonder with your pulse going like a sledge hammer name some of them said i devoe sent for me said stamford he saw you from his window go to old campos store chase him up the hill with his own yardstick and then come back and make off with his biggest cocoanut it s the little things that count after all said i it s your little bed that counts with you just now said the doctor you come with me at once or i ll throw up the case you re as loony as a loon so i got no cocoanut pudding that evening but i conceived a distrust as to the value of the method of the head hunters perhaps for many centuries the maidens of the villages may have been looking wistfully at the heads in the baskets at the doorways longing for other and lesser trophies no story to avoid having this book hurled into corner of the room by the suspicious reader i will assert in time that this is not a newspaper story you will encounter no shirt sleeved omniscient city editor no prodigy cub reporter just off the farm no scoop no story no anything but if you will concede me the setting of the first scene in the reporters room of the morning beacon i will repay the favor by keeping strictly my promises set forth above i was doing space work on the beacon hoping to be put on a salary some one had cleared with a rake or a shovel a small space for me at the end of a long table piled high with exchanges congressional records and old files there i did my work i wrote whatever the city whispered or roared or chuckled to me on my diligent wanderings about its streets my income was not regular one day tripp came in and leaned on my table tripp was something in the mechanical department i think he had something to do with the pictures for he smelled of photographers supplies and his hands were always stained and cut up with acids he was about twenty five and looked forty half of his face was covered with short curly red whiskers that looked like a door mat with the welcome left off he was pale and unhealthy and miserable and fawning and an assiduous borrower of sums ranging from twenty five cents to a dollar one dollar was his limit he knew the extent of his credit as well as the chemical national bank knows the amount of h that collateral will show on analysis when he sat on my table he held one hand with the other to keep both from shaking whiskey he had a spurious air of lightness and bravado about him that deceived no one but was useful in his borrowing because it was so pitifully and perceptibly assumed this day i had coaxed from the cashier five shining silver dollars as a grumbling advance on a story that the sunday editor had reluctantly accepted so if i was not feeling at peace with the world at least an armistice had been declared and i was beginning with ardor to write a description of the brooklyn bridge by moonlight well tripp said i looking up at him rather impatiently how goes it he was looking to day more miserable more cringing and haggard and downtrodden than i had ever seen him he was at that stage of misery where he drew your pity so fully that you longed to kick him have you got a dollar asked tripp with his most fawning look and his dog like eyes that blinked in the narrow space between his high growing matted beard and his low growing matted hair i have said i and again i said i have more loudly and inhospitably and four besides and i had hard work corkscrewing them out of old atkinson i can tell you and i drew them i continued to meet a want a hiatus a demand a need an exigency a requirement of exactly five dollars i was driven to emphasis by the premonition that i was to lose one of the dollars on the spot i don t want to borrow any said tripp and i breathed again i thought you d like to get put onto a good story he went on i ve got a rattling fine one for you you ought to make it run a column at least it ll make a dandy if you work it up right it ll probably cost you a dollar or two to get the stuff i don t want anything out of it myself i became placated the proposition showed that tripp appreciated past favors although he did not return them if he had been wise enough to strike me for a quarter then he would have got it what is the story i asked poising my pencil with a finely calculated editorial air i ll tell you said tripp it s a girl a beauty one of the howlingest amsden s junes you ever saw rosebuds covered with dew violets in their mossy bed and truck like that she s lived on long island twenty years and never saw new york city before i ran against her on thirty fourth street she d just got in on the east river ferry i tell you she s a beauty that would take the hydrogen out of all the peroxides in the world she stopped me on the street and asked me where she could find george brown asked me where she could find george brown in new york city what do you think of that i talked to her and found that she was going to marry a young farmer named dodd hiram dodd next week but it seems that george brown still holds the championship in her youthful fancy george had greased his cowhide boots some years ago and came to the city to make his fortune but he forgot to remember to show up again at greenburg and hiram got in as second best choice but when it comes to the scratch ada her name s ada lowery saddles a nag and rides eight miles to the railroad station and catches the a m train for the city looking for george you know you understand about women george wasn t there so she wanted him well you know i couldn t leave her loose in wolftown on the hudson i suppose she thought the first person she inquired of would say george brown why yes lemme see he s a short man with light blue eyes ain t he oh yes you ll find george on one hundred and twenty fifth street right next to the grocery he s bill clerk in a saddle and harness store that s about how innocent and beautiful she is you know those little long island water front villages like greenburg a couple of duck farms for sport and clams and about nine summer visitors for industries that s the kind of a place she comes from but say you ought to see her what could i do i don t know what money looks like in the morning and she d paid her last cent of pocket money for her railroad ticket except a quarter which she had squandered on gum drops she was eating them out of a paper bag i took her to a boarding house on thirty second street where i used to live and hocked her she s in soak for a dollar that s old mother mcginnis price per day i ll show you the house what words are these tripp said i i thought you said you had a story every ferryboat that crosses the east river brings or takes away girls from long island the premature lines on tripp s face grew deeper he frowned seriously from his tangle of hair he separated his hands and emphasized his answer with one shaking forefinger can t you see he said what a rattling fine story it would make you could do it fine all about the romance you know and describe the girl and put a lot of stuff in it about true love and sling in a few stickfuls of funny business joshing the long islanders about being green and well you know how to do it you ought to get fifteen dollars out of it anyhow and it ll cost you only about four dollars you ll make a clear profit of eleven how will it cost me four dollars i asked suspiciously one dollar to mrs mcginnis tripp answered promptly and two dollars to pay the girl s fare back home and the fourth dimension i inquired making a rapid mental calculation one dollar to me said tripp for whiskey are you on i smiled enigmatically and spread my elbows as if to begin writing again but this grim abject specious subservient burr like wreck of a man would not be shaken off his forehead suddenly became shiningly moist don t you see he said with a sort of desperate calmness that this girl has got to be sent home to day not to night nor to morrow but to day i can t do anything for her you know i m the janitor and corresponding secretary of the down and out club i thought you could make a newspaper story out of it and win out a piece of money on general results but anyhow don t you see that she s got to get back home before night and then i began to feel that dull leaden soul depressing sensation known as the sense of duty why should that sense fall upon one as a weight and a burden i knew that i was doomed that day to give up the bulk of my store of hard wrung coin to the relief of this ada lowery but i swore to myself that tripp s whiskey dollar would not be forthcoming he might play knight errant at my expense but he would indulge in no wassail afterward commemorating my weakness and gullibility in a kind of chilly anger i put on my coat and hat tripp submissive cringing vainly endeavoring to please conducted me via the street cars to the human pawn shop of mother mcginnis i paid the fares it seemed that the collodion scented don quixote and the smallest minted coin were strangers tripp pulled the bell at the door of the mouldly red brick boarding house at its faint tinkle he paled and crouched as a rabbit makes ready to spring away at the sound of a hunting dog i guessed what a life he had led terror haunted by the coming footsteps of landladies give me one of the dollars quick he said the door opened six inches mother mcginnis stood there with white eyes they were white i say and a yellow face holding together at her throat with one hand a dingy pink flannel dressing sack tripp thrust the dollar through the space without a word and it bought us entry she s in the parlor said the mcginnis turning the back of her sack upon us in the dim parlor a girl sat at the cracked marble centre table weeping comfortably and eating gum drops she was a flawless beauty crying had only made her brilliant eyes brighter when she crunched a gum drop you thought only of the poetry of motion and envied the senseless confection eve at the age of five minutes must have been a ringer for miss ada lowery at nineteen or twenty i was introduced and a gum drop suffered neglect while she conveyed to me a naive interest such as a puppy dog a prize winner might bestow upon a crawling beetle or a frog tripp took his stand by the table with the fingers of one hand spread upon it as an attorney or a master of ceremonies might have stood but he looked the master of nothing his faded coat was buttoned high as if it sought to be charitable to deficiencies of tie and linen i thought of a scotch terrier at the sight of his shifty eyes in the glade between his tangled hair and beard for one ignoble moment i felt ashamed of having been introduced as his friend in the presence of so much beauty in distress but evidently tripp meant to conduct the ceremonies whatever they might be i thought i detected in his actions and pose an intention of foisting the situation upon me as material for a newspaper story in a lingering hope of extracting from me his whiskey dollar my friend i shuddered mr chalmers said tripp will tell you miss lowery the same that i did he s a reporter and he can hand out the talk better than i can that s why i brought him with me tripp wasn t it the silver tongued orator you wanted he s wise to a lot of things and he ll tell you now what s best to do i stood on one foot as it were as i sat in my rickety chair why er miss lowery i began secretly enraged at tripp s awkward opening i am at your service of course but er as i haven t been apprized of the circumstances of the case i er oh said miss lowery beaming for a moment it ain t as bad as that there ain t any circumstances it s the first time i ve ever been in new york except once when i was five years old and i had no idea it was such a big town and i met mr mr snip on the street and asked him about a friend of mine and he brought me here and asked me to wait i advise you miss lowery said tripp to tell mr chalmers all he s a friend of mine i was getting used to it by this time and he ll give you the right tip why certainly said miss ada chewing a gum drop toward me there ain t anything to tell except that well everything s fixed for me to marry hiram dodd next thursday evening hi has got two hundred acres of land with a lot of shore front and one of the best truck farms on the island but this morning i had my horse saddled up he s a white horse named dancer and i rode over to the station i told em at home i was going to spend the day with susie adams it was a story i guess but i don t care and i came to new york on the train and i met mr mr flip on the street and asked him if he knew where i could find g g now miss lowery broke in tripp loudly and with much bad taste i thought as she hesitated with her word you like this young man hiram dodd don t you he s all right and good to you ain t he of course i like him said miss lowery emphatically hi s all right and of course he s good to me so is everybody i could have sworn it myself throughout miss ada lowery s life all men would be to good to her they would strive contrive struggle and compete to hold umbrellas over her hat check her trunk pick up her handkerchief buy for her soda at the fountain but went on miss lowery last night got to thinking about g george and i down went the bright gold head upon dimpled clasped hands on the table such a beautiful april storm unrestrainedly sobbed i wished i could have comforted her but i was not george and i was glad i was not hiram and yet i was sorry too by and by the shower passed she straightened up brave and half way smiling she would have made a splendid wife for crying only made her eyes more bright and tender she took a gum drop and began her story i guess i m a terrible hayseed she said between her little gulps and sighs but i can t help it g george brown and i were sweet hearts since he was eight and i was five when he was nineteen that was four years ago he left greenburg and went to the city he said he was going to be a policeman or a railroad president or something and then he was coming back for me but i never heard from him any more and i i liked him another flow of tears seemed imminent but tripp hurled himself into the crevasse and dammed it confound him i could see his game he was trying to make a story of it for his sordid ends and profit go on mr chalmers said he and tell the lady what s the proper caper that s what i told her you d hand it to her straight spiel up i coughed and tried to feel less wrathful toward tripp i saw my duty cunningly i had been inveigled but i was securely trapped tripp s first dictum to me had been just and correct the young lady must be sent back to greenburg that day she must be argued with convinced assured instructed ticketed and returned without delay i hated hiram and despised george but duty must be done noblesse oblige and only five silver dollars are not strictly romantic compatibles but sometimes they can be made to jibe it was mine to be sir oracle and then pay the freight so i assumed an air that mingled solomon s with that of the general passenger agent of the long island railroad miss lowery said i as impressively as i could life is rather a queer proposition after all there was a familiar sound to these words after i had spoken them and i hoped miss lowery had never heard mr cohan s song those whom we first love we seldom wed our earlier romances tinged with the magic radiance of youth often fail to materialize the last three words sounded somewhat trite when they struck the air but those fondly cherished dreams i went on may cast a pleasant afterglow on our future lives however impracticable and vague they may have been but life is full of realities as well as visions and dreams one cannot live on memories may i ask miss lowery if you think you could pass a happy that is a contented and harmonious life with mr er dodd if in other ways than romantic recollections he seems to er fill the bill as i might say oh hi s all right answered miss lowery yes i could get along with him fine he s promised me an automobile and a motor boat but somehow when it got so close to the time i was to marry him i couldn t help wishing well just thinking about george something must have happened to him or he d have written on the day he left he and me got a hammer and a chisel and cut a dime into two pieces i took one piece and he took the other and we promised to be true to each other and always keep the pieces till we saw each other again i ve got mine at home now in a ring box in the top drawer of my dresser i guess i was silly to come up here looking for him i never realized what a big place it is and then tripp joined in with a little grating laugh that he had still trying to drag in a little story or drama to earn the miserable dollar that he craved oh the boys from the country forget a lot when they come to the city and learn something i guess george maybe is on the bum or got roped in by some other girl or maybe gone to the dogs on account of whiskey or the races you listen to mr chalmers and go back home and you ll be all right but now the time was come for action for the hands of the clock were moving close to noon frowning upon tripp i argued gently and philosophically with miss lowery delicately convincing her of the importance of returning home at once and i impressed upon her the truth that it would not be absolutely necessary to her future happiness that she mention to hi the wonders or the fact of her visit to the city that had swallowed up the unlucky george she said she had left her horse unfortunate rosinante tied to a tree near the railroad station tripp and i gave her instructions to mount the patient steed as soon as she arrived and ride home as fast as possible there she was to recount the exciting adventure of a day spent with susie adams she could fix susie i was sure of that and all would be well and then being susceptible to the barbed arrows of beauty i warmed to the adventure the three of us hurried to the ferry and there i found the price of a ticket to greenburg to be but a dollar and eighty cents i bought one and a red red rose with the twenty cents for miss lowery we saw her aboard her ferryboat and stood watching her wave her handkerchief at us until it was the tiniest white patch imaginable and then tripp and i faced each other brought back to earth left dry and desolate in the shade of the sombre verities of life the spell wrought by beauty and romance was dwindling i looked at tripp and almost sneered he looked more careworn contemptible and disreputable than ever i fingered the two silver dollars remaining in my pocket and looked at him with the half closed eyelids of contempt he mustered up an imitation of resistance can t you get a story out of it he asked huskily some sort of a story even if you have to fake part of it not a line said i i can fancy the look on grimes face if i should try to put over any slush like this but we ve helped the little lady out and that ll have to be our only reward i m sorry said tripp almost inaudibly i m sorry you re out your money now it seemed to me like a find of a big story you know that is a sort of thing that would write up pretty well let s try to forget it said i with a praiseworthy attempt at gayety and take the next car cross town i steeled myself against his unexpressed but palpable desire he should not coax cajole or wring from me the dollar he craved i had had enough of that wild goose chase tripp feebly unbuttoned his coat of the faded pattern and glossy seams to reach for something that had once been a handkerchief deep down in some obscure and cavernous pocket as he did so i caught the shine of a cheap silver plated watch chain across his vest and something dangling from it caused me to stretch forth my hand and seize it curiously it was the half of a silver dime that had been cut in halves with a chisel what i said looking at him keenly oh yes he responded dully george brown alias tripp what s the use barring the w c t u i d like to know if anybody disapproves of my having produced promptly from my pocket tripp s whiskey dollar and unhesitatingly laying it in his hand the higher pragmatism i where to go for wisdom has become a question of serious import the ancients are discredited plato is boiler

let us rather gather wisdom but how to do so requires knowledge if we know a thing we know it but very often we are not wise to it that we are wise and but let s go on with the story ii once upon a time i found a ten cent magazine lying on a bench in a little city park anyhow that was the amount he asked me for when i sat on the bench next to him he was a musty dingy and tattered magazine with some queer stories bound in him i was sure he turned out to be a scrap book i am a newspaper reporter i said to him to try him i have been detailed to write up some of the experiences of the unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in this park may i ask you to what you attribute your downfall in i was interrupted by a laugh from my purchase a laugh so rusty and unpractised that i was sure it had been his first for many a day oh no no said he you ain t a reporter reporters don t talk that way they pretend to be one of us and say they ve just got in on the blind baggage from st louis i can tell a reporter on sight us park bums get to be fine judges of human nature we sit here all day and watch the people go by i can size up anybody who walks past my bench in a way that would surprise you well i said go on and tell me how do you size me up i should say said the student of human nature with unpardonable hesitation that you was say in the contracting business or maybe worked in a store or was a sign painter you stopped in the park to finish your cigar and thought you d get a little free monologue out of me still you might be a plasterer or a lawyer it s getting kind of dark you see and your wife won t let you smoke at home i frowned gloomily but judging again went on the reader of men i d say you ain t got a wife no said i rising restlessly no no no i ain t but i will have by the arrows of cupid that is if my voice must have trailed away and muffled itself in uncertainty and despair i see you have a story yourself said the dusty vagrant impudently it seemed to me suppose you take your dime back and spin your yarn for me i m interested myself in the ups and downs of unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in the park somehow that amused me i looked at the frowsy derelict with more interest i did have a story why not tell it to him i had told none of my friends i had always been a reserved and bottled up man it was psychical timidity or sensitiveness perhaps both and i smiled to myself in wonder when i felt an impulse to confide in this stranger and vagabond jack said i mack said he mack said i i ll tell you do you want the dime back in advance said he i handed him a dollar the dime said i was the price of listening to your story right on the point of the jaw said he go on and then incredible as it may seem to the lovers in the world who confide their sorrows only to the night wind and the gibbous moon i laid bare my secret to that wreck of all things that you would have supposed to be in sympathy with love i told him of the days and weeks and months that i had spent in adoring mildred telfair i spoke of my despair my grievous days and wakeful nights my dwindling hopes and distress of mind i even pictured to this night prowler her beauty and dignity the great sway she had in society and the magnificence of her life as the elder daughter of an ancient race whose pride overbalanced the dollars of the city s millionaires why don t you cop the lady out asked mack bringing me down to earth and dialect again i explained to him that my worth was so small my income so minute and my fears so large that i hadn t the courage to speak to her of my worship i told him that in her presence i could only blush and stammer and that she looked upon me with a wonderful maddening smile of amusement she kind of moves in the professional class don t she asked mack the telfair family i began haughtily i mean professional beauty said my hearer she is greatly and widely admired i answered cautiously any sisters one you know any more girls why several i answered and a few others say said mack tell me one thing can you hand out the dope to other girls can you chin em and make matinee eyes at em and squeeze em you know what i mean you re just shy when it comes to this particular dame the professional beauty ain t that right in a way you have outlined the situation with approximate truth i admitted i thought so said mack grimly now that reminds me of my own case i ll tell you about it i was indignant but concealed it what was this loafer s case or anybody s case compared with mine besides i had given him a dollar and ten cents feel my muscle said my companion suddenly flexing his biceps i did so mechanically the fellows in gyms are always asking you to do that his arm was as hard as cast iron four years ago said mack i could lick any man in new york outside of the professional ring your case and mine is just the same i come from the west side between thirtieth and fourteenth i won t give the number on the door i was a scrapper when i was ten and when i was twenty no amateur in the city could stand up four rounds with me s a fact you know bill mccarty no he managed the smokers for some of them swell clubs well i knocked out everything bill brought up before me i was a middle weight but could train down to a welter when necessary i boxed all over the west side at bouts and benefits and private entertainments and was never put out once but say the first time i put my foot in the ring with a professional i was no more than a canned lobster i dunno how it was i seemed to lose heart i guess i got too much imagination there was a formality and publieness about it that kind of weakened my nerve i never won a fight in the ring light weights and all kinds of scrubs used to sign up with my manager and then walk up and tap me on the wrist and see me fall the minute i seen the crowd and a lot of gents in evening clothes down in front and seen a professional come inside the ropes i got as weak as ginger ale of course it wasn t long till i couldn t get no backers and i didn t have any more chances to fight a professional or many amateurs either but lemme tell you i was as good as most men inside the ring or out it was just that dumb dead feeling i had when i was up against a regular that always done me up well sir after i had got out of the business i got a mighty grouch on i used to go round town licking private citizens and all kinds of unprofessionals just to please myself i d lick cops in dark streets and car conductors and cab drivers and draymen whenever i could start a row with em it didn t make any difference how big they were or how much science they had i got away with em if i d only just have had the confidence in the ring that i had beating up the best men outside of it i d be wearing black pearls and heliotrope silk socks to day one evening i was walking along near the bowery thinking about things when along comes a slumming party about six or seven they was all in swallowtails and these silk hats that don t shine one of the gang kind of shoves me off the sidewalk i hadn t had a scrap in three days and i just says de lighted and hits him back of the ear well we had it that johnnie put up as decent a little fight as you d want to see in the moving pictures it was on a side street and no cops around the other guy had a lot of science but it only took me about six minutes to lay him out some of the swallowtails dragged him up against some steps and began to fan him another one of em comes over to me and says young man do you know what you ve done oh beat it says i i ve done nothing but a little punching bag work take freddy back to yale and tell him to quit studying sociology on the wrong side of the sidewalk my good fellow says he i don t know who you are but i d like to you ve knocked out reddy burns the champion middle weight of the world he came to new york yesterday to try to get a match on with jim jeifries if you but when i come out of my faint i was laying on the floor in a drug store saturated with aromatic spirits of ammonia if i d known that was reddy burns i d have got down in the gutter and crawled past him instead of handing him one like i did why if i d ever been in a ring and seen him climbing over the ropes i d have been all to the sal volatile so that s what imagination does concluded mack and as i said your case and mine is simultaneous you ll never win out you can t go up against the professionals i tell you it s a park bench for yours in this romance business mack the pessimist laughed harshly i m afraid i don t see the parallel i said coldly i have only a very slight acquaintance with the prize ring the derelict touched my sleeve with his forefinger for emphasis as he explained his parable every man said he with some dignity has got his lamps on something that looks good to him with you it s this dame that you re afraid to say your say to with me it was to win out in the ring well you ll lose just like i did why do you think i shall lose i asked warmly cause said he you re afraid to go in the ring you dassen t stand up before a professional your case and mine is just the same you re a amateur and that means that you d better keep outside of the ropes well i must be going i said rising and looking with elaborate care at my watch when i was twenty feet away the park bencher called to me much obliged for the dollar he said and for the dime but you ll never get er you re in the amateur class serves you right i said to myself for hobnobbing with a tramp his impudence but as i walked his words seemed to repeat themselves over and over again in my brain i think i even grew angry at the man i ll show him i finally said aloud i ll show him that i can fight reddy burns too even knowing who he is i hurried to a telephone booth and rang up the telfair residence a soft sweet voice answered didn t i know that voice my hand holding the receiver shook is that you said i employing the foolish words that form the vocabulary of every talker through the telephone yes this is i came back the answer in the low clear cut tones that are an inheritance of the telfairs who is it please it s me said i less ungrammatically than egotistically it s me and i ve got a few things that i want to say to you right now and immediately and straight to the point dear me said the voice oh it s you mr arden i wondered if any accent on the first word was intended mildred was fine at saying things that you had to study out afterward yes said i i hope so and now to come down to brass tacks i thought that rather a vernacularism if there is such a word as soon as i had said it but i didn t stop to apologize you know of course that i love you and that i have been in that idiotic state for a long time i don t want any more foolish ness about it that is i mean i want an answer from you right now will you marry me or not hold the wire please keep out central hello hello will you or will you not that was just the uppercut for reddy burns chin the answer came back why phil dear of course i will i didn t know that you that is you never said oh come up to the house please i can t say what i want to over the phone you are so importunate but please come up to the house won t you would i i rang the bell of the telfair house violently some sort of a human came to the door and shooed me into the drawing room oh well said i to myself looking at the ceiling any one can learn from any one that was a pretty good philosophy of mack s anyhow he didn t take advantage of his experience but i get the benefit of it if you want to get into the professional class you ve got to i stopped thinking then some one was coming down the stairs my knees began to shake i knew then how mack had felt when a professional began to climb over the ropes i looked around foolishly for a door or a window by which i might escape if it had been any other girl approaching i mightn t have but just then the door opened and bess mildred s younger sister came in i d never seen her look so much like a glorified angel she walked straight tip to me and and i d never noticed before what perfectly wonderful eyes and hair elizabeth telfair had phil she said in the telfair sweet thrilling tones why didn t you tell me about it before i thought it was sister you wanted all the time until you telephoned to me a few minutes ago i suppose mack and i always will be hopeless amateurs but as the thing has turned out in my case i m mighty glad of it best seller i one day last summer i went to pittsburgh well i had to go there on business my chair car was profitably well filled with people of the kind one usually sees on chair cars most of them were ladies in brown silk dresses cut with square yokes with lace insertion and dotted veils who refused to have the windows raised then there was the usual number of men who looked as if they might be in almost any business and going almost anywhere some students of human nature can look at a man in a pullman and tell you where he is from his occupation and his stations in life both flag and social but i never could the only way i can correctly judge a fellow traveller is when the train is held up by robbers or when he reaches at the same time i do for the last towel in the dressing room of the sleeper the porter came and brushed the collection of soot on the window sill off to the left knee of my trousers i removed it with an air of apology the temperature was eighty eight one of the dotted veiled ladies demanded the closing of two more ventilators and spoke loudly of interlaken i leaned back idly in chair no and looked with the tepidest curiosity at the small black bald spotted head just visible above the back of no suddenly no hurled a book to the floor between his chair and the window and looking i saw that it was the rose lady and trevelyan one of the best selling novels of the present day and then the critic or philistine whichever he was veered his chair toward the window and i knew him at once for john a pescud of pittsburgh travelling salesman for a plate glass company an old acquaintance whom i had not seen in two years in two minutes we were faced had shaken hands and had finished with such topics as rain prosperity health residence and destination politics might have followed next but i was not so ill fated i wish you might know john a pescud he is of the stuff that heroes are not often lucky enough to be made of he is a small man with a wide smile and an eye that seems to be fixed upon that little red spot on the end of your nose i never saw him wear but one kind of necktie and he believes in cuff holders and button shoes he is as hard and true as anything ever turned out by the cambria steel works and he believes that as soon as pittsburgh makes smoke consumers compulsory st peter will come down and sit at the foot of smithfield street and let somebody else attend to the gate up in the branch heaven he believes that our plate glass is the most important commodity in the world and that when a man is in his home town he ought to be decent and law abiding during my acquaintance with him in the city of diurnal night i had never known his views on life romance literature and ethics we had browsed during our meetings on local topics and then parted after chateau margaux irish stew flannel cakes cottage pudding and coffee hey there with milk separate now i was to get more of his ideas by way of facts he told me that business had picked up since the party conventions and that he was going to get off at coketown ii say said pescud stirring his discarded book with the toe of his right shoe did

culture and my good friend his father kept a general store in a little town called hosea pettit had been raised in the pine woods and broom sedge fields adjacent thereto he had in his gripsack two manuscript novels of the adventures in picardy of one gaston laboulaye vicompte de montrepos in the year that s nothing we all do that and some day when we make a hit with the little sketch about a newsy and his lame dog the editor prints the other one for us or on us as the say ing is and then and then we have to get a big valise and peddle those patent air draft gas burners at everybody should have em i took pettit to the red brick house which was to appear in an article entitled literary landmarks of old new york some day when we got through with it he engaged a room there drawing on the general store for his expenses i showed new york to him and he did not mention how much narrower broadway is than lee avenue in hosea this seemed a good sign so i put the final test suppose you try your band at a descriptive arti cle i suggested giving your impressions of new york as seen from the brooklyn bridge the fresh point of view the don t be a fool said pettit let s go have some beer on the whole i rather like the city we discovered and enjoyed the only true bohemia every day and night we repaired to one of those palaces of marble and glass and tilework where goes on a tremendous and sounding epic of life valhalla itself could not be more glorious and sonorous the classic marble on which we ate the great light flooded vitreous front adorned with snow white scrolls the grand wagnerian din of clanking cups and bowls the flashing staccato of brandishing cut lery the piercing recitative of the white aproned grub maidens at the morgue like banquet tables the recurrent lied motif of the cash register it was a gigantic triumphant welding of art and sound a deafening soul uplifting pageant of heroic and em blematic life and the beans were only ten cents we wondered why our fellow artists cared to dine at sad little tables in their so called bohemian restau rants and we shuddered lest they should seek out our resorts and make them conspicuous with their pres ence pettit wrote many stories which the editors re turned to him he wrote love stories a thing i have always kept free from holding the belief that the well known and popular sentiment is not properly a matter for publication but something to be privately handled by the alienists and florists but the editors had told him that they wanted love stories because they said the women read them now the editors are wrong about that of course women do not read the love stories in the magazines they read the poker game stories and the recipes for cucumber lotion the love stories are read by fat cigar drummers and little ten year old girls i am not criticising the judgment of editors they are mostly very fine men but a man can be but one man with individual opinions and tastes i knew two associate editors of a magazine who were won derfully alike in almost everything and yet one of them was very fond of flaubert while the other preferred gin pettit brought me his returned manuscripts and we looked them over together to find out why they were not accepted they seemed to me pretty fair stories written in a good style and ended as they should at the bottom of the last page they were well constructed and the events were marshalled in orderly and logical sequence but i thought i detected a lack of living substance it was much as if i gazed at a symmetrical array of presentable clamshells from which the succulent and vital inhabitants had been removed i intimated that the author might do well to get better acquainted with his theme you sold a story last week said pettit about a gun fight in an arizona mining town in which the hero drew his colt s and shot seven bandits as fast as they came in the door now if a six shooter could oh well said i that s different arizona is a long way from new york i could have a man stabbed with a lariat or chased by a pair of chap arreras if i wanted to and it wouldn t be noticed until the usual error sharp from around mcadams junction isolates the erratum and writes in to the pa pers about it but you are up against another proposition this thing they call love is as common around new york as it is in sheboygan during the young onion season it may be mixed here with a little commercialism they read byron but they look up bradstreet s too while they re among the b s and brigham also if they have time but it s pretty much the same old internal disturbance every where you can fool an editor with a fake picture of a cowboy mounting a pony with his left hand on the saddle horn but you can t put him up a tree with a love story so you ve got to fall in love and then write the real thing pettit did i never knew whether he was taking my advice or whether be fell an accidental victim there was a girl be had met at one of these studio contrivances a glorious impudent lucid open minded girl with hair the color of culmbacher and a good natured way of despising you she was a new york girl well as the narrative style permits us to say in frequently pettit went to pieces all those pains those lover

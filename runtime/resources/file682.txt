cab wbeels the shout of the press agent the tinkle of fountains on the roof gardens the hullabaloo of the strawberry vender and the covers of everybody s magazine the whispers of the lovers in the parks all these sounds must go into your voice not combined but mixed and of the mixture an essence made and of the es sence an extract an audible extract of which one drop shall form the thing we seek do you remember asked the poet with a chuckle that california girl we met at stiver s studio last week well i m on my way to see her she repeated that poem of mine the tribute of spring word for word she s the smartest proposi tion in this town just at present say how does this confounded tie look i spoiled four before i got one to set right and the voice that i asked you about i in quired oh she doesn t sing said cleon but you ought to bear her recite my angel of the inshore wind i passed on i cornered a newsboy and be flashed at me prophetic pink papers that outstripped the news by two revolutions of the clock s longest hand son i said while i pretended to chase coins in my penny pocket doesn t it sometimes seem to you as if the city ought to be able to talk all these ups and downs and funny business and queer things hap pening every daywhat would it say do you think if it could speak quit yer kiddin said the boy wot paper yer want i got no time to waste it s mag s birthday and i want thirty cents to git her a present here was no interpreter of the city s mouthpiece i bought a paper and consigned its undeclared treaties its premeditated murders and unfought bat tles to an

he has known poverty love and war the justness of this reflection commends it to the lover of condensed philosophy the three condi tions embrace about all there is in life worth knowing a surface

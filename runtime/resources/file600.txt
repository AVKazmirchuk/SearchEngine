in the melancholy september afternoons on the spot where dums used to run in every day with her yellow curls flying the smile that lakelands always saw upon his face was not there the miller made his way slowly up the winding steep road the trees crowded so close to the edge of it that he walked in their shade with his hat in his hand squirrels ran playfully upon the old rail fence at his right quails were calling to their young broods in the wheat stubble the low sun sent a torrent of pale gold up the ravine that opened to the west early september it was within a few days only of the anniversary of aglaia s disappearance the old overshot wheel half covered with mountain ivy caught patches of the warm sunlight filtering through the trees the cottage across the road was still standing but it would doubtless go down before the next winter s mountain blasts it was overrun with morning glory and wild gourd vines and the door hung by one hinge father abram pushed open the mill door and entered softly and then he stood still wondering he heard the sound of some one within weeping inconsolably he looked and saw miss chester sitting in a dim pew with her head bowed upon an open letter that her hands held father abram went to her and laid one of his strong hands firmly upon hers she looked up breathed his name and tried to speak further not yet miss rose said the miller kindly don t try to talk yet there s nothing as good for you as a nice quiet little cry when you are feeling blue it seemed that the old miller who had known so much sorrow himself was a magician in driving it away from others miss chester s sobs grew easier presently she took her little plain bordered handkerchief and wiped away a drop or two that had fallen from her eyes upon father abram s big hand then she looked up and smiled through her tears miss chester could always smile before her tears had dried just as father abram could smile through his own grief in that way the two were very much alike the miller asked her no questions but by and by miss chester began to tell him it was the old story that always seems so big and important to the young and that brings reminiscent smiles to their elders love was the theme as may be supposed there was a young man in atlanta full of all goodness and the graces who had discovered that miss chester also possessed these qualities above all other people in atlanta or anywhere else from greenland to patagonia she showed father abram the letter over which she had been weeping it was a manly tender letter a little superlative and urgent after the style of love letters written by young men full of goodness and the graces he proposed for miss chester s hand in marriage at once life he said since her departure for a three weeks visit was not to be endured he begged for an immediate answer and if it were favourable he promised to fly ignoring the narrow gauge railroad at once to lakelands and now where does the trouble come in asked the miller when he had read the letter i cannot marry him said miss chester do you want to marry him asked father abram oh i love him she answered but down went her head and she sobbed again come miss rose said the miller you can give me your confidence i do not question you but i think you can trust me i do trust you said the girl i will tell you why i must refuse ralph i am nobody i haven t even a name the name i call myself is a lie ralph is a noble man i love him with all my heart but i can never be his what talk is this said father abram you said that you remember your parents why do you say you have no name i do not understand i do remember them said miss chester i remember them too well my first recollections are of our life somewhere in the far south we moved many times to different towns and states i have picked cotton and worked in factories and have often gone without enough food and clothes my mother was sometimes good to me my father was always cruel and beat me i think they were both idle and unsettled one night when we were living in a little town on a river near atlanta they had a great quarrel it was while they were abusing and taunting each other that i learned oh father abram i learned that i didn t even have the right to be don t you understand i had no right even to a name i was nobody i ran away that night i walked to atlanta and found work i gave myself the name of rose chester and have earned my own living ever since now you know why i cannot marry ralph and oh i can never tell him why better than any sympathy more helpful than pity was father abram s depreciation of her woes why dear dear is that all he said fie fie i thought something was in the way if this perfect young man is a man at all he will not care a pinch of bran for your family tree dear miss rose take my word for it it is yourself he cares for tell him frankly just as you have told me and i ll warrant that he will laugh at your story and think all the more of you for it i shall never tell him said miss chester sadly and i shall never marry him nor any one else i have

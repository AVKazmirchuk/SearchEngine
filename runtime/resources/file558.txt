a troubadour who according to the encyclopaedia should have flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries drew rein at the gates of his baronial castle old man ellison s smiles came back and filled his wrinkles when he saw sam he hurried out of the house in his shuffling limping way to greet him hello mr ellison called sam cheerfully thought i d drop over and see you a while notice you ve had fine rains on your range they ought to make good grazing for your spring lambs well well well said old man ellison i m mighty glad to see you sam i never thought you d take the trouble to ride over to as out of the way an old ranch as this but you re mighty welcome light i ve got a sack of new oats in the kitchen shall i bring out a feed for your hoss oats for him said sam derisively no sir ee he s as fat as a pig now on grass he don t get rode enough to keep him in condition i ll just turn him in the horse pasture with a drag rope on if you don t mind i am positive that never during the eleventh and thirteenth centuries did baron troubadour and worker amalgamate as harmoniously as their parallels did that evening at old man ellison s sheep ranch the kiowa s biscuits were light and tasty and his coffee strong ineradicable hospitality and appreciation glowed on old man ellison s weather tanned face as for the troubadour he said to himself that he had stumbled upon pleasant places indeed a well cooked abundant meal a host whom his lightest attempt to entertain seemed to delight far beyond the merits of the exertion and the reposeful atmosphere that his sensitive soul at that time craved united to confer upon him a satisfaction and luxurious ease that he had seldom found on his tours of the ranches after the delectable supper sam untied the green duck bag and took out his guitar not by way of payment mind you neither sam galloway nor any other of the true troubadours are lineal descendants of the late tommy tucker you have read of tommy tucker in the works of the esteemed but often obscure mother goose tommy tucker sang for his supper no true troubadour would do that he would have his supper and then sing for art s sake sam galloway s repertoire comprised about fifty funny stories and between thirty and forty songs he by no means stopped there he could talk through twenty cigarettes on any topic that you brought up and he never sat up when he could lie down and never stood when he could sit i am strongly disposed to linger with him for i am drawing a portrait as well as a blunt pencil and a tattered thesaurus will allow i wish you could have seen him he was small and tough and inactive beyond the power of imagination to conceive he wore an ultramarine blue woollen shirt laced down the front with a pearl gray exaggerated sort of shoestring indestructible brown duck clothes inevitable high heeled boots with mexican spurs and a mexican straw sombrero that evening sam and old man ellison dragged their chairs out under the hackberry trees they lighted cigarettes and the troubadour gaily touched his guitar many of the songs he sang were the weird melancholy minor keyed canciones that he had learned from the mexican sheep herders and vaqueros one in particular charmed and soothed the soul of the lonely baron it was a favourite song of the sheep herders beginning huile huile palomita which being translated means fly fly little dove sam sang it for old man ellison many times that evening the troubadour stayed on at the old man s ranch there was peace and quiet and appreciation there such as he had not found in the noisy camps of the cattle kings no audience in the world could have crowned the work of poet musician or artist with more worshipful and unflagging approval than that bestowed upon his efforts by old man ellison no visit by a royal personage to a humble woodchopper or peasant could have been received with more flattering thankfulness and joy on a cool canvas covered cot in the shade of the hackberry trees sam galloway passed the greater part of his time there he rolled his brown paper cigarettes read such tedious literature as the ranch afforded and added to his repertoire of improvisations that he played so expertly on his guitar to him as a slave ministering to a great lord the kiowa brought cool water from the red jar hanging under the brush shelter and food when he called for it the prairie zephyrs fanned him mildly mocking birds at morn and eve competed with but scarce equalled the sweet melodies of his lyre a perfumed stillness seemed to fill all his world while old man ellison was pottering among his flocks of sheep on his mile an hour pony and while the kiowa took his siesta in the burning sunshine at the end of the kitchen sam would lie on his cot thinking what a happy world he lived in and how kind it is to the ones whose mission in life it is to give entertainment and pleasure here he had food and lodging as good as he had ever longed for absolute immunity from care or exertion or strife an endless welcome and a host whose delight at the sixteenth repetition of a song or a story was as keen as at its initial giving was there ever a troubadour of old who struck upon as royal a castle in his wanderings while he lay thus meditating upon his blessings little brown cottontails would shyly frolic through the yard a covey of white topknotted blue quail would run past in single file

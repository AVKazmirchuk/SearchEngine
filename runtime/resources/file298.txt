sociology on the wrong side of the sidewalk my good fellow says he i don t know who you are but i d like to you ve knocked out reddy burns the champion middle weight of the world he came to new york yesterday to try to get a match on with jim jeifries if you but when i come out of my faint i was laying on the floor in a drug store saturated with aromatic spirits of ammonia if i d known that was reddy burns i d have got down in the gutter and crawled past him instead of handing him one like i did why if i d ever been in a ring and seen him climbing over the ropes i d have been all to the sal volatile so that s what imagination does concluded mack and as i said your case and mine is simultaneous you ll never win out you can t go up against the professionals i tell you it s a park bench for yours in this romance business mack the pessimist laughed harshly i m afraid i don t see the parallel i said coldly i have only a very slight acquaintance with the prize ring the derelict touched my sleeve with his forefinger for emphasis as he explained his parable every man said he with some dignity has got his lamps on something that looks good to him with you it s this dame that you re afraid to say your say to with me it was to win out in the ring well you ll lose just like i did why do you think i shall lose i asked warmly cause said he you re afraid to go in the ring you dassen t stand up before a professional your case and mine is just the same you re a amateur and that means that you d better keep outside of the ropes well i must be going i said rising and looking with elaborate care at my watch when i was twenty feet away the park bencher called to me much obliged for the dollar he said and for the dime but you ll never get er you re in the amateur class serves you right i said to myself for hobnobbing with a tramp his impudence but as i walked his words seemed to repeat themselves over and over again in my brain i think i even grew angry at the man i ll show him i finally said aloud i ll show him that i can fight reddy burns too even knowing who he is i hurried to a telephone booth and rang up the telfair residence a soft sweet voice answered didn t i know that voice my hand holding the receiver shook is that you said i employing the foolish words that form the vocabulary of every talker through the telephone yes this is i came back the answer in the low clear cut tones that are an inheritance of the telfairs who is it please it s me said i less ungrammatically than egotistically it s me and i ve got a few things that i want to say to you right now and immediately and straight to the point dear me said the voice oh it s you mr arden i wondered if any accent on the first word was intended mildred was fine at saying things that you had to study out afterward yes said i i hope so and now to come down to brass tacks i thought that rather a vernacularism if there is such a word as soon as i had said it but i didn t stop to apologize you know of course that i love you and that i have been in that idiotic state for a long time i don t want any more foolish ness about it that is i mean i want an answer from you right now will you marry me or not hold the wire please keep out central hello hello will you or will you not that was just the uppercut for reddy burns chin the answer came back why phil dear of course i will i didn t know that you that is you never said oh come up to the house please i can t say what i want to over the phone you are so importunate but please come up to the house won t you would i i rang the bell of the telfair house violently some sort of a human came to the door and shooed me into the drawing room oh well said i to myself looking at the ceiling any one can learn from any one that was a pretty good philosophy of mack s anyhow he didn t take advantage of his experience but i get the benefit of it if you want to get into the professional class you ve got to i stopped thinking then some one was coming down the stairs my knees began to shake i knew then how mack had felt when a professional began to climb over the ropes i looked around foolishly for a door or a window by which i might escape if it had been any other girl approaching i mightn t have but just then the door opened and bess mildred s younger sister came in i d never seen her look so much like a glorified angel she walked straight tip to me and and i d never noticed before what perfectly wonderful eyes and hair elizabeth telfair had phil she said in the telfair sweet thrilling tones why didn t you tell me about it before i thought it was sister you wanted all the time until you telephoned to me a few minutes ago i suppose mack and i always will be hopeless amateurs but as the thing has turned out in my case i m mighty glad

clothes that they call detectives and marches the whole outfit of us to what they call a magistrate s court they accuse luke of at tempted kidnapping and ask him what he has to say this snipe says

language as i had and when we goes outside he announces the verdict that the young man is delivered into the hands of the texas authorities and calls the next case skipping over much of what happened

pedro johnson one of bildad s most prominent and oh hell says luke that don t amount to anything that fellow was half mexican anyhow transformation of martin burney in behalf of sir walter s soothing plant let us look into the case of martin burney they were constructing the speedway along the west bank of the harlem river the grub boat of dennis corrigan sub contractor was moored to a tree on the bank twenty two men belonging to the little green island toiled there at the sinew cracking labour one among them who wrought in the kitchen of the grub boat was of the race of the goths over them all stood the exorbitant corrigan harrying them like the captain of a galley crew he paid them so little that most of the gang work as they might e arned little more than food and tobacco many of them were in debt to him corrigan boarded them all in the grub boat and gave them good grub for he got it back in work martin burney was furthest behind of all he was a little man all muscles and hands and feet with a gray red stubbly beard he was too light for the work which would have glutted the capacity of a steam shovel the work was hard besides that the banks of the river were humming with mosquitoes as a child in a dark room fixes his regard on the pale light of a comforting window these toilers watched the sun that brought around the one hour of the day that tasted less bitter after the sundown supper they would huddle together on the river bank and send the mosquitoes whining and eddying back from the malignant puffs of twenty three reeking pipes thus socially banded against the foe they wrenched out of the hour a few well smoked drops from the cup of joy each week burney grew deeper in debt corrigan kept a small stock of goods on the boat which he sold to the men at prices that brought him no loss burney was a good customer at the tobacco counter one sack when he went to work in the morning and one when he came in at night so much was his account swelled daily burney was something of a smoker yet it was not true that he ate his meals with a pipe in his mouth which had been said of him the little man was not discontented he had plenty to eat plenty of tobacco and a tyrant to curse so why should not he an irishman be well satisfied one morning as he was starting with the others for work he stopped at the pine counter for his usual sack of tobacco there s no more for ye said corrigan your account s closed ye are a losing investment no not even tobaccy my son no more tobaccy on account if ye want to work on and eat do so but the smoke of ye has all ascended tis my advice that ye hunt a new job i have no tobaccy to smoke in my pipe this day mr corrigan said burney not quite understanding that such a thing could happen to him earn it said corrigan and then buy it burney stayed on he knew of no other job at first he did not realize that tobacco had got to be his father and mother his confessor and sweetheart and wife and child for three days he managed to fill his pipe from the other men s sacks and then they shut him off one and all they told him rough but friendly that of all things in the world tobacco must be quickest forthcoming to a fellow man desiring it but that beyond the immediate temporary need requisition upon the store of a comrade is pressed with great danger to friendship then the blackness of the pit arose and filled the heart of burney sucking the corpse of his deceased dudheen he staggered through his duties with his barrowful of stones and dirt feeling for the first time that the curse of adam was upon him other men bereft of a pleasure might have recourse to other delights but burney had only two comforts in life one was his pipe the other was an ecstatic hope that there would be no speedways to build on the other side of jordan at meal times he would let the other men go first into the grub boat and then he would go down on his hands and knees grovelling fiercely upon the ground where they had been sitting trying to find some stray crumbs of tobacco once he sneaked down the river bank and filled his pipe with dead willow leaves at the first whiff of the smoke he spat in the direction of the boat and put the finest curse he knew on corrigan one that began with the first corrigans born on earth and ended with the corrigans that shall hear the trumpet of gabriel blow he began to hate corrigan with all his shaking nerves and soul even murder occurred to him in a vague sort of way five days he went without the taste of tobacco he who had smoked all day and thought the night misspent in which he had not awakened for a pipeful or two under the bedclothes one day a man stopped at the boat to say that there was work to be had in the bronx park where a large number of labourers were required in making some improvements after dinner burney walked thirty yards down the river bank away from the maddening smell of the others pipes he sat down upon a stone he was thinking he would set out for the bronx at least he could earn tobacco there what if the books did say he owed corrigan any man s work was worth his keep but then he hated to go without getting even with the hard hearted screw who had put his pipe out was there any way to do it softly stepping among the clods came tony he of the race of goths who worked in the kitchen he grinned at burney s elbow and that unhappy man full of race animosity and holding urbanity in contempt growled at him what d ye want ye dago tony also contained a grievance and a plot he too was a corrigan hater and had been primed to see it in others how you like a mr corrigan he asked you think a him a nice a man to hell with m he said may his liver turn to water and the bones of him crack in the cold of his heart may dog fennel grow upon his ancestors graves and the grandsons of his children be born without eyes may whiskey turn to clabber in his mouth and every time he sneezes may he blister the soles of his feet and the smoke of his pipe may it make his eyes water and the drops fall on the grass that his cows eat and poison the butter that he spreads on his bread though tony remained a stranger to the beauties of this imagery he gathered from it the conviction that it was sufficiently anti corrigan in its tendency so with the confidence of a fellow conspirator he sat by burney upon the stone and unfolded his plot it was very simple in design every day after dinner it was corrigan s habit to sleep for an hour in his bunk at such times it was the duty of the cook and his helper tony to leave the boat so that no noise might disturb the autocrat the cook always spent this hour in walking exercise tony s plan was this after corrigan should be asleep he tony and burney would cut the mooring ropes that held the boat to the shore tony lacked the nerve to do the deed alone then the awkward boat would swing out into a swift current and surely overturn against a rock there was below come on and do it said burney if the back of ye aches from the lick he gave ye as the pit of me stomach does for the taste of a bit of smoke we can t cut the ropes too quick all a right said tony but better wait bout a ten minute more give a corrigan plenty time get good a sleep they waited sitting upon the stone the rest of the men were at work out of sight around a bend in the road everything would have gone well except perhaps with corrigan had not tony been moved to decorate the plot with its conventional accompaniment he was of dramatic blood and perhaps he intuitively divined the appendage to villainous machinations as prescribed by the stage he pulled from his shirt bosom a long black beautiful venomous cigar and handed it to burney you like a smoke while we wait he asked burney clutched it and snapped off the end as a terrier bites at a rat he laid it to his lips like a long lost sweetheart when the smoke began to draw he gave a long deep sigh and the bristles of his gray red moustache curled down over the cigar like the talons of an eagle slowly the red faded from the whites of his eyes he fixed his gaze dreamily upon the hills across the river the minutes came and went bout time to go now said tony that damn a corrigan he be in the reever very quick burney started out of his trance with a grunt he turned his head and gazed with a surprised and pained severity at his accomplice he took the cigar partly from his mouth but sucked it back again immediately chewed it lovingly once or twice and spoke in virulent puffs from the corner of his mouth what is it ye yaller haythen would ye lay contrivances against the enlightened races of the earth ye instigator of illegal crimes would ye seek to persuade martin burney into the dirty tricks of an indecent dago would ye be for murderin your benefactor the good man that gives ye food and work take that ye punkin coloured assassin the torrent of burney s indignation carried with it bodily assault the toe of his shoe sent the would be cutter of ropes tumbling from his seat tony arose and fled his vendetta he again relegated to the files of things that might have been beyond the boat he fled and away away he was afraid to remain burney with expanded chest watched his late coplotter disappear then he too departed setting his face in the direction of the bronx in his wake was a rank and pernicious trail of noisome smoke that brought peace to his heart and drove the birds from the roadside into the deepest thickets the caliph and the cad surely there is no pastime more diverting than that of mingling incognito with persons of wealth and station where else but in those circles can one see life in its primitive crude state unhampered by the conventions that bind the dwellers in a lower sphere there was a certain caliph of bagdad who was accustomed to go down among the poor and lowly for the solace obtained from the relation of their tales and histories is it not strange that the humble and poverty stricken have not availed themselves of the pleasure they might glean by donning diamonds and silks and playing caliph among the haunts of the upper world there was one who saw the possibilities of thus turning the tables on haroun al raschid his name was corny brannigan and he was a truck driver for a canal street importing firm and if you read further you will learn how he turned upper broadway into bagdad and learned something about himself that he did not know before many people would have called corny a snob preferably by means of a telephone his chief interest in life his chosen amusement and his sole diversion after working hours was to place himself in juxtaposition since he could not hope to mingle with people of fashion and means every evening after corny had put up his team and dined at a lunch counter that made immediateness a specialty he would clothe himself in evening raiment as correct as any you will see in the palm rooms then he would betake himself to that ravishing radiant roadway devoted to thespis thais and bacchus for a time he would stroll about the lobbies of the best hotels his soul steeped in blissful content beautiful women cooing like doves but feathered like birds of paradise flicked him with their robes as they passed courtly gentlemen attended them gallant and assiduous and corny s heart within him swelled like sir lancelot s for the mirror spoke to him as he passed and said corny lad there s not a guy among em that looks a bit the sweller than yerself and you drivin of a truck and them swearin off their taxes and playin the red in art galleries with the best in the land and the mirrors spake the truth mr corny brannigan had acquired the outward polish if nothing more long and keen observation of polite society had gained for him its manner its genteel air and most difficult of acquirement its repose and ease now and then in the hotels corny had managed conversation and temporary acquaintance with substantial if not distinguished guests with many of these he had exchanged cards and the ones he received he carefully treasured for his own use later leaving the hotel lobbies corny would stroll leisurely about lingering at the theatre entrance dropping into the fashionable restaurants as if seeking some friend he rarely patronized any of these places he was no bee come to suck honey but a butterfly flashing his wings among the flowers whose calyces held no sweets for him his wages were not large enough to furnish him with more than the outside garb of the gentleman to have been one of the beings he so cunningly imitated corny brannigan would have given his right hand one night corny had an adventure after absorbing the delights of an hour s lounging in the principal hotels along broadway he passed up into the stronghold of thespis cab drivers hailed him as a likely fare to his prideful content languishing eyes were turned upon him as a hopeful source of lobsters and the delectable ascendant globules of effervescence these overtures and unconscious compliments corny swallowed as manna and hoped bill the off horse would be less lame in the left forefoot in the morning beneath a cluster of milky globes of electric light corny paused to admire the sheen of his low cut patent leather shoes the building occupying the angle was a pretentious cafe out of this came a couple a lady in a white cobwebby evening gown with a lace wrap like a wreath of mist thrown over it and a man tall faultless assured too assured they moved to the edge of the sidewalk and halted corny s eye ever alert for pointers in swell behaviour took them in with a sidelong glance the carriage is not here said the lady you ordered it to wait i ordered it for nine thirty said the man it should be here now a familiar note in the lady s voice drew a more especial attention from corny it was pitched in a key well known to him the soft electric shone upon her face sisters of sorrow have no quarters fixed for them in the index to the book of breaking hearts you will find that broadway follows very soon after the bowery this lady s face was sad and her voice was attuned with it they waited as if for the carriage corny waited too for it was out of doors and he was never tired of accumulating and profiting by knowledge of gentlemanly conduct jack said the lady don t be angry i ve done everything i could to please you this evening why do you act so oh you re an angel said the man depend upon woman to throw the blame upon a man i m not blaming you i m only trying to make you happy you go about it in a very peculiar way you have been cross with me all the evening without any cause oh there isn t any cause except you make me tired corny took out his card case and looked over his collection he selected one that read mr r lionel whyte melville bloomsbury square london this card he had inveigled from a tourist at the king edward hotel corny stepped up to the man and presented it with a correctly formal air may i ask why i am selected for the honour asked the lady s escort now mr corny brannigan had a very wise habit of saying little during his imitations of the caliph of bagdad the advice of lord chesterfield wear a black coat and hold your tongue he believed in without having heard but now speech was demanded and required of him no gent said corny would talk to a lady like you done fie upon you willie even if she happens to be your wife you ought to have more respect for your clothes than to chin her back that way maybe it ain t my butt in but it goes anyhow you strike me as bein a whole lot to the wrong the lady s escort indulged in more elegantly expressed but fetching repartee corny eschewing his truck driver s vocabulary retorted as nearly as he could in polite phrases then diplomatic relations were severed there was a brief but lively set to with other than oral weapons from which corny came forth easily victor a carriage dashed up driven by a tardy and solicitous coachman will you kindly open the door for me asked the lady corny assisted her to enter and took off his hat the escort was beginning to scramble up from the sidewalk i beg your pardon ma am said corny if he s your man he s no man of mine said the lady perhaps he but there s no chance of his being now drive home michael if you care to take this with my thanks three red roses were thrust out through the carriage window into corny s hand he took them and the hand for an instant and then the carriage sped away corny gathered his foe s hat and began to brush the dust from his clothes come along said corny taking the other man by the arm his late opponent was yet a little dazed by the hard knocks he had received corny led him carefully into a saloon three doors away the drinks for us said corny me and my friend you re a queer feller said the lady s late escort lick a man and then want to set em up you re my best friend said corny exultantly you don t understand well listen you just put me wise to somethin i been playin gent a long time thinkin it was just the glad rags i had and nothin else say you re a swell ain t you well you trot in that class i guess i don t but i found out one thing i m a gentleman by and i know it now what ll you have to drink the diamond of kali the original news item concerning the diamond of the goddess kali was handed in to the city editor he smiled and held it for a moment above the wastebasket then he laid it back on his desk and said try the sunday people they might work something out of it the sunday editor glanced the item over and said h m afterward he sent for a reporter and expanded his comment you might see general ludlow he said and make a story out of this if you can diamond stories are a drug but this one is big enough to be found by a scrubwoman wrapped up in a piece of newspaper and tucked under the corner of the hall linoleum find out first if the general has a daughter who intends to go on the stage if not you can go ahead with the story run cuts of the kohinoor and j p morgan s collection and work in pictures of the kimberley mines and barney barnato fill in with a tabulated comparison of the values of diamonds radium and veal cutlets since the meat strike and let it run to a half page on the following day the reporter turned in his story the sunday editor let his eye sprint along its lines h m he said again this time the copy went into the waste basket with scarcely a flutter the reporter stiffened a little around the lips but he was whistling softly and contentedly between his teeth when i went over to talk with him about it an hour later i don t blame the old man said he magnanimously for cutting it out it did sound like funny business but it happened exactly as i wrote it say why don t you fish that story out of the w b and use it seems to me it s as good as the tommyrot you write i accepted the tip and if you read further you will learn the facts about the diamond of the goddess kali as vouched for by one of the most reliable reporters on the staff gen marcellus b ludlow lives in one of those decaying but venerated old red brick mansions in the west twenties the general is a member of an old new york family that does not advertise he is a globe trotter by birth a gentleman by predilection a millionaire by the mercy of heaven and a connoisseur of precious stones by occupation the reporter was admitted promptly when he made himself known at the general s residence at about eight thirty on the evening that he received the assignment in the magnificent library he was greeted by the distinguished traveller and connoisseur a tall erect gentleman in the early fifties with a nearly white moustache and a bearing so soldierly that one perceived in him scarcely a trace of the national guardsman his weather beaten countenance lit up with a charming smile of interest when the reporter made known his errand ah you have heard of my latest find i shall be glad to show you what i conceive to be one of the six most valuable blue diamonds in existence the general opened a small safe in a corner of the library and brought forth a plush covered box opening this he exposed to the reporter s bewildered gaze a huge and brilliant diamond nearly as large as a hailstone this stone said the general is something more than a mere jewel it once formed the central eye of the three eyed goddess kali who is worshipped by one of the fiercest and most fanatical tribes of india if you will arrange yourself comfortably i will give you a brief history of it for your paper general ludlow brought a decanter of whiskey and glasses from a cabinet and set a comfortable armchair for the lucky scribe the phansigars or thugs of india began the general are the most dangerous and dreaded of the tribes of north india they are extremists in religion and worship the horrid goddess kali in the form of images their rites are interesting and bloody the robbing and murdering of travellers are taught as a worthy and obligatory deed by their strange religious code their worship of the three eyed goddess kali is conducted so secretly that no traveller has ever heretofore had the honour of witnessing the ceremonies that distinction was reserved for myself while at sakaranpur between delhi and khelat i used to explore the jungle in every direction in the hope of learning something new about these mysterious phansigars one evening at twilight i was making my way through a teakwood forest when i came upon a deep circular depression in an open space in the centre of which was a rude stone temple i was sure that this was one of the temples of the thugs so i concealed myself in the undergrowth to watch when the moon rose the depression in the clearing was suddenly filled with hundreds of shadowy swiftly gliding forms then a door opened in the temple exposing a brightly illuminated image of the goddess kali before which a white robed priest began a barbarous incantation while the tribe of worshippers prostrated themselves upon the earth but what interested me most was the central eye of the huge wooden idol i could see by its flashing brilliancy that it was an immense diamond of the purest water after the rites were concluded the thugs slipped away into the forest as silently as they had come the priest stood for a few minutes in the door of the temple enjoying the cool of the night before closing his rather warm quarters suddenly a dark lithe shadow slipped down into the hollow leaped upon the priest and struck him down with a glittering knife then the murderer sprang at the image of the goddess like a cat and pried out the glowing central eye of kali with his weapon straight toward me he ran with his royal prize when he was within two paces i rose to my feet and struck him with all my force between the eyes he rolled over senseless and the magnificent jewel fell from his hand that is the splendid blue diamond you have just seen a stone worthy of a monarch s crown that s a corking story said the reporter that decanter is exactly like the one that john w gates always sets out during an interview pardon me said general ludlow for forgetting hospitality in the excitement of my narrative help yourself here s looking at you said the reporter what i am afraid of now said the general lowering his voice is that i may be robbed of the diamond the jewel that formed an eye of their goddess is their most sacred symbol somehow the tribe suspected me of having it and members of the band have followed me half around the earth they are the most cunning and cruel fanatics in the world and their religious vows would compel them to assassinate the unbeliever who has desecrated their sacred treasure once in lucknow three of their agents disguised as servants in a hotel endeavoured to strangle me with a twisted cloth again in london two thugs made up as street musicians climbed into my window at night and attacked me they have even tracked me to this country my life is never safe a month ago while i was at a hotel in the berkshires three of them sprang upon me from the roadside weeds i saved myself then by my knowledge of their customs how was that general asked the reporter there was a cow grazing near by said general ludlow a gentle jersey cow i ran to her side and stood the three thugs ceased their attack knelt and struck the ground thrice with their foreheads then after many respectful salaams they departed afraid the cow would hook asked the reporter no the cow is a sacred animal to the phansigars next to their goddess they worship the cow they have never been known to commit any deed of violence in the presence of the animal they reverence it s a mighty interesting story said the reporter if you don t mind i ll take another drink and then a few notes i will join you said general ludlow with a courteous wave of his hand if i were you advised the reporter i d take that sparkler to texas get on a cow ranch there and the pharisees phansigars corrected the general oh yes the fancy guys would run up against a long horn every time they made a break general ludlow closed the diamond case and thrust it into his bosom the spies of the tribe have found me out in new york he said straightening his tall figure i m familiar with the east indian cast of countenance and i know that my every movement is watched they will undoubtedly attempt to rob and murder me here here exclaimed the reporter seizing the decanter and pouring out a liberal amount of its contents at any moment said the general but as a soldier and a connoisseur i shall sell my life and my diamond as dearly as i can at this point of the reporter s story there is a certain vagueness but it can be gathered that there was a loud crashing noise at the rear of the house they were in general ludlow buttoned his coat closely and sprang for the door but the reporter clutched him firmly with one hand while he held the decanter with the other tell me before we fly he urged in a voice thick with some inward turmoil do any of your daughters contemplate going on the stage i have no daughters fly for your life the phansigars are upon us cried the general the two men dashed out of the front door of the house the hour was late as their feet struck the side walk strange men of dark and forbidding appearance seemed to rise up out of the earth and encompass them one with asiatic features pressed close to the general and droned in a terrible voice buy cast clo another dark whiskered and sinister sped lithely to his side and began in a whining voice say mister have yer got a dime fer a poor feller what they hurried on but only into the arms of a black eyed dusky browed being who held out his hat under their noses while a confederate of oriental hue turned the handle of a street organ near by twenty steps farther on general ludlow and the reporter found themselves in the midst of half a dozen villainous looking men with high turned coat collars and faces bristling with unshaven beards run for it hissed the general they have discovered the possessor of the diamond of the goddess kali the two men took to their heels the avengers of the goddess pursued oh lordy groaned the reporter there isn t a cow this side of brooklyn we re lost when near the corner they both fell over an iron object that rose from the sidewalk close to the gutter clinging to it desperately they awaited their fate if i only had a cow moaned the reporter or another nip from that decanter general as soon as the pursuers observed where their victims had found refuge they suddenly fell back and retreated to a considerable distance they are waiting for reinforcements in order to attack us said general ludlow but the reporter emitted a ringing laugh and hurled his hat triumphantly into the air guess again he shouted and leaned heavily upon the iron object your old fancy guys or thugs whatever you call em are up to date dear general this is a pump we ve stranded upon same as a cow in new york hic see thas h why the nfuriated smoked guys don t attack us see sacred an mal the pump in n york my dear general but further down in the shadows of twenty eighth street the marauders were holding a parley come on reddy said one let s go frisk the old un he s been shown a sparkler as big as a hen egg all around eighth avenue for two weeks past not on your silhouette decided reddy you see em rallyin round the pump they re friends of bill s bill won t stand for nothin of this kind in his district since he got that bid to esopus this exhausts the facts concerning the kali diamond but it is deemed not inconsequent to close with the following brief paid item that appeared two days later in a morning paper it is rumored that a niece of gen marcellus b ludlow of new york city will appear on the stage next season her diamonds are said to be extremely valuable and of much historic interest the day we celebrate in the tropics hop along bibb the bird fancier was saying to me the seasons months fortnights week ends holidays dog days sundays and yesterdays get so jumbled together in the shuffle that you never know when a year has gone by until you re in the middle of the next one hop along bibb kept his bird store on lower fourth avenue he was an ex seaman and beachcomber who made regular voyages to southern ports and imported personally conducted invoices of talking parrots and dialectic paroquets he had a stiff knee neck and nerve i had gone to him to buy a parrot to present at christmas to my aunt joanna this one said i disregarding his homily on the subdivisions of time this one that seems all red white and blue to what genus of beasts does he belong he appeals at once to my patriotism and to my love of discord in colour schemes that s a cockatoo from ecuador said bibb all he has been taught to say is merry christmas a seasonable bird he s only seven dollars and i ll bet many a human has stuck you for more money by making the same speech to you and then bibb laughed suddenly and loudly that bird he explained reminds me he s got his dates mixed he ought to be saying e pluri bus unum to match his feathers instead of trying to work the santa claus graft it reminds me of the time me and liverpool sam got our ideas of things tangled up on the coast of costa rica on account of the weather and other phenomena to be met with in the tropics we were as it were stranded on that section of the spanish main with no money to speak of and no friends that should be talked about either we had stoked and second cooked ourselves down there on a fruit steamer from new orleans to try our luck which was discharged after we got there for lack of evidence there was no work suitable to our instincts so me and liverpool began to subsist on the red rum of the country and such fruit as we could reap where we had not sown it was an alluvial town called soledad where there was no harbour or future or recourse between steamers the town slept and drank rum it only woke up when there were bananas to ship it was like a man sleeping through dinner until the dessert when me and liverpool got so low down that the american consul wouldn t speak to us we knew we d struck bed rock we boarded with a snuff brown lady named chica who kept a rum shop and a ladies and gents restaurant in a street called the calle de los forty seven inconsolable saints when our credit played out there liverpool whose stomach overshadowed his sensations of noblesse oblige married chica this kept us in rice and fried plantain for a month and then chica pounded liverpool one morning sadly and earnestly for fifteen minutes with a casserole handed down from the stone age and we knew that we had out welcomed our liver that night we signed an engagement with don jaime mcspinosa a hybrid banana fancier of the place to work on his fruit preserves nine miles out of town we had to do it or be reduced to sea water and broken doses of feed and slumber now speaking of liverpool sam i don t malign or inexculpate him to you any more than i would to his face but in my opinion when an englishman gets as low as he can he s got to dodge so that the dregs of other nations don t drop ballast on him out of their balloons and if he s a liverpool englishman why fire damp is what he s got to look out for being a natural american that s my personal view but liverpool and me had much in common we were without decorous clothes or ways and means of exist ence and as the saying goes misery certainly does enjoy the society of accomplices our job on old mcspinosa s plantation was chopping down banana stalks and loading the bunches of fruit on the backs of horses then a native dressed up in an alligator hide belt a machete and a pair of aa sheeting pajamas drives em over to the coast and piles em up on the beach you ever been in a banana grove it s as solemn as a rathskeller at seven a m it s like being lost behind the scenes at one of these mushroom musical shows you can t see the sky for the foliage above you and the ground is knee deep in rotten leaves and it s so still that you can hear the stalks growing again after you chop em down at night me and liverpool herded in a lot of grass huts on the edge of a lagoon with the red yellow and black employes of don jaime there we lay fighting mosquitoes and listening to the monkeys squalling and the alligators grunting and splashing in the lagoon until daylight with only snatches of sleep between times we soon lost all idea of what time of the year it was it s just about eighty degrees there in december and june and on fridays and at midnight and election day and any other old time sometimes it rains more than at others and that s all the difference you notice a man is liable to live along there without noticing any fugiting of tempus until some day the undertaker calls in for him just when he s beginning to think about cutting out the gang and saving up a little to invest in real estate i don t know how long we worked for don jaime but it was through two or thee rainy spells eight or ten hair cuts and the life of thee pairs of sail cloth trousers all the money we earned went for rum and tobacco but we ate and that was something all of a sudden one day me and liverpool find the trade of committing surgical operations on banana stalks turning to aloes and quinine in our mouths it s a seizure that often comes upon white men in latin and geographical countries we wanted to be addressed again in language and see the smoke of a steamer and read the real estate transfers and gents outfitting ads in an old newspaper even soledad seemed like a centre of civilization to us so that evening we put our thumbs on our nose at don jaime s fruit stand and shook his grass burrs off our feet it was only twelve miles to soledad but it took me and liverpool two days to get there it was banana grove nearly all the way and we got twisted time and again it was like paging the palm room of a new york hotel for a man named smith when we saw the houses of soledad between the trees all my disinclination toward this liverpool sam rose up in me i stood him while we were two white men against the banana brindles but now when there were prospects of my exchanging even cuss words with an american citizen i put him back in his proper place and he was a sight too with his rum painted nose and his red whiskers and elephant feet with leather sandals strapped to them i suppose i looked about the same it looks to me says i like great britain ought to be made to keep such gin swilling scurvy unbecoming mud larks as you at home instead of sending em over here to degrade and taint foreign lands we kicked you out of america once and we ought to put on rubber boots and do it again oh you go to ell says liverpool which was about all the repartee he ever had well soledad looked fine to me after don jaime s plantation liverpool and me walked into it side by side from force of habit past the calabosa and the hotel grande down across the plaza toward chica s hut where we hoped that liverpool being a husband of hers might work his luck for a meal as we passed the two story little frame house occupied by the american club we noticed that the balcony had been decorated all around with wreaths of evergreens and flowers and the flag was flying from the pole on the roof stanzey the consul and ark right a gold mine owner were smoking on the balcony me and liverpool waved our dirty hands toward em and smiled real society smiles but they turned their backs to us and went on talking and we had played whist once with the two of em up to the ti me when liverpool held all thirteen trumps for four hands in succession it was some holiday we knew but we didn t know the day nor the year a little further along we saw a reverend man named pendergast who had come to soledad to build a church standing under a cocoanut palm with his little black alpaca coat and green umbrella boys boys says he through his blue spectacles is it as bad as this are you so far reduced we re reduced says i to very vulgar fractions it is indeed sad says pendergast to see my countrymen in such circumstances cut arf of that out old party says liverpool cawn t you tell a member of the british upper classes when you see one shut up i told liverpool you re on foreign soil now or that portion of it that s not on you and on this day too goes on pendergast grievous on this most glorious day of the year when we should all be celebrating the dawn of christian civilization and the downfall of the wicked i did notice bunting and bouquets decorating the town reverend says i but i didn t know what it was for we ve been so long out of touch with calendars that we didn t know whether it was summer time or saturday afternoon here is two dollars says pendergast digging up two chili silver wheels and handing em to me go my men and observe the rest of the day in a befitting manner me and liverpool thanked him kindly and walked away shall we eat i asks oh ell says liverpool what s money for very well then i says since you insist upon it we ll drink so we pull up in a rum shop and get a quart of it and go down on the beach under a cocoanut tree and celebrate not having eaten anything but oranges in two days the rum has immediate effect and once more i conjure up great repugnance toward the british nation stand up here i says to liverpool you scum of a despot limited monarchy and have another dose of bunker hill that good man mr pendergast says i said we were to observe the day in a befitting manner and i m not going to see his money misapplied oh you go to ell says liverpool and i started in with a fine left hander on his right eye liverpool had been a fighter once but dissipation and bad company had taken the nerve out of him in ten minutes i had him lying on the sand waving the white flag get up says i kicking him in the ribs and come along with me liverpool got up and followed behind me because it was his habit wiping the red off his face and nose i led him to reverend pendergast s shack and called him out look at this sir says i look at this thing that was once a proud britisher you gave us two dollars and told us to celebrate the day the star spangled banner still waves hurrah for the stars and eagles dear me says pendergast holding up his hands fighting on this day of all days on christmas day when peace on christmas hell says i i thought it was the fourth of july merry christmas said the red white and blue cockatoo take him for six dollars said hop along bibb he s got his dates and colours mixed the trimmed lamp and other stories the trimmed lamp of course there are two sides to the question let us look at the other we often hear shop girls spoken of no such persons exist there are girls who work in shops they make their living that way but why turn their occupation into an adjective let us be fair we do not refer to the girls who live on fifth avenue as marriage girls lou and nancy were chums they came to the big city to find work because there was not enough to eat at their homes to go around nancy was nineteen lou was twenty both were pretty active country girls who had no ambition to go on the stage the little cherub that sits up aloft guided them to a cheap and respectable boarding house both found positions and became wage earners they remained chums it is at the end of six months that i would beg you to step forward and be introduced to them meddlesome reader my lady friends miss nancy and miss lou while you are shaking hands please take notice cautiously of their attire yes cautiously for they are as quick to resent a stare as a lady in a box at the horse show is lou is a piece work ironer in a hand laundry she is clothed in a badly fitting purple dress and her hat plume is four inches too long but her ermine muff and scarf cost and its fellow beasts will be ticketed in the windows at before the season is over her cheeks are pink and her light blue eyes bright contentment radiates from her nancy you would call a shop girl because you have the habit there is no type but a perverse generation is always seeking a type so this is what the type should be she has the high ratted pompadour and the exaggerated straight front her skirt is shoddy but has the correct flare no furs protect her against the bitter spring air but she wears her short broadcloth jacket as jauntily as though it were persian lamb on her face and in her eyes remorseless type seeker is the typical shop girl expression it is a look of silent but contemptuous revolt against cheated womanhood of sad prophecy of the vengeance to come when she laughs her loudest the look is still there the same look can be seen in the eyes of russian peasants and those of us left will see it some day on gabriel s face when he comes to blow us up it is a look that should wither and abash man but he has been known to smirk at it and offer flowers with a string tied to them now lift your hat and come away while you receive lou s cheery see you again and the sardonic sweet smile of nancy that seems somehow to miss you and go fluttering like a white moth up over the housetops to the stars the two waited on the corner for dan dan was lou s steady company faithful well he was on hand when mary would have had to hire a dozen subpoena servers to find her lamb ain t you cold nance said lou say what a chump you are for working in that old store for a week i made l last week of course ironing ain t as swell work as selling lace behind a counter but it pays none of us ironers make less than and i don t know that it s any less respectful work either you can have it said nancy with uplifted nose i ll take my eight a week and hall bedroom i like to be among nice things and swell people and look what a chance i ve got why one of our glove girls married a pittsburg steel maker or blacksmith or something the other day worth a million dollars i ll catch a swell myself some time i ain t bragging on my looks or anything but i ll take my chances where there s big prizes offered what show would a girl have in a laundry why that s where i met dan said lou triumphantly he came in for his sunday shirt and collars and saw me at the first board ironing we all try to get to work at the first board ella maginnis was sick that day and i had her place he said he noticed any arms first how round and white they was i had my sleeves rolled up some nice fellows come into laundries you can tell em by their bringing their clothes in suit cases and turning in the door sharp and sudden how can you wear a waist like that lou said nancy gazing down at the offending article with sweet scorn in her heavy lidded eyes it shows fierce taste this waist cried lou with wide eyed indignation why i paid for this waist it s worth twenty five a woman left it to be laundered and never called for it the boss sold it to me it s got yards and yards of hand embroidery on it better talk about that ugly plain thing you ve got on this ugly plain thing said nancy calmly was copied from one that mrs van alstyne fisher was wearing the girls say her bill in the store last year was i made mine myself it cost me ten feet away you couldn t tell it from hers oh well said lou good naturedly if you want to starve and put on airs go ahead but i ll take my job and good wages and after hours give me something as fancy and attractive to wear as i am able to buy but just then dan came a serious young man with a ready made necktie who had escaped the city s brand of frivolity an electrician earning dollars per week who looked upon lou with the sad eyes of romeo and thought her embroidered waist a web in which any fly should delight to be caught my friend mr owens shake hands with miss danforth said lou i m mighty glad to know you miss danforth said dan with outstretched hand i ve heard lou speak of you so often thanks said nancy touching his fingers with the tips of her cool ones i ve heard her mention you a few times lou giggled did you get that handshake from mrs van alstyne fisher nance she asked if i did you can feel safe in copying it said nancy oh i couldn t use it at all it s too stylish for me it s intended to set off diamond rings that high shake is wait till i get a few and then i ll try it learn it first said nancy wisely and you ll be more likely to get the rings now to settle this argument said dan with his ready cheerful smile let me make a proposition as i can t take both of you up to tiffany s and do the right thing what do you say to a little vaudeville i ve got the rickets how about looking at stage diamonds since we can t shake hands with the real sparklers the faithful squire tools his place close to the curb lou next a little peacocky in her bright and pretty clothes nancy on the inside slender and soberly clothed as the sparrow but with the true van alstyne fisher walk thus they set out for their evening s moderate diversion i do not suppose that many look upon a great department store as an educational institution but the one in which nancy worked was something like that to her she was surrounded by beautiful things that breathed of taste and refinement if

street was his goal nearly two months after his arrival he began to complain that he felt worse it was then that he became the ranch s incubus its harpy its old man of the sea he shut himself in his room like some venomous kobold or flibbertigibbet whining complaining cursing accusing the keynote of his plaint was that he had been inveigled into a gehenna against his will that he was dying of neglect and lack of comforts with all his dire protestations of increasing illness to the eye of others he remained unchanged his currant like eyes were as bright and diabolic as ever his voice was as rasping his callous face with the skin drawn tense as a drum head had no flesh to lose a flush on his prominent cheek bones each afternoon hinted that a clinical thermometer might have revealed a symptom and percussion might have established the fact that mcguire was breathing with only one lung but his appearance remained the same in constant attendance upon him was ylario whom the coming reward of the mayordomoship must have greatly stimulated for mcguire chained him to a bitter existence the air the man s only chance for life he commanded to be kept out by closed windows and drawn curtains the room was always blue and foul with cigarette smoke whosoever entered it must sit suffocating and listen to the imp s interminable gasconade concerning his scandalous career the oddest thing of all was the relation existing between mcguire and his benefactor the attitude of the invalid toward the cattleman was something like that of a peevish perverse child toward an indulgent parent when raidler would leave the ranch mcguire would fall into a fit of malevolent silent sullenness when he returned he would be met by a string of violent and stinging reproaches raidler s attitude toward his charge was quite inexplicable in its way the cattleman seemed actually to assume and feel the character assigned to him by mcguire s intemperate accusations the character of tyrant and guilty oppressor he seemed to have adopted the responsibility of the fellow s condition and he always met his tirades with a pacific patient and even remorseful kindness that never altered one day raidler said to him try more air son you can have the buckboard and a driver every day if you ll go try a week or two in one of the cow camps i ll fix you up plumb comfortable the ground and the air next to it them s the things to cure you i knowed a man from philadelphy sicker than you are got lost on the guadalupe and slept on the bare grass in sheep camps for two weeks well sir it started him getting well which he done close to the ground that s where the medicine in the air stays try a little hossback riding now there s a gentle pony what ve i done to yer screamed mcguire did i ever doublecross yer did i ask you to bring me here drive me out to your camps if you wanter or stick a knife in me and save trouble ride i can t lift my feet i couldn t sidestep a jab from a five year old kid that s what your d d ranch has done for me there s nothing to eat nothing to see and nobody to talk to but a lot of reubens who don t know a punching bag from a lobster salad it s a lonesome place for certain apologised raidler abashedly we got plenty but it s rough enough anything you think of you want the boys ll ride up and fetch it down for you it was chad murchison a cow puncher from the circle bar outfit who first suggested that mcguire s illness was fraudulent chad had brought a basket of grapes for him thirty miles and four out of his way tied to his saddle horn after remaining in the smoke tainted room for a while he emerged and bluntly confided his suspicions to raidler his arm said chad is harder n a diamond he interduced me to what he called a shore perplexus punch and twas like being kicked twice by a mustang he s playin it low down on you curt he ain t no sicker n i am i hate to say it but the runt s workin you for range and shelter the cattleman s ingenuous mind refused to entertain chad s view of the case and when later he came to apply the test doubt entered not into his motives one day about noon two men drove up to the ranch alighted hitched and came in to dinner standing and general invitations being the custom of the country one of them was a great san antonio doctor whose costly services had been engaged by a wealthy cowman who had been laid low by an accidental bullet he was now being driven back to the station to take the train back to town after dinner raidler took him aside pushed a twenty dollar bill against his hand and said doc there s a young chap in that room i guess has got a bad case of consumption i d like for you to look him over and see just how bad he is and if we can do anything for him how much was that dinner i just ate mr raidler said the doctor bluffly looking over his spectacles raidler returned the money to his pocket the doctor immediately entered mcguire s room and the cattleman seated himself upon a heap of saddles on the gallery ready to reproach himself in the event the verdict should be unfavourable in ten minutes the doctor came briskly out your man he said promptly is as sound as a new dollar his lungs are better than mine respiration temperature and pulse normal chest expansion four inches

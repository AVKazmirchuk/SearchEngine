amusement and she looks down that road again and listens now ma am says i there s no use watching cold wheel tracks by this time they re halfway to hush she says holding up her hand and i do hear something coming flip flap in the dark and then there is the awfulest war whoop ever heard outside of madison square garden at a buffalo bill matinee and up the steps and on to the porch jumps the disrespectable indian the lamp in the hall shines on him and i fail to recognize mr j t little bear alumnus of the class of what i see is a cherokee brave and the warpath is what he has been travelling firewater and other things have got him going his buckskin is hanging in strings and his feathers are mixed up like a frizzly hen s the dust of miles is on his moccasins and the light in his eye is the kind the aborigines wear but in his arms he brings that kid his eyes half closed with his little shoes dangling and one hand fast around the indian s collar pappoose says john tom and i notice that the flowers of the white man s syntax have left his tongue he is the original proposition in bear s claws and copper color me bring says he and he lays the kid in his mother s arms run

thimselves mulvaney this is the story that william trotter told me on the beach at aguas frescas while i waited for the gig of the captain of the fruit steamer andador which was to take me abroad reluctantly i was leaving the land of always afternoon william was remaining and he favored me with a condensed oral autobiography as we sat on the sands in the shade cast by the bodega nacional as usual i became aware that the man from bombay had already written the story but as he had compressed it to an eight word sentence i have become an expansionist and have quoted his phrase above with apologies to him and best regards to terence ii don t you ever have a desire to go back to the land of derby hats and starched collars i asked him you seem to be a handy man and a man of action i continued and i am sure i could find you a comfortable job somewhere in the states ragged shiftless barefooted a confirmed eater of the lotos william trotter had pleased me much and i hated to see him gobbled up by the tropics i ve no doubt you could he said idly splitting the bark from a section of sugar cane i ve no doubt you could do much for me if every man could do as much for himself as he can for others every country in the world would be holding millenniums instead of centennials there seemed to be pabulum in w t s words and then another idea came to me i had a brother in chicopee falls who owned manufactories cotton or sugar or a a sheetings or something in the commercial line lie was vulgarly rich and therefore reverenced art the artistic temperament of the family was monopolized at my birth i knew that brother james would honor my slightest wish i would demand from him a position in cotton sugar or sheetings for william trotter something say at two hundred a month or thereabouts i confided my beliefs and made my large propositions to william he had pleased me much and he was ragged while we were talking there was a sound of firing guns four or five rattlingly as if by a squad the cheerful noise came from the direction of the cuartel which is a kind of makeshift barracks for the soldiers of the republic

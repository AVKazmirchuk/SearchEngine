libraries in bagdad well now can you whistle up a fairy that ll solve this hen query or not when the young man ceased the margrave arose and paced to and fro by the park bench for several minutes finally he sat again and said in grave and impressive tones i must confess sir that during the eight years that i have spent in search of adventure and in relieving distress i have never encountered a more interesting or a more perplexing case i fear that i have overlooked hens in my researches and observations as to their habits their times and manner of laying their many varieties and cross breedings their span of life their oh don t make an ibsen drama of it interrupted the young man flippantly riddles especially old hildebrant s riddles don t have to be worked out seriously they are light themes such as sim ford and harry thurston peck like to handle but somehow i can t strike just the answer bill watson may and he may not to morrow will tell well your majesty i m glad anyhow that you butted in and whiled the time away i guess mr al rashid himself would have bounced back if one of his constituents had conducted him up against this riddle i ll say good night peace fo yours

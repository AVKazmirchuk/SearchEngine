window when he entered their room she was still clothed as when they were on the porch outside and crowding against the window was a giant apple tree full blossomed robert sighed and went near the window he was ready to meet his fate a confessed vulgarian he foresaw the verdict of justice in the shape of that whiteclad form he knew the rigid lines that a van der pool would draw he was a peasant gam bolling indecorously in the valley and the pure cold white unthawed summit of the matterhorn could not but frown on him he had been unmasked by his own actions all the polish the poise the form that the city had given him had fallen from him like an ill fitting mantle at the first breath of a country breeze dully be awaited the approaching condemna tion robert said the calm cool voice of his judge i thought i married a gentleman yes it was coming and yet in the face of it robert walmsley was eagerly regarding a certain branch of the apple tree upon which be used to climb out of that very window he believed he could do it now he wondered bow many blossoms there were on the tree ten millions but here was some one speaking again i thought i married a gentleman the voice went on but why had she come and was standing so close by his side but i find that i have married was this alicia talking something better a man bob dear kiss me won t you the city was far away the shocks of doom here is an aristocracy of the public parks and even of the vagabonds who use them for their private apartments vallance felt rather than knew this but when he stepped down out of his world into chaos his feet brought him directly to madison square raw and astringent as a schoolgirl of the old order young may breathed austerely among the budding trees vallance buttoned his coat lighted his last cigarette and took his seat upon a bench for three minutes be mildly regretted the last hundred of his last thousand that it had cost him when the bicycle cop put an end to his last automobile ride then he felt in every pocket and found not a single penny he had given up his apartment that morning his furniture had gone toward certain debts his clothes save what were upon him had descended to his man servant for back wages as he sat there was not in the whole city for him a bed or a broiled lobster or a street car fare or a carnation for buttonhole unless be should obtain them by spong on his friends or by false pretenses therefore lie had chosen the park and all this was because an uncle had disinherited him and cut down his allowance from liberality to nothing and all that was because his nephew had disobeyed him concerning a certain girl who comes not into this story therefore all readers who brush their hair toward its roots may be warned to read no further there was another nephew of a different branch who had once been the prospective heir and favorite being without grace or hope he had long ago disappeared in the mire now drag nets were out for him he was to be rehabilitated and restored and so vallance fell grandly as lucifer to the lowest pit joining the tattered ghosts in the little park sitting there he leaned far back on the hard bench and laughed a jet of cigarette smoke up to the lowest tree branches the sudden severing of all his life s ties had brought him a free thrilling almost joyous elation he felt precisely the sensation of the aero naut when he cuts loose his parachute and lets his balloon drift away the hour was nearly ten not many loungers were on the benches the park dweller though a stubborn fighter against autumnal coolness is slow to attack the advance line of spring s chilly cohorts then arose one from a seat near the leaping foun tain and came and sat himself at vallance s side he was either young or old cheap lodging houses had flavored him mustily razors and combs had passed him by in him drink had been bottled and sealed in the devil s bond he begged a match which is the form of introduction among park benchers and then he began to talk you re not one of the regulars he said to val lance i know tailored clothes when i see em you just stopped for a moment on your way through the park don t mind my talking to you for a while i ve got to be with somebody i m afraid i m afraid i ve told two or three of those bummers over about it they think i m crazy say let tell you all i ve had to eat to day was a couple pretzels and an apple to morrow i ll stand in to inherit three millions and that restaurant you ee over there with the autos around it will be too for me to eat in don t believe it do you without the slightest trouble said vallance with a laugh i lunched there yesterday to night i couldn t buy a five cent cup of coffee you don t look like one of us well i guess those things happen i used to be a high flyer myself years ago what knocked you out of the game i oh i lost my job said vallance it s undiluted hades this city went on the other one day you re eating from china the next you are eating in china a chop suey joint i ve had more than my share of hard luck for five years i ve been little better than a panhandler i was

happened to them they had money to buy anything they wanted but they didn t know what to want their ideas of spendthriftiness were limited to three whisky saddles and gold watches if there was anything else in the world to throw away fortunes on they had never heard about it so when they wanted to have a hot time they d ride into town and get a city directory and stand in front of the principal saloon and call up the population alphabetically for free drinks then they would order three or four new california saddles from the storekeeper and play crack loo on the sidewalk with twenty dollar gold pieces betting who could throw his gold watch the farthest was an inspiration of george s but even that was getting to be monotonous was i on to the opportunity listen in thirty minutes i had dashed off a word picture of metropolitan joys that made life in atascosa city look as dull as a trip to coney island with your own wife in ten minutes more we shook hands on an agreement that i was to act as his guide interpreter and friend in and to the aforesaid wassail and amenity and solomon mills which was his name was to pay all expenses for a month at the end of that time if i had made good as director general of the rowdy life he was to pay me one thousand dollars and then to clinch the bargain we called the roll of atascosa city and put all of its citizens except the ladies and minors under the table except one man named horace westervelt st clair just for that we bought a couple of hatfuls of cheap silver watches and egged him out of town with em we wound up by dragging the harness maker out of bed and setting him to work on three new saddles and then we went to sleep across the railroad track at the depot just to annoy the s a a p think of having seventy five thousand dollars and trying to avoid the disgrace of dying rich in a town like that the next day george who was married or something started back to the ranch me and solly as i now called him prepared to shake off our moth balls and wing our way against the arc lights of the joyous and tuneful east no way stops says i to solly except long enough to get you barbered and haberdashed this is no texas feet shampetter says i where you eat chili concarne con huevos and then holler whoopee across the plaza we re now going against the real high life we re going to mingle with the set that carries a spitz wears spats and hits the ground in high spots solly puts six thousand dollars in century bills in one pocket of his brown ducks and bills of lading for ten thousand dollars on eastern banks in another then i resume diplomatic relations with the s a a p and we hike in a northwesterly direction on our circuitous route to the spice gardens of the yankee orient we stopped in san antonio long enough for solly to buy some clothes and eight rounds of drinks for the guests and employees of the menger hotel and order four mexican saddles with silver trimmings and white angora suaderos to be shipped down to the ranch from there we made a big jump to st louis we got there in time for dinner and i put our thumb prints on the register of the most expensive hotel in the city now says i to solly with a wink at myself here s the first dinner station we ve struck where we can get a real good plate of beans and while he was up in his room trying to draw water out of the gas pipe i got one finger in the buttonhole of the head waiter s tuxedo drew him apart inserted a two dollar bill and closed him up again frankoyse says i i have a pal here for dinner that s been subsisting for years on cereals and short stogies you see the chef and order a dinner for us such as you serve to dave francis and the general passenger agent of the iron mountain when they eat here we ve got more than bernhardt s tent full of money and we want the nose bags crammed with all the chief deveries de cuisine object is no expense now show us at six o clock me and solly sat down to dinner spread there s nothing been seen like it since the cambon snack it was all served at once the chef called it dinnay a la poker it s a famous thing among the gormands of the west the dinner comes in threes of a kind there was guinea fowls guinea pigs and guinness s stout roast veal mock turtle soup and chicken pate shad roe caviar and tapioca canvas back duck canvas back ham and cotton tail rabbit philadelphia capon fried snails and sloe gin and so on in threes the idea was that you eat nearly all you can of them and then the waiter takes away the discard and gives you pears to fill on i was sure solly would be tickled to death with these hands after the bobtail flushes he d been eating on the ranch and i was a little anxious that he should for i didn t remember his having honoured my efforts with a smile since we left atascosa city we were in the main dining room and there was a fine dressed crowd there all talking loud and enjoyable about the two st louis topics the water supply and the colour line they mix the two subjects so fast that strangers often think they are discussing water colours and that has given the old town something of a rep as an art centre and over in the corner was a fine brass band playing and now thinks i solly will become conscious of the spiritual oats of life nourishing and exhilarating his system but nong mong frang he gazed across the table at me there was four square yards of it looking like the path of a cyclone that has wandered through a stock yard a poultry farm a vegetable garden and an irish linen mill solly gets up and comes around to me luke says he i m pretty hungry after our ride i thought you said they had some beans here i m going out and get something i can eat you can stay and monkey with this artificial layout of grub if you want to wait a minute says i i called the waiter and slapped s mills on the back of the check for thirteen dollars and fifty cents what do you mean says i by serving gentlemen with a lot of truck only suitable for deck hands on a mississippi steamboat we re going out to get something decent to eat i walked up the street with the unhappy plainsman he saw a saddle shop open and some of the sadness faded from his eyes we went in and he ordered and paid for two more saddles one with a solid silver horn and nails and ornaments and a six inch border of rhinestones and imitation rubies around the flaps the other one had to have a gold mounted horn quadruple plated stirrups and the leather inlaid with silver beadwork wherever it would stand it eleven hundred dollars the two cost him then he goes out and heads toward the river following his nose in a little side street where there was no street and no sidewalks and no houses he finds what he is looking for we go into a shanty and sit on high stools among stevedores and boatmen and eat beans with tin spoons yes sir beans beans boiled with salt pork i kind of thought we d strike some over this way says solly delightful says i that stylish hotel grub may appeal to some but for me give me the husky table d goat when we had succumbed to the beans i leads him out of the tarpaulin steam under a lamp post and pulls out a daily paper with the amusement column folded out but now what ho for a merry round of pleasure says i here s one of hall caine s shows and a stock yard company in hamlet and skating at the hollowhorn rink and sarah bernhardt and the shapely syrens burlesque company i should think now that the shapely but what does this healthy wealthy and wise man do but reach his arms up to the second story windows and gape noisily reckon i ll be going to bed says he it s about my time st louis is a kind of quiet place ain t it oh yes says i ever since the railroads ran in here the town s been practically ruined and the building and loan associations and the fair have about killed it guess we might as well go to bed wait till you see chicago though shall we get tickets for the big breeze to morrow mought as well says solly i reckon all these towns are about alike well maybe the wise cicerone and personal conductor didn t fall hard in chicago loolooville on the lake is supposed to have one or two things in it calculated to keep the rural visitor awake after the curfew rings but not for the grass fed man of the pampas i tried him with theatres rides in automobiles sails on the lake champagne suppers and all those little inventions that hold the simple life in check but in vain solly grew sadder day by day and i got fearful about my salary and knew i must play my trump card so i mentioned new york to him and informed him that these western towns were no more than gateways to the great walled city of the whirling dervishes after i bought the tickets i missed solly i knew his habits by then so in a couple of hours i found him in a saddle shop they had some new ideas there in the way of trees and girths that had strayed down from the canadian mounted police and solly was so interested that he almost looked reconciled to live he invested about nine hundred dollars in there at the depot i telegraphed a cigar store man i knew in new york to meet me at the twenty third street ferry with a list of all the saddle stores in the city i wanted to know where to look for solly when he got lost now i ll tell you what happened in new york i says to myself friend heherezade you want to get busy and make bagdad look pretty to the sad sultan of the sour countenance or it ll be the bowstring for yours but i never had any doubt i could do it i began with him like you d feed a starving man i showed him the horse cars on broadway and the staten island ferry boats and then i piled up the sensations on him but always keeping a lot of warmer ones up my sleeve at the end of the third day he looked like a composite picture of five thousand orphans too late to catch a picnic steamboat and i was wilting down a collar every two hours wondering how i could please him and whether i was going to get my thou he went to sleep looking at the brooklyn bridge he disregarded the sky scrapers above the third story it took three ushers to wake him up at the liveliest vaudeville in town once i thought i had him i nailed a pair of cuffs on him one morning before he was awake and i dragged him that evening to the palm cage of one of the biggest hotels in the city to see the johnnies and the alice sit by the hours they were out in numerous quantities with the fat of the land showing in their clothes while we were looking them over solly divested himself of a fearful rusty kind of laugh like moving a folding bed with one roller broken it was his first in two weeks and it gave me hope right you are says i they re a funny lot of post cards aren t they oh i wasn t thinking of them dudes and culls on the hoof says he i was thinking of the time me and george put sheep dip in horsehead johnson s whisky i wish i was back in atascosa city says he i felt a cold chill run down my back me to play and mate in one move says i to myself i made solly promise to stay in the cafe for half an hour and i hiked out in a cab to lolabelle delatour s flat on forty third street i knew her well she was a chorus girl in a broadway musical comedy jane says i when i found her i ve got a friend from texas here he s all right but well he carries weight i d like to give him a little whirl after the show this evening bubbles you know and a buzz out to a casino for the whitebait and pickled walnuts is it a go can he sing asks lolabelle you know says i that i wouldn t take him away from home unless his notes were good he s got pots of money bean pots full of it bring him around after the second act says lolabelle and i ll examine his credentials and securities so about ten o clock that evening i led solly to miss delatour s dressing room and her maid let us in in ten minutes in comes lolabelle fresh from the stage looking stunning in the costume she wears when she steps from the ranks of the lady grenadiers and says to the king welcome to our may day revels and you can bet it wasn t the way she spoke the lines that got her the part as soon as solly saw her he got up and walked straight out through the stage entrance into the street i followed him lolabelle wasn t paying my salary i wondered whether anybody was luke says solly outside that was an awful mistake we must have got into the lady s private room i hope i m gentleman enough to do anything possible in the way of apologies do you reckon she d ever forgive us she may forget it says i of course it was a mistake let s go find some beans that s the way it went but pretty soon afterward solly failed to show up at dinner time for several days i cornered him he confessed that he had found a restaurant on third avenue where they cooked beans in texas style i made him take me there the minute i set foot inside the door i threw up my hands there was a young woman at the desk and solly introduced me to her and then we sat down and had beans yes sir sitting at the desk was the kind of a young woman that can catch any man in the world as easy as lifting a finger there s a way of doing it she knew i saw her working it she was healthy looking and plain dressed she had her hair drawn back from her forehead and face no curls or frizzes that s the way she looked now i ll tell you the way they work the game it s simple when she wants a man she manages it so that every time he looks at her he finds her looking at him that s all the next evening solly was to go to coney island with me at seven at eight o clock he hadn t showed up i went out and found a cab i felt sure there was something wrong drive to the back home restaurant on third avenue says i and if i don t find what i want there take in these saddle shops i handed him the list boss says the cabby i et a steak in that restaurant once if you re real hungry i advise you to try the saddle shops first i m a detective says i and i don t eat hurry up as soon as i got to the restaurant i felt in the lines of my palms that i should beware of a tall red damfool man and i was going to lose a sum of money solly wasn t there neither was the smooth haired lady i waited and in an hour they came in a cab and got out hand in hand i asked solly to step around the corner for a few words he was grinning clear across his face but i had not administered the grin she s the greatest that ever sniffed the breeze says he congrats says i i d like to have my thousand now if you please well luke says he i don t know that i ve had such a skyhoodlin fine time under your tutelage and dispensation but i ll do the best i can for you i ll do the best i can he repeats me and miss skinner was married an hour ago we re leaving for texas in the morning great says i consider yourself covered with rice and congress gaiters but don t let s tie so many satin bows on our business relations that we lose sight of em how about my honorarium missis mills says he has taken possession of my money and papers except six bits i told her what i d agreed to give you but she says it s an irreligious and illegal contract and she won t pay a cent of it but i ain t going to see you treated unfair says he i ve got eighty seven saddles on the ranch what i ve bought on this trip and when i get back i m going to pick out the best six in the lot and send em to you and did he i asked when lucullus ceased talking he did and they are fit for kings to ride on the six he sent me must have cost him three thousand dollars but where is the market for em who would buy one except one of these rajahs and princes of asia and africa i ve got em all on the list i know every tan royal dub and smoked princerino from mindanao to the caspian sea it s a long time between customers i ventured they re coming faster said polk nowadays when one of the murdering mutts gets civilised enough to abolish suttee and quit using his whiskers for a napkin he calls himself the roosevelt of the east and comes over to investigate our chautauquas and cocktails i ll place em all yet now look here from an inside pocket he drew a tightly folded newspaper with much worn edges and indicated a paragraph read that said the saddler to royalty the paragraph ran thus his highness seyyid feysal bin turkee imam of muskat is one of the most progressive and enlightened rulers of the old world his stables contain more than a thousand horses of the purest persian breeds it is said that this powerful prince contemplates a visit to the united states at an early date there said mr polk triumphantly my best saddle is as good as sold the one with turquoises set in the rim of the cantle have you three dollars that you could loan me for a short time it happened that i had and i did if this should meet the eye of the imam of muskat may it quicken his whim to visit the land of the free otherwise i fear that i shall be longer than a short time separated from my dollars three hygeia at the solito if you are knowing in the chronicles of the ring you will recall to mind an event in the early nineties when for a minute and sundry odd seconds a champion and a would be faced each other on the alien side of an international river so brief a conflict had rarely imposed upon the fair promise of true sport the reporters made what they could of it but divested of padding the action was sadly fugacious the champion merely smote his victim turned his back upon him remarking i know what i done to dat stiff and extended an arm like a ship s mast for his glove to be removed which accounts for a trainload of extremely disgusted gentlemen in an uproar of fancy vests and neck wear being spilled from their pullmans in san antonio in the early morning following the fight which also partly accounts for the unhappy predicament in which cricket mcguire found himself as he tumbled from his car and sat upon the depot platform torn by a spasm of that hollow racking cough so familiar to san antonian ears at that time in the uncertain light of dawn that way passed curtis raidler the nueces county cattleman may his shadow never measure under six foot two the cattleman out this early to catch the south bound for his ranch station stopped at the side of the distressed patron of sport and spoke in the kindly drawl of his ilk and region got it pretty bad bud cricket mcguire ex feather weight prizefighter tout jockey follower of the ponies all round sport and manipulator of the gum balls and walnut shells looked up pugnaciously at the imputation cast by bud g wan he rasped telegraph pole i didn t ring for yer another paroxysm wrung him and he leaned limply against a convenient baggage truck raidler waited patiently glancing around at the white hats short overcoats and big cigars thronging the platform you re from the no th ain t you bud he asked when the other was partially recovered come down to see the fight fight snapped mcguire puss in the corner twas a hypodermic injection handed him just one like a squirt of dope and he s asleep and no tanbark needed in front of his residence fight he rattled a bit coughed and went on hardly addressing the cattleman but rather for the relief of voicing his troubles no more dead sure t ings for me but rus sage himself would have snatched at it five to one dat de boy from cork wouldn t stay t ree rounds is what i invested in put my last cent on and could already smell the sawdust in dat all night joint of jimmy delaney s on t irty seventh street i was goin to buy and den say telegraph pole what a gazaboo a guy is to put his whole roll on one turn of the gaboozlum you re plenty right said the big cattleman more specially when you lose son you get up and light out for a hotel you got a mighty bad cough had it long lungs said mcguire comprehensively i got it the croaker says i ll come to time for six months longer maybe a year if i hold my gait i wanted to settle down and take care of myself dat s why i speculated on dat five to one perhaps i had a t ousand iron dollars saved up if i winned i was goin to buy delaney s cafe who d a t ought dat stiff would take a nap in de foist round say it s a hard deal commented raidler looking down at the diminutive form of mcguire crumpled against the truck but you go to a hotel and rest there s the menger and the maverick and and the fi th av noo and the waldorf astoria mimicked mcguire told you i went broke i m on de bum proper i ve got one dime left maybe a trip to europe or a sail in me private yacht would fix me up pa per he flung his dime at a newsboy got his express propped his back against the truck and was at once rapt in the account of his waterloo as expanded by the ingenious press curtis raidler interrogated an enormous gold watch and laid his hand on mcguire s shoulder come on bud he said we got three minutes to catch the train sarcasm seemed to be mcguire s vein you ain t seen me cash in any chips or call a turn since i told you i was broke a minute ago have you friend chase yourself away you re going down to my ranch said the cattleman and stay till you get well six months ll fix you good as new he lifted mcguire with one hand and half dragged him in the direction of the train what about the money said mcguire struggling weakly to escape money for what asked raidler puzzled they eyed each other not understanding for they touched only as at the gear of bevelled cog wheels at right angles and moving upon different axes passengers on the south bound saw them seated together and wondered at the conflux of two such antipodes mcguire was five feet one with a countenance belonging to either yokohama or dublin bright beady of eye bony of cheek and jaw scarred toughened broken and reknit indestructible grisly gladiatorial as a hornet he was a type neither new nor unfamiliar raidler was the product of a different soil six feet two in height miles broad and no deeper than a crystal brook he represented the union of the west and south few accurate pictures of his kind have been made for art galleries are so small and the mutoscope is as yet unknown in texas after all the only possible medium of portrayal of raidler s kind would be the fresco something high and simple and cool and unframed they were rolling southward on the international the timber was huddling into little dense green motts at rare distances before the inundation of the downright vert prairies this was the land of the ranches the domain of the kings of the kine mcguire sat collapsed into his corner of the seat receiving with acid suspicion the conversation of the cattleman what was the game of this big geezer who was carrying him off altruism would have been mcguire s last guess he ain t no farmer thought the captive and he ain t no con man for sure w at s his lay you trail in cricket and see how many cards he draws you re up against it anyhow you got a nickel and gallopin consumption and you better lay low lay low and see w at s his game at rincon a hundred miles from san antonio they left the train for a buckboard which was waiting there for raidler in this they travelled the thirty miles between the station and their destination if anything could this drive should have stirred the acrimonious mcguire to a sense of his ransom they sped upon velvety wheels across an exhilarant savanna the pair of spanish ponies struck a nimble tireless trot which gait they occasionally relieved by a wild untrammelled gallop the air was wine and seltzer perfumed as they absorbed it with the delicate redolence of prairie flowers the road perished and the buckboard swam the uncharted billows of the grass itself steered by the practised hand of raidler to whom each tiny distant mott of trees was a signboard each convolution of the low hills a voucher of course and distance but mcguire reclined upon his spine seeing nothing but a desert and receiving the cattleman s advances with sullen distrust w at s he up to was the burden of his thoughts w at kind of a gold brick has the big guy got to sell mcguire was only applying the measure of the streets he had walked to a range bounded by the horizon and the fourth dimension a week before while riding the prairies raidler had come upon a sick and weakling calf deserted and bawling without dismounting he had reached and slung the distressed bossy across his saddle and dropped it at the ranch for the boys to attend to it was impossible for mcguire to know or comprehend that in the eyes of the cattleman his case and that of the calf were identical in interest and demand upon his assistance a creature was ill and helpless he had the power to render aid these were the only postulates required for the cattleman to act they formed his system of logic and the most of his creed mcguire was the seventh invalid whom raidler had picked up thus casually in san antonio where so many thousand go for the ozone that is said to linger about its contracted streets five of them had been guests of solito ranch until they had been able to leave cured or better and exhausting the vocabulary of tearful gratitude one came too late but rested very comfortably at last under a ratama tree in the garden so then it was no surprise to the ranchhold when the buckboard spun to the door and raidler took up his debile protege like a handful of rags and set him down upon the gallery mcguire looked upon things strange to him the ranch house was the best in the country it was built of brick hauled one hundred miles by wagon but it was of but one story and its four rooms were completely encircled by a mud floor gallery the miscellaneous setting of horses dogs saddles wagons guns and cow punchers paraphernalia oppressed the metropolitan eyes of the wrecked sportsman well here we are at home said raidler cheeringly it s a h l of a looking place said mcguire promptly as he rolled upon the gallery floor in a fit of coughing we ll try to make it comfortable for you buddy said the cattleman gently it ain t fine inside but it s the outdoors anyway that ll do you the most good this ll be your room in here anything we got you ask for it he led mcguire into the east room the floor was bare and clean white curtains waved in the gulf breeze through the open windows a big willow rocker two straight chairs a long table covered with newspapers pipes tobacco spurs and cartridges stood in the centre some well mounted heads of deer and one of an enormous black javeli projected from the walls a wide cool cot bed stood in a corner nueces county people regarded this guest chamber as fit for a prince mcguire showed his eyeteeth at it he took out his nickel and spun it up to the ceiling t ought i was lyin about the money did ye well you can frisk me if you wanter dat s the last simoleon in the treasury who s goin to pay the cattleman s clear grey eyes looked steadily from under his grizzly brows into the huckleberry optics of his guest after a little he said simply and not ungraciously i ll be much obliged to you son if you won t mention money any more once was quite a plenty folks i ask to my ranch don t have to pay anything and they very scarcely ever offers it supper ll be ready in half an hour there s water in the pitcher and some cooler to drink in that red jar hanging on the gallery where s the bell asked mcguire looking about bell for what bell to ring for things i can t see here he exploded in a sudden weak fury i never asked you to bring me here i never held you up for a cent i never gave you a hard luck story till you asked me here i am fifty miles from a bellboy or a cocktail i m sick i can t hustle gee but i m up against it mcguire fell upon the cot and sobbed shiveringly raidler went to the door and called a slender bright complexioned mexican youth about twenty came quickly raidler spoke to him in spanish ylario it is in my mind that i promised you the position of vaquero on the san carlos range at the fall rodeo si senor such was your goodness listen this senorito is my friend he is very sick place yourself at his side attend to his wants at all times have much patience and care with him and when he is well or and when he is well instead of vaquero i will make you mayordomo of the rancho de las piedras esta bueno si si mil gracias senor ylario tried to kneel upon the floor in his gratitude but the cattleman kicked at him benevolently growling none of your opery house antics now ten minutes later ylario came from mcguire s room and stood before raidler the little senor he announced presents his compliments raidler credited ylario with the preliminary and desires some pounded ice one hot bath one gin feez z that the windows be all closed toast one shave one newyorkheral cigarettes and to send one telegram raidler took a quart bottle of whisky from his medicine cabinet here take him this he said thus was instituted the reign of terror at the solito ranch for a few weeks mcguire blustered and boasted and swaggered before the cow punchers who rode in for miles around to see this latest importation of raidler s he was an absolutely new experience to them he explained to them all the intricate points of sparring and the tricks of training and defence he opened to their minds view all the indecorous life of a tagger after professional sports his jargon of slang was a continuous joy and surprise to them his gestures his strange poses his frank ribaldry of tongue and principle fascinated them he was like a being from a new world strange to say this new world he had entered did not exist to him he was an utter egoist of bricks and mortar he had dropped out he felt into open space for a time and all it contained was an audience for his reminiscences neither the limitless freedom of the prairie days nor the grand hush of the close drawn spangled nights touched him all the hues of aurora could not win him from the pink pages of a sporting journal get something for nothing was his mission in life thirty seventh street was his goal nearly two months after his arrival he began to complain that he felt worse it was then that he became the ranch s incubus its harpy its old man of the sea he shut himself in his room like some venomous kobold or flibbertigibbet whining complaining cursing accusing the keynote of his plaint was that he had been inveigled into a gehenna against his will that he was dying of neglect and lack of comforts with all his dire protestations of increasing illness to the eye of others he remained unchanged his currant like eyes were as bright and diabolic as ever his voice was as rasping his callous face with the skin drawn tense as a drum head had no flesh to lose a flush on his prominent cheek bones each afternoon hinted that a clinical thermometer might have revealed a symptom and percussion might have established the fact that mcguire was breathing with only one lung but his appearance remained the same in constant attendance upon him was ylario whom the coming reward of the mayordomoship must have greatly stimulated for mcguire chained him to a bitter existence the air the man s only chance for life he commanded to be kept out by closed windows and drawn curtains the room was always blue and foul with cigarette smoke whosoever entered it must sit suffocating and listen to the imp s interminable gasconade concerning his scandalous career the oddest thing of all was the relation existing between mcguire and his benefactor the attitude of the invalid toward the cattleman was something like that of a peevish perverse child toward an indulgent parent when raidler would leave the ranch mcguire would fall into a fit of malevolent silent sullenness when he returned he would be met by a string of violent and stinging reproaches raidler s attitude toward his charge was quite inexplicable in its way the cattleman seemed actually to assume and feel the character assigned to him by mcguire s intemperate accusations the character of tyrant and guilty oppressor he seemed to have adopted the responsibility of the fellow s condition and he always met his tirades with a pacific patient and even remorseful kindness that never altered one day raidler said to him try more air son you can have the buckboard and a driver every day if you ll go try a week or two in one of the cow camps i ll fix you up plumb comfortable the ground and the air next to it them s the things to cure you i knowed a man from philadelphy sicker than you are got lost on the guadalupe and slept on the bare grass in sheep camps for two weeks well sir it started him getting well which he done close to the ground that s where the medicine in the air stays try a little hossback riding now there s a gentle pony what ve i done to yer screamed mcguire did i ever doublecross yer did i ask you to bring me here drive me out to your camps if you wanter or stick a knife in me and save trouble ride i can t lift my feet i couldn t sidestep a jab from a five year old kid that s what your d d ranch has done for me there s nothing to eat nothing to see and nobody to talk to but a lot of reubens who don t know a punching bag from a lobster salad it s a lonesome place for certain apologised raidler abashedly we got plenty but it s rough enough anything you think of you want the boys ll ride up and fetch it down for you it was chad murchison a cow puncher from the circle bar outfit who first suggested that mcguire s illness was fraudulent chad had brought a basket of grapes for him thirty miles and four out of his way tied to his saddle horn after remaining in the smoke tainted room for a while he emerged and bluntly confided his suspicions to raidler his arm said chad is harder n a diamond he interduced me to what he called a shore perplexus punch and twas like being kicked twice by a mustang he s playin it low down on you curt he ain t no sicker n i am i hate to say it but the runt s workin you for range and shelter the cattleman s ingenuous mind refused to entertain chad s view of the case and when later he came to apply the test doubt entered not into his motives one day about noon two men drove up to the ranch alighted hitched and came in to dinner standing and general invitations being the custom of the country one of them was a great san antonio doctor whose costly services had been engaged by a wealthy cowman who had been laid low by an accidental bullet he was now being driven back to the station to take the train back to town after dinner raidler took him aside pushed a twenty dollar bill against his hand and said doc there s a young chap in that room i guess has got a bad case of consumption i d like for you to look him over and see just how bad he is and if we can do anything for him how much was that dinner i just ate mr raidler said the doctor bluffly looking over his spectacles raidler returned the money to his pocket the doctor immediately entered mcguire s room and the cattleman seated himself upon a heap of saddles on the gallery ready to reproach himself in the event the verdict should be unfavourable in ten minutes the doctor came briskly out your man he said promptly is as sound as a new dollar his lungs are better than mine respiration temperature and pulse normal chest expansion four inches not a sign of weakness anywhere of course i didn t examine for the bacillus but it isn t there you can put my name to the diagnosis even cigarettes and a vilely close room haven t hurt him coughs does he well you tell him it isn t necessary you asked if there is anything we could do for him well i advise you to set him digging post holes or breaking mustangs there s our team ready good day sir and like a puff of wholesome blustery wind the doctor was off raidler reached out and plucked a leaf from a mesquite bush by the railing and began chewing it thoughtfully the branding season was at hand and the next morning ross hargis foreman of the outfit was mustering his force of some twenty five men at the ranch ready to start for the san carlos range where the work was to begin by six o clock the horses were all saddled the grub wagon ready and the cow punchers were swinging themselves upon their mounts when raidler bade them wait a boy was bringing up an extra pony bridled and saddled to the gate raidler walked to mcguire s room and threw open the door mcguire was lying on his cot not yet dressed smoking get up said the cattleman and his voice was clear and brassy like a bugle how s that asked mcguire a little startled get up and dress i can stand a rattlesnake but i hate a liar do i have to tell you again he caught mcguire by the neck and stood him on the floor say friend cried mcguire wildly are you bug house i m sick see i ll croak if i got to hustle what ve i done to yer he began his chronic whine i never asked yer to put on your clothes called raidler in a rising tone swearing stumbling shivering keeping his amazed shining eyes upon the now menacing form of the aroused cattleman mcguire managed to tumble into his clothes then raidler took him by the collar and shoved him out and across the yard to the extra pony hitched at the gate the cow punchers lolled in their saddles open mouthed take this man said raidler to ross hargis and put him to work make him work hard sleep hard and eat hard you boys know i done what i could for him and he was welcome yesterday the best doctor in san antone examined him and says he s got the lungs of a burro and the constitution of a steer you know what to do with him ross ross hargis only smiled grimly aw said mcguire looking intently at raidler with a peculiar expression upon his face the croaker said i was all right did he said i was fakin did he you put him onto me you t ought i wasn t sick you said i was a liar say friend i talked rough i know but i didn t mean most of it if you felt like i did aw i forgot i ain t sick the croaker says well friend now i ll go work for yer here s where you play even he sprang into the saddle easily as a bird got the quirt from the horn and gave his pony a slash with it cricket who once brought in good boy by a neck at hawthorne and a to shot had his foot in the stirrups again mcguire led the cavalcade as they dashed away for san carlos and the cow punchers gave a yell of applause as they closed in behind his dust but in less than a mile he had lagged to the rear and was last man when they struck the patch of high chaparral below the horse pens behind a clump of this he drew rein and held a handkerchief to his mouth he took it away drenched with bright arterial blood and threw it carefully into a clump of prickly pear then he slashed with his quirt again gasped g wan to his astonished pony and galloped after the gang that night raidler received a message from his old home in alabama there had been a death in the family an estate was to divide and they called for him to come daylight found him in the buckboard skimming the prairies for the station it was two months before he returned when he arrived at the ranch house he found it well nigh deserted save for ylario who acted as a kind of steward during his absence little by little the youth made him acquainted with the work done while he was away the branding camp he was informed was still doing business on account of many severe storms the cattle had been badly scattered and the branding had been accomplished but slowly the camp was now in the valley of the guadalupe twenty miles away by the way said raidler suddenly remembering that fellow i sent along with them mcguire is he working yet i do not know said ylario mans from the camp come verree few times to the ranch so plentee work with the leetle calves they no say oh i think that fellow mcguire he dead much time ago dead said raidler what you talking about verree sick fellow mcguire replied ylario with a shrug of his shoulder i theenk he no live one two month when he go away shucks said raidler he humbugged you too did he the doctor examined him and said he was sound as a mesquite knot that doctor said ylario smiling he tell you so that doctor no see mcguire talk up ordered raidler what the devil do you mean mcguire continued the boy tranquilly he getting drink water outside when that doctor come in room that doctor take me and pound me all over here with his fingers putting his hand to his chest i not know for what he put his ear here and here and here and listen i not know for what he put little glass stick in my mouth he feel my arm here he make me count like whisper so twenty treinta cuarenta who knows concluded ylario with a deprecating spread of his hands for what that doctor do those verree droll and such like things what horses are up asked raidler shortly paisano is grazing out behind the little corral senor saddle him for me at once within a very few minutes the cattleman was mounted and away paisano well named after that ungainly but swift running bird struck into his long lope that ate up the ground like a strip of macaroni in two hours and a quarter raidler from a gentle swell saw the branding camp by a water hole in the guadalupe sick with expectancy of the news he feared he rode up dismounted and dropped paisano s reins so gentle was his heart that at that moment he would have pleaded guilty to the murder of mcguire the only being in the camp was the cook who was just arranging the hunks of barbecued beef and distributing the tin coffee cups for supper raidler evaded a direct question concerning the one subject in his mind everything all right in camp pete he managed to inquire so so said pete conservatively grub give out twice wind scattered the cattle and we ve had to rake the brush for forty mile i need a new coffee pot and the mosquitos is some more hellish than common the boys all well pete was no optimist besides inquiries concerning the health of cow punchers were not only superfluous but bordered on flaccidity it was not like the boss to make them what s left of em don t miss no calls to grub the cook conceded what s left of em repeated raidler in a husky voice mechanically he began to look around for mcguire s grave he had in his mind a white slab such as he had seen in the alabama church yard but immediately he knew that was foolish sure said pete what s left cow camps change in two months some s gone raidler nerved himself that chap i sent along mcguire did he say interrupted pete rising with a chunk of corn bread in each hand that was a dirty shame sending that poor sick kid to a cow camp a doctor that couldn t tell he was graveyard meat ought to be skinned with a cinch buckle game as he was too it s a scandal among snakes lemme tell you what he done first night in camp the boys started to initiate him in the leather breeches degree ross hargis busted him one swipe with his chaparreras and what do you reckon the poor child did got up the little skeeter and licked ross licked ross hargis licked him good hit him plenty and everywhere and hard ross d just get up and pick out a fresh place to lay down on agin then that mcguire goes off there and lays down with his head in the grass and bleeds a hem ridge they calls it he lays there eighteen hours by the watch and they can t budge him then ross hargis who loves any man who can lick him goes to work and damns the doctors from greenland to poland chiny and him and green branch johnson they gets mcguire into a tent and spells each other feedin him chopped raw meat and whisky but it looks like the kid ain t got no appetite to git well for they misses him from the tent in the night and finds him rootin in the grass and likewise a drizzle fallin g wan he says lemme go and die like i wanter he said i was a liar and a fake and i was playin sick lemme alone two weeks went on the cook he laid around not noticin nobody and then a sudden thunder filled the air and a score of galloping centaurs crashed through the brush into camp illustrious rattlesnakes exclaimed pete springing all ways at once here s the boys come and i m an assassinated man if supper ain t ready in three minutes but raidler saw only one thing a little brown faced grinning chap springing from his saddle in the full light of the fire mcguire was not like that and yet in another instant the cattleman was holding him by the hand and shoulder son son how goes it was all he found to say close to the ground says you shouted mcguire crunching raidler s fingers in a grip of steel and dat s where i found it healt and strengt and tumbled to what a cheap skate i been actin t anks fer kickin me out old man and say de joke s on dat croaker ain t it i

whitest bunch of sports i ever travelled with you ll let me stay won t yer old man raidler looked wonderingly toward ross hargis that cussed little runt remarked ross tenderly is the jo dartin est hustler and the hardest hitter in anybody s cow camp an afternoon miracle at the united states end of an international river bridge four armed rangers sweltered in a little dobe hut keeping a fairly faithful espionage upon the lagging trail of passengers from the mexican side bud dawson proprietor of the top notch saloon had on the evening previous violently ejected from his premises one leandro garcia for alleged violation of the top notch code of behaviour garcia had mentioned twenty four hours as a limit by which time he would call and collect a painful indemnity for personal satisfaction this mexican although a tremendous braggart was thoroughly courageous and each side of the river respected him for one of these attributes he and a following of similar bravoes were addicted to the pastime of retrieving towns from stagnation the day designated by garcia for retribution was to be further signalised on the american side by a cattlemen s convention a bull fight and an old settlers barbecue and picnic knowing the avenger to be a man of his word and believing it prudent to court peace while three such gently social relaxations were in progress captain mcnulty of the ranger company stationed there detailed his lieutenant and three men for duty at the end of the bridge their instructions were to prevent the invasion of garcia either alone or attended by his gang travel was slight that sultry afternoon and the rangers swore gently and mopped their brows in their convenient but close quarters for an hour no one had crossed save an old woman enveloped in a brown wrapper and a black mantilla driving before her a burro loaded with kindling wood tied in small bundles for peddling then three shots were fired down the street the sound coming clear and snappy through the still air the four rangers quickened from sprawling symbolic figures of indolence to alert life but only one rose to his feet three turned their eyes beseechingly but hopelessly upon the fourth who had gotten nimbly up and was buckling his cartridge belt around him the three knew that lieutenant bob buckley in command would allow no man of them the privilege of investigating a row when he himself might go the agile broad chested lieutenant without a change of expression in his smooth yellow brown melancholy face shot the belt strap through the guard of the buckle hefted his sixes in their holsters as a belle gives the finishing touches to her toilette caught up his winchester and dived for the door there he paused long enough to caution his comrades to maintain their watch upon the bridge and then plunged into the broiling highway the three relapsed into resigned inertia and plaintive comment i ve heard of fellows grumbled broncho leathers what was wedded to danger but if bob buckley ain t committed bigamy with trouble i m a son of a gun peculiarness of bob is inserted the nueces kid he ain t had proper trainin he never learned how to git skeered now a man ought to be skeered enough when he tackles a fuss to hanker after readin his name on the list of survivors anyway buckley commented ranger no who was a misguided eastern man burdened with an education scraps in such a solemn manner that i have been led to doubt its spontaneity i m not quite onto his system but he fights like tybalt by the book of arithmetic i never heard mentioned broncho about any of dibble s ways of mixin scrappin and cipherin triggernometry suggested the nueces infant that s rather better than i hoped from you nodded the easterner approvingly the other meaning is that buckley never goes into a fight without giving away weight he seems to dread taking the slightest advantage that s quite close to foolhardiness when you are dealing with horse thieves and fence cutters who would ambush you any night and shoot you in the back if they could buckley s too full of sand he ll play horatius and hold the bridge once too often some day i m on there drawled the kid i mind that bridge gang in the reader me i go instructed for the other chap spurious somebody the one that fought and pulled his freight to fight em on some other day anyway summed up broncho bob s about the gamest man i ever see along the rio bravo great sam houston if she gets any hotter she ll sizzle broncho whacked at a scorpion with his four pound stetson felt and the three watchers relapsed into comfortless silence how well bob buckley had kept his secret since these men for two years his side comrades in countless border raids and dangers thus spake of him not knowing that he was the most arrant physical coward in all that rio bravo country neither his friends nor his enemies had suspected him of aught else than the finest courage it was purely a physical cowardice and only by an extreme grim effort of will had he forced his craven body to do the bravest deeds scourging himself always as a monk whips his besetting sin buckley threw himself with apparent recklessness into every danger with the hope of some day ridding himself of the despised affliction but each successive test brought no relief and the ranger s face by nature adapted to cheerfulness and good humour became set to the guise of gloomy melancholy thus while the frontier admired his deeds and his prowess was celebrated in print and by word of mouth in many camp fires in the valley of the bravo his heart was sick within him only himself knew of the horrible tightening of the chest the dry mouth the weakening of the spine the agony of the strung nerves the never failing symptoms of his shameful malady one mere boy in his company was wont to enter a fray with a leg perched flippantly about the horn of his saddle a cigarette hanging from his lips which emitted smoke and original slogans of clever invention buckley would have given a year s pay to attain that devil may care method once the debonair youth said to him buck you go into a scrap like it was a funeral not he added with a complimentary wave of his tin cup but what it generally is buckley s conscience was of the new england order with western adjustments and he continued to get his rebellious body into as many difficulties as possible wherefore on that sultry afternoon he chose to drive his own protesting limbs to investigation of that sudden alarm that had startled the peace and dignity of the state two squares down the street stood the top notch saloon here buckley came upon signs of recent upheaval a few curious spectators pressed about its front

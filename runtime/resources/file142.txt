mavourneen young olivarra had reascended the steps and spoken a few words to general pilar then that distinguished veteran descended to the ground and approached pasa who still stood wonder eyed where dicky had left her with his plumed hat in his hand and his medals and decorations shining on his breast the general spoke to her and gave her his arm and they went up the stone steps of the casa morena together and then ramon olivarra stepped forward and took both her hands before all the people and while the cheering was breaking out afresh everywhere captain cronin and mr vincenti turned and walked back toward the shore where the gig was waiting for them there ll be another presidente proclamada in the morning said mr vincenti musingly as a rule they are not as reliable as the elected ones but this youngster seems to have some good stuff in him he planned and maneuvered the entire campaign olivarra s widow you know was wealthy after her husband was assassinated she went to the states and educated her son at yale the vesuvius company hunted him up and backed him in the little game it s a glorious thing said cronin half jestingly to be able to discharge a government and

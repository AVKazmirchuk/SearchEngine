rows at twenty he left for new york with a flowing necktie and a capital tied up somewhat closer delia caruthers did things in six octaves so promisingly in a pine tree village in the south that her relatives chipped in enough in her chip hat for her to go north and finish they could not see her f but that is our story joe and delia met in an atelier where a number of art and music students had gathered to discuss chiaroscuro wagner music rembrandt s works pictures waldteufel wall paper chopin and oolong joe and delia became enamoured one of the other or each of the other as you please and in a short time were married for see above when one loves one s art no service seems too hard mr and mrs larrabee began housekeeping in a flat it was a lonesome flat something like the a sharp way down at the left hand end of the keyboard and they were happy for they had their art and they had each other and my advice to the rich young man would be sell all thou hast and give it to the poor janitor for the privilege of living in a flat with your art and your delia flat dwellers shall indorse my dictum that theirs is the only true happiness if a home is happy it cannot fit too close let the dresser collapse and become a billiard table let the mantel turn to a rowing machine the escritoire to a spare bedchamber the washstand to an upright piano let the four walls come together if they will so you and your delia are between but if home be the other kind let it be wide and long enter you at the golden gate hang your hat on hatteras your cape on cape horn and go out by the labrador joe was painting in the class of the great magister you know his fame his fees are high his lessons are light his high lights have brought him renown delia was studying under rosenstock you know his repute as a disturber of the piano keys they were mighty happy as long as their money lasted so is every but i will not be cynical their aims were very clear and defined joe was to become capable very soon of turning out pictures that old gentlemen with thin side whiskers and thick pocketbooks would sandbag one another in his studio for the privilege of buying delia was to become familiar and then contemptuous with music so that when she saw the orchestra seats and boxes unsold she could have sore throat and lobster in a private dining room and refuse to go on the stage but the best in my opinion was the home life in the little flat the ardent voluble chats after the day s study the cozy dinners and fresh light breakfasts the interchange of ambitions ambitions interwoven each with the other s or else inconsiderable the mutual help and inspiration and overlook my artlessness stuffed olives and cheese sandwiches at p m but after a while art flagged it sometimes does even if some switchman doesn t flag it everything going out and nothing coming in as the vulgarians say money was lacking to pay mr magister and herr rosenstock their prices when one loves one s art no service seems too hard so delia said she must give music lessons to keep the chafing dish bubbling for two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils one evening she came home elated joe dear she said gleefully i ve a pupil and oh the loveliest people general general a b pinkney s daughter on seventy first street such a splendid house joe you ought to see the front door byzantine i think you would call it and inside oh joe i never saw anything like it before my pupil is his daughter clementina i dearly love her already she s a delicate thing dresses always in white and the sweetest simplest manners only eighteen years old i m to give three lessons a week and just think joe a lesson i don t mind it a bit for when i get two or three more pupils i can resume my lessons with herr rosenstock now smooth out that wrinkle between your brows dear and let s have a nice supper that s all right for you dele said joe attacking a can of peas with a carving knife and a hatchet but how about me do you think i m going to let you hustle for wages while i philander in the regions of high art not by the bones of benvenuto cellini i guess i can sell papers or lay cobblestones and bring in a dollar or two delia came and hung about his neck joe dear you are silly you must keep on at your studies it is not as if i had quit my music and gone to work at something else while i teach i learn i am always with my music and we can live as happily as millionaires on a week you mustn t think of leaving mr magister all right said joe reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable dish but i hate for you to be giving lessons it isn t art but you re a trump and a dear to do it when one loves one s art no service seems too hard said delia magister praised the sky in that sketch i made in the park said joe and tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his window i may sell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees them i m sure you will said delia sweetly and now let s be thankful for gen

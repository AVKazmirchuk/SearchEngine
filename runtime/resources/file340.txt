lower slant of our city i spoke of the tyrant president cruz and the burdens that his green and insolent cruelty laid upon the people and at that kearny s tears flowed and then i dried them with a picture of the fat rewards that would be ours when the oppressor should be overthrown and the wise and generous valdevia in his seat then kearny leaped to his feet and wrung my hand with the strength of a roustabout he was mine he said till the last minion of the hated despot was hurled from the highest peaks of the cordilleras into the sea i paid the score and we went out near the door kearny s elbow overturned an upright glass showcase smashing it into little bits i paid the storekeeper the price he asked come to my hotel for the night i said to kearny we sail to morrow at noon he agreed but on the sidewalk he fell to cursing again in the dull monotonous way that he had done when i pulled him out of the coal cellar captain said he before we go any further it s no more than fair to tell you that i m known from baffin s bay to terra del fuego as bad luck kearny and i m it everything i get into goes up in the air except a balloon every bet i ever made i lost except when i coppered it every boat i ever sailed on sank except the submarines everything i was ever interested in went to pieces except a patent bombshell that i invented everything i ever took hold of and tried to run i ran into the ground except when i tried to plough and that s why they call me bad luck kearny i thought i d tell you bad luck said i or what goes by that name may now and then tangle the affairs of any man but if it persists beyond the estimate of what we may call the averages there must be a cause for it there is said kearny emphatically and when we walk another square i will show it to you surprised i kept by his side until we came to canal street and out into the middle of its great width kearny seized me by an arm and pointed a tragic forefinger at a rather brilliant star that shone steadily about thirty degrees above the horizon that s saturn said he the star that presides over bad luck and evil and disappointment and nothing doing and trouble i was born under that star every move i make up bobs saturn and blocks it he s the hoodoo planet of the heavens they say he s miles in diameter and no solider of body than split pea soup and he s got as many disreputable and malignant rings as chicago now what kind of a star is that to be born under i asked kearny where he had obtained all this astonishing knowledge from azrath the great astrologer of cleveland ohio said he that man looked at a glass ball and told me my name before i d taken a chair he prophesied the date of my birth and death before i d said a word and then he cast my horoscope and the sidereal system socked me in the solar plexus it was bad luck for francis kearny from a to izard and for his friends that were implicated with him for that i gave up ten dollars this azrath was sorry but he respected his profession too much to read the heavens wrong for any man it was night time and he took me out on a balcony and gave me a free view of the sky and he showed me which saturn was and how to find it in different balconies and longitudes but saturn wasn t all he was only the man higher up he furnishes so much bad luck that they allow him a gang of deputy sparklers to help hand it out they re circulating and revolving and hanging around the main supply all the time each one throwing the hoodoo on his own particular district you see that ugly little red star about eight inches above and to the right of saturn kearny asked me well that s her that s phoebe she s got me in charge by the day of your birth says azrath to me your life is subjected to the influence of saturn by the hour and minute of it you must dwell under the sway and direct authority of phoebe the ninth satellite so said this azrath kearny shook his fist violently skyward curse her she s done her work well said he ever since i was astrologized bad luck has followed me like my shadow as i told you and for many years before now captain i ve told you my handicap as a man should if you re afraid this evil star of mine might cripple your scheme leave me out of it i reassured kearny as well as i could i told him that for the time we would banish both astrology and astronomy from our heads the manifest valour and enthusiasm of the man drew me let us see what a little courage and diligence will do against bad luck i said we will sail to morrow for esperando fifty miles down the mississippi our steamer broke her rudder we sent for a tug to tow us back and lost three days when we struck the blue waters of the gulf all the storm clouds of the atlantic seemed to have concentrated above us we thought surely to sweeten those leaping waves with our sugar and to stack our arms and lumber on the floor of the mexican gulf kearny did not seek to cast off one iota of the burden of our danger from the shoulders of his fatal horoscope

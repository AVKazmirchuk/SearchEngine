kansas bill anyway twas among a great race of people off colored but progressive i was there three months no doubt you are glad to be back among the truly great race i surmised especially among new yorkers the most progressive and independent citizens of any country in the world i continued with the fatuity of the provincial who has eaten the broadway lotus do you want to start an argument asked bill can there be one i answered has an irishman humor do you think asked he i have an hour or two to spare said i looking at the cafe clock not that the americans aren t a great commercial nation conceded bill but the fault laid with the people who wrote lies for fiction what was this irishman s name i asked was that last beer cold enough said he i see there is talk of further outbreaks among the russian peasants i remarked his name was barney o connor said bill thus because of our ancient prescience of each other s trail of thought we travelled ambiguously to the point where kansas bill s story began i met o connor in a boarding house on the west side he invited me to his hall room to have a drink and we became like a dog and a cat that had been raised together there he sat a tall fine handsome man with his feet against one wall and his back against the other looking over a map on the bed and sticking three feet out of it was a beautiful gold sword with tassels on it and rhinestones in the handle what s this says i for by that time we were well acquainted the annual parade in vilification of the ex snakes of ireland and what s the line of march up broadway to forty second thence east to mccarty s cafe thence sit down on the wash stand says o connor and listen and cast no perversions on the sword twas me father s in old munster and this map bowers is no diagram of a holiday procession if ye look again ye ll see that it s the continent known as south america comprising fourteen green blue red and yellow countries all crying out from time to time to be liberated from the yoke of the oppressor i know says i to o connor the idea is a literary one the ten cent magazine stole it from ridpath s history of the world from the sand stone period to the equator you ll find it in every one of em it s a continued story of a soldier of fortune generally named o keefe who gets to be dictator while the spanish american populace cries cospetto and other italian maledictions i misdoubt if it s ever been done you re not thinking of trying that are you barney i asks bowers says he you re a man of education and courage how can i deny it says i education runs in my family and i have acquired courage by a hard struggle with life the o connors says he are a warlike race there is me father s sword and here is the map a life of inaction is not for me the o connors were born to rule tis a ruler of men i must be barney i says to him why don t you get on the force and settle down to a quiet life of carnage and corruption instead of roaming off to foreign parts in what better way can you indulge your desire to subdue and maltreat the oppressed look again at the map says he at the country i have the point of me knife on tis that one i have selected to aid and overthrow with me father s sword i see says i it s the green one and that does credit to your patriotism and it s the smallest one and that does credit to your judgment do ye accuse me of cowardice says barney turning pink no man says i who attacks and confiscates a country single handed could be called a coward the worst you can be charged with is plagiarism or imitation if anthony hope and roosevelt let you get away with it nobody else will have any right to kick i m not joking says o connor and i ve got cash to work the scheme with i ve taken a liking to you do you want it or not i m not working i told him but how is it to be do i eat during the fomentation of the insurrection or am i only to be secretary of war after the country is conquered is it to be a pay envelope or only a portfolio i ll pay all expenses says o connor i want a man i can trust if we succeed you may pick out any appointment you want in the gift of the government all right then says i you can get me a bunch of draying contracts and then a quick action consignment to a seat on the supreme court bench so i won t be in line for the presidency the kind of cannon they chasten their presidents with in that country hurt too much you can consider me on the pay roll two weeks afterward o connor and me took a steamer for the small green doomed country we were three weeks on the trip o connor said he had his plans all figured out in advance but being the commanding general it consorted with his dignity to keep the details concealed from his army and cabinet commonly known as william t bowers three dollars a day was the price for which i joined the cause of liberating an undiscovered country from the ills that threatened or sustained it every saturday night on the steamer i stood in line at parade rest and o connor handed ever the twenty one dollars the town we landed at was named guayaquerita so they told me not for me says i it ll be little old hilldale or tompkinsville or cherry tree corners when i speak of it it s a clear case where spelling reform ought to butt in and disenvowel it but the town looked fine from the bay when we sailed in it was white with green ruching and lace ruffles on the skirt when the surf slashed up on the sand it looked as tropical and dolce far ultra as the pictures of lake ronkonkoma in the brochure of the passenger department of the long island railroad we went through the quarantine and custom house indignities and then o connor leads me to a dobe house on a street called the avenue of the dolorous butterflies of the individual and collective saints ten feet wide it was and knee deep in alfalfa and cigar stumps hooligan alley says i rechristening it twill be our headquarters says o connor my agent here don fernando pacheco secured it for us so in that house o connor and me established the revolutionary centre in the front room we had ostensible things such as fruit a guitar and a table with a conch shell on it in the back room o connor had his desk and a large looking glass and his sword hid in a roll of straw matting we slept on hammocks that we hung to hooks in the wall and took our meals at the hotel ingles a beanery run on the american plan by a german proprietor with chinese cooking served a la kansas city lunch counter it seems that o connor really did have some sort of system planned out beforehand he wrote plenty of letters and every day or two some native gent would stroll round to headquarters and be shut up in the back room for half an hour with o connor and the interpreter i noticed that when they went in they were always smoking eight inch cigars and at peace with the world but when they came out they would be folding up a ten or twenty dollar bill and cursing the government horribly one evening after we had been in guaya in this town of smellville by the sea about a month and me and o connor were sitting outside the door helping along old tempus fugit with rum and ice and limes i says to him if you ll excuse a patriot that don t exactly know what he s patronizing for the question what is your scheme for subjugating this country do you intend to plunge it into bloodshed or do you mean to buy its votes peacefully and honorably at the polls bowers says he ye re a fine little man and i intend to make great use of ye after the conflict but ye do not understand statecraft already by now we have a network of strategy clutching with invisible fingers at the throat of the tyrant calderas we have agents at work in every town in the republic the liberal party is bound to win on our secret lists we have the names of enough sympathizers to crush the administration forces at a single blow a straw vote says i only shows which way the hot air blows who has accomplished this goes on o connor i have i have directed everything the time was ripe when we came so my agents inform me the people are groaning under burdens of taxes and levies who will be their natural leader when they rise could it be any one but meself twas only yesterday that zaldas our representative in the province of durasnas tells me that the people in secret already call me el library door which is the spanish manner of saying the liberator was zaldas that maroon colored old aztec with a paper collar on and unbleached domestic shoes i asked he was says o connor i saw him tucking a yellow back into his vest pocket as he came out says i it may be says i that they call you a library door but they treat you more like the side door of a bank but let us hope for the worst it has cost money of course says o connor but we ll have the country in our hands inside of a month in the evenings we walked about in the plaza and listened to the band playing and mingled with the populace at its distressing and obnoxious pleasures there were thirteen vehicles belonging to the upper classes mostly rockaways and old style barouches such as the mayor rides in at the unveiling of the new poorhouse at milledgeville alabama round and round the desiccated fountain in the middle of the plaza they drove and lifted their high silk hats to their friends the common people walked around in barefooted bunches puffing stogies that a pittsburg millionaire wouldn t have chewed for a dry smoke on ladies day at his club and the grandest figure in the whole turnout was barney o connor six foot two he stood in his fifth avenue clothes with his eagle eye and his black moustache that tickled his ears he was a born dictator and czar and hero and harrier of the human race it looked to me that all eyes were turned upon o connor and that every woman there loved him and every man feared him once or twice i looked at him and thought of funnier things that had happened than his winning out in his game and i began to feel like a hidalgo de officio de grafto de south america myself and then i would come down again to solid bottom and let my imagination gloat as usual upon the twenty one american dollars due me on saturday night take note says o connor to me as thus we walked of the mass of the people observe their oppressed and melancholy air can ye not see that they are ripe for revolt do ye not perceive that they are disaffected i do not says i nor disinfected either i m beginning to understand these people when they look unhappy they re enjoying themselves when they feel unhappy they go to sleep they re not the kind of people to take an interest in revolutions they ll flock to our standard says o connor three thousand men in this town alone will spring to arms when the signal is given i am assured of that but everything is in secret there is no chance for us to fail on hooligan alley as i prefer to call the street our headquarters was on there was a row of flat dobe houses with red tile roofs some straw shacks full of indians and dogs and one two story wooden house with balconies a little farther down that was where general tumbalo the comandante and commander of the military forces lived right across the street was a private residence built like a combination bake oven and folding bed one day o connor and me were passing it single file on the flange they called a sidewalk when out of the window flies a big red rose o connor who is ahead picks it up presses it to his fifth rib and bows to the ground by carrambos that man certainly had the irish drama chaunceyized i looked around expecting to see the little boy and girl in white sateen ready to jump on his shoulder while he jolted their spinal columns and ribs together through a breakdown and sang sleep little one sleep as i passed the window i glanced inside and caught a glimpse of a white dress and a pair of big flashing black eyes and gleaming teeth under a dark lace mantilla when we got back to our house o connor began to walk up and down the floor and twist his moustaches did ye see her eyes bowers he asks me i did says i and i can see more than that it s all coming out according to the story books i knew there was something missing twas the love interest what is it that comes in chapter vii to cheer the gallant irish adventurer why love of course love that makes the hat go around at last we have the eyes of midnight hue and the rose flung from the barred window now what comes next the underground passage the intercepted letter the traitor in camp the hero thrown into a dungeon the mysterious message from the senorita then the outburst the fighting on the plaza the don t be a fool says o connor interrupting but that s the only woman in the world for me bowers the o connors are as quick to love as they are to fight i shall wear that rose over me heart when i lead me men into action for a good battle to be fought there must be some woman to give it power every time i agreed if you want to have a good lively scrap there s only one thing bothering me in the novels the light haired friend of the hero always gets killed think em all over that you ve read and you ll see that i m right i think i ll step down to the botica espanola and lay in a bottle of walnut stain before war is declared how will i find out her name says o connor layin his chin in his hand why don t you go across the street and ask her says i will ye never regard anything in life seriously says o connor looking down at me like a schoolmaster maybe she meant the rose for me i said whistling the spanish fandango for the first time since i d known o connor he laughed he got up and roared and clapped his knees and leaned against the wall till the tiles on the roof clattered to the noise of his lungs he went into the back room and looked at himself in the glass and began and laughed all over from the beginning again then he looked at me and repeated himself that s why i asked you if you thought an irishman had any humor he d been doing farce comedy from the day i saw him without knowing it and the first time he had an idea advanced to him with any intelligence in it he acted like two twelfths of the sextet in a floradora road company the next afternoon he comes in with a triumphant smile and begins to pull something like ticker tape out of his pocket great says i this is something like home how is amalgamated copper to day i ve got her name says o connor and he reads off something like this dona isabel antonia inez lolita carreras y buencaminos y monteleon she lives with her mother explains o connor her father was killed in the last revolution she is sure to be in sympathy with our cause and sure enough the next day she flung a little bunch of roses clear across the street into our door o connor dived for it and found a piece of paper curled around a stem with a line in spanish on it he dragged the interpreter out of his corner and got him busy the interpreter scratched his head and gave us as a translation three best bets fortune had got a face like the man fighting fortune looks like a brave man and fortune favors the brave we put our money on the last one do ye see says o connor she intends to encourage me sword to save her country it looks to me like an invitation to supper says i so every day this senorita sits behind the barred windows and exhausts a conservatory or two one posy at a time and o connor walks like a dominecker rooster and swells his chest and swears to me he will win her by feats of arms and big deeds on the gory field of battle by and by the revolution began to get ripe one day o connor takes me into the back room and tells me all bowers says he at twelve o clock one week from to day the struggle will take place it has pleased ye to find amusement and diversion in this project because ye have not sense enough to perceive that it is easily accomplished by a man of courage intelligence and historical superiority such as meself the whole world over says he the o connors have ruled men women and nations to subdue a small and indifferent country like this is a trifle ye see what little barefooted manikins the men of it are i could lick four of em single handed no doubt says i but could you lick six and suppose they hurled an army of seventeen against you listen says o connor to what will occur at noon next tuesday patriots will rise up in the towns of the republic the government will be absolutely unprepared the public buildings will be taken the regular army made prisoners and the new administration set up in the capital it will not be so easy on account of most of the army being stationed there they will occupy the president s palace and the strongly fortified government buildings and stand a siege but on the very day of the outbreak a body of our troops will begin a march to the capital from every town as soon as the local victory has been won the thing is so well planned that it is an impossibility for us to fail i meself will lead the troops from here the new president will be senor espadas now minister of finance in the present cabinet what do you get i asked twill be strange said o connor smiling if i don t have all the jobs handed to me on a silver salver to pick what i choose i ve been the brains of the scheme and when the fighting opens i guess i won t be in the rear rank who managed it so our troops could get arms smuggled into this country didn t i arrange it with a new york firm before i left there our financial agents inform me that stands of winchester rifles have been delivered a month ago at a secret place up coast and distributed among the towns i tell you bowers the game is already won well that kind of talk kind of shook my disbelief in the infallibility of the serious irish gentleman soldier of fortune it certainly seemed that the patriotic grafters had gone about the thing in a business way i looked upon o connor with more respect and began to figure on what kind of uniform i might wear as secretary of war tuesday the day set for the revolution came around according to schedule o connor said that a signal had been agreed upon for the uprising there was an old cannon on the beach near the national warehouse that had been secretly loaded and promptly at twelve o clock was to be fired off immediately the revolutionists would seize their concealed arms attack the comandante s troops in the cuartel and capture the custom house and all government property and supplies i was nervous all the morning and about eleven o clock o connor became infused with the excitement and martial spirit of murder he geared his father s sword around him and walked up and down in the back room like a lion in the zoo suffering from corns i smoked a couple of dozen cigars and decided on yellow stripes down the trouser legs of my uniform at half past eleven o connor asks me to take a short stroll through the streets to see if i could notice any signs of the uprising i was back in fifteen minutes did you hear anything he asks i did says i at first i thought it was drums but it wasn t it was snoring everybody in town s asleep o connor tears out his watch fools says he they ve set the time right at the siesta hour when everybody takes a nap but the cannon will wake em up everything will be all right depend upon it just at twelve o clock we heard the sound of a cannon boom shaking the whole town o connor loosens his sword in its scabbard and jumps for the door i went as far as the door and stood in it people were sticking their heads out of doors and windows but there was one grand sight that made the landscape look tame general tumbalo the comandante was rolling down the steps of his residential dugout waving a five foot sabre in his hand he wore his cocked and plumed hat and his dress parade coat covered with gold braid and buttons sky blue pajamas one rubber boot and one red plush slipper completed his make up the general had heard the cannon and he puffed down the sidewalk toward the soldiers barracks as fast as his rudely awakened two hundred pounds could travel o connor sees him and lets out a battle cry and draws his father s sword and rushes across the street and tackle s the enemy right there in the street he and the general gave an exhibition of blacksmithing and butchery sparks flew from their blades the general roared and o connor gave the slogan of his race and proclivities then the general s sabre broke in two and he took to his ginger colored heels crying out policios at every jump o connor chased him a block imbued with the sentiment of manslaughter and slicing buttons off the general s coat tails with the paternal weapon at the corner five barefooted policemen in cotton undershirts and straw fiats climbed over o connor and subjugated him according to the municipal statutes they brought him past the late revolutionary headquarters on the way to jail i stood in the door a policeman had him by each hand and foot and they dragged him on his back through the grass like a turtle twice they stopped and the odd policeman took another s place while he rolled a cigarette the great soldier of fortune turned his head and looked at me as they passed i blushed and lit another cigar the procession passed on and at ten minutes past twelve everybody had gone back to sleep again in the afternoon the interpreter came around and smiled as he laid his hand on the big red jar we usually kept ice water in the ice man didn t call to day says i what s the matter with everything sancho ah yes says the liver colored linguist they just tell me in the town verree bad act that senor o connor make fight with general tumbalo yes general tumbalo great soldier and big mans what ll they do to mr o connor i asks i talk little while presently with the juez de la paz what you call justice with the peace says sancho he tell me it verree bad crime that one senor americano try kill general tumbalo he say they keep senor o connor in jail six months then have trial and shoot him with guns verree sorree how about this revolution that was to be pulled off i asks oh says this sancho i think too hot weather for revolution revolution better in winter time maybe so next winter quien sabe but the cannon went off says i the signal was given that big sound says sancho grinning the boiler in ice factory he blow up boom wake everybody up from siesta verree sorree no ice mucho hot day about sunset i went over to the jail and they let me talk to o connor through the bars what s the news bowers says he have we taken the town i ve been expecting a rescue party all the afternoon i haven t heard any firing has any word been received from the capital take it easy barney says i i think there s been a change of plans there s something more important to talk about have you any money i have not says o connor the last dollar went to pay our hotel bill yesterday did our troops capture the custom house there ought be plenty of government money there segregate your mind from battles says i i ve been making inquiries you re to be shot six months from date for assault and battery i m expecting to receive fifty years at hard labor for vagrancy all they furnish you while you re a prisoner is water you depend on your friends for food i ll see what i can do i went away and found a silver chile dollar in an old vest of o connor s i took him some fried fish and rice for his supper in the morning i went down to a lagoon and had a drink of water and then went back to the jail o connor had a porterhouse steak look in his eye barney says i i ve found a pond full of the finest kind of water it s the grandest sweetest purest water in the world say the word and i ll go fetch you a bucket of it and you can throw this vile government stuff out the window i ll do anything i can for a friend has it come to this says o connor raging up and down his cell am i to be starved to death and then shot i ll make those traitors feel the weight of an o connor s hand when i get out of this and then he comes to the bars and speaks softer has nothing been heard from dona isabel he asks though every one else in the world fail says he i trust those eyes of hers she will find a way to effect my release do ye think ye could communicate with her one word from her even a rose would make me sorrow light but don t let her know except with the utmost delicacy bowers these high bred castilians are sensitive and proud well said barney says i you ve given me an idea i ll report later something s got to be pulled off quick or we ll both starve i walked out and down to hooligan alley and then on the other side of the street as i went past the window of dona isabel antonia concha regalia out flies the rose as usual and hits me on the ear the door was open and i took off my hat and walked in it wasn t very light inside but there she sat in a rocking chair by the window smoking a black cheroot and when i got closer i saw that she was about thirty nine and had never seen a straight front in her life i sat down on the arm of her chair and took the cheroot out of her mouth and stole a kiss hullo izzy i says excuse my unconventionality but i feel like i have known you for a month whose izzy is oo the lady ducked her head under her mantilla and drew in a long breath i thought she was going to scream but with all that intake of air she only came out with me likee americanos as soon as she said that i knew that o connor and me would be doing things with a knife and fork before the day was over i drew a chair beside her and inside of half an hour we were engaged then i took my hat and said i must go out for a while you come back says izzy in alarm me go bring preacher says i come back twenty minutes we marry now how you likee marry to day says izzy good i went down on the beach to the united states consul s shack he was a grizzly man eighty two pounds smoked glasses five foot eleven pickled he was playing chess with an india rubber man in white clothes excuse me for interrupting says i but can you tell me how a man could get married quick the consul gets up and fingers in a pigeonhole i believe i had a license to perform the ceremony myself a year or two ago he said i ll look and i caught hold of his arm don t look it up says i marriage is a lottery anyway i m willing to take the risk about the license if you are the consul went back to hooligan alley with me izzy called her ma to come in but the old lady was picking a chicken in the patio and begged to be excused so we stood up and the consul performed the ceremony that evening mrs bowers cooked a great supper of stewed goat tamales baked bananas fricasseed red peppers and coffee afterward i sat in the rocking chair by the front window and she sat on the floor plunking at a guitar and happy as she should be as mrs william t b all at once i sprang up in a hurry i d forgotten all about o connor i asked izzy to fix up a lot of truck for him to eat that big oogly man said izzy but all right he your friend i pulled a rose out of a bunch in a jar and took the grub basket around to the jail o connor ate like a wolf then he wiped his face with a banana peel and said have you heard nothing from dona isabel yet hist says i slipping the rose between the bars she sends you this she bids you take courage at nightfall two masked men brought it to the ruined chateau in the orange grove how did you like that goat hash barney o connor pressed the rose to his lips this is more to me than all the food in the world says he but the supper was fine where did you raise it i ve negotiated a stand off at a delicatessen but downtown i tells him rest easy if there s anything to be done i ll do it so things went along that way for some weeks izzy was a great cook and if she had had a little more poise of character and smoked a little better brand of tobacco we might have drifted into some sense of responsibility for the honor i had conferred on her but as time went on i began to hunger for the sight of a real lady standing before me in a street car all i was staying in that land of bilk and money for was because i couldn t get away and i thought it no more than decent to stay and see o connor shot one day our old interpreter drops around and after smoking an hour says that the judge of the peace sent him to request me to call on him i went to his office in a lemon grove on a hill at the edge of the town and there i had a surprise i expected to see one of the usual cinnamon colored natives in congress gaiters and one of pizzaro s cast off hats what i saw was an elegant gentleman of a slightly claybank complexion sitting in an upholstered leather chair sipping a highball and reading mrs humphry ward i had smuggled into my brain a few words of spanish by the help of izzy and i began to remark in a rich andalusian brogue buenas dias senor yo tengo yo tengo oh sit down mr bowers says he i spent eight years in your country in colleges and law schools let me mix you a highball lemon peel or not thus we got along in about half an hour i was beginning to tell him about the scandal in our family when aunt elvira ran away with a cumberland presbyterian preacher then he says to me i sent for you mr bowers to let you know that you can have your friend mr o connor now of course we had to make a show of punishing him on account of his attack on general tumbalo it is arranged that he shall be released to morrow night you and he will be conveyed on board the fruit steamer voyager bound for new york which lies in the harbor your passage will be arranged for one moment judge says i that revolution the judge lays back in his chair and howls why says he presently that was all a little joke fixed up by the boys around the court room and one or two of our cut ups and a few clerks in the stores the town is bursting its sides with laughing the boys made themselves up to be conspirators and they what you call it stick senor o connor for his money it is very funny it was says i i saw the joke all along i ll take another highball if your honor don t mind the next evening just at dark a couple of soldiers brought o connor down to the beach where i was waiting under a cocoanut tree hist says i in his ear dona isabel has arranged our escape not a word they rowed us in a boat out to a little steamer that smelled of table d hote salad oil and bone phosphate the great mellow tropical moon was rising as we steamed away o connor leaned on the taffrail or rear balcony of the ship and gazed silently at guaya at buncoville on the beach he had the red rose in his hand she will wait i heard him say eyes like hers never deceive but i shall see her again traitors cannot keep an o connor down forever you talk like a sequel says i but in volume ii please omit the light haired friend who totes the grub to the hero in his dungeon cell and thus reminiscing we came back to new york there was a little silence broken only by the familiar roar of the streets after kansas bill bowers ceased talking did o connor ever go back i asked he attained his heart s desire said bill can you walk two blocks i ll show you he led me eastward and down a flight of stairs that was covered by a curious shaped glowing pagoda like structure signs and figures on the tiled walls and supporting columns attested that we were in the grand central station of the subway hundreds of people were on the midway platform an uptown express dashed up and halted it was crowded there was a rush for it by a still larger crowd towering above every one there a magnificent broad shouldered athletic man leaped into the centre of the struggle men and women he seized in either hand and hurled them like manikins toward the open gates of the train now and then some passenger with a shred of soul and self respect left to him turned to offer remonstrance but the blue uniform on the towering figure the fierce and conquering glare of his eye and the ready impact of his ham like hands glued together the lips that would have spoken complaint when the train was full then he exhibited to all who might observe and admire his irresistible genius as a ruler of men with his knees with his elbows with his shoulders with his resistless feet he shoved crushed slammed heaved kicked flung pounded the overplus of passengers aboard then with the sounds of its wheels drowned by the moans shrieks prayers and curses of its unfortunate crew the express dashed away that s him ain t he a wonder said kansas bill admiringly that tropical country wasn t the place for him i wish the distinguished traveller writer war correspondent and playright richmond hobson davis could see him now o connor ought to be dramatized the atavism of john tom little bear o henry thought this the best of the jeff peters stories all the rest of which are included in the gentle grafter except cupid a la carte in the heart of the west the atavism of john tom little bear appeared in everybody s magazine for july i saw a light in jeff peters s room over the red front drug store i hastened toward it for i had not known that jeff was in town he is a man of the hadji breed of a hundred occupations with a story to tell when he will of each one i found jeff repacking his grip for a run down to florida to look at an orange grove for which he had traded a month before his mining claim on the yukon he kicked me a chair with the same old humorous profound smile on his seasoned countenance it had been eight months since we had met but his greeting was such as men pass from day to day time is jeff s servant and the continent is a big lot across which he cuts to his many roads for a while we skirmished along the edges of unprofitable talk which culminated in that unquiet problem of the philippines all them tropical races said jeff could be run out better with their own jockeys up the tropical man knows what he wants all he wants is a season ticket to the cock fights and a pair of western union climbers to go up the bread fruit tree the anglo saxon man wants him to learn to conjugate and wear suspenders he ll be happiest in his own way i was shocked education man i said is the watchword in time they will rise to our standard of civilization look at what education has done for the indian o ho sang jeff lighting his pipe which was a good sign yes the indian i m looking i hasten to contemplate the redman as a standard bearer of progress he s the same as the other brown boys you can t make an anglo saxon of him did i ever tell you about the time my friend john tom little bear bit off the right ear of the arts of culture and education and spun the teetotum back round to where it was when columbus was a little boy i did not john tom little bear was an educated cherokee indian and an old friend of mine when i was in the territories he was a graduate of one of them eastern football colleges that have been so successful in teaching the indian to use the gridiron instead of burning his victims at the stake as an anglo saxon john tom was copper colored in spots as an indian he was one of the whitest men i ever knew as a cherokee he was a gentleman on the first ballot as a ward of the nation he was mighty hard to carry at the primaries john tom and me got together and began to make medicine how to get up some lawful genteel swindle which we might work in a quiet way so as not to excite the stupidity of the police or the cupidity of the larger corporations we had close upon between us and we pined to make it grow as all respectable capitalists do so we figured out a proposition which seems to be as honorable as a gold mine prospectus and as profitable as a church raffle and inside of thirty days you find us swarming into kansas with a pair of fluent horses and a red camping wagon on the european plan john tom is chief wish heap dough the famous indian medicine man and samaritan sachem of the seven tribes mr peters is business manager and half owner we needed a third man so we looked around and found j conyngham binkly leaning against the want column of a newspaper this binkly has a disease for shakespearian roles and an hallucination about a nights run on the new york stage but he confesses that he never could earn the butter to spread on his william s roles so he is willing to drop to the ordinary baker s kind and be satisfied with a mile run behind the medicine ponies besides richard iii he could do twenty seven coon songs and banjo specialties and was willing to cook and curry the horses we carried a fine line of excuses for taking money one was a magic soap for removing grease spots and quarters from clothes one was a sum wah tah the great indian remedy made from a prairie herb revealed by the great spirit in a dream to his favorite medicine men the great chiefs mcgarrity and siberstein bottlers chicago and the other was a frivolous system of pick pocketing the kansasters that had the department stores reduced to a decimal fraction look ye a pair of silk garters a dream book one dozen clothespins a gold tooth and when knighthood was in flower all wrapped up in a genuine japanese silkarina handkerchief and handed to the handsome lady by mr peters for the trivial sum of fifty cents while professor binkly entertains us in a three minute round with the banjo twas an eminent graft we had we ravaged peacefully through the state determined to remove all doubt as to why twas called bleeding kansas john tom little bear in full indian chief s costume drew crowds away from the parchesi sociables and government ownership conversaziones while at the football college in the east he had acquired quantities of rhetoric and the art of calisthenics and sophistry in his classes and when he stood up in the red wagon and explained to the farmers eloquent about chilblains and hyperaesthesia of the cranium jeff couldn t hand out the indian remedy fast enough for em one night we was camped on the edge of a little town out west of salina we always camped near a stream and put up a little tent sometimes we sold out of the remedy unexpected and then chief wish heap dough would have a dream in which the manitou commanded him to fill up a few bottles of sum wah tah at the most convenient place twas about ten o clock and we d just got in from a street performance i was in the tent with the lantern figuring up the day s profits john tom hadn t taken off his indian make up and was sitting by the campfire minding a fine sirloin steak in the pan for the professor till he finished his hair raising scene with the trained horses all at once out of dark bushes comes a pop like a firecracker and john tom gives a grunt and digs out of his bosom a little bullet that has dented itself against his collar bone john tom makes a dive in the direction of the fireworks and comes back dragging by the collar a kid about nine or ten years young in a velveteen suit with a little nickel mounted rifle in his hand about as big as a fountain pen here you pappoose says john tom what are you gunning for with that howitzer you might hit somebody in the eye come out jeff and mind the steak don t let it burn while i investigate this demon with the pea shooter cowardly redskin says the kid like he was quoting from a favorite author dare to burn me at the stake and the paleface will sweep you from the prairies like like everything now you lemme go or i ll tell mamma john tom plants the kid on a camp stool and sits down by him now tell the big chief he says why you try to shoot pellets into your uncle john s system didn t you know it was loaded are you a indian asks the kid looking up cute as you please at john tom s buckskin and eagle feathers i am says john tom well then that s why answers the boy swinging his feet i nearly let the steak burn watching the nerve of that youngster o ho says john tom i see you re the boy avenger and you ve sworn to rid the continent of the savage redman is that about the way of it son the kid halfway nodded his head and then he looked glum twas indecent to wring his secret from his bosom before a single brave had fallen before his parlor rifle now tell us where your wigwam is pappoose says john tom where you live your mamma will be worrying about you being out so late tell me and i ll take you home the kid grins i guess not he says i live thousands and thousands of miles over there he gyrated his hand toward the horizon i come on the train he says by myself i got off here because the conductor said my ticket had ex pirated he looks at john tom with sudden suspicion i bet you ain t a indian he says you don t talk like a indian you look like one but all a indian can say is heap good and paleface die say i bet you are one of them make believe indians that sell medicine on the streets i saw one once in quincy you never mind says john tom whether i m a cigar sign or a tammany cartoon the question before the council is what s to be done with you you ve run away from home you ve been reading howells you ve disgraced the profession of boy avengers by trying to shoot a tame indian and never saying die dog of a redskin you have crossed the path of the boy avenger nineteen times too often what do you mean by it the kid thought for a minute i guess i made a mistake he says i ought to have gone farther west they find em wild out there in the canyons he holds out his hand to john tom the little rascal please excuse me sir says he for shooting at you i hope it didn t hurt you but you ought to be more careful when a scout sees a indian in his war dress his rifle must speak little bear give a big laugh with a whoop at the end of it and swings the kid ten feet high and sets him on his shoulder and the runaway fingers the fringe and the eagle feathers and is full of the joy the white man knows when he dangles his heels against an inferior race it is plain that little bear and that kid are chums from that on the little renegade has already smoked the pipe of peace with the savage and you can see in his eye that he is figuring on a tomahawk and a pair of moccasins children s size we have supper in the tent the youngster looks upon me and the professor as ordinary braves only intended as a background to the camp scene when he is seated on a box of sum wah tah with the edge of the table sawing his neck and his mouth full of beefsteak little bear calls for his name roy says the kid with a sirloiny sound to it but when the rest of it and his post office address is referred to he shakes his head i guess not he says you ll send me back i want to stay with you i like this camping out at home we fellows had a camp in our back yard they called me roy the red wolf i guess that ll do for a name gimme another piece of beefsteak please we had to keep that kid we knew there was a hullabaloo about him somewheres and that mamma and uncle harry and aunt jane and the chief of police were hot after finding his trail but not another word would he tell us in two days he was the mascot of the big medicine outfit and all of us had a sneaking hope that his owners wouldn t turn up when the red wagon was doing business he was in it and passed up the bottles to mr peters as proud and satisfied as a prince that s abjured a two hundred dollar crown for a million dollar parvenuess once john tom asked him something about his papa i ain t got any papa he says he runned away and left us he made my mamma cry aunt lucy says he s a shape a what somebody asks him a shape says the kid some kind of a shape lemme see oh yes a feendenuman shape i don t know what it means john tom was for putting our brand on him and dressing him up like a little chief with wampum and beads but i vetoes it somebody s lost that kid is my view of it and they may want him you let me try him with a few stratagems and see if i can t get a look at his visiting card so that night i goes up to mr roy blank by the camp fire and looks at him contemptuous and scornful snickenwitzel says i like the word made me sick snickenwitzel bah before i d be named snickenwitzel what s the matter with you jeff says the kid opening his eyes wide snickenwitzel i repeats and i spat the word out i saw a man to day from your town and he told me your name i m not surprised you was ashamed to tell it snickenwitzel whew ah here now says the boy indignant and wriggling all over what s the matter with you that ain t my name it s conyers what s the matter with you and that s not the worst of it i went on quick keeping him hot and not giving him time to think we thought you was from a nice well to do family here s mr little bear a chief of the cherokees entitled to wear nine otter tails on his sunday blanket and professor binkly who plays shakespeare and the banjo and me that s got hundreds of dollars in that black tin box in the wagon and we ve got to be careful about the company we keep that man tells me your folks live way down in little old hencoop alley where there are no sidewalks and the goats eat off the table with you that kid was almost crying now taint so he splutters he he don t know what he s talking about we live on poplar av noo i don t sociate with goats what s the matter with you poplar avenue says i sarcastic poplar avenue that s a street to live on it only runs two blocks and then falls off a bluff you can throw a keg of nails the whole length of it don t talk to me about poplar avenue it s it s miles long says the kid our number s and there s lots of houses after that what s the matter with aw you make me tired jeff well well now says i i guess that man made a mistake maybe it was some other boy he was talking about if i catch him i ll teach him to go around slandering people and after supper i goes up town and telegraphs to mrs conyers poplar avenue quincy ill that the kid is safe and sassy with us and will be held for further orders in two hours an answer comes to hold him tight and she ll start for him by next train the next train was due at p m the next day and me and john tom was at the depot with the kid you might scour the plains in vain for the big chief wish heap dough in his place is mr little bear in the human habiliments of the anglo saxon sect and the leather of his shoes is patented and the loop of his necktie is copyrighted for these things john tom had grafted on him at college along with metaphysics and the knockout guard for the low tackle but for his complexion which is some yellowish and the black mop of his straight hair you might have thought here was an ordinary man out of the city directory that subscribes for magazines and pushes the lawn mower in his shirt sleeves of evenings then the train rolled in and a little woman in a gray dress with sort of illuminating hair slides off and looks around quick and the boy avenger sees her and yells mamma and she cries o and they meet in a clinch and now the pesky redskins can come forth from their caves on the plains without fear any more of the rifle of roy the red wolf mrs conyers comes up and thanks me an john tom without the usual extremities you always look for in a woman she says just enough in a way to convince and there is no incidental music by the orchestra i made a few illiterate requisitions upon the art of conversation at which the lady smiles friendly as if she had known me a week and then mr little bear adorns the atmosphere with the various idioms into which education can fracture the wind of speech i could see the kid s mother didn t quite place john tom but it seemed she was apprised in his dialects and she played up to his lead in the science of making three words do the work of one that kid introduced us with some footnotes and explanations that made things plainer than a week of rhetoric he danced around and punched us in the back and tried to climb john tom s leg this is john tom mamma says he he s a indian he sells medicine in a red wagon i shot him but he wasn t wild the other one s jeff he s a fakir too come on and see the camp where we live won t you mamma it is plain to see that the life of the woman is in that boy she has got him again where her arms can gather him and that s enough she s ready to do anything to please him she hesitates the eighth of a second and takes another look at these men i imagine she says to herself about john tom seems to be a gentleman if his hair don t curl and mr peters she disposes of as follows no ladies man but a man who knows a lady so we all rambled down to the camp as neighborly as coming from a wake and there she inspects the wagon and pats the place with her hand where the kid used to sleep and dabs around her eyewinkers with her handkerchief and professor binkly gives us trovatore on one strong of the banjo and is about to slide off into hamlet s monologue when one of the horses gets tangled in his rope and he must go look after him and says something about foiled again when it got dark me and john tom walked back up to the corn exchange hotel and the four of us had supper there i think the trouble started at that supper for then was when mr little bear made an intellectual balloon ascension i held on to the tablecloth and listened to him soar that redman if i could judge had the gift of information he took language and did with it all a roman can do with macaroni his vocal remarks was all embroidered over with the most scholarly verbs and prefixes and his syllables was smooth and fitted nicely to the joints of his idea i thought i d heard him talk before but i hadn t and it wasn t the size of his words but the way they come and twasn t his subjects for he spoke of common things like cathedrals and football and poems and catarrh and souls and freight rates and sculpture mrs conyers understood his accents and the elegant sounds went back and forth between em and now and then jefferson d peters would intervene a few shop worn senseless words to have the butter passed or another leg of the chicken yes john tom little bear appeared to be inveigled some in his bosom about that mrs conyers she was of the kind that pleases she had the good looks and more i ll tell you you take one of these cloak models in a big store they strike you as being on the impersonal system they are adapted for the eye what they run to is inches around and complexion and the art of fanning the delusion that the sealskin would look just as well on the lady with the warts and the pocket book now if

david stood for a moment upon one foot the huge gentleman waved a hand you will enter the carriage he said in a voice large like himself but smoothed by art and habit obedience belonged in the path of such a voice brief as was the young poet s hesitation it was cut shorter still by a renewal of the command david s foot went to the step in the darkness he perceived dimly the form of the lady upon the rear seat he was about to seat himself opposite when the voice again swayed him to its will you will sit at the lady s side the gentleman swung his great weight to the forward seat the carriage proceeded up the hill the lady was shrunk silent into her corner david could not estimate whether she was old or young but a delicate mild perfume from her clothes stirred his poet s fancy to the belief that there was loveliness beneath the mystery here was an adventure such as he had often imagined but as yet he held no key to it for no word was spoken while he sat with his impenetrable companions in an hour s time david perceived through the window that the vehicle traversed the street of some town then it stopped in front of a closed and darkened house and a postilion alighted to hammer impatiently upon the door a latticed window above flew wide and a nightcapped head popped out who are ye that disturb honest folk at this time of night my house is closed tis too late for profitable travellers to be abroad cease knocking at my door and be off open spluttered the postilion loudly open for monsiegneur the marquis de beaupertuys ah cried the voice above ten thousand pardons my lord i did not know the hour is so late at once shall the door be opened and the house placed at my lord s disposal inside was heard the clink of chain and bar and the door was flung open shivering with chill and apprehension the landlord of the silver flagon stood half clad candle in hand upon the threshold david followed the marquis out of the carriage assist the lady he was ordered the poet obeyed he felt her small hand tremble as he guided her descent into the house was the next command the room was the long dining hall of the tavern a great oak table ran down its length the huge gentleman seated himself in a chair at the nearer end the lady sank into another against the wall with an air of great weariness david stood considering how best he might now take his leave and continue upon his way my lord said the landlord bowing to the floor h had i ex expected this honour entertainment would have been ready t t there is wine and cold fowl and m m maybe candles said the marquis spreading the fingers of one plump white hand in a gesture he had y yes my lord he fetched half a dozen candles lighted them and set them upon the table if monsieur would perhaps deign to taste a certain burgundy there is a cask candles said monsieur spreading his fingers assuredly quickly i fly my lord a dozen more lighted candles shone in the hall the great bulk of the marquis overflowed his chair he was dressed in fine black from head to foot save for the snowy ruffles at his wrist and throat even the hilt and scabbard of his sword were black his expression was one of sneering pride the ends of an upturned moustache reached nearly to his mocking eyes the lady sat motionless and now david perceived that she was young and possessed of pathetic and appealing beauty he was startled from the contemplation of her forlorn loveliness by the booming voice of the marquis what is your name and pursuit david mignot i am a poet the moustache of the marquis curled nearer to his eyes how do you live i am also a shepherd i guarded my father s flock david answered with his head high but a flush upon his cheek then listen master shepherd and poet to the fortune you have blundered upon to night this lady is my niece mademoiselle lucie de varennes she is of noble descent and is possessed of ten thousand francs a year in her own right as to her charms you have but to observe for yourself if the inventory pleases your shepherd s heart she becomes your wife at a word do not interrupt me to night i conveyed her to the chateau of the comte de villemaur to whom her hand had been promised guests were present the priest was waiting her marriage to one eligible in rank and fortune was ready to be accomplished at the alter this demoiselle so meek and dutiful turned upon me like a leopardess charged me with cruelty and crimes and broke before the gaping priest the troth i had plighted for her i swore there and then by ten thousand devils that she should marry the first man we met after leaving the chateau be he prince charcoal burner or thief you shepherd are the first mademoiselle must be wed this night if not you then another you have ten minutes in which to make your decision do not vex me with words or questions ten minutes shepherd and they are speeding the marquis drummed loudly with his white fingers upon the table he sank into a veiled attitude of waiting it was as if some great house had shut its doors and windows against approach david would have spoken but the huge man s bearing stopped his tongue instead he stood by the lady s chair and bowed mademoiselle he said and he marvelled to find his words flowing easily before so much elegance and beauty you have heard me say i was a shepherd i have also had the fancy at times that i am a poet if it be the test of a poet to adore and cherish the beautiful that fancy is now strengthened can i serve you in any way mademoiselle the young woman looked up at him with eyes dry and mournful his frank glowing face made serious by the gravity of the adventure his strong straight figure and the liquid sympathy in his blue eyes perhaps also her imminent need of long denied help and kindness thawed her to sudden tears monsieur she said in low tones you look to be true and kind he is my uncle the brother of my father and my only relative he loved my mother and he hates me because i am like her he has made my life one long terror i am afraid of his very looks and never before dared to disobey him but to night he would have married me to a man three times my age you will forgive me for bringing this vexation upon you monsieur you will of course decline this mad act he tries to force upon you but let me thank you for your generous words at least i have had none spoken to me in so long there was now something more than generosity in the poet s eyes poet he must have been for yvonne was forgotten this fine new loveliness held him with its freshness and grace the subtle perfume from her filled him with strange emotions his tender look fell warmly upon her she leaned to it thirstily ten minutes said david is given me in which to do what i would devote years to achieve i will not say i pity you mademoiselle it would not be true i love you i cannot ask love from you yet but let me rescue you from this cruel man and in time love may come i think i have a future i will not always be a shepherd for the present i will cherish you with all my heart and make your life less sad will you trust your fate to me mademoiselle ah you would sacrifice yourself from pity from love the time is almost up mademoiselle you will regret it and despise me i will live only to make you happy and myself worthy of you her fine small hand crept into his from beneath her cloak i will trust you she breathed with my life and and love may not be so far off as you think tell him once away from the power of his eyes i may forget david went and stood before the marquis the black figure stirred and the mocking eyes glanced at the great hall clock two minutes to spare a shepherd requires eight minutes to decide whether he will accept a bride of beauty and income speak up shepherd do you consent to become mademoiselle s husband mademoiselle said david standing proudly has done me the honour to yield to my request that she become my wife well said said the marquis you have yet the making of a courtier in you master shepherd mademoiselle could have drawn a worse prize after all and now to be done with the affair as quick as the church and the devil will allow he struck the table soundly with his sword hilt the landlord came knee shaking bringing more candles in the hope of anticipating the great lord s whims fetch a priest said the marquis a priest do you understand in ten minutes have a priest here or the landlord dropped his candles and flew the priest came heavy eyed and ruffled he made david mignot and lucie de verennes man and wife pocketed a gold piece that the marquis tossed him and shuffled out again into the night wine ordered the marquis spreading his ominous fingers at the host fill glasses he said when it was brought he stood up at the head of the table in the candlelight a black mountain of venom and conceit with something like the memory of an old love turned to poison in his eyes as it fell upon his niece monsieur mignot he said raising his wineglass drink after i say this to you you have taken to be your wife one who will make your life a foul and wretched thing the blood in her is an inheritance running black lies and red ruin she will bring you shame and anxiety the devil that descended to her is there in her eyes and skin and mouth that stoop even to beguile a peasant there is your promise monsieur poet for a happy life drink your wine at last mademoiselle i am rid of you the marquis drank a little grievous cry as if from a sudden wound came from the girl s lips david with his glass in his hand stepped forward three paces and faced the marquis there was little of a shepherd in his bearing just now he said calmly you did me the honor to call me monsieur may i hope therefore that my marriage to mademoiselle has placed me somewhat nearer to you in let us say reflected rank has given me the right to stand more as an equal to monseigneur in a certain little piece of business i have in my mind you may hope shepherd sneered the marquis then said david dashing his glass of wine into the contemptuous eyes that mocked him perhaps you will condescend to fight me the fury of the great lord outbroke in one sudden curse like a blast from a horn he tore his sword from its black sheath he called to the hovering landlord a sword there for this lout he turned to the lady with a laugh that chilled her heart and said you put much labour upon me madame it seems i must find you a husband and make you a widow in the same night i know not sword play said david he flushed to make the confession before his lady i know not sword play mimicked the marquis shall we fight like peasants with oaken cudgels hola francois my pistols a postilion brought two shining great pistols ornamented with carven silver from the carriage holsters the marquis tossed one upon the table near david s hand to the other end of the table he cried even a shepherd may pull a trigger few of them attain the honour to die by the weapon of a de beaupertuys the shepherd and the marquis faced each other from the ends of the long table the landlord in an ague of terror clutched the air and stammered m m monseigneur for the love of christ not in my house do not spill blood it will ruin my custom the look of the marquis threatening him paralyzed his tongue coward cried the lord of beaupertuys cease chattering your teeth long enough to give the word for us if you can mine host s knees smote the floor he was without a vocabulary even sounds were beyond him still by gestures he seemed to beseech peace in the name of his house and custom i will give the word said the lady in a clear voice she went up to david and kissed him sweetly her eyes were sparkling bright and colour had come to her cheek she stood against the wall and the two men levelled their pistols for her count un deux trois the two reports came so nearly together that the candles flickered but once the marquis stood smiling the fingers of his left hand resting outspread upon the end of the table david remained erect and turned his head very slowly searching for his wife with his eyes then as a garment falls from where it is hung he sank crumpled upon the floor with a little cry of terror and despair the widowed maid ran and stooped above him she found his wound and then looked up with her old look of pale melancholy through his heart she whispered oh his heart come boomed the great voice of the marquis out with you to the carriage daybreak shall not find you on my hands wed you shall be again and to a living husband this night the next we come upon my lady highwayman or peasant if the road yields no other then the churl that opens my gates out with you into the carriage the marquis implacable and huge the lady wrapped again in the mystery of her cloak the postilion bearing the weapons all moved out to the waiting carriage the sound of its ponderous wheels rolling away echoed through the slumbering village in the hall of the silver flagon the distracted landlord wrung his hands above the slain poet s body while the flames of the four and twenty candles danced and flickered on the table the right branch three leagues then the road ran and turned into a puzzle it joined with another and a larger road at right angles david stood uncertain for a while and then took the road to the right whither it led he knew not but he was resolved to leave vernoy far behind that night he travelled a league and then passed a large chateau which showed testimony of recent entertainment lights shone from every window from the great stone gateway ran a tracery of wheel tracks drawn in the dust by the vehicles of the guests three leagues farther and david was weary he rested and slept for a while on a bed of pine boughs at the roadside then up and on again along the unknown way thus for five days he travelled the great road sleeping upon nature s balsamic beds or in peasants ricks eating of their black hospitable bread drinking from streams or the willing cup of the goatherd at length he crossed a great bridge and set his foot within the smiling city that has crushed or crowned more poets than all the rest of the world his breath came quickly as paris sang to him in a little undertone her vital chant of greeting the hum of voice and foot and wheel high up under the eaves of an old house in the rue conti david paid for lodging and set himself in a wooden chair to his poems the street once sheltering citizens of import and consequence was now given over to those who ever follow in the wake of decline the houses were tall and still possessed of a ruined dignity but many of them were empty save for dust and the spider by night there was the clash of steel and the cries of brawlers straying restlessly from inn to inn where once gentility abode was now but a rancid and rude incontinence but here david found housing commensurate to his scant purse daylight and candlelight found him at pen and paper one afternoon he was returning from a foraging trip to the lower world with bread and curds and a bottle of thin wine halfway up his dark stairway he met or rather came upon for she rested on the stair a young woman of a beauty that should balk even the justice of a poet s imagination a loose dark cloak flung open showed a rich gown beneath her eyes changed swiftly with every little shade of thought within one moment they would be round and artless like a child s and long and cozening like a gypsy s one hand raised her gown undraping a little shoe high heeled with its ribbons dangling untied so heavenly she was so unfitted to stoop so qualified to charm and command perhaps she had seen david coming and had waited for his help there ah would monsieur pardon that she occupied the stairway but the shoe the naughty shoe alas it would not remain tied ah if monsieur would be so gracious the poet s fingers trembled as he tied the contrary ribbons then he would have fled from the danger of her presence but the eyes grew long and cozening like a gypsy s and held him he leaned against the balustrade clutching his bottle of sour wine you have been so good she said smiling does monsieur perhaps live in the house yes madame i i think so madame perhaps in the third story then no madame higher up the lady fluttered her fingers with the least possible gesture of impatience pardon certainly i am not discreet in asking monsieur will forgive me it is surely not becoming that i should inquire where he lodges madame do not say so i live in the no no no do not tell me now i see that i erred but i cannot lose the interest i feel in this house and all that is in it once it was my home often i come here but to dream of those happy days again will you let that be my excuse let me tell you then for you need no excuse stammered the poet i live in the top floor the small room where the stairs turn in the front room asked the lady turning her head sidewise the rear madame the lady sighed as if with relief i will detain you no longer then monsieur she said employing the round and artless eye take good care of my house alas only the memories of it are mine now adieu and accept my thanks for your courtesy she was gone leaving but a smile and a trace of sweet perfume david climbed the stairs as one in slumber but he awoke from it and the smile and the perfume lingered with him and never afterward did either seem quite to leave him this lady of whom he knew nothing drove him to lyrics of eyes chansons of swiftly conceived love odes to curling hair and sonnets to slippers on slender feet poet he must have been for yvonne was forgotten this fine new loveliness held him with its freshness and grace the subtle perfume about her filled him with strange emotions on a certain night three persons were gathered about a table in a room on the third floor of the same house three chairs and the table and a lighted candle upon it was all the furniture one of the persons was a huge man dressed in black his expression was one of sneering pride the ends of his upturned moustache reached nearly to his mocking eyes another was a lady young and beautiful with eyes that could be round and artless as a child s or long and cozening like a gypsy s but were now keen and ambitious like any other conspirator s the third was a man of action a combatant a bold and impatient executive breathing fire and steel he was addressed by the others as captain desrolles this man struck the table with his fist and said with controlled violence to night to night as he goes to midnight mass i am tired of the plotting that gets nowhere i am sick of signals and ciphers and secret meetings and such baragouin let us be honest traitors if france is to be rid of him let us kill in the open and not hunt with snares and traps to night i say i back my words my hand will do the deed to night as he goes to mass the lady turned upon him a cordial look woman however wedded to plots must ever thus bow to rash courage the big man stroked his upturned moustache dear captain he said in a great voice softened by habit this time i agree with you nothing is to be gained by waiting enough of the palace guards belong to us to make the endeavour a safe one to night repeated captain desrolles again striking the table you have heard me marquis my hand will do the deed but now said the huge man softly comes a question word must be sent to our partisans in the palace and a signal agreed upon our stanchest men must accompany the royal carriage at this hour what messenger can penetrate so far as the south doorway ribouet is stationed there once a message is placed in his hands all will go well i will send the message said the lady you countess said the marquis raising his eyebrows your devotion is great we know but listen exclaimed the lady rising and resting her hands upon the table in a garret of this house lives a youth from the provinces as guileless and tender as the lambs he tended there i have met him twice or thrice upon the stairs i questioned him fearing that he might dwell too near the room in which we are accustomed to meet he is mine if i will he writes poems in his garret and i think he dreams of me he will do what i say he shall take the message to the palace the marquis rose from his chair and bowed you did not permit me to finish my sentence countess he said i would have said your devotion is great but your wit and charm are infinitely greater while the conspirators were thus engaged david was polishing some lines addressed to his amorette d escalier he heard a timorous knock at his door and opened it with a great throb to behold her there panting as one in straits with eyes wide open and artless like a child s monsieur she breathed i come to you in distress i believe you to be good and true and i know of no other help how i flew through the streets among the swaggering men monsieur my mother is dying my uncle is a captain of guards in the palace of the king some one must fly to bring him may i hope mademoiselle interrupted davis his eyes shining with the desire to do her service your hopes shall be my wings tell me how i may reach him the lady thrust a sealed paper into his hand go to the south gate the south gate mind and say to the guards there the falcon has left his nest they will pass you and you will go to the south entrance to the palace repeat the words and give this letter to the man who will reply let him strike when he will this is the password monsieur entrusted to me by my uncle for now when the country is disturbed and men plot against the king s life no one without it can gain entrance to the palace grounds after nightfall if you will monsieur take him this letter so that my mother may see him before she closes her eyes give it me said david eagerly but shall i let you return home through the streets alone so late i no no fly each moment is like a precious jewel some time said the lady with eyes long and cozening like a gypsy s i will try to thank you for your goodness the poet thrust the letter into his breast and bounded down the stairway the lady when he was gone returned to the room below the eloquent eyebrows of the marquis interrogated her he is gone she said as fleet and stupid as one of his own sheep to deliver it the table shook again from the batter of captain desrolles s fist sacred name he cried i have left my pistols behind i can trust no others take this said the marquis drawing from beneath his cloak a shining great weapon ornamented with carven silver there are none truer but guard it closely for it bears my arms and crest and already i am suspected me i must put many leagues between myself and paris this night to morrow must find me in my chateau after you dear countess the marquis puffed out the candle the lady well cloaked and the two gentlemen softly descended the stairway and flowed into the crowd that roamed along the narrow pavements of the rue conti david sped at the south gate of the king s residence a halberd was laid to his breast but he turned its point with the words the falcon has left his nest pass brother said the guard and go quickly on the south steps of the palace they moved to seize him but again the mot de passe charmed the watchers one among them stepped forward and began let him strike but a flurry among the guards told of a surprise a man of keen look and soldierly stride suddenly pressed through them and seized the letter which david held in his hand come with me he said and led him inside the great hall then he tore open the letter and read it he beckoned to a man uniformed as an officer of musketeers who was passing captain tetreau you will have the guards at the south entrance and the south gate arrested and confined place men known to be loyal in their places to david he said come with me he conducted him through a corridor and an anteroom into a spacious chamber where a melancholy man sombrely dressed sat brooding in a great leather covered chair to that man he said sire i have told you that the palace is as full of traitors and spies as a sewer is of rats you have thought sire that it was my fancy this man penetrated to your very door by their connivance he bore a letter which i have intercepted i have brought him here that your majesty may no longer think my zeal excessive i will question him said the king stirring in his chair he looked at david with heavy eyes dulled by an opaque film the poet bent his knee from where do you come asked the king from the village of vernoy in the province of eure et loir sire what do you follow in paris i i would be a poet sire what did you in vernoy i minded my father s flock of sheep the king stirred again and the film lifted from his eyes ah in the fields yes sire you lived in the fields you went out in the cool of the morning and lay among the hedges in the grass the flock distributed itself upon the hillside you drank of the living stream you ate your sweet brown bread in the shade and you listened doubtless to blackbirds piping in the grove is not that so shepherd it is sire answered david with a sigh and to the bees at the flowers and maybe to the grape gatherers singing on the hill yes yes said the king impatiently maybe to them but surely to the blackbirds they whistled often in the grove did they not nowhere sire so sweetly as in eure et loir i have endeavored to express their song in some verses that i have written can you repeat those verses asked the king eagerly a long time ago i listened to the blackbirds it would be something better than a kingdom if one could rightly construe their song and at night you drove the sheep to the fold and then sat in peace and tranquillity to your pleasant bread can you repeat those verses shepherd they run this way sire said david with respectful ardour lazy shepherd see your lambkins skip ecstatic on the mead see the firs dance in the breezes hear pan blowing at his reed hear us calling from the tree tops see us swoop upon your flock yield us wool to make our nests warm in the branches of the if it please your majesty interrupted a harsh voice i will ask a question or two of this rhymester there is little time to spare i crave pardon sire if my anxiety for your safety offends the loyalty said the king of the duke d aumale is too well proven to give offence he sank into his chair and the film came again over his eyes first said the duke i will read you the letter he brought to night is the anniversary of the dauphin s death if he goes as is his custom to midnight mass to pray for the soul of his son the falcon will strike at the corner of the rue esplanade if this be his intention set a red light in the upper room at the southwest corner of the palace that the falcon may take heed peasant said the duke sternly you have heard these words who gave you this message to bring my lord duke said david sincerely i will tell you a lady gave it me she said her mother was ill and that this writing would fetch her uncle to her bedside i do not know the meaning of the letter but i will swear that she is beautiful and good describe the woman commanded the duke and how you came to be her dupe describe her said david with a tender smile you would command words to perform miracles well she is made of sunshine and deep shade she is slender like the alders and moves with their grace her eyes change while you gaze into them now round and then half shut as the sun peeps between two clouds when she comes heaven is all about her when she leaves there is chaos and a scent of hawthorn blossoms she came to see me in the rue conti number twenty nine it is the house said the duke turning to the king that we have been watching thanks to the poet s tongue we have a picture of the infamous countess quebedaux sire and my lord duke said david earnestly i hope my poor words have done no injustice i have looked into that lady s eyes i will stake my life that she is an angel letter or no letter the duke looked at him steadily i will put you to the proof he said slowly dressed as the king you shall yourself attend mass in his carriage at midnight do you accept the test david smiled i have looked into her eyes he said i had my proof there take yours how you will half an hour before twelve the duke d aumale with his own hands set a red lamp in a southwest window of the palace at ten minutes to the hour david leaning on his arm dressed as the king from top to toe with his head bowed in his cloak walked slowly from the royal apartments to the waiting carriage the duke assisted him inside and closed the door the carriage whirled away along its route to the cathedral on the qui vive in a house at the corner of the rue esplanade was captain tetreau with twenty men ready to pounce upon the conspirators when they should appear but it seemed that for some reason the plotters had slightly altered their plans when the royal carriage had reached the rue christopher one square nearer than the rue esplanade forth from it burst captain desrolles with his band of would be regicides and assailed the equipage the guards upon the carriage though surprised at the premature attack descended and fought valiantly the noise of conflict attracted the force of captain tetreau and they came pelting down the street to the rescue but in the meantime the desperate desrolles had torn open the door of the king s carriage thrust his weapon against the body of the dark figure inside and fired now with loyal reinforcements at hand the street rang with cries and the rasp of steel but the frightened horses had dashed away upon the cushions lay the dead body of the poor mock king and poet slain by a ball from the pistol of monseigneur the marquis de beaupertuys the main road three leagues then the road ran and turned into a puzzle it joined with another and a larger road at right angles david stood uncertain for a while and then sat himself to rest upon its side whither these roads led he knew not either way there seemed to lie a great world full of chance and peril and then sitting there his eye fell upon a bright star one that he and yvonne had named for theirs that set him thinking of yvonne and he wondered if he had not been too hasty why should he leave her and his home because a few hot words had come between them was love so brittle a thing that jealousy the very proof of it could break it mornings always brought a cure for the little heartaches of evening there was yet time for him to return home without any one in the sweetly sleeping village of vernoy being the wiser his heart was yvonne s there where he had lived always he could write his poems and find his happiness david rose and shook off his unrest and the wild mood that had tempted him he set his face steadfastly back along the road he had come by the time he had retravelled the road to vernoy his desire to rove was gone he passed the sheepfold and the sheep scurried with a drumming flutter at his late footsteps warming his heart by the homely sound he crept without noise into his little room and lay there thankful that his feet had escaped the distress of new roads that night how well he knew woman s heart the next evening yvonne was at the well in the road where the young congregated in order that the cure might have business the corner of her eye was engaged in a search for david albeit her set mouth seemed unrelenting he saw the look braved the mouth drew from it a recantation and later a kiss as they walked homeward together three months afterwards they were married david s father was shrewd and prosperous he gave them a wedding that was heard of three leagues away both the young people were favourites in the village there was a procession in the streets a dance on the green they had the marionettes and a tumbler out from dreux to delight the guests then a year and david s father died the sheep and the cottage descended to him he already had the seemliest wife in the village yvonne s milk pails and her brass kettles were bright ouf they blinded you in the sun when you passed that way but you must keep your eyes upon her yard for her flower beds were so neat and gay they restored to you your sight and you might hear her sing aye as far as the double chestnut tree above pere gruneau s blacksmith forge but a day came when david drew out paper from a long shut drawer and began to bite the end of a pencil spring had come again and touched his heart poet he must have been for now yvonne was well nigh forgotten this fine new loveliness of earth held him with its witchery and grace the perfume from her woods and meadows stirred him strangely daily had he gone forth with his flock and brought it safe at night but now he stretched himself under the hedge and pieced words together on his bits of paper the sheep strayed and the wolves perceiving that difficult poems make easy mutton ventured from the woods and stole his lambs david s stock of poems grew longer and his flock smaller yvonne s nose and temper waxed sharp and her talk blunt her pans and kettles grew dull but her eyes had caught their flash she pointed out to the poet that his neglect was reducing the flock and bringing woe upon the household david hired a boy to guard the sheep locked himself in the little room at the top of the cottage and wrote more poems the boy being a poet by nature but not furnished with an outlet in the way of writing spent his time in slumber the wolves lost no time in discovering that poetry and sleep are practically the same so the flock steadily grew smaller yvonne s ill temper increased at an equal rate sometimes she would stand in the yard and rail at david through his high window then you could hear her as far as the double chestnut tree above pere gruneau s blacksmith forge m papineau the kind wise meddling old notary saw this as he saw everything at which his nose pointed he went to david fortified himself with a great pinch of snuff and said friend mignot i affixed the seal upon the marriage certificate of your father it would distress me to be obliged to attest a paper signifying the bankruptcy of his son but that is what you are coming to i speak as an old friend now listen to what i have to say you have your heart set i perceive upon poetry at dreux i have a friend one monsieur bril georges bril he lives in a little cleared space in a houseful of books he is a learned man he visits paris each year he himself has written books he will tell you when the catacombs were made how they found out the names of the stars and why the plover has a long bill the meaning and the form of poetry is to him as intelligent as the baa of a sheep is to you i will give you a letter to him and you shall take him your poems and let him read them then you will know if you shall write more or give your attention to your wife and business write the letter said david i am sorry you did not speak of this sooner at sunrise the next morning he was on the road to dreux with the precious roll of poems under his arm at noon he wiped the dust from his feet at the door of monsieur bril that learned man broke the seal of m papineau s letter and sucked up its contents through his gleaming spectacles as the sun draws water he took david inside to his study and sat him down upon a little island beat upon by a sea of books monsieur bril had a conscience he flinched not even at a mass of manuscript the thickness of a finger length and rolled to an incorrigible curve he broke the back of the roll against his knee and began to read he slighted nothing he bored into the lump as a worm into a nut seeking for a kernel meanwhile david sat marooned trembling in the spray of so much literature it roared in his ears he held no chart or compass for voyaging in that sea half the world he thought must be writing books monsieur bril bored to the last page of the poems then he took off his spectacles and wiped them with his handkerchief my old friend papineau is well he asked in the best of health said david how many sheep have you monsieur mignot three hundred and nine when i counted them yesterday the flock has had ill fortune to that number it has decreased from eight hundred and fifty you have a wife and home and lived in comfort the sheep brought you plenty you went into the fields with them and lived in the keen air and ate the sweet bread of contentment you had but to be vigilant and recline there upon nature s breast listening to the whistle of the blackbirds in the grove am i right thus far it was so said david i have read all your verses continued monsieur bril his eyes wandering about his sea of books as if he conned the horizon for a sail look yonder through that window monsieur mignot tell me what you see in that tree i see a crow said david looking there is a bird said monsieur bril that shall assist me where i am disposed to shirk a duty you know that bird monsieur mignot he is the philosopher of the air he is happy through submission to his lot none so merry or full crawed as he with his whimsical eye and rollicking step the fields yield him what he desires he never grieves that his plumage is not gay like the oriole s and you have heard monsieur mignot the notes that nature has given him is the nightingale any happier do you think david rose to his feet the crow cawed harshly from his tree i thank you monsieur bril he said slowly there was not then one nightingale among all those croaks i could not have missed it said monsieur bril with a sigh i read every word live your poetry man do not try to write it any more i thank you said david again and now i will be going back to my sheep if you would dine with me said the man of books and overlook the smart of it i will give you reasons at length no said the poet i must be back in the fields cawing at my sheep back along the road to vernoy he trudged with his poems under his arm when he reached his village he turned into the shop of one zeigler a jew out of armenia who sold anything that came to his hand friend said david wolves from the forest harass my sheep on the hills i must purchase firearms to protect them what have you a bad day this for me friend mignot said zeigler spreading his hands for i perceive that i must sell you a weapon that will not fetch a tenth of its value only last i week i bought from a peddlar a wagon full of goods that he procured at a sale by a commissionaire of the crown the sale was of the chateau and belongings of a great lord i know not his title who has been banished for conspiracy against the king there are some choice firearms in the lot this pistol oh a weapon fit for a prince it shall be only forty francs to you friend mignot if i lose ten by the sale but perhaps an arquebuse this will do said david throwing the money on the counter is it charged i will charge it said zeigler and for ten francs more add a store of powder and ball david laid his pistol under his coat and walked to his cottage yvonne was not there of late she had taken to gadding much among the neighbours but a fire was glowing in the kitchen stove david opened the door of it and thrust his poems in upon the coals as they blazed up they made a singing harsh sound in the flue the song of the crow said the poet he went up to his attic room and closed the door so quiet was the village that a score of people heard the roar of the great pistol they flocked thither and up the stairs where the smoke issuing drew their notice the men laid the body of the poet upon his bed awkwardly arranging it to conceal the torn plumage of the poor black crow the women chattered in a luxury of zealous pity some of them ran to tell yvonne m papineau whose nose had brought him there among the first picked up the weapon and ran his eye over its silver mountings with a mingled air of connoisseurship and grief the arms he explained aside to the cure and crest of monseigneur the marquis de beaupertuys the guardian of the accolade not the least important of the force of the weymouth bank was uncle bushrod sixty years had uncle bushrod given of faithful service to the house of weymouth as chattel servitor and friend of the colour of the mahogany bank furniture was uncle bushrod thus dark was he externally white as the uninked pages of the bank ledgers was his soul eminently pleasing to uncle bushrod would the comparison have been for to him the only institution in existence worth considering was the weymouth bank of which he was something between porter and generalissimo in charge weymouth lay dreamy and umbrageous among the low foothills along the brow of a southern valley three banks there were in weymouthville two were hopeless misguided enterprises lacking the presence and prestige of a weymouth to give them glory the third was the bank managed by the weymouths and uncle bushrod in the old weymouth homestead the red brick white porticoed mansion the first to your right as you crossed elder creek coming into town lived mr robert weymouth the president of the bank his widowed daughter mrs vesey called miss letty by every one and her two children nan and guy there also in a cottage on the grounds resided uncle bushrod and aunt malindy his wife mr william weymouth the cashier of the bank lived in a modern fine house on the principal avenue mr robert was a large stout man sixty two years of age with a smooth plump face long iron gray hair and fiery blue eyes he was high tempered kind and generous with a youthful smile and a formidable stern voice that did not always mean what it sounded like mr william was a milder man correct in deportment and absorbed in business the weymouths formed the family of weymouthville and were looked up to as was their right of heritage uncle bushrod was the bank s trusted porter messenger vassal and guardian he carried a key to the vault just as mr robert and mr williams did sometimes there was ten fifteen or twenty thousand dollars in sacked silver stacked on the vault floor it was safe with uncle bushrod he was a weymouth in heart honesty and pride of late uncle bushrod had not been without worry it was on account of marse robert for nearly a year mr robert had been known to indulge in too much drink not enough understand to become tipsy but the habit was getting a hold upon him and every one was beginning to notice it half a dozen times a day he would leave the bank and step around to the merchants and planters hotel to take a drink mr roberts usual keen judgment and business capacity became a little impaired mr william a weymouth but not so rich in experience tried to dam the inevitable backflow of the tide but with incomplete success the deposits in the weymouth bank dropped from six figures to five past due paper began to accumulate owing to injudicious loans no one cared to address mr robert on the subject of temperance many of his friends said that the cause of it had been the death of his wife some two years before others hesitated on account of mr robert s quick temper which was extremely apt to resent personal interference of such a nature miss letty and the children noticed the change and grieved about it uncle bushrod also worried but he was one of those who would not have dared to remonstrate although he and marse robert had been raised almost as companions but there was a heavier shock coming to uncle bushrod than that caused by the bank president s toddies and juleps mr robert had a passion for fishing which he usually indulged whenever the season and business permitted one day when reports had been coming in relating to the bass and perch he announced his intention of making a two or three days visit to the lakes he was going down he said to reedy lake with judge archinard an old friend now uncle bushrod was treasurer of the sons and daughters of the burning bush every association he belonged to made him treasurer without hesitation he stood aa in coloured circles he was understood among them to be mr bushrod weymouth of the weymouth bank the night following the day on which mr robert mentioned his intended fishing trip the old man woke up and rose from his bed at twelve o clock declaring he must go down to the bank and fetch the pass book of the sons and daughters which he had forgotten to bring home the bookkeeper had balanced it for him that day put the cancelled checks in it and snapped two elastic bands around it he put but one band around other pass books aunt malindy objected to the mission at so late an hour denouncing it as foolish and unnecessary but uncle bushrod was not to be deflected from duty i done told sister adaline hoskins he said to come by here for dat book to morrer mawnin at sebin o clock for to kyar it to de meetin of de bo d of rangements and dat book gwine to be here when she come so uncle bushrod put on his old brown suit got his thick hickory stick and meandered through the almost deserted streets of weymouthville he entered the bank unlocking the side door and found the pass book where he had left it in the little back room used for consultations where he always hung his coat looking about casually he saw that everything was as he had left it and was about to start for home when he was brought to a standstill by the sudden rattle of a key in the front door some one came quickly in closed the door softly and entered the counting room through the door in the iron railing that division of the bank s space was connected with the back room by a narrow passageway now in deep darkness uncle bushrod firmly gripping his hickory stick tiptoed gently up this passage until he could see the midnight intruder into the sacred precincts of the weymouth bank one dim gas jet burned there but even in its nebulous light he perceived at once that the prowler was the bank s president wondering fearful undecided what to do the old coloured man stood motionless in the gloomy strip of hallway and waited developments the vault with its big iron door was opposite him inside that was the safe holding the papers of value the gold and currency of the bank on the floor of the vault was perhaps eighteen thousand dollars in silver the president took his key from his pocket opened the vault and went inside nearly closing the door behind him uncle bushrod saw through the narrow aperture the flicker of a candle in a minute or two it seemed an hour to the watcher mr robert came out bringing with him a large hand satchel handling it in a careful but hurried manner as if fearful that he might be observed with one hand he closed and locked the vault door with a reluctant theory forming itself beneath his wool uncle bushrod waited and watched shaking in his concealing shadow mr robert set the satchel softly upon a desk and turned his coat collar up about his neck and ears he was dressed in a rough suit of gray as if for travelling he glanced with frowning intentness at the big office clock above the burning gas jet and then looked lingeringly about the bank lingeringly and fondly uncle bushrod thought as one who bids farewell to dear and familiar scenes now he caught up his burden again and moved promptly and softly out of the bank by the way he had come locking the front door behind him for a minute or longer uncle bushrod was as stone in his tracks had that midnight rifler of safes and vaults been any other on earth than the man he was the old retainer would have rushed upon him and struck to save the weymouth property but now the watcher s soul was tortured by the poignant dread of something worse than mere robbery he was seized by an accusing terror that said the weymouth name and the weymouth honour were about to be lost marse robert robbing the bank what else could it mean the hour of the night the stealthy visit to the vault the satchel brought forth and with expedition and silence the prowler s rough dress his solicitous reading of the clock and noiseless departure what else could it mean and then to the turmoil of uncle bushrod s thoughts came the corroborating recollection of preceding events mr robert s increasing intemperance and consequent many moods of royal high spirits and stern tempers the casual talk he had heard in the bank of the decrease in business and difficulty in collecting loans what else could it all mean but that mr robert weymouth was an absconder was about to fly with the bank s remaining funds leaving mr william miss letty little nab guy and uncle bushrod to bear the disgrace during one minute uncle bushrod considered these things and then he awoke to sudden determination and action lawd lawd he moaned aloud as he hobbled hastily toward the side door sech a come off after all dese here years of big doin s and fine doin s scan lous sights upon de yearth when de weymouth fambly done turn out robbers and bezzlers time for uncle bushrod to clean out somebody s chicken coop and eben matters up oh lawd marse robert you ain t gwine do dat n miss letty an dem chillun so proud and talkin weymouth weymouth all de time i m gwine to stop you ef i can spec you shoot mr nigger s head off ef he fool wid you but i m gwine stop you ef i can uncle bushrod aided by his hickory stick impeded by his rheumatism hurried down the street toward the railroad station where the two lines touching weymouthville met as he had expected and feared he saw there mr robert standing in the shadow of the building waiting for the train he held the satchel in his hand when uncle bushrod came within twenty yards of the bank president standing like a huge gray ghost by the station wall sudden perturbation seized him the rashness and audacity of the thing he had come to do struck him fully he would have been happy could he have turned and fled from the possibilities of the famous weymouth wrath but again he saw in his fancy the white reproachful face of miss letty and the distressed looks of nan and guy should he fail in his duty and they question him as to his stewardship braced by the thought he approached in a straight line clearing his throat and pounding with his stick so that he might be early recognized thus he might avoid the likely danger of too suddenly surprising the sometimes hasty mr robert is that you bushrod called the clamant clear voice of the gray ghost yes suh marse robert what the devil are you doing out at this time of night for the first time in his life uncle bushrod told marse robert a falsehood he could not repress it he would have to circumlocute a little his nerve was not equal to a direct attack i done been down suh to see ol aunt m ria patterson she taken sick in de night and i kyar ed her a bottle of m lindy s medercine yes suh humph said robert you better get home out of the night air it s damp you ll hardly be worth killing to morrow on account of your rheumatism think it ll be a clear day bushrod i low it will suh de sun sot red las night mr robert lit a cigar in the shadow and the smoke looked like his gray ghost expanding and escaping into the night air somehow uncle bushrod could barely force his reluctant tongue to the dreadful subject he stood awkward shambling with his feet upon the gravel and fumbling with his stick but then afar off three miles away at the jimtown switch he heard the faint whistle of the coming train the one that was to transport the weymouth name into the regions of dishonour and shame all fear left him he took off his hat and faced the chief of the clan he served the great royal kind lofty terrible weymouth he bearded him there at the brink of the awful thing that was about to happen marse robert he began his voice quivering a little with the stress of his feelings you member de day dey all rode de tunnament at oak lawn de day suh dat you win in de ridin and you crown miss lucy de queen tournament said mr robert taking his cigar from his mouth yes i remember very well the but what the deuce are you talking about tournaments here at midnight for go long home bushrod i believe you re sleep walking miss lucy tetch you on de shoulder continued the old man never heeding wid a s ord and say i mek you a knight suh robert rise up pure and fearless and widout reproach dat what miss lucy say dat s been a long time ago

about leisurely as at all times the market was thronged with bare headed women buying fruit and carne we heard the twang and tinkle of string bands in the patios of the cantinas we could see that it was a waiting game that don rafael was playing his residencia as a large but low building around a great courtyard in grounds crowed with ornamental trees and tropic shrubs at his door an old woman who came informed us that don rafael had not yet arisen tell him said i that captain malone and a friend wish to see him at once perhaps he has overslept she came back looking frightened i have called she said and rung his bell many times but he does not answer i knew where his sleeping room was kearny and i pushed by her and went to it i put my shoulder against the thin door and forced it open in an armchair by a great table covered with maps and books sat don rafael with his eyes closed i touched his hand he had been dead many hours on his head above one ear was a wound caused by a heavy blow it had ceased to bleed long before i made the old woman call a mozo and dispatched him in haste to fetch herr bergowitz he came and we stood about as if we were half stunned by the awful shock thus can the letting of a few drops of blood from one man s veins drain the life of a nation presently herr bergowitz stooped and picked up a darkish stone the size of an orange which he saw under the table he examined it closely through his great glasses with the eye of science a fragment said he of a detonating meteor the most remarkable one in twenty years exploded above this city a little after midnight this morning the professor looked quickly up at the ceiling we saw the blue sky through a hole the size of an orange nearly above don rafael s chair i heard a familiar sound and turned kearny had thrown himself on the floor and was babbling his compendium of bitter blood freezing curses against the star of his evil luck undoubtedly phoebe had been feminine even when hurtling on her way to fiery dissolution and everlasting doom the last word had been hers captain malone was not unskilled in narrative he knew the point where a story should end i sat reveling in his effective conclusion when he aroused me by continuing of course said he our schemes were at an end there was no one to take don rafael s place our little army melted away like dew before the sun one day after i had returned to new orleans i related this story to a friend who holds a professorship in tulane university when i had finished he laughed and asked whether i had any knowledge of kearny s luck afterward i told him no that i had seen him no more but that when he left me he had expressed confidence that his future would be successful now that his unlucky star had been overthrown no doubt said the professor he is happier not to know one fact if he derives his bad luck from phoebe the ninth satellite of saturn that malicious lady is still engaged in overlooking his career the star close to saturn that he imagined to be her was near that planet simply by the chance of its orbit probably at different times he has regarded many other stars that happened to be in saturn s neighbourhood as his evil one the real phoebe is visible only through a very good telescope about a year afterward continued captain malone i was walking down a street that crossed the poydras market an immensely stout pink faced lacy in black satin crowded me from the narrow sidewalk with a frown behind her trailed a little man laden to the gunwales with bundles and bags of goods and vegetables it was kearny but changed i stopped and shook one of his hands which still clung to a bag of garlic and red peppers how is the luck old companero i asked him i had not the heart to tell him the truth about his star well said he i am married as you may guess francis called the big lady in deep tones are you going to stop in the street talking all day i am coming phoebe dear said kearny hastening after her captain malone ceased again after all do you believe in luck i asked do you answered the captain with his ambiguous smile shaded by the brim of his soft straw hat a double dyed deceiver the trouble began in laredo it was the llano kid s fault for he should have confined his habit of manslaughter to mexicans but the kid was past twenty and to have only mexicans to one s credit at twenty is to blush unseen on the rio grande border it happened in old justo valdos s gambling house there was a poker game at which sat players who were not all friends as happens often where men ride in from afar to shoot folly as she gallops there was a row over so small a matter as a pair of queens and when the smoke had cleared away it was found that the kid had committed an indiscretion and his adversary had been guilty of a blunder for the unfortunate combatant instead of being a greaser was a high blooded youth from the cow ranches of about the kid s own age and possessed of friends and champions his blunder in missing the kid s right ear only a sixteenth of an inch when he pulled his gun did not lessen the indiscretion of the better marksman the kid not being equipped with a retinue nor bountifully supplied with personal admirers and supporters on account of a rather umbrageous reputation even for the border considered it not incompatible with his indispensable gameness to perform that judicious tractional act known as pulling his freight quickly the avengers gathered and sought him three of them overtook him within a rod of the station the kid turned and showed his teeth in that brilliant but mirthless smile that usually preceded his deeds of insolence and violence and his pursuers fell back without making it necessary for him even to reach for his weapon but in this affair the kid had not felt the grim thirst for encounter that usually urged him on to battle it had been a purely chance row born of the cards and certain epithets impossible for a gentleman to brook that had passed between the two the kid had rather liked the slim haughty brown faced young chap whom his bullet had cut off in the first pride of manhood and now he wanted no more blood he wanted to get away and have a good long sleep somewhere in the sun on the mesquit grass with his handkerchief over his face even a mexican might have crossed his path in safety while he was in this mood the kid openly boarded the north bound passenger train that departed five minutes later but at webb a few miles out where it was flagged to take on a traveller he abandoned that manner of escape there were telegraph stations ahead and the kid looked askance at electricity and steam saddle and spur were his rocks of safety the man whom he had shot was a stranger to him but the kid knew that he was of the coralitos outfit from hidalgo and that the punchers from that ranch were more relentless and vengeful than kentucky feudists when wrong or harm was done to one of them so with the wisdom that has characterized many great farmers the kid decided to pile up as many leagues as possible of chaparral and pear between himself and the retaliation of the coralitos bunch near the station was a store and near the store scattered among the mesquits and elms stood the saddled horses of the customers most of them waited half asleep with sagging limbs and drooping heads but one a long legged roan with a curved neck snorted and pawed the turf him the kid mounted gripped with his knees and slapped gently with the owner s own quirt if the slaying of the temerarious card player had cast a cloud over the kid s standing as a good and true citizen this last act of his veiled his figure in the darkest shadows of disrepute on the rio grande border if you take a man s life you sometimes take trash but if you take his horse you take a thing the loss of which renders him poor indeed and which enriches you not if you are caught for the kid there was no turning back now with the springing roan under him he felt little care or uneasiness after a five mile gallop he drew it in to the plainsman s jogging trot and rode northeastward toward the nueces river bottoms he knew the country well its most tortuous and obscure trails through the great wilderness of brush and pear and its camps and lonesome ranches where one might find safe entertainment always he bore to the east for the kid had never seen the ocean and he had a fancy to lay his hand upon the mane of the great gulf the gamesome colt of the greater waters so after three days he stood on the shore at corpus christi and looked out across the gentle ripples of a quiet sea captain boone of the schooner flyaway stood near his skiff which one of his crew was guarding in the surf when ready to sail he had discovered that one of the necessaries of life in the parallelogrammatic shape of plug tobacco had been forgotten a sailor had been dispatched for the missing cargo meanwhile the captain paced the sands chewing profanely at his pocket store a slim wiry youth in high heeled boots came down to the water s edge his face was boyish but with a premature severity that hinted at a man s experience his complexion was naturally dark and the sun and wind of an outdoor life had burned it to a coffee brown his hair was as black and straight as an indian s his face had not yet upturned to the humiliation of a razor his eyes were a cold and steady blue he carried his left arm somewhat away from his body for pearl handled s are frowned upon by town marshals and are a little bulky when placed in the left armhole of one s vest he looked beyond captain boone at the gulf with the impersonal and expressionless dignity of a chinese emperor thinkin of buyin that ar gulf buddy asked the captain made sarcastic by his narrow escape from a tobaccoless voyage why no said the kid gently i reckon not i never saw it before i was just looking at it not thinking of selling it are you not this trip said the captain i ll send it to you c o d when i get back to buenas tierras here comes that capstanfooted lubber with the chewin i ought to ve weighed anchor an hour ago is that your ship out there asked the kid why yes answered the captain if you want to call a schooner a ship and i don t mind lyin but you better say miller and gonzales owners and ordinary plain billy be damned old samuel k boone skipper where are you going to asked the refugee buenas tierras coast of south america i forgot what they called the country the last time i was there cargo lumber corrugated iron and machetes what kind of a country is it asked the kid hot or cold warmish buddy said the captain but a regular paradise lost for elegance of scenery and be yooty of geography ye re wakened every morning by the sweet singin of red birds with seven purple tails and the sighin of breezes in the posies and roses and the inhabitants never work for they can reach out and pick steamer baskets of the choicest hothouse fruit without gettin out of bed and there s no sunday and no ice and no rent and no troubles and no use and no nothin it s a great country for a man to go to sleep with and wait for somethin to turn up the bananys and oranges and hurricanes and pineapples that ye eat comes from there that sounds to me said the kid at last betraying interest what ll the expressage be to take me out there with you twenty four dollars said captain boone grub and transportation second cabin i haven t got a first cabin you ve got my company said the kid pulling out a buckskin bag with three hundred dollars he had gone to laredo for his regular blowout the duel in valdos s had cut short his season of hilarity but it had left him with nearly for aid in the flight that it had made necessary all right buddy said the captain i hope your ma won t blame me for this little childish escapade of yours he beckoned to one of the boat s crew let sanchez lift you out to the skiff so you won t get your feet wet thacker the united states consul at buenas tierras was not yet drunk it was only eleven o clock and he never arrived at his desired state of beatitude a state wherein he sang ancient maudlin vaudeville songs and pelted his screaming parrot with banana peels until the middle of the afternoon so when he looked up from his hammock at the sound of a slight cough and saw the kid standing in the door of the consulate he was still in a condition to extend the hospitality and courtesy due from the representative of a great nation don t disturb yourself said the kid easily i just dropped in they told me it was customary to light at your camp before starting in to round up the town i just came in on a ship from texas glad to see you mr said the consul the kid laughed sprague dalton he said it sounds funny to me to hear it i m called the llano kid in the rio grande country i m thacker said the consul take that cane bottom chair now if you ve come to invest you want somebody to advise you these dingies will cheat you out of the gold in your teeth if you don t understand their ways try a cigar much obliged said the kid but if it wasn t for my corn shucks and the little bag in my back pocket i couldn t live a minute he took out his makings and rolled a cigarette they speak spanish here said the consul you ll need an interpreter if there s anything i can do why i d be delighted if you re buying fruit lands or looking for a concession of any sort you ll want somebody who knows the ropes to look out for you i speak spanish said the kid about nine times better than i do english everybody speaks it on the range where i come from and i m not in the market for anything you speak spanish said thacker thoughtfully he regarded the kid absorbedly you look like a spaniard too he continued and you re from texas and you can t be more than twenty or twenty one i wonder if you ve got any nerve you got a deal of some kind to put through asked the texan with unexpected shrewdness are you open to a proposition said thacker what s the use to deny it said the kid i got into a little gun frolic down in laredo and plugged a white man there wasn t any mexican handy and i come down to your parrot and monkey range just for to smell the morning glories and marigolds now do you sabe thacker got up and closed the door let me see your hand he said he took the kid s left hand and examined the back of it closely i can do it he said excitedly your flesh is as hard as wood and as healthy as a baby s it will heal in a week if it s a fist fight you want to back me for said the kid don t put your money up yet make it gun work and i ll keep you company but no barehanded scrapping like ladies at a tea party for me it s easier than that said thacker just step here will you through the window he pointed to a two story white stuccoed house with wide galleries rising amid the deep green tropical foliage on a wooded hill that sloped gently from the sea in that house said thacker a fine old castilian gentleman and his wife are yearning to gather you into their arms and fill your pockets with money old santos urique lives there he owns half the gold mines in the country you haven t been eating loco weed have you asked the kid sit down again said thacker and i ll tell you twelve years ago they lost a kid no he didn t die although most of em here do from drinking the surface water he was a wild little devil even if he wasn t but eight years old everybody knows about it some americans who were through here prospecting for gold had letters to senor urique and the boy was a favorite with them they filled his head with big stories about the states and about a month after they left the kid disappeared too he was supposed to have stowed himself away among the banana bunches on a fruit steamer and gone to new orleans he was seen once afterward in texas it was thought but they never heard anything more of him old urique has spent thousands of dollars having him looked for the madam was broken up worst of all the kid was her life she wears mourning yet but they say she believes he ll come back to her some day and never gives up hope on the back of the boy s left hand was tattooed a flying eagle carrying a spear in his claws that s old urique s coat of arms or something that he inherited in spain the kid raised his left hand slowly and gazed at it curiously that s it said thacker reaching behind the official desk for his bottle of smuggled brandy you re not so slow i can do it what was i consul at sandakan for i never knew till now in a week i ll have the eagle bird with the frog sticker blended in so you d think you were born with it i brought a set of the needles and ink just because i was sure you d drop in some day mr dalton oh hell said the kid i thought i told you my name all right kid then it won t be that long how does senorito urique sound for a change i never played son any that i remember of said the kid if i had any parents to mention they went over the divide about the time i gave my first bleat what is the plan of your round up thacker leaned back against the wall and held his glass up to the light we ve come now said he to the question of how far you re willing to go in a little matter of the sort i told you why i came down here said the kid simply a good answer said the consul but you won t have to go that far here s the scheme after i get the trademark tattooed on your hand i ll notify old urique in the meantime i ll furnish you with all of the family history i can find out so you can be studying up points to talk about you ve got the looks you speak the spanish you know the facts you can tell about texas you ve got the tattoo mark when i notify them that the rightful heir has returned and is waiting to know whether he will be received and pardoned what will happen they ll simply rush down here and fall on your neck and the curtain goes down for refreshments and a stroll in the lobby i m waiting said the kid i haven t had my saddle off in your camp long pardner and i never met you before but if you intend to let it go at a parental blessing why i m mistaken in my man that s all thanks said the consul i haven t met anybody in a long time that keeps up with an argument as well as you do the rest of it is simple if they take you in only for a while it s long enough don t give em time to hunt up the strawberry mark on your left shoulder old urique keeps anywhere from to in his house all the time in a little safe that you could open with a shoe buttoner get it my skill as a tattooer is worth half the boddle we go halves and catch a tramp steamer for rio janeiro let the united states go to pieces if it can t get along without my services que dice senor it sounds to me said the kid nodding his head i m out for the dust all right then said thacker you ll have to keep close until we get the bird on you you can live in the back room here i do my own cooking and i ll make you as comfortable as a parsimonious government will allow me thacker had set the time at a week but it was two weeks before the design that he patiently tattooed upon the kid s hand was to his notion and then thacker called a muchacho and dispatched this note to the intended victim el senor don santos urique la casa blanca my dear sir i beg permission to inform you that there is in my house as a temporary guest a young man who arrived in buenas tierras from the united states some days ago without wishing to excite any hopes that may not be realized i think there is a possibility of his being your long absent son it might be well for you to call and see him if he is it is my opinion that his intention was to return to his home but upon arriving here his courage failed him from doubts as to how he would be received your true servant thompson thacker half an hour afterward quick time for buenas tierras senor urique s ancient landau drove to the consul s door with the barefooted coachman beating and shouting at the team of fat awkward horses a tall man with a white moustache alighted and assisted to the ground a lady who was dressed and veiled in unrelieved black the two hastened inside and were met by thacker with his best diplomatic bow by his desk stood a slender young man with clear cut sun browned features and smoothly brushed black hair senora urique threw back her black veil with a quick gesture she was past middle age and her hair was beginning to silver but her full proud figure and clear olive skin retained traces of the beauty peculiar to the basque province but once you had seen her eyes and comprehended the great sadness that was revealed in their deep shadows and hopeless expression you saw that the woman lived only in some memory she bent upon the young man a long look of the most agonized questioning then her great black eyes turned and her gaze rested upon his left hand and then with a sob not loud but seeming to shake the room she cried hijo mio and caught the llano kid to her heart a month afterward the kid came to the consulate in response to a message sent by thacker he looked the young spanish caballero his clothes were imported and the wiles of the jewellers had not been spent upon him in vain a more than respectable diamond shone on his finger as he rolled a shuck cigarette what s doing asked thacker nothing much said the kid calmly i eat my first iguana steak to day they re them big lizards you sabe i reckon though that frijoles and side bacon would do me about as well do you care for iguanas thacker no nor for some other kinds of reptiles said thacker it was three in the afternoon and in another hour he would be in his state of beatitude it s time you were making good sonny he went on with an ugly look on his reddened face you re not playing up to me square you ve been the prodigal son for four weeks now and you could have had veal for every meal on a gold dish if you d wanted it now mr kid do you think it s right to leave me out so long on a husk diet what s the trouble don t you get your filial eyes on anything that looks like cash in the casa blanca don t tell me you don t everybody knows where old urique keeps his stuff it s u s currency too he don t accept anything else what s doing don t say nothing this time why sure said the kid admiring his diamond there s plenty of money up there i m no judge of collateral in bunches but i will undertake for to say that i ve seen the rise of at a time in that tin grub box that my adopted father calls his safe and he lets me carry the key sometimes just to show me that he knows i m the real francisco that strayed from the herd a long time ago well what are you waiting for asked thacker angrily don t you forget that i can upset your apple cart any day i want to if old urique knew you were an imposter what sort of things would happen to you oh you don t know this country mr texas kid the laws here have got mustard spread between em these people here d stretch you out like a frog that had been stepped on and give you about fifty sticks at every corner of the plaza and they d wear every stick out too what was left of you they d feed to alligators i might just as well tell you now pardner said the kid sliding down low on his steamer chair that things are going to stay just as they are they re about right now what do you mean asked thacker rattling the bottom of his glass on his desk the scheme s off said the kid and whenever you have the pleasure of speaking to me address me as don francisco urique i ll guarantee i ll answer to it we ll let colonel urique keep his money his little tin safe is as good as the time locker in the first national bank of laredo as far as you and me are concerned you re going to throw me down then are you said the consul sure said the kid cheerfully throw you down that s it and now i ll tell you why the first night i was up at the colonel s house they introduced me to a bedroom no blankets on the floor a real room with a bed and things in it and before i was asleep in comes this artificial mother and tucks in the covers panchito she says my little lost one god has brought you back to me i bless his name forever it was that or some truck like that she said and down comes a drop or two of rain and hits me on the nose and all that stuck by me mr thacker and it s been that way ever since and it s got to stay that way don t you think that it s for what s in it for me either that i say so if you have any such ideas keep em to yourself i haven t had much truck with women in my life and no mothers to speak of but here s a lady that we ve got to keep fooled once she stood it twice she won t i m a low down wolf and the devil may have sent me on this trail instead of god but i ll travel it to the end and now don t forget that i m don francisco urique whenever you happen to mention my name i ll expose you to day you you double dyed traitor stammered thacker the kid arose and without violence took thacker by the throat with a hand of steel and shoved him slowly into a corner then he drew from under his left arm his pearl handled and poked the cold muzzle of it against the consul s mouth i told you why i come here he said with his old freezing smile if i leave here you ll be the reason never forget it pardner now what is my name er don francisco urique gasped thacker from outside came a sound of wheels and the shouting of some one and the sharp thwacks of a wooden whipstock upon the backs of fat horses the kid put up his gun and walked toward the door but he turned again and came back to the trembling thacker and held up his left hand with its back toward the consul there s one more reason he said slowly why things have got to stand as they are the fellow i killed in laredo had one of them same pictures on his left hand outside the ancient landau of don santos urique rattled to the door the coachman ceased his bellowing senora urique in a voluminous gay gown of white lace and flying ribbons leaned forward with a happy look in her great soft eyes are you within dear son she called in the rippling castilian madre mia yo vengo mother i come answered the young don francisco urique the passing of black eagle for some months of a certain year a grim bandit infested the texas border along the rio grande peculiarly striking to the optic nerve was this notorious marauder his personality secured him the title of black eagle the terror of the border many fearsome tales are on record concerning the doings of him and his followers suddenly in the space of a single minute black eagle vanished from earth he was never heard of again his own band never even guessed the mystery of his disappearance the border ranches and settlements feared he would come again to ride and ravage the mesquite flats he never will it is to disclose the fate of black eagle that this narrative is written the initial movement of the story is furnished by the foot of a bartender in st louis his discerning eye fell upon the form of chicken ruggles as he pecked with avidity at the free lunch chicken was a hobo he had a long nose like the bill of a fowl an inordinate appetite for poultry and a habit of gratifying it without expense which accounts for the name given him by his fellow vagrants physicians agree that the partaking of liquids at meal times is not a healthy practice the hygiene of the saloon promulgates the opposite chicken had neglected to purchase a drink to accompany his meal the bartender rounded the counter caught the injudicious diner by the ear with a lemon squeezer led him to the door and kicked him into the street thus the mind of chicken was brought to realize the signs of coming winter the night was cold the stars shone with unkindly brilliancy people were hurrying along the streets in two egotistic jostling streams men had donned their overcoats and chicken knew to an exact percentage the increased difficulty of coaxing dimes from those buttoned in vest pockets the time had come for his annual exodus to the south a little boy five or six years old stood looking with covetous eyes in a confectioner s window in one small hand he held an empty two ounce vial in the other he grasped tightly something flat and round with a shining milled edge the scene presented a field of operations commensurate to chicken s talents and daring after sweeping the horizon to make sure that no official tug was cruising near he insidiously accosted his prey the boy having been early taught by his household to regard altruistic advances with extreme suspicion received the overtures coldly then chicken knew that he must make one of those desperate nerve shattering plunges into speculation that fortune sometimes requires of those who would win her favour five cents was his capital and this he must risk against the chance of winning what lay within the close grasp of the youngster s chubby hand it was a fearful lottery chicken knew but he must accomplish his end by strategy since he had a wholesome terror of plundering infants by force once in a park driven by hunger he had committed an onslaught upon a bottle of peptonized infant s food in the possession of an occupant of a baby carriage the outraged infant had so promptly opened its mouth and pressed the button that communicated with the welkin that help arrived and chicken did his thirty days in a snug coop wherefore he was as he said leary of kids beginning artfully to question the boy concerning his choice of sweets he gradually drew out the information he wanted mamma said he was to ask the drug store man for ten cents worth of paregoric in the bottle he was to keep his hand shut tight over the dollar he must not stop to talk to anyone in the street he must ask the drug store man to wrap up the change and put it in the pocket of his trousers indeed they had pockets two of them and he liked chocolate creams best chicken went into the store and turned plunger he invested his entire capital in c a n d y stocks simply to pave the way to the greater risk following he gave the sweets to the youngster and had the satisfaction of perceiving that confidence was established after that it was easy to obtain leadership of the expedition to take the investment by the hand and lead it to a nice drug store he knew of in the same block there chicken with a parental air passed over the dollar and called for the medicine while the boy crunched his candy glad to be relieved of the responsibility of the purchase and then the successful investor searching his pockets found an overcoat button the extent of his winter trousseau and wrapping it carefully placed the ostensible change in the pocket of confiding juvenility setting the youngster s face homeward and patting him benevolently on the back for chicken s heart was as soft as those of his feathered namesakes the speculator quit the market with a profit of per cent on his invested capital two hours later an iron mountain freight engine pulled out of the railroad yards texas bound with a string of empties in one of the cattle cars half buried in excelsior chicken lay at ease beside him in his nest was a quart bottle of very poor whisky and a paper bag of bread and cheese mr ruggles in his private car was on his trip south for the winter season for a week that car was trundled southward shifted laid over and manipulated after the manner of rolling stock but chicken stuck to it leaving it only at necessary times to satisfy his hunger and thirst he knew it must go down to the cattle country and san antonio in the heart of it was his goal there the air was salubrious and mild the people indulgent and long suffering the bartenders there would not kick him if he should eat too long or too often at one place they would swear at him as if by rote and without heat they swore so drawlingly and they rarely paused short of their full vocabulary which was copious so that chicken had often gulped a good meal during the process of the vituperative prohibition the season there was always spring like the plazas were pleasant at night with music and gaiety except during the slight and infrequent cold snaps one could sleep comfortably out of doors in case the interiors should develop inhospitability at texarkana his car was switched to the i and g n then still southward it trailed until at length it crawled across the colorado bridge at austin and lined out straight as an arrow for the run to san antonio when the freight halted at that town chicken was fast asleep in ten minutes the train was off again for laredo the end of the road those empty cattle cars were for distribution along the line at points from which the ranches shipped their stock when chicken awoke his car was stationary looking out between the slats he saw it was a bright moonlit night scrambling out he saw his car with three others abandoned on a little siding in a wild and lonesome country a cattle pen and chute stood on one side of the track the railroad bisected a vast dim ocean of prairie in the midst of which chicken with his futile rolling stock was as completely stranded as was robinson with his land locked boat a white post stood near the rails going up to it chicken read the letters at the top s a laredo was nearly as far to the south he was almost a hundred miles from any town coyotes began to yelp in the mysterious sea around him chicken felt lonesome he had lived in boston without an education in chicago without nerve in philadelphia without a sleeping place in new york without a pull and in pittsburg sober and yet he had never felt so lonely as now suddenly through the intense silence he heard the whicker of a horse the sound came from the side of the track toward the east and chicken began to explore timorously in that direction he stepped high along the mat of curly mesquit grass for he was afraid of everything there might be in this wilderness snakes rats brigands centipedes mirages cowboys fandangoes tarantulas tamales he had read of them in the story papers rounding a clump of prickly pear that reared high its fantastic and menacing array of rounded heads he was struck to shivering terror by a snort and a thunderous plunge as the horse himself startled bounded away some fifty yards and then resumed his grazing but here was the one thing in the desert that chicken did not fear he had been reared on a farm he had handled horses understood them and could ride approaching slowly and speaking soothingly he followed the animal which after its first flight seemed gentle enough and secured the end of the twenty foot lariat that dragged after him in the grass it required him but a few moments to contrive the rope into an ingenious nose bridle after the style of the mexican borsal in another he was upon the horse s back and off at a splendid lope giving the animal free choice of direction he will take me somewhere said chicken to himself it would have been a thing of joy that untrammelled gallop over the moonlit prairie even to chicken who loathed exertion but that his mood was not for it his head ached a growing thirst was upon him the somewhere whither his lucky mount might convey him was full of dismal peradventure and now he noted that the horse moved to a definite goal where the prairie lay smooth he kept his course straight as an arrow s toward the east deflected by hill or arroyo or impractical spinous brakes he quickly flowed again into the current charted by his unerring instinct at last upon the side of a gentle rise he suddenly subsided to a complacent walk a stone s cast away stood a little mott of coma trees beneath it a jacal such as the mexicans erect a one room house of upright poles daubed with clay and roofed with grass or tule reeds an experienced eye would have estimated the spot as the headquarters of a small sheep ranch in the moonlight the ground in the nearby corral showed pulverized to a level smoothness by the hoofs of the sheep everywhere was carelessly distributed the paraphernalia of the place ropes bridles saddles sheep pelts wool sacks feed troughs and camp litter the barrel of drinking water stood in the end of the two horse wagon near the door the harness was piled promiscuous upon the wagon tongue soaking up the dew chicken slipped to earth and tied the horse to a tree he halloed again and again but the house remained quiet the door stood open and he entered cautiously the light was sufficient for him to see that no one was at home the room was that of a bachelor ranchman who was content with the necessaries of life chicken rummaged intelligently until he found what he had hardly dared hope for a small brown jug that still contained something near a quart of his desire half an hour later chicken now a gamecock of hostile aspect emerged from the house with unsteady steps he had drawn upon the absent ranchman s equipment to replace his own ragged attire he wore a suit of coarse brown ducking the coat being a sort of rakish bolero jaunty to a degree boots he had donned and spurs that whirred with every lurching step buckled around him was a belt full of cartridges with a big six shooter in each of its two holsters prowling about he found blankets a saddle and bridle with which he caparisoned his steed again mounting he rode swiftly away singing a loud and tuneless song bud king s band of desperadoes outlaws and horse and cattle thieves were in camp at a secluded spot on the bank of the frio their depredations in the rio grande country while no bolder than usual had been advertised more extensively and captain kinney s company of rangers had been ordered down to look after them consequently bud king who was a wise general instead of cutting out a hot trail for the upholders of the law as his men wished to do retired for the time to the prickly fastnesses of the frio valley though the move was a prudent one and not incompatible with bud s well known courage it raised dissension among the members of the band in fact while they thus lay ingloriously perdu in the brush the question of bud king s fitness for the leadership was argued with closed doors as it were by his followers never before had bud s skill or efficiency been brought to criticism but his glory was wandering and such is glory s fate in the light of a newer star the sentiment of the band was crystallizing into the opinion that black eagle could lead them with more lustre profit and distinction this black eagle sub titled the terror of the border had been a member of the gang about three months one night while they were in camp on the san miguel water hole a solitary horseman on the regulation fiery steed dashed in among them the newcomer was of a portentous and devastating aspect a beak like nose with a predatory curve projected above a mass of bristling blue black whiskers his eye was cavernous and fierce he was spurred sombreroed booted garnished with revolvers abundantly drunk and very much unafraid few people in the country drained by the rio bravo would have cared thus to invade alone the camp of bud king but this fell bird swooped fearlessly upon them and demanded to be fed hospitality in the prairie country is not limited even if your enemy pass your way you must feed him before you shoot him you must empty your larder into him before you empty your lead so the stranger of undeclared intentions was set down to a mighty feast a talkative bird he was full of most marvellous loud tales and exploits and speaking a language at times obscure but never colourless he was a new sensation to bud king s men who rarely encountered new types they hung delighted upon his vainglorious boasting the spicy strangeness of his lingo his contemptuous familiarity with life the world and remote places and the extravagant frankness with which he conveyed his sentiments to their guest the band of outlaws seemed to be nothing more than a congregation of country bumpkins whom he was stringing for grub just as he would have told his stories at the back door of a farmhouse to wheedle a meal and indeed his ignorance was not without excuse for the bad man of the southwest does not run to extremes those brigands might justly have been taken for a little party of peaceable rustics assembled for a fish fry or pecan gathering gentle of manner slouching of gait soft voiced unpicturesquely clothed not one of them presented to the eye any witness of the desperate records they had earned for two days the glittering stranger within the camp was feasted then by common consent he was invited to become a member of the band he consented presenting for enrollment the prodigious name of captain montressor this name was immediately overruled by the band and piggy substituted as a compliment to the awful and insatiate appetite of its owner thus did the texas border receive the most spectacular brigand that ever rode its chaparral for the next three months bud king conducted business as usual escaping encounters with law officers and being content with reasonable profits the band ran off some very good companies of horses from the ranges and a few bunches of fine cattle which they got safely across the rio grande and disposed of to fair advantage often the band would ride into the little villages and mexican settlements terrorizing the inhabitants and plundering for the provisions and ammunition they needed it was during these bloodless raids that piggy s ferocious aspect and frightful voice gained him a renown more widespread and glorious than those other gentle voiced and sad faced desperadoes could have acquired in a lifetime the mexicans most apt in nomenclature first called him the black eagle and used to frighten the babes by threatening them with tales of the dreadful robber who carried off little children in his great beak soon the name extended and black eagle the terror of the border became a recognized factor in exaggerated newspaper reports and ranch gossip the country from the nueces to the rio grande was a wild but fertile stretch given over to the sheep and cattle ranches range was free the inhabitants were few the law was mainly a letter and the pirates met with little opposition until the flaunting and garish piggy gave the band undue advertisement then mckinney s ranger company headed for those precincts and bud king knew that it meant grim and sudden war or else temporary retirement regarding the risk to be unnecessary he drew off his band to an almost inaccessible spot on the bank of the frio wherefore as has been said dissatisfaction arose among the members and impeachment proceedings against bud were premeditated with black eagle in high favour for the succession bud king was not unaware of the sentiment and he called aside cactus taylor his trusted lieutenant to discuss it if the boys said bud ain t satisfied with me i m willing to step out they re buckin against my way of handlin em and specially because i concludes to hit the brush while sam kinney is ridin the line i saves em from bein shot or sent up on a state contract and they up and says i m no good it ain t so much that explained cactus as it is they re plum locoed about piggy they want them whiskers and that nose of his to split the wind at the head of the column there s somethin mighty seldom about piggy declared bud musingly i never yet see anything on the hoof that he exactly grades up with he can shore holler a plenty and he straddles a hoss from where you laid the chunk but he ain t never been smoked yet you know cactus we ain t had a row since he s been with us piggy s all right for skearin the greaser kids and layin waste a cross roads store i reckon he s the finest canned oyster buccaneer and cheese pirate that ever was but how s his appetite for fightin i ve knowed some citizens you d think was starvin for trouble get a bad case of dyspepsy the first dose of lead they had to take he talks all spraddled out said cactus bout the rookuses he s been in he claims to have saw the elephant and hearn the owl i know replied bud using the cowpuncher s expressive phrase of skepticism but it sounds to me this conversation was held one night in camp while the other members of the band eight in number were sprawling around the fire lingering over their supper when bud and cactus ceased talking they heard piggy s formidable voice holding forth to the others as usual while he was engaged in checking though never satisfying his ravening appetite wat s de use he was saying of chasin little red cowses and hosses round for t ousands of miles dere ain t nuttin in it gallopin t rough dese bushes and briers and gettin a t irst dat a brewery couldn t put out and missin meals say you know what i d do if i was main finger of dis bunch i d stick up a train i d blow de express car and make hard dollars where you guys get wind youse makes me tired dis sook cow kind of cheap sport gives me a pain later on a deputation waited on bud they stood on one leg chewed mesquit twigs and circumlocuted for they hated to hurt his feelings bud foresaw their business and made it easy for them bigger risks and larger profits was what they wanted the suggestion of piggy s about holding up a train had fired their imagination and increased their admiration for the dash and boldness of the instigator they were such simple artless and custom bound bush rangers that they had never before thought of extending their habits beyond the running off of live stock and the shooting of such of their acquaintances as ventured to interfere bud acted on the level agreeing to take a subordinate place in the gang until black eagle should have been given a trial as leader after a great deal of consultation studying of time tables and discussion of the country s topography the time and place for carrying out their new enterprise was decided upon at that time there was a feedstuff famine in mexico and a cattle famine in certain parts of the united states and there was a brisk international trade much money was being shipped along the railroads that connected the two republics it was agreed that the most promising place for the contemplated robbery was at espina a little station on the i and g n about forty miles north of laredo the train stopped there one minute the country around was wild and unsettled the station consisted of but one house in which the agent lived black eagle s band set out riding by night arriving in the vicinity of espina they rested their horses all day in a thicket a few miles distant the train was due at espina at p m they could rob the train and be well over the mexican border with their booty by daylight the next morning to do black eagle justice he exhibited no signs of flinching from the responsible honours that had been conferred upon him he assigned his men to their respective posts with discretion and coached them carefully as to their duties on each side of the track four of the band were to lie concealed in the chaparral gotch ear rodgers was to stick up the station agent bronco charlie was to remain with the horses holding them in readiness at a spot where it was calculated the engine would be when the train stopped bud king was to lie hidden on one side and black eagle himself on the other the two would get the drop on the engineer and fireman force them to descend and proceed to the rear then the express car would be looted and the escape made no one was to move until black eagle gave the signal by firing his revolver the plan was perfect at ten minutes to train time every man was at his post effectually concealed by the thick chaparral that grew almost to the rails the night was dark and lowering with a fine drizzle falling from the flying gulf clouds black eagle crouched behind a bush within five yards of the track two six shooters were belted around him occasionally he drew a large black bottle from his pocket and raised it to his mouth a star appeared far down the track which soon waxed into the headlight of the approaching train it came on with an increasing roar the engine bore down upon the ambushing desperadoes with a glare and a shriek like some avenging monster come to deliver them to justice black eagle flattened himself upon the ground the engine contrary to their calculations instead of stopping between him and bud king s place of concealment passed fully forty years farther before it came to a stand the bandit leader rose to his feet and peered through the bush his men all lay quiet awaiting the signal immediately opposite black eagle was a thing that drew his attention instead of being a regular passenger train it was a mixed one before him stood a box car the door of which by some means had been left slightly open black eagle went up to it and pushed the door farther open an odour came forth a damp rancid familiar musty intoxicating beloved odour stirring strongly at old memories of happy days and travels black eagle sniffed at the witching smell as the returned wanderer smells of the rose that twines his boyhood s cottage home nostalgia seized him he put his hand inside excelsior dry springy curly soft enticing covered the floor outside the drizzle had turned to a chilling rain the train bell clanged the bandit chief unbuckled his belt and cast it with its revolvers upon the ground his spurs followed quickly and his broad sombrero black eagle was moulting the train started with a rattling jerk the ex terror of the border scrambled into the box car and closed the door stretched luxuriously upon the excelsior with the black bottle clasped closely to his breast his eyes closed and a foolish happy smile upon his terrible features chicken ruggles started upon his return trip undisturbed with the band of desperate bandits lying motionless awaiting the signal to attack the train pulled out from espina as its speed increased and the black masses of chaparral went whizzing past on either side the express messenger lighting his pipe looked through his window and remarked feelingly what a jim dandy place for a hold up a retrieved reformation a guard came to the prison shoe shop where jimmy valentine was assiduously stitching uppers and escorted him to the front office there the warden handed jimmy his pardon which had been signed that morning by the governor jimmy took it in a tired kind of way he had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence he had expected to stay only about three months at the longest when a man with as many friends on the outside as jimmy valentine had is received in the stir it is hardly worth while to cut his hair now valentine said the warden you ll go out in the morning brace up and make a man of yourself you re not a bad fellow at heart stop cracking safes and live straight me said jimmy in surprise why i never cracked a safe in my life oh no laughed the warden of course not let s see now how was it you happened to get sent up on that springfield job was it because you wouldn t prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high toned society or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you it s always one or the other with you innocent victims me said jimmy still blankly virtuous why warden i never was in springfield in my life take him back cronin said the warden and fix him up with outgoing clothes unlock him at seven in the morning and let him come to the bull pen better think over my advice valentine at a quarter past seven on the next morning jimmy stood in the warden s outer office he had on a suit of the villainously fitting ready made clothes and a pair of the stiff squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests the clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity the warden gave him a cigar and shook hands valentine was chronicled on the books pardoned by governor and mr james valentine walked out into the sunshine disregarding the song of the birds the waving green trees and the smell of the flowers jimmy headed straight for a restaurant there he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him from there he proceeded leisurely to the depot he tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door and boarded his train three hours set him down in a little town near the state line he went to the cafe of one mike dolan and shook hands with mike who

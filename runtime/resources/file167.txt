of his soul once when we left him unpaid with egregious excuses i looked back and saw him shaking with inaudible laughter behind his film now and then we paid up back scores but the chief thing at cypher s was milly milly was a waitress she was a grand example of kraft s theory of the artistic adjustment of nature she belonged largely to waiting as minerva did to the art of scrapping or venus to the science of serious flirtation pedestalled and in bronze she might have stood with the noblest of her heroic sisters as liver and bacon enlivening the world she belonged to cypher s you expected to see her colossal figure loom through that reeking blue cloud of smoke from frying fat just as you expect the palisades to appear through a drifting hudson river fog there amid the steam of vegetables and the vapours of acres of ham and the crash of crockery the clatter of steel the screaming of short orders the cries of the hungering and all the horrid tumult of feeding man surrounded by swarms of the buzzing winged beasts bequeathed us by pharaoh milly steered her magnificent way like some great liner cleaving among the canoes of howling savages our goddess of grub was built on lines so majestic that they could be followed only with awe her sleeves were always rolled above her elbows she could have taken us three musketeers in her two hands and dropped us out of the window she had seen fewer years than any of us but she was of such superb evehood and simplicity that she mothered us from the beginning cypher s store of eatables she poured out upon us with royal indifference to price and quantity as from a cornucopia that knew no exhaustion her voice rang like a great silver bell her smile was many toothed and frequent she seemed like a yellow sunrise on mountain tops i never saw her but i thought of the yosemite and yet somehow i could never think of her as existing outside of cypher s there nature had placed her and she had taken root and grown mightily she seemed happy and took her few poor dollars on saturday nights with the flushed pleasure of a child that receives an unexpected donation it was kraft who first voiced the fear that each of us must have held latently it came up apropos of course of certain questions of art at which we were hammering one of us compared the harmony existing between a haydn symphony and pistache ice cream to the exquisite congruity between milly and cypher s there is a certain fate hanging over milly said kraft and if it overtakes her she is lost to cypher s and to us she will grow fat asked judkins fearsomely she will go to night school and become refined i ventured anxiously it is this said kraft punctuating in a puddle of spilled coffee with a stiff forefinger caesar had his brutus the cotton has its boliworm the chorus girl has her pittsburger the summer boarder has his poison ivy the hero has his carnegie medal art has its morgan the rose has its speak i interrupted much perturbed you do not think that milly will begin to lace one day concluded kraft solemnly there will come to cypher s for a plate of beans a millionaire lumberman from wisconsin and he will marry milly never exclaimed judkins and t in horror a lumberman repeated kraft hoarsely and a millionaire lumberman i sighed despairingly from wisconsin groaned judkins we agreed that the awful fate seemed to menace her few things were less improbable milly like some vast virgin stretch of pine woods was made to catch the lumberman s eye and well we knew the habits of the badgers once fortune smiled upon them straight to new york they hie and lay their goods at the feet of the girl who serves them beans in a beanery why the alphabet itself connives the sunday newspaper s headliner s work is cut for him winsome waitress wins wealthy wisconsin woodsman for a while we felt that milly was on the verge of being lost to us it was our love of the unerring artistic adjustment of nature that inspired us we could not give her over to a lumberman doubly accursed by wealth and provincialism we shuddered to think of milly with her voice modulated and her elbows covered pouring tea in the marble teepee of a tree murderer no in cypher s she belonged in the bacon smoke the cabbage perfume the grand wagnerian chorus of hurled ironstone china and rattling casters our fears must have been prophetic for on that same evening the wildwood discharged upon us milly s preordained confiscator our fee to adjustment and order but alaska and not wisconsin bore the burden of the visitation we were at our supper of beef stew and dried apples when he trotted in as if on the heels of a dog team and made one of the mess at our table with the freedom of the camps he assaulted our ears and claimed the fellowship of men lost in the wilds of a hash house we embraced him as a specimen and in three minutes we had all but died for one another as friends he was rugged and bearded and wind dried he had just come off the trail he said at one of the north river ferries i fancied i could see the snow dust of chilcoot yet powdering his shoulders and then he strewed the table with the nuggets stuffed ptarmigans bead work and seal pelts of the returned kiondiker and began to prate to us of his millions bank drafts for two millions was his summing up and a thousand a day piling up from my claims and now i want some beef stew and canned peaches i never

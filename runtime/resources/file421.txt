that would have spoken complaint when the train was full then he exhibited to all who might observe and admire his irresistible genius as a ruler of men with his knees with his elbows with his shoulders with his resistless feet he shoved crushed slammed heaved kicked flung pounded the overplus of passengers aboard then with the sounds of its wheels drowned by the moans shrieks prayers and

war correspondent and playright richmond hobson davis could see him now o connor ought to be dramatized the atavism of john tom little bear o henry thought this the best of the jeff peters stories all the rest of which are included in the gentle grafter except cupid a la carte in the heart of the west the atavism of john tom little bear appeared in everybody s magazine for july i saw a light in jeff peters s room over the red front drug store i hastened toward it for i had not known that jeff was in town he is a man of the hadji breed of a hundred occupations with a story to tell when he will of each one i found jeff repacking his grip for a run down to florida to look at an orange grove for which he had traded a month before his mining claim on the yukon he kicked me a chair with the same old humorous profound smile on his seasoned countenance it had been eight months since we had met but his greeting was such as men pass from day to day time is jeff s servant and the continent is a big lot across which he cuts to his many roads for a while we skirmished along the edges of unprofitable talk which culminated in that unquiet problem of the philippines all them tropical races said jeff could be run out better with their own jockeys up the tropical man knows what he wants all he wants is a season ticket to the cock fights and a pair of western union climbers to go up the bread fruit tree the anglo saxon man wants him to learn to conjugate and wear suspenders he ll be happiest in his own way i was shocked education man i said is the watchword in time they will rise to our

bear that the president missed an other story by a young woman who spent a week as a spy making overalls on the east side another fiction story that reeks of the garage and a cer tain make of automobile of course the title contains the words cupid and chauffeur an article on naval strategy illustrated with cuts of the spanish armada and the new staten island ferry boats an other story of a political boss who won the love of a fifth avenue belle by blackening her eye and refusing to vote for an iniquitous ordinance it doesn t say whether it was in the street cleaning department or congress and nineteen pages by the editors brag ging about the circulation the whole thing sammy is an obituary on romance sammy brown sat comfortably in the leather arm chair by the open window his suit was a vehement brown with visible checks beautifully matched in shade by the ends of four cigars that his vest pocket poorly concealed light tan were his shoes gray his socks sky blue his apparent linen snowy and high and adamantine his collar against which a black but terfly had alighted and spread his wings sammy s face least important was round and pleasant and pinkish and in his eyes you saw no haven for fleeing romance that window of ravenel s apartment opened upon an old garden full of ancient trees and shrubbery the apartment house towered above one side of it a high brick wall fended it from the street oppo site ravenel s window an old old mansion stood half hidden in the shade of the summer foliage the house was a castle besieged the city howled and roared and shrieked and beat upon its double doors and shook white fluttering checks above the wall offering terms of surrender the gray dust settled upon the trees the siege was pressed hotter but the draw bridge was not lowered no further will the language of chivalry serve inside lived an old gentleman who loved his home and did not wish to sell it that is all the romance of the besieged castle three or four times every week came sammy brown to ravenel s apartment he belonged to the poet s club for the former browns had been con spicuous though sammy bad been vulgarized by business he had no tears for departed romance the song of the ticker was the one that reached his heart and when it came to matters equine and batting scores he was something of a pink edition he loved to sit in the leather armchair by ravenel s window and ravenel didn t mind particularly sammy seemed to enjoy his talk and then the broker s clerk was such a perfect embodiment of modernity and the day s sordid practicality that ravenel rather liked to use him as a scapegoat i ll tell you what s the matter with you said sammy with the shrewdness that business had taught him the magazine has turned down some of your poetry stunts that s why you are sore at it that would be a good guess in wall street or in a campaign for the presidency of a woman s club said ravenel quietly now there is a poem if you will allow me to call it that of my own in this number of the magazine read it to me said sammy watching a cloud of pipe smoke be had just blown out the window ravenel was no greater than achilles no one is there is bound to be a spot the somebody or other must take bold of us somewhere when she dips us in the something or other that makes us invulnerable he read aloud this verse in the magazine the four roses one rose i twined within your hair white rose that spake of worth and one you placed upon your breast red rose love s seal of birth you plucked another from its stem tea rose that means for aye and one you gave that bore for me the thorns of memory that s a crackerjack said sammy admiringly there are five more verses said ravenel pa tiently sardonic one naturally pauses at the end of each of course oh let s have the rest old man shouted sammy contritely i didn t mean to cut you off i m not much of a poetry expert you know i never saw a poem that didn t look like it ought to have terminal facilities at the end of every verse reel off the rest of it ravenel sighed and laid the magazine down all right said sammy cheerfully we ll have it next time i ll be off now got a date at five o clock he took a last look at the shaded green garden and left whistling in an off key an untuneful air from a roofless farce comedy the next afternoon ravenel while polishing a ragged line of a new sonnet reclined by the window overlooking the besieged garden of the unmercenary baron suddenly he sat up spilling two rhymes and a syllable or two through the trees one window of the old mansion could be seen clearly in its window draped in flow ing white leaned the angel of all his dreams of ro mance and poesy young fresh as a drop of dew graceful as a spray of clematis conferring upon the garden hemmed in by the roaring traffic the air of a princess s bower beautiful as any flower sung by poet thus ravenel saw her for the first time she lingered for a while and then disappeared within leaving a few notes of a birdlike ripple of song to reach his entranced ears through the rattle of cabs and the snarling of the electric cars thus as if to challenge the poet s flaunt at ro mance and to punish him for his recreancy to the undying spirit of youth and beauty this vision bad dawned upon him with a thrilling and accusive power and so metabolic was the power that in an instant the atoms of ravenel s entire world were redistrib uted the laden drays that passed the house in which she lived rumbled a deep double bass to the tune of love the newsboys shouts were the notes of singing birds that garden was the pleasance of the capulets the janitor was an ogre himself a knight ready with sword lance or lute thus does romance show herself amid forests of brick and stone when she gets lost in the city and there has to be sent out a general alarm to find her again at four in the afternoon ravenel looked out across the garden in the window of his hopes were set four small vases each containing a great full blown rose red and white and as he gazed she leaned above them shaming them with her loveliness and seeming to direct her eyes pensively toward his own window and then as though she had caught his respectful but ardent regard she melted away leaving the fragrant emblems on the window sill yes emblems he would be unworthy if be had not understood she had read his poem the four roses it had reached her heart and this was its romantic answer of course she must know that ravenel the poet lived there across her garden his picture too she must have seen in the magazines the delicate tender modest flattering message could not be ignored ravenel noticed beside the roses a small flowering pot containing a plant without shame be brought his opera glasses and employed them from the cover of his window curtain a nutmeg geranium with the true poetic instinct be dragged a book of useless information from his shelves and tore open the leaves at the language of flowers geranium nutmeg i expect a meeting so romance never does things by halves if she comes back to you she brings gifts and her knitting and will sit in your chimney corner if you will let her and now ravenel smiled the lover smiles when be thinks he has won the woman who loves ceases to smile with victory he ends a battle she begins hers what a pretty idea to set the four roses in her window for him to see she must have a sweet poetic soul and now to contrive the meeting a whistling and slamming of doors preluded the coming of sammy brown ravenel smiled again even sammy brown was shone upon by the far flung rays of the renaissance sammy with his ultra clothes his horseshoe pin his plump face his trite slang his uncomprehending admiration of ravenel the broker s clerk made an excellent foil to the new bright unseen visitor to the poet s sombre apartment sammy went to his old seat by the window and looked out over the dusty green foliage in the garden then he looked at his watch and rose hastily by grabs he exclaimed twenty after four i can t stay old man i ve got a date at why did you come then asked ravenel with sarcastic jocularity if you had an engagement at that time i thought you business men kept better account of your minutes and seconds than that sammy hesitated in the doorway and turned pinker fact is ravvy be explained as to a customer whose margin is exhausted i didn t know i had it till i came i ll tell you old man there s a dandy girl in that old house next door that i m dead gone on i put it straight we re engaged the old man says nit but that don t go he keeps her pretty close i can see edith s window from yours here she gives me a tip when she s going shopping and i meet her it s to day maybe i ought to have explained sooner but i know it s all right with you so long how do you get your tip as you call it asked ravenel losing a little spontaneity from his smile roses said sammy briefly four of em to day means four o clock at the corner of broadway and twenty third but the geranium persisted ravenel clutch ing at the end of flying romance s trailing robe means half past shouted sammy from the hall see you to morrow the city of dreadful night during the recent warmed over spell said my friend carney driver of express wagon no a good many opportunities was had of observing human nature through peekaboo waists the park commissioner and the commissioner of polis and the forestry commission gets together and agrees to let the people sleep in the parks until the weather bureau gets the thermometer down again to a living basis so they draws up open air resolu tions and has them k d by the secretary of agri culture mr comstock and the village improvement mosquito exterminating society of south orange n j when the proclamation was made opening up to the people by special grant the public parks that be long to em there was a general exodus into central park by the communities existing along its borders in ten minutes after sundown you d have thought that there was an undress rehearsal of a potato famine in ireland and a kishineff massacre they come by families gangs clambake societies clans clubs and tribes from all sides to enjoy a cool sleep on the grass them that didn t have oil stoves brought along plenty of blankets so as not to be upset with the cold and discomforts of sleeping outdoors by building fires of the shade trees and huddling together in the bridle paths and burrowing under the grass where the ground was soft enough the likes of head of people successfully battled against the night air in central park alone ye know i live in the elegant furnished apart ment house called the beersheba flats over against the elevated portion of the new york central rail road when the order come to the flats that all hands must turn out and sleep in the park according to the instructions of the consulting committee of the city club and the murphy draying returfing and sod ding company there was a look of a couple of fires and an eviction all over the place the tenants began to pack up feather beds rub ber boots strings of garlic hot water bags porta ble canoes and scuttles of coal to take along for the sake of comfort the sidewalk looked like a russian camp in oyama s line of mareb there was waiting and lamenting up and down stairs from danny geog hegan s flat on the top floor to the apartments of missis goldsteinupski on the first for why says danny coming down and raging in his blue yarn socks to the janitor should i be turned out of me comfortable apartments to lay in the dirty grass like a rabbit tis like jerome to stir up trouble wid small matters like this instead of whist says officer reagan on the sidewalk rapping with his club tis not jerome tis by order of the polis commissioner turn out every one of yez and hike yerselves to the park now twas a peaceful and happy home that all of us had in them same beersheba flats the o dowds and the steinowitzes and the callahans and the cohens and the spizzinellis and the mcmanuses and the spiegelmayers and the joneses all nations of us we lived like one big family together and when the hot nights come along we kept a line of children reaching from the front door to kelly s on the corner passing along the cans of beer from one to another without the trouble of running after it and with no more clothing on than is provided for in the statutes sitting in all the windies with a cool growler in every one and your feet out in the air and the rosenstein girls singing on the fire escape of the sixth floor and patsy rourke s flute going in the eighth and the ladies calling each other synonyms out the win dies and now and then a breeze sailing in over mister depew s central i tell you the beersheba flats was a summer resort that made the catskills look like a bole in the ground with his person full of beer and his feet out the windy and his old woman frying pork chops over a charcoal furnace and the children dancing in cotton slips on the sidewalk around the organ grinder and the rent paid for a week what does a man want better on a hot night than that and then comes this ruling of the polis driving people out o their comfortable homes to sleep in parks twas for all the world like a ukase of them rus sians twill be heard from again at next election time well then officer reagan drives the whole lot of us to the park and turns us in by the nearest gate tis dark under the trees and all the children sets up to howling that they want to go home ye ll pass the night in this stretch of woods and scenery says officer reagan twill be fine and imprisonment for insoolting the park commis sioner and the chief of the weather bureau if ye re fuse i m in charge of thirty acres between here and the agyptian monument and i advise ye to give no trouble tis sleeping on the grass yez all have been condemned to by the authorities yez ll be permitted to leave in the morning but ye must retoorn be night me orders was silent on the subject of bail but i find out if tis required and there ll be bondsmen at the gate there being no lights except along the automo bile drives us tenants of the beersheba flats prepared to spend the night as best we could in the raging forest them that brought blankets and kin dling wood was best off they got fires started and wrapped the blankets round their heads and laid down cursing in the grass there was nothing to see nothing to drink nothing to do in the dark we had no way of telling friend or foe except by feeling the noses of em i brought along me last winter overcoat me toothbrush some quinine pills and the red quilt off the bed in me flat three times during the night somebody rolled on me quilt and stuck his knees against the adam s apple of me and three times i judged his character by running me hand over his face and three times i rose up and kicked the in truder down the hill to the gravelly walk below and then some one with a flavor of kelly s whiskey snug gled up to me and i found his nose turned up the right way and i says is that you then patsey and he says it is carney how long do you think it ll last i m no weather prophet says i but if they bring out a strong anti tammany ticket next fall it ought to get us home in time to sleep on a bed once or twice before they line us up at the polls a playing of my flute into the airshaft i says patsey rourke and a perspiring in me own windy to the joyful noise of the passing trains and the smell of liver and onions and a reading of the latest mur der in the smoke of the cooking is well enough for me says he what is this herding us in grass for not to mention the crawling things with legs that walk up the trousers of us and the jersey snipes that peck at us masquerading under the name and denom ination of mosquitoes what is it all for carney and the rint going on just the same over at the flats tis the great annual municipal free night outing lawn party says i given by the polis hetty green and the drug trust during the heated season they hold a week of it in the principal parks tis a scheme to reach that portion of the people that s not worth taking up to north beach for a fish fry i can t sleep on the ground says patsey wid any benefit i have the hay fever and the rheuma tism and me car is full of ants well the night goes on and the ex tenants of the flats groans and stumbles around in the dark trying to find rest and recreation in the forest the children is screaming with the coldness and the jan itor makes hot tea for em and keeps the fires going with the signboards that point to the tavern and the casino the tenants try to lay down on the grass by families in the dark but you re lucky if you can sleep next to a man from the same floor or believing in the same religion now and then a murpby acci dental rolls over on the grass of a rosenstein or a cohen tries to crawl under the o grady bush and then there s a feeling of noses and somebody is rolled down the hill to the driveway and stays there there is some hair pulling among the women folks and everybody spanks the nearest howling kid to him by the sense of feeling only regardless of its parentage and ownership tis hard to keep up the social dis tinctions in the dark that flourish by daylight in the beersheba flats mrs rafferty that despises the asphalt that a dago treads on wakes up in the morn ing with her feet in the bosom of antonio spizzinelli and mike o dowd that always threw peddlers down stairs as fast as he came upon em has to unwind old isaacstein s whiskers from around his neck and wake up the whole gang at daylight but here and there some few got acquainted and overlooked the discom forts of the elements there was five engagements to be married announced at the flats the next morning about midnight i gets up and wrings the dew out of my hair and goes to the side of the driveway and sits down at one side of the park i could see the lights in the streets and houses and i was thinking how happy them folks was who could chase the duck and smoke their pipes at their windows and keep cool and pleasant like nature intended for em to just then an automobile stops by me and a fine looking well dressed man steps out me man says he can you tell me why all these people are lying around on the grass in the park i thought it was against the rules twas an ordinance says i just passed by the polis department and ratified by the turf cut ters association providing that all persons not car rying a license number on their rear axles shall keep in the public parks until further notice fortu nately the orders comes this year during a spell of fine weather and the mortality except on the borders of the lake and along the automobile drives will not be any greater than usual who are these people on the side of the bill asks the man sure says i none others than the tenants of the beersheba flats a fine home for any man especially on hot nights may daylight come soon they come here be night says be and breathe in the pure air and the fragrance of the flowers and trees they do that says be coming every night from the burning beat of dwellings of brick and stone and wood says i and marble and plaster and iron the matter will be attended to at once says the man putting up his book are ye the park commissioner i asks i own the beersheba flats says he god bless the grass and the trees that give extra benefits to a man s tenants the rents shall be raised fifteen per cent to morrow good night says he the easter of the soul it is hardly likely that a goddess may die then eastre the old saxon goddess of spring must be laughing in her muslin sleeve at people who believe that easter her namesake exists only along certain strips of fifth avenue pavement after church service aye it belongs to the world the ptarmigan in chilkoot pass discards his winter white feathers for brown the patagonian beau brummell oils his chi gnon and clubs him another sweetheart to drag to his skull strewn flat and down in chrystie street mr tiger mcquirk arose with a feeling of disquiet that be did not understand with a prac tised foot be rolled three of his younger brothers like logs out of his way as they lay sleeping on the floor before a foot square looking glass hung by the win dow he stood and shaved himself if that may seem to you a task too slight to be thus impressively chron icled i bear with you you do not know of the areas to be accomplished in traversing the cheek and chin of mr mcquirk mcquirk senior had gone to work long before the big son of the house was idle he was a marble cutter and the marble cutters were out on a strike what ails ye asked his mother looking at him curiously are ye not feeling well the morning maybe now he s thinking along of annie maria doyle im pudently explained younger brother tim ten years old tiger reached over the hand of a champion and swept the small mcquirk from his chair i feel fine said he beyond a touch of the i don t know wbat you call its i feel like there was going to be earthquakes or music or a trifle of chills and fever or maybe a picnic i don t know how i feel i feel like knocking the face off a policeman or else maybe like playing coney island straight across the board from pop corn to the elephant boudabs it s the spring in yer bones said mrs mcquirk it s the sap risin time was when i couldn t keep me feet still nor me head cool when the earthworms began to crawl out in the dew of the mornin tis a bit of tea will do ye good made from pipsissewa and gentian bark at the druggist s back up said mr mcquirk impatiently there s no spring in sight there s snow yet on the shed in donovan s backyard and yesterday they puts open cars on the sixth avenue lines and the janitors have quit ordering coal and that means six weeks more of winter by all the signs that be after breakfast mr mcquirk spent fifteen minutes before the corrugated mirror subjugating his hair and arranging his green and purple ascot with its amethyst tombstone pin eloquent of his chosen calling since the strike had been called it was this par ticular striker s habit to hie himself each morning to the corner saloon of flaherty brothers and there establish himself upon the sidewalk with one foot resting on the bootblack s stand observing the panorama of the street until the pace of time brought twelve o clock and the dinner hour and mr tiger mcquirk with his athletic seventy inches well trained in sport and battle his smooth pale solid amiable face blue where the razor had trav elled his carefully considered clothes and air of capa bility was himself a spectacle not displeasing to the eye but on this morning mr mcquirk did not hasten immediately to his post of leisure and observation something unusual that he could not quite grasp was in the air something disturbed his thoughts ruffled his senses made him at once languid irritable elated dissastisfied and sportive he was no diagnostician and he did not know that lent was breaking up physiologically in his system mrs mcquirk had spoken of spring sceptically tiger looked about him for signs few they were the organ grinders were at work but they were always precocious harbingers it was near enough spring for them to go penny hunting when the skating ball dropped at the park in the milliners windows easter hats grave gay and jubilant blos somed there were green patches among the side walk debris of the grocers on a third story window sill the first elbow cushion of the season old gold stripes on a crimson ground supported the kimo noed arms of a pensive brunette the wind blew cold from the east river but the sparrows were fly ing to the eaves with straws a second hand store combining foresight with faith had set out an ice chest and baseball goods and then tiger s eye discrediting these signs fell upon one that bore a bud of promise from a bright new lithograph the head of capricornus con fronted him betokening the forward and heady brew mr mcquirk entered the saloon and called for his glass of bock he threw his nickel on the bar raised the glass set it down without tasting it and strolled toward the door wot s the matter lord bolinbroke inquired the sarcastic bartender want a chiny vase or a gold lined epergne to drink it out of hey say said mr mcquirk wheeling and shooting out a horizontal hand and a forty five degree chin you know your place only when it comes for givin titles i ve changed me mind about drinkin see you got your money ain t you wait till you get stung before you get the droop to your lip will you thus mr quirk added mutability of desires to the strange humors that had taken possession of him leaving the saloon he walked away twenty steps and leaned in the open doorway of lutz the barber he and lutz were friends masking their sentiments behind abuse and bludgeons of repartee irish loafer roared lutz how do you do so not yet haf der bolicemans or der catcher of dogs done deir duty hello dutch said mr mcquirk can t get your mind off of frankfurters can you bah exclaimed the german coming and lean ing in the door i haf a soul above frankfurters to day dere is springtime in der air i can feel it coming in ofer der mud of der streets and das ice in der river soon will dere be bienics in der islands mit kegs of beer under der trees say said mr mcquirk setting his bat on one side is everybody kiddin me about gentle spring there ain t any more spring in the air than there is in a horsehair sofa in a second avenue furnished room for me the winter underwear yet and the buckwheat cakes you haf no boetry said lutz true it is yedt cold und in der city we haf not many of der signs but dere are dree kinds of beoble dot should always feel der approach of spring first dey are boets lovers and poor vidows mr mcquirk went on his way still possessed by the strange perturbation that he did not understand something was lacking to his comfort and it made him half angry because be did not know what it was two blocks away he came upon a foe one conover whom he was bound in honor to engage in combat mr mcquirk made the attack with the charac teristic suddenness and fierceness that had gained for him the endearing sobriquet of tiger the de fence of mr conover was so prompt and admirable that the conflict was protracted until the onlookers un selfishly gave the warning cry of cheese it the cop the principals escaped easily by running through the nearest open doors into the communi cating backyards at the rear of the houses mr mcquirk emerged into another street he stood by a lamp post for a few minutes engaged in thought and then he turned and plunged into a small notion and news shop a red haired young woman eating gum drops came and looked freezingly at him across the ice bound steppes of the counter say lady he said have you got a song book with this in it let s see bow it leads off when the springtime comes well wander in the dale love and whisper of those days of yore i m having a friend explained mr mcquirk laid up with a broken leg and he sent me after it he s a devil for songs and poetry when he can t get out to drink we have not replied the young woman with un concealed contempt but there is a new song out that begins this way let us sit together in the old armchair and while the firelight flickers we ll be comfortable there there will be no profit in following mr tiger mcquirk through his further vagaries of that day until he comes to stand knocking at the door of annie maria doyle the goddess eastre it seems had guided his footsteps aright at last is that you now jimmy mcquirk she cried smiling through the opened door annie maria had never accepted the tiger well whatever come out in the ball said mr mcquirk i want to ask yer opinion of the weather on the level are you crazy sure said annie maria i am said the tiger they ve been telling me all day there was spring in the air were they liars or am i dear me said annie maria haven t you no ticed it i can almost smell the violets and the green grass of course there ain t any yet it s just a kind of feeling you know that s what i m getting at said mr mcquirk i ve had it i didn t recognize it at first i thought maybe it was en wee contracted the other day when i stepped above fourteenth street but the katzenjammer i ve got don t spell violets it spells yer own name annie maria and it s you i want i go to work next monday and i make four dollars a day spiel up old girl do we make a team jimmy sighed annie maria suddenly disap pearing in his overcoat don t you see that spring is all over the world right this minute but you yourself remember how that day ended beginning with so fine a promise of vernal things late in the afternoon the air chilled and an inch of snow fell even so late in march on fifth ave nue the ladies drew their winter furs close about them only in the florists windows could be per ceived any signs of the morning smile of the coming goddess eastre at six o clock herr lutz began to close his shop he beard a well known shout hello dutch tiger mcquirk in his shirt sleeves with his hat on the back of his bead stood outside in the whirling snow puffing at a black cigar donnerwetter shouted lutz der vinter he has gome back again yet yer a liar dutch called back mr mcquirk with friendly geniality it s springtime by the watch the fool killer down south whenever any one perpetrates some particularly monumental piece of foolishness every body says send for jesse holmes jesse holmes is the fool killer of course he is a myth like santa claus and jack frost and general prosperity and all those concrete conceptions that are supposed to represent an idea that nature has failed to embody the wisest of the southrons can not tell you whence comes the fool killer s name but few and happy are the households from the ro anoke to the rio grande in which the name of jesse holmes has not been pronounced or invoked always with a smile and often with a tear is he summoned to his official duty a busy man is jesse holmes i remember the clear picture of him that hung on the walls of my fancy during my barefoot days when i was dodging his oft threatened devoirs to me be was a terrible old man in gray clothes with a long ragged gray beard and reddish fierce eyes i looked to see him come stumping up the road in a cloud of dust with a white oak staff in his hand and his shoes tied with leather thongs i may yet but this is a story not a sequel i have taken notice with regret that few stories worth reading have been written that did not con tain drink of some sort down go the fluids from arizona dick s three fingers of red pizen to the in efficacious oolong that nerves lionel montressor to repartee in the dotty dialogues so in such good company i may introduce an absinthe drip one absinthe drip dripped through a silver dripper orderly opalescent cool green eyed deceptive kerner was a fool besides that he was an artist and my good friend now if there is one thing on earth utterly despicable to another it is an artist in the eyes of an author whose story he has illus trated just try it once write a story about a mining camp in idiho sell it spend the money and then six months later borrow a quarter or a dime and buy the magazine containing it you find a full page wash drawing of your hero black bill the cowboy somewhere in your story you em ployed the word horse aha the artist has grasped the idea black bill has on the regulation trousers of the m f h of the westchester county hunt he carries a parlor rifle and wears a mon ocle in the distance is a section of forty second street during a search for a lost gas pipe and the taj mahal the famous mausoleum in india enough i hated kerner and one day i met him and we became friends he was young and glori ously melancholy because his spirits were so high and life bad so much in store for him yes he was almost riotously sad that was his youth when a man begins to be hilarious in a sorrowful way you can bet a million that he is dyeing his hair ker ner s hair was plentiful and carefully matted as an artist s thatch should be he was a cigaretteur and be audited his dinners with red wine but most of all be was a fool and wisely i envied him and listened patiently while he knocked velasquez and tintoretto once he told me that he liked a story of mine that he bad come across in an anthology he described it to me and i was sorry that mr fitz james o brien was dead and could not learn of the eulogy of his work but mostly kerner made few breaks and was a consistent fool i d better explain what i mean by that there was a girl now a girl as far as i am concerned is a thing that belongs in a seminary or an album but i conceded the existence of the animal in order to retain kerner s friendship he showed me her picture in a locket she was a blonde or a brunette i have forgotten which she worked in a factory for eight dollars a week lest factories quote this wage by way of vindication i will add that the girl bad worked for five years to reach that supreme ele vation of remuneration beginning at per week kerner s father was worth a couple of millions he was willing to stand for art but he drew the line at the factory girl so kerner disinherited his father and walked out to a cheap studio and lived on sausages for breakfast and on farroni for dinner farroni had the artistic soul and a line of credit for painters and poets nicely adjusted sometimes ker rier sold a picture and bought some new tapestry a ring and a dozen silk cravats and paid farroni two dollars on account one evening kerner had me to dinner with himself and the factory girl they were to be married as soon as kerner could slosh paint profitably as for the ex father s two millions pouf she was a wonder small and half way pretty and as much at her ease in that cheap cafe as though she were only in the palmer house chicago with a souvenir spoon already safely hidden in her shirt waist she was natural two things i noticed about her especially her belt buckle was exactly in the middle of her back and she didn t tell us that a large man with a ruby stick pin had followed her up all the way from fourteenth street was kerner such a fool i wondered and then i thought of the quantity of striped cuffs and blue glass beads that can buy for the heathen and i said to myself that he was and then elise certainly that was her name told us merrily that the brown spot on her waist was caused by her landlady knocking at the door while she the girl confound the english language was heating an iron over the gas jet and she hid the iron under the bedclothes until the coast was clear and there was the piece of chewing gum stuck to it when she began to iron the waist and well i wondered bow in the world the chewing gum came to be there don t they ever stop chewing it a while after that don t be impatient the ab sinthe drip is coming now kerner and i were dining at farroni s a mandolin and a guitar were being attacked the room was full of smoke in nice long crinkly layers just like the artists draw the steam from a plum pudding on christmas posters and a lady in a blue silk and gasolined gauntlets was be ginning to bum an air from the catskills kerner said i you are a fool of course said kerner i wouldn t let her go on working not my wife what s the use to wait she s willing i sold that water color of the pali sades yesterday we could cook on a two burner gas stove you know the ragouts i can throw together yes i think we will marry next week kerner said i you are a fool have an absinthe drip said kerner grandly to night you are the guest of art in paying quan tities i think we will get a flat with a bath i never tried one i mean an absinthe drip said i the waiter brought it and poured the water slowly over the ice in the dripper it looks exactly like the mississippi river water in the big bend below natchez said i fascinated gazing at the be muddled drip there are such flats for eight dollars a week said kerner you are a fool said i and began to sip the filtration what you need i continued is the official attention of one jesse holmes kerner not being a southerner did not compre hend so he sat sentimental figuring on his flat in his sordid artistic way while i gazed into the green eyes of the sophisticated spirit of wormwood presently i noticed casually that a procession of bacchantes limned on the wall immediately below the ceiling bad begun to move traversing the room from right to left in a gay and spectacular pilgrimage i did not confide my discovery to kerner the artistic temperament is too high strung to view such devia tions from the natural laws of the art of kalsomining i sipped my absinthe drip and sawed wormwood one absinthe drip is not much but i said again to kerner kindly you are a fool and then in the vernacular jesse holmes for yours and then i looked around and saw the fool killer as he had always appeared to my imagination sitting at a nearby table and regarding us with his reddish fatal relentless eyes he was jesse holmes from top to toe he had the long gray ragged beard the gray clothes of ancient cut the executioner s look and the dusty shoes of one who bad been called from afar his eyes were turned fixedly upon kerner i shuddered to think that i bad invoked him from his assiduous southern duties i thought of flying and then i kept my seat reflecting that many men bad es caped his ministrations when it seemed that nothing short of an appointment as ambassador to spain could save them from him i had called my brother kerner a fool and was in danger of hell fire that was nothing but i would try to save him from jesse holmes the fool killer got up from his table and came over to ours he rested his hands upon it and turned his burning vindictive eyes upon kerner ig noring me you are a hopeless fool be said to the artist haven t you had enough of starvation yet i of fer you one more opportunity give up this girl and come back to your home refuse and you must take the consequences the fool killer s threatening face was within a foot of his victim s but to my horror kerner made not the slightest sign of being aware of his presence we will be married next week be muttered ab sent mindedly with my studio furniture and some second hand stuff we can make out you have decided your own fate said the fool killer in a low but terrible voice you may con sider yourself as one dead you have had your last chance in the moonlight went on kerner softly we will sit under the skylight with our guitar and sing away the false delights of pride and money on your own head be it hissed the fool killer and my scalp prickled when i perceived that neither kerner s eyes nor his ears took the slightest cog nizance of jesse holmes and then i knew that for some reason the veil had been lifted for me alone and that i bad been elected to save my friend from de struction at the fool killer s bands something of the fear and wonder of it must have showed itself in my face excuse me said kerner with his wan amiable smile was i talking to myself i think it is getting to be a habit with me the fool killer turned and walked out of far ronils wait here for me said i rising i must speak to that man had you no answer for him because you are a fool must you die like a mouse under his foot could you not utter one squeak in your own defence you are drunk said kerner heartlessly no one addressed me the destroyer of your mind said i stood above you just now and marked you for his victim you are not blind or deaf i recognized no such person said kerner i have seen no one but you at this table sit down hereafter you shall have no more absinthe drips wait here said i furious if you don t care for your own life i will save it for you i hurried out and overtook the man in gray half way down the block he looked as i bad seen him in my fancy a thousand times truculent gray and awful he walked with the white oak staff and but for the street sprinkler the dust would have been fly ing under his tread i caught him by the sleeve and steered him to a dark angle of a building i knew he was a myth and i did not want a cop to see me conversing with va cancy for i might land in bellevue minus my silver matchbox and diamond ring jesse holmes said i facing him with apparent bravery i know you i have heard of you all my life i know now what a scourge you have been to your country instead of killing fools you have been murdering the youth and genius that are necessary to make a people live and grow great you are a fool yourself holmes you began killing off the brightest and best of our countrymen three generations ago when the old and obsolete standards of society and honor and orthodoxy were narrow and bigoted you proved that when you put your murderous mark upon my friend kerner the wisest chap i ever knew in my life the fool killer looked at me grimly and closely you ve a queer jag said he curiously oh yes i see who you are now you were sitting with him at the table well if i m not mistaken i heard you call him a fool too i did said i i delight in doing so it is from envy by all the standards that you know he is the most egregious and grandiloquent and gorgeous fool in all the world that s why you want to kill him would you mind telling me who or what you think i am asked the old man i laughed boisterously and then stopped suddenly for i remembered that it would not do to be seen so hilarious in the company of nothing but a brick wall you are jesse holmes the fool killer i said solemnly and you are going to kill my friend ker ner i don t know who rang you up but if you do kill him i ll see that you get pinched for it that is i added despairingly if i can get a cop to see you they have a poor eye for mortals and i think it would take the whole force to round up a myth mur derer well said the fool killer briskly i must be going you had better go home and sleep it off good night at this i was moved by a sudden fear for kerner to a softer and more pleading mood i leaned against the gray man s sleeve and besought him good mr fool killer please don t kill little ker ner why can t you go back south and kill con gressmen and clay caters and let us alone why don t you go up on fifth avenue and kill millionaires that keep their money locked up and won t let young fools marry because one of em lives on the wrong street come and have a drink jesse will you never get on to your job do you know this girl that your friend has made himself a fool about asked the fool killer i have the honor said i and that s why i called kerner a fool he is a fool because he has waited so long before marrying her he is a fool because be has been waiting in the hopes of getting the consent of some absurd two million dollar fool parent or something of the sort maybe said the fool killer maybe i i might have looked at it differently would you mind going back to the restaurant and bringing your friend kerner here oh what s the use jesse i yawned he can t see you he didn t know you were talking to him at the table you are a fictitious character you know maybe he can this time will you go fetch him all right said i but i ve a suspicion that you re not strictly sober jesse you seem to be wa vering and losing your outlines don t vanish before i get back i went back to kerner and said there s a man with an invisible homicidal mania waiting to see you outside i believe he wants to murder you come along you won t see him so there s nothing to be frightened about kerner looked anxious why said be i had no idea one absinthe would do that you d better stick to wurzburger i ll walk home with you i led him to jesse holmes s rudolf said the fool killer i ll give in bring her up to the house give me your hand boy good for you dad said kerner shaking hands with the old man you ll never regret it after you know her so you did see him when he was talking to you at the table i asked kerner we hadn t spoken to each other in a year said kerner it s all right now i walked away where are you going called kerner i am going to look for jesse holmes i an swered with dignity and reserve transients in arcadia there is a hotel on broadway that has escaped discovery by the summer resort promoters it is deep and wide and cool its rooms are finished in dark oak of a low temperature home made breezes and deep green shrubbery give it the delights without the inconveniences of the adirondacks one can mount its broad staircases or glide dreamily upward in its aerial elevators attended by guides in brass but tons with a serene joy that alpine climbers have never attained there is a chef in its kitchen who will prepare for you brook trout better than the white mountains ever served sea food that would turn old point comfort by gad sah green with envy and maine venison that would melt the official heart of a game warden a few have found out this oasis in the july desert of manhattan during that month you will see the hotel s reduced array of guests scattered luxuriously about in the cool twilight of its lofty dining room gazing at one another across the snowy waste of un occupied tables silently congratulatory superfluous watchful pneumatically moving wait ers hover near supplying every want before it is ex pressed the temperature is perpetual april the ceiling is painted in water colors to counterfeit a sum mer sky across which delicate clouds drift and do not vanish as those of nature do to our regret the pleasing distant roar of broadway is trans formed in the imagination of the happy guests to the noise of a waterfall filling the woods with its restful sound at every strange footstep the guests turn an anxious ear fearful lest their retreat be discovered and invaded by the restless pleasure seekers who are forever hounding nature to her deepest lairs thus in the depopulated caravansary the little band of connoisseurs jealously bide themselves during the heated season enjoying to the uttermost the de lights of mountain and seashore that art and skill have gathered and served to them in this july came to the hotel one whose card that she sent to the clerk for her name to be registered read mme he oise d arcy beaumont madame beaumont was a guest such as the hotel lotus loved she possessed the fine air of the e ite tempered and sweetened by a cordial graciousness that made the hotel employees her slaves bell boys fought for the honor of answering her ring the clerks but for the question of ownership would have deeded to her the hotel and its contents the other guests regarded her as the final touch of feminine exclusiveness and beauty that rendered the entourage perfect this super excellent guest rarely left the hotel her habits were consonant with the customs of the dis criminating patrons of the hotel lotus to enjoy that delectable hostelry one must forego the city as though it were leagues away by night a brief ex cursion to the nearby roofs is in order but during the torrid day one remains in the umbrageous fast nesses of the lotus as a trout hangs poised in the pel lucid sanctuaries of his favorite pool though alone in the hotel lotus madame beau mont preserved the state of a queen whose loneliness was of position only she breakfasted at ten a cool sweet leisurely delicate being who glowed softly in the dimness like a jasmine flower in the dusk but at dinner was madame s glory at its height she wore a gown as beautiful and immaterial as the mist from an unseen cataract in a mountain gorge the nomenclature of this gown is beyond the guess of the scribe always pale red roses reposed against its lace garnished front it was a gown that the bead waiter viewed with respect and met at the door you thought of paris when you saw it and maybe of mysterious countesses and certainly of versailles and rapiers and mrs fiske and rouge et noir there was an untraceable rumor in the hotel lotus that madame was a cosmopolite and that she was pulling with her slender white bands certain strings between the nations in the favor of russia being a citi zeness of the world s smoothest roads it was small wonder that she was quick to recognize in the refined purlieus of the hotel lotus the most desirable spot in america for a restful sojourn during the heat of mid summer on the third day of madame beaumont s residence in the hotel a young man entered and registered him self as a guest his clothing to speak of his points in approved order was quietly in the mode his features good and regular his expression that of a poised and sophisticated man of the world he in formed the clerk that he would remain three or four days inquired concerning the sailing of european steamships and sank into the blissful inanition of the nonpareil hotel with the contented air of a traveller in his favorite inn the young man not to question the veracity of the register was harold farrington he drifted into the exclusive and calm current of life in the lotus so tactfully and silently that not a ripple alarmed his fellow seekers after rest he ate in the lotus and of its patronym and was lulled into blissful peace with the other fortunate mariners in one day he acquired his table and his waiter and the fear lest the panting chasers after repose that kept broadway warm should pounce upon and destroy this contiguous but covert haven after dinner on the next day after the arrival of harold farrington madame beaumont dropped her handkerchief in passing out mr farrington recov ered and returned it without the effusiveness of a seeker after acquaintance perhaps there was a mystic freemasonry between the discriminating guests of the lotus perhaps they were drawn one to another by the fact of their common good fortune in discovering the acme of sum mer resorts in a broadway hotel words delicate in courtesy and tentative in departure from formality passed between the two and as if in the expedient atmosphere of a real summer resort an acquaintance grew flowered and fructified on the spot as does the mystic plant of the conjuror for a few moments they stood on a balcony upon which the corridor ended and tossed the feathery ball of conversation one tires of the old resorts said madame beau mont with a faint but sweet smile what is the use to fly to the mountains or the seashore to escape noise and dust when the very people that make both follow us there even on the ocean remarked farrington sadly the philistines be upon you the most exclusive steamers are getting to be scarcely more than ferry boats heaven help us when the summer resorter dis covers that the lotus is further away from broadway than thousand islands or mackinac i hope our secret will be safe for a week any how said madame with a sigh and a smile i do not know where i would go if they should descend upon the dear lotus i know of but one place so de lightful in summer and that is the castle of count polinski in the ural mountains i hear that baden baden and cannes are almost deserted this season said farrington year by year the old resorts fall in disrepute perhaps many others like ourselves are seeking out the quiet nooks that are overlooked by the majority i promise myself three days more of this delicious rest said madame beaumont on monday the cedric sails harold farrington s eyes proclaimed his regret i too must leave on monday he said but i do not go abroad madame beaumont shrugged one round shoulder in a foreign gesture one cannot bide here forever charming though it may be the chateau has been in preparation for me longer than a month those house parties that one must give what a nuisance but i shall never for get my week in the hotel lotus nor shall i said farrington in a low voice and i shall never forgive the cedric on sunday evening three days afterward the two sat at a little table on the same balcony a discreet waiter brought ices and small glasses of claret cup madame beaumont wore the same beautiful even ing gown that she had worn each day at dinner she seemed thoughtful near her hand on the table lay a small chatelaine purse after she had eaten her ice she opened the purse and took out a one dollar bill mr farrington she said with the smile that had won the hotel lotus i want to tell you some thing i m going to leave before breakfast in the morning because i ve got to go back to my work i m behind the hosiery counter at casey s mammoth store and my vacation s up at eight o clock to morrow that paper dollar is the last cent i ll see till i draw my eight dollars salary next saturday night you re a real gentleman and you ve been good to me and i wanted to tell you before i went i ve been saving up out of my wages for a year just for this vacation i wanted to spend one week like a lady if i never do another one i wanted to get up when i please instead of having to crawl out at seven every morning and i wanted to live on the best and be waited on and ring bells for things just like rich folks do now i ve done it and i ve had the happiest time i ever expect to have in my life i m going back to my work and my little hall bedroom satisfied for another year i wanted to tell you about it mr farrington because i i thought you kind of liked me and i i liked you but oh i couldn t help deceiving you up till now for it was all just like a fairy tale to me so i talked about europe and the things i ve read about in other countries and made you think i was a great lady this dress i ve got on it s the only one i have that s fit to wear i bought from o dowd levin sky on the instalment plan seventy five dollars is the price and it was made to measure i paid down and they re to collect a week till it s paid for that ll be about all i have to say mr farrington except that my name is mamie siviter instead of madame beaumont and i thank you for your attentions this dollar will pay the instalment due on the dress to morrow i guess i ll go up to my room now harold farrington listened to the recital of the lotus s loveliest guest with an impassive countenance when she had concluded he drew a small book like a checkbook from his coat pocket he wrote upon a blank form in this with a stub of pencil tore out the leaf tossed it over to his companion and took up the paper dollar i ve got to go to work too in the morning he said and i might as well begin now there s a receipt for the dollar instalment i ve been a col lector for o dowd levinsky for three years funny ain t it that you and me both had the same idea about spending our vacation i ve always wanted to put up at a swell hotel and i saved up out of my twenty per and did it say mame how about a trip to coney saturday night on the boat what the face of the pseudo madame heloise d arcy beaumont beamed oh you bet i ll go mr farrington the store closes at twelve on saturdays i guess coney ll be all right even if we did spend a week with the swells below the balcony the sweltering city growled and buzzed in the july night inside the hotel lotus the tempered cool shadows reigned and the solicitous waiter single footed near the low windows ready at a nod to serve madame and her escort at the door of the elevator farrington took his leave and madame beaumont made her last ascent but before they reached the noiseless cage be said just forget that harold farrington will you mcmanus is the name james mcmanus some call me jimmy good night jimmy said madame the rathskeller and the rose miss posie carrington had earned her suc cess she began life handicapped by the family name of boggs in the small town known as cranberry corners at the age of eighteen she had acquired the name of carrington and a position in the chorus of a metropolitan burlesque company thence upward she had ascended by the legitimate and delectable steps of broiler member of the famous dickey bird octette in the successful musical comedy fudge and fellows leader of the potato bug dance in fol de rol and at length to the part of the maid toinette in the king s bath robe which captured the critics and gave her her chance and when we come to consider miss carrington she is in the heydey of flattery fame and fizz and that astute manager herr timothy goldstein has her signature to iron clad papers that she will star the coming season in dyde rich s new play paresis by gaslight promptly there came to herr timothy a capable twentieth century young character actor by the name of highsmith who besought engagement as sol haytosser the comic and chief male character part in paresis by gaslight my boy said goldstein take the part if you can get it miss carrington won t listen to any of my suggestions she has turned down half a dozen of the best imitators of the rural dub in the city she declares she won t set a foot on the stage un less haytosser is the best that can be raked up she was raised in a village you know and when a broadway orchid sticks a straw in his hair and tries to call himself a clover blossom she s on all right i asked her in a sarcastic vein if she thought den man thompson would make any kind of a show in the part oh no says she i don t want him or john drew or jim corbett or any of these swell actors that don t know a turnip from a turnstile i want the real article so my boy if you want to play i sol haytosser you will have to convince miss carrington luck be with you highsmith took the train the next day for cran berry corners he remained in that forsaken and inanimate village three days he found the boggs family and corkscrewed their history unto the third and fourth generation he amassed the facts and the local color of cranberry corners the village had not grown as rapidly as had miss carrington the actor estimated that it had suffered as few actual changes since the departure of its solitary follower of thespis as had a stage upon which four years is supposed to have elapsed he absorbed cran berry corners and returned to the city of chameleon changes it was in the rathskeller that highsmith made the hit of his histrionic career there is no need to name the place there is but one rathskeller where you could hope to find miss posie carrington after a performance of the king s bath robe there was a jolly small party at one of the tables that drew many eyes miss carrington petite mar vellous bubbling electric fame drunken shall be named first herr goldstein follows sonorous curly haired heavy a trifle anxious as some bear that had caught somehow a butterfly in his claws next a man condemned to a newspaper sad courted armed analyzing for press agent s dross every sen tence that was poured over him eating his a la new burg in the silence of greatness to conclude a youth with parted hair a name that is ochre to red journals and gold on the back of a supper check these sat at a table while the musicians played while waiters moved in the mazy performance of their duties with their backs toward all who desired their service and all was bizarre and merry because it was nine feet below the level of the sidewalk at a being entered the rathskeller the first violin perceptibly flatted a c that should have been natural the clarionet blew a bubble instead of a grace note miss carrington giggled and the youth with parted hair swallowed an olive seed exquisitely and irreproachably rural was the new entry a lank disconcerted hesitating young man it was flaxen haired gaping of mouth awkward stricken to misery by the lights and company his clothing was butternut with bright blue tie showing four inches of bony wrist and white socked ankle he upset a chair sat in another one curled a foot around a table leg and cringed at the approach of a waiter you may fetch me a glass of lager beer he said in response to the discreet questioning of the servitor the eyes of the rathskeller were upon him he was as fresh as a collard and as ingenuous as a hay rake he let his eye rove about the place as one who re gards big eyed hogs in the potato patch his gaze rested at length upon miss carrington he rose and went to her table with a lateral shining smile and a blush of pleased trepidation how re ye miss posie he said in accents not to be doubted don t ye remember me bill sum mers the summerses that lived back of the black smith shop i reckon i ve growed up some since ye left cranberry corners liza perry lowed i might see ye in the city while i was here you know liza married benny stanfield and she says ah say interrupted miss carrington brightly lize perry is never married what oh the freckles of her married in june grinned the gossip and livin in the old tatum place ham riley perfessed reli gion old mrs blithers sold her place to cap n spooner the youngest waters girl run away with a music teacher the court house burned up last march your uncle wiley was elected constable matilda hos kins died from runnin a needle in her hand and tom beedle is courtin sallie lathrop they say he don t miss a night but what he s settin on their porch the wall eyed thing exclaimed miss carring ton with asperity why tom beedle once say you folks excuse me a while this is an old friend of mine mr what was it yes mr summers mr goldstein mr ricketts mr oh what s yours johnny ll do come on over here and tell me some more she swept him to an isolated table in a corner herr goldstein shrugged his fat shoulders and beck oned to the waiter the newspaper man brightened a little and mentioned absinthe the youth with parted hair was plunged into melancholy the guests of the rathskeller laughed clinked glasses and enjoyed the comedy that posie carrington was treat ing them to after her regular performance a few cynical ones whispered press agent and smiled wisely posie carrington laid her dimpled and desirable chin upon her hands and forgot her audience a faculty that had won her laurels for her i don t seem to recollect any bill summers she said thoughtfully gazing straight into the innocent blue eyes of the rustic young man but i know the summerses all right i guess there ain t many changes in the old town you see any of my folks lately and then highsmith played his trump the part of sol haytosser called for pathos as well as comedy miss carrington should see that he could do that as well miss posie said bill summers i was up to your folkeses house jist two or three days ago no there ain t many changes to speak of the lilac bush by the kitchen window is over a foot higher and the elm in the front yard died and had to be cut down and yet it don t seem the same place that it used to be how s ma asked miss carrington she was settin by the front door crocheting a lamp mat when i saw her last said bill she s older n she was miss posie but everything in the house looked jest the same your ma asked me to set down don t touch that willow rocker william says she it ain t been moved since posie left and that s the apron she was hemmin layin over the arm of it jist as she flung it i m in hopes she goes on that posie ll finish runnin out that hem some day miss carrington beckoned peremptorily to a waiter a pint of extra dry she ordered briefly and give the check to goldstein the sun was shinin in the door went on the chronicler from cranberry and your ma was settin right in it i asked her if she hadn t better move back a little william says she when i get sot down and lookin down the road i can t bear to move never a day says she but what i set here every minute that i can spare and watch over them palin s for posie she went away down that road in the night for we seen her little shoe tracks in the dust and somethin tells me she ll come back that way ag in when she s weary of the world and begins to think about her old mother when i was comin away concluded bill i pulled this off n the bush by the front steps i thought maybe i might see you in the city and i knowed you d like somethin from the old home he took from his coat pocket a rose a drooping yellow velvet odorous rose that hung its bead in the foul atmosphere of that tainted rathskeller like a virgin bowing before the hot breath of the lions in a roman arena miss carrington s penetrating but musical laugh rose above the orcbestra s rendering of bluebells oh say she cried with glee ain t those poky places the limit i just know that two hours at cranberry corners would give me the horrors now well i m awful glad to have seen you mr summers guess i ll bustle around to the hotel now and get my beauty sleep she thrust the yellow rose into the bosom of her wonderful dainty silken garments stood up and nodded imperiously at herr goldstein her three companions and bill summers at tended her to her cab when her flounces and streamers were all safely tucked inside she dazzled them with au revoirs from her shining eyes and teeth come around to the hotel and see me bill before you leave the city she called as the glittering cab rolled away highsmith still in his make up went with herr goldstein to a cafe booth bright idea eh asked the smiling actor ought to land sol haytosser for me don t you think the little lady never once tumbled i didn t bear your conversation said goldstein but your make up and acting was k here s to your success you d better call on miss carrington early to morrow and strike her for the part i don t see how she can keep from being satisfied with your exhibition of ability at a m on the next day highsmith hand some dressed in the latest mode confident with a fuchsia in his button bole sent up his card to miss carrington in her select apartment hotel he was shown up and received by the actress s french maid i am sorree said mlle hortense but i am to say this to all it is with great regret mees car rington have cancelled all engagements on the stage and have returned to live in that how you call that town cranberry cornaire the clarion call half of this story can be found in the records of the police department the other half belong behind the business counter of a newspaper office one afternoon two weeks after millionaire nor cross was found in his apartment murdered by a bur glar the murderer while strolling serenely down broadway ran plump against detective barney woods is that you johnny kernan asked woods who had been near sighted in public for five years no less cried kernan heartily if it isn t barney woods late and early of old saint jo you ll have to show me what are you doing east do the green goods circulars get out that far said woods i ve been in new york some years i m on the city detective force well well said kernan breathing smiling joy and patting the detective s arm come into muller s said woods and let s hunt a quiet table i d like to talk to you awhile it lacked a few minutes to the hour of four the tides of trade were not yet loosed and they found a quiet corner of the cafe kernan well dressed slightly swaggering self confident seated himself op posite the little detective with his pale sandy mus tache squinting eyes and ready made cheviot suit what business are you in now asked woods you know you left saint jo a year before i did i m selling shares in a copper mine said ker nan i may establish an office here well well and so old barney is a new york detective you always had a turn that way you were on the po lice in saint jo after i left there weren t you six months said woods and now there s one more question johnny i ve followed your record pretty close ever since you did that hotel job in sara toga and i never knew you to use your gun before why did you kill norcross kernan stared for a few moments with concen trated attention at the slice of lemon in his high ball and then be looked at the detective with a sudden crooked brilliant smile how did you guess it barney he asked ad miringly i swear i thought the job was as clean and as smooth as a peeled onion did i leave a string hanging out anywhere woods laid upon the table a small gold pencil in tended for a watch charm it s the one i gave you the last christmas we were in saint jo i ve got your shaving mug yet i found this under a corner of the rug in norcross s room i warn you to be careful what you say i ve got it put on to you johnny we were old friends once but i must do my duty you ll have to go to the chair for norcross kernan laughed my luck stays with me said be who d have thought old barney was on my trail he slipped one hand inside his coat in an instant woods had a revolver against his side put it away said kernan wrinkling his nose i m only investigating aha it takes nine tailors to make a man but one can do a man up there s a hole in that vest pocket i took that pencil off my chain and slipped it in there in case of a scrap put up your gun barney and i ll tell you why i had to shoot norcross the old fool started down the hall after me popping at the buttons on the back of my coat with a peevish little and i had to stop him the old lady was a darling she just lay in bed and saw her diamond necklace go with out a chirp while she begged like a panhandler to have back a little thin gold ring with a garnet worth about guess she married old norcross for his money all right don t they hang on to the little trinkets from the man who lost out though there were six rings two brooches and a chatelaine watch fifteen thousand would cover the lot i warned you not to talk said woods oh that s all right said kernan the stuff is in my suit case at the hotel and now i ll tell you why i m talking because it s safe i m talking to a man i know you owe me a thousand dollars bar ney woods and even if you wanted to arrest me your hand wouldn t make the move i haven t forgotten said woods you counted out twenty fifties without a word i ll pay it back some day that thousand saved me and well they were piling my furniture out on the sidewalk when i got back to the house and so continued kernan you being barney woods born as true as steel and bound to play a white man s game can t lift a finger to arrest the man you re indebted to oh i have to study men as well as yale locks and window fastenings in my business now keep quiet while i ring for the waiter i ve had a thirst for a year or two that wor ries me a little if i m ever caught the lucky sleuth will have to divide honors with old boy booze but i never drink during business hours after a job i can crook elbows with my old friend barney with a clear conscience what are you taking the waiter came with the little decanters and the siphon and left them alone again you ve called the turn said woods as he rolled the little gold pencil about with a thoughtful fore finger i ve got to pass you up i can t lay a hand on you if i d a paid that money back but i didn t and that settles it it s a bad break i m making johnny but i can t dodge it you helped me once and it calls for the same i knew it said kernan raising his glass with a flushed smile of self appreciation i can judge men here s to barney for he s a jolly good fellow i don t believe went on woods quietly as if be were thinking aloud that if accounts had been square between you and me all the money in all the banks in new york could have bought you out of my hands to night i know it couldn t said kernan that s why i knew i was safe with you most people continued the detective look side ways at my business they don t class it among the fine arts and the professions but i ve always taken a kind of fool pride in it and here is where i go busted i guess i m a man first and a detective afterward i ve got to let you go and then i ve got to resign from the force i guess i can drive an ex press wagon your thousand dollars is further off than ever johnny oh you re welcome to it said kernan with a lordly air i d be willing to call the debt off but i know you wouldn t have it it was a lucky day for me when you borrowed it and now let s drop the subject i m off to the west on a morning train i know a place out there where i can negotiate the norcross sparks drink up barney and forget your troubles we ll have a jolly time while the police are knocking their heads together over the case i ve got one of my sahara thirsts on to night but i m in the bands the unofficial bands of my old friend barney and i won t even dream of a cop and then as kernan s ready finger kept the but ton and the waiter working his weak point a tre mendous vanity and arrogant egotism began to show itself he recounted story after story of his suc cessful plunderings ingenious plots and infamous transgressions until woods with all his familiarity with evil doers felt growing within him a cold ab horrence toward the utterly vicious man who had once been his benefactor i m disposed of of course said woods at length but i advise you to keep under cover for a spell the newspapers may take up this norcross affair there has been an epidemic of burglaries and manslaughter in town this summer the word sent kernan into a high glow of sullen and vindictive rage to hell with the newspapers he growled what do they spell but brag and blow and boodle in box car letters suppose they do take up a case what does it amount to the police are easy enough to fool but what do the newspapers do they send a lot of pin head reporters around to the scene and they make for the nearest saloon and have beer while they take photos of the bartender s oldest daughter in evening dress to print as the fiancee of the young man in the tenth story who thought he heard a noise below on the night of the murder that s about as near as the newspapers ever come to running down mr burglar well i don t know said woods reflecting some of the papers have done good work in that line there s the morning mars for instance it warmed up two or three trails and got the man after the police had let em get cold i ll show you said tiernan rising and expand ing his chest i ll show you what i think of news papers in general and your morning mars in par ticular three feet from their table was the telephone booth kernan went inside and sat at the instrument leaving the door open he found a number in the book took down the receiver and made his demand upon central woods sat still looking at the sneer ing cold vigilant face waiting close to the trans mitter and listened to the words that came from the thin truculent lips curved into a contemptuous smile that the morning mars i want to speak to the managing editor why tell him it s some one who wants to talk to him about the norcross murder you the editor all right i am the man who killed old norcross wait hold the wire i m not the usual crank oh there isn t the slightest danger

woods with a diabolic smile i ve got him going he believes me now he didn t quite cover the transmitter with his hand when he told somebody to call up central on another phone and get our number i ll give him just one more dig and then we ll make a get away hello yes i m here yet you didn t think i d run from such a little subsidized turn coat rag of a newspaper did you have me inside of forty

and coming out and now barney my boy we ll go to a show and enjoy ourselves until a reasonable bedtime four hours sleep for me and then the west bound the two dined in a broadway restaurant kernan was pleased with himself he spent money like a prince of fiction and then a weird and gorgeous musical comedy engaged their attention afterward there was a late supper in a grillroom with champagne and kernan at the height of his com placency half past three in the morning found them in a corner of an all night cafe kernan still boasting in a vapid and rambling way woods thinking moodily over the end that had come to his usefulness as an upholder of the law but as he pondered his eye brightened with a speculative light i wonder if it s possible be said to himself i won der if it s pos si ble and then outside the cafe the comparative stillness of the early morning was punctured by faint uncer tain cries that seemed mere fireflies of sound some growing louder some fainter waxing and waning amid the rumble of milk wagons and infrequent cars shrill cries they were when near well known cries that conveyed many meanings to the ears of those of the slumbering millions of the great city who waked to hear them cries that bore upon their significant small volume the weight of a world s woe and laugh ter and delight and stress to some cowering be neath the protection of a night s ephemeral cover they brought news of the hideous bright day to others wrapped in happy sleep they announced a morning that would dawn blacker than sable night to many of the rich they brought a besom to sweep away what had been theirs while the stars shone to the poor they brought another day all over the city the cries were starting up keen and sonorous heralding the chances that the slip ping of one cogwheel in the machinery of time had made apportioning to the sleepers while they lay at the mercy of fate the vengeance profit grief reward and doom that the new figure in the calen dar had brought them shrill and yet plaintive were the cries as if the young voices grieved that so much evil and so little good was in their irresponsible hands thus echoed in the streets of the helpless city the transmission of the latest decrees of the gods the cries of the newsboys the clarion call of the press woods flipped a dime to the waiter and said get me a morning mars when the paper came he glanced at its first page and then tore a leaf out of his memorandum book and began to write on it with the little old pencil what s the news yawned kernan woods flipped over to him the piece of writing the new york morning mars please pay to the order of john kernan the one thousand dollars reward coming to me for his arrest and conviction barnard woods i kind of thought they would do that said woods when you were jollying them so hard now johnny you ll come to the police station with me extradited from bohemia from near the village of harmony at the foot of the green mountains came miss medora martin to new york with her color box and easel miss medora resembled the rose which the autum nal frosts had spared the longest of all her sister blossoms in harmony when she started alone to the wicked city to study art they said she was a mad reckless headstrong girl in new york when she first took her seat at a west side boardinghouse table the boarders asked who is the nice looking old maid medora took heart a cheap hall bedroom and two art lessons a week from professor angelini a retired barber who had studied his profession in a harlem dancing academy there was no one to set her right for here in the big city they do it unto all of us how many of us are badly shaved daily and taught the two step imperfectly by ex pupils of bastien le page and gerome the most pathetic sight in new york except the manners of the rush hour crowds is the dreary march of the hopeless army of me diocrity here art is no benignant goddess but a circe who turns her wooers into mewing toms and tabbies who linger about the doorsteps of her abode unmindful of the flying brickbats and boot jacks of the critics some of us creep back to our native vil lages to the skim milk of i told you so but most of us prefer to remain in the cold courtyard of our mistress s temple snatching the scraps that fall from her divine table d hote but some of us grow weary at last of the fruitless service and then there are two fates open to us we can get a job driving a grocer s wagon or we can get swallowed up in the vortex of bohemia the latter sounds good but the former really pans out better for when the grocer pays us off we can rent a dress suit and the cap italized system of humor describes it best get bo hemia on the run miss medora chose the vortex and thereby fur nishes us with our little story professor angelini praised her sketches excessively once when she had made a neat study of a horse chestnut tree in the park he declared she would be come a second rosa bonheur again a great art ist has his moods he would say cruel and cutting things for example medora had spent an after noon patiently sketching the statue and the archi tecture at columbus circle tossing it aside with a sneer the professor informed her that giotto had once drawn a perfect circle with one sweep of his hand one day it rained the weekly remittance from har mony was overdue medora had a headache the pro fessor had tried to borrow two dollars from her her art dealer had sent back all her water colors unsold and mr binkley asked her out to dinner mr binkley was the gay boy of the boarding house he was forty nine and owned a fishstall in a downtown market but after six o clock he wore an evening suit and whooped things up connected with the beaux arts the young men said he was an indian he was supposed to be an accomplished habitue of the inner circles of bohemia it was no secret that he had once loaned to a young man who had had a drawing printed in puck often has one thus obtained his entree into the charmed circle while the other obtained both his entree and roast the other boarders enviously regarded medora as she left at mr binkley s side at nine o clock she was as sweet as a cluster of dried autumn grasses in her pale blue oh er that very thin stuff in her pale blue comstockized silk waist and box pleated voile skirt with a soft pink glow on her thin cheeks and the tiniest bit of rouge powder on her face with her handkerchief and room key in her brown walrus pebble grain band bag and mr binkley looked imposing and dashing with his red face and gray mustache and his tight dress coat that made the back of his neck roll up just like a successful novelist s they drove in a cab to the cafe terence just off the most glittering part of broadway which as every one knows is one of the most popular and widely patronized jealously exclusive bohemian re sorts in the city down between the rows of little tables tripped medora of the green mountains after her escort thrice in a lifetime may woman walk upon clouds once when she trippeth to the altar once when she first enters bohemian halls the last when she marches back across her first garden with the dead hen of her neighbor in her band there was a table set with three or four about it a waiter buzzed around it like a bee and silver and glass shone upon it and preliminary to the meal as the prehistoric granite strata heralded the pro tozoa the bread of gaul compounded after the for mula of the recipe for the eternal bills was there set forth to the hand and tooth of a long suffering city while the gods lay beside their nectar and home made biscuits and smiled and the dentists leaped for joy in their gold leafy dens the eye of binkley fixed a young man at his table with the bobemian gleam which is a compound of the look of the basilisk the shine of a bubble of wurzburger the inspiration of genius and the plead ing of a panhandler the young man sprang to his feet hello bink old boy be shouted don t tell me you were go ing to pass our table join us unless you ve an other crowd on hand don t mind old chap said binkley of the fish stall you know how i like to butt up against the fine arts mr vandyke mr madder er miss martin one of the elect also in art er the introduction went around there were also miss elise and miss toinette perhaps they were models for they chattered of the st regis decora tions and henry james and they did it not badly medora sat in transport music wild intoxi eating music made by troubadours direct from a rear basement room in elysium set her thoughts to dancing here was a world never before penetrated by her warmest imagination or any of the lines con trolled by harriman with the green mountains external calm upon her she sat her soul flaming in her with the fire of andalusia the tables were filled with bohemia the room was full of the fragrance of flowers both mille and cauli questions and corks popped laughter and silver rang champagne flashed in the pail wit flashed in the pan vandyke ruffled his long black locks disarranged his careless tie and leaned over to madder say maddy he whispered feelingly some times i m tempted to pay this philistine his ten dol lars and get rid of him madder ruffled his long sandy locks and disar ranged his careless tie don t think of it vandy he replied we are short and art is long medora ate strange viands and drank elderberry wine that they poured in her glass it was just the color of that in the vermont home the waiter poured something in another glass that seemed to be boiling but when she tasted it it was not hot she had never felt so light hearted before she thought lovingly of the green mountain farm and its fauna she leaned smiling to miss elise if i were at home she said beamingly i could show you the cutest little calf nothing for you in the white lane said miss elise why don t you pad the orchestra played a wailing waltz that medora had learned from the hand organs she followed the air with nodding head in a sweet soprano hum madder looked across the table at her and wondered in what strange waters binkley had caught her in his seine she smiled at him and they raised glasses and drank of the wine that boiled when it was cold binkley had abandoned art and was prating of the unusual spring catch of shad miss elise arranged the palette and maul stick tie pin of mr vandyke a philistine at some distant table was maundering volubly either about jerome or gerome a famous actress was discoursing excitably about monogrammed hosiery a hose clerk from a department store was loudly proclaiming his opinions of the drama a writer was abusing dickens a magazine editor and a photographer were drinking a dry brand at a re served table a young lady was saying to an eminent sculptor fudge for your prax italys bring one of your venus anno dominis down to cohen s and see bow quick she d be turned down for a cloak model back to the quarries with your greeks and dagos thus went bohemia at eleven mr binkley took medora to the board ing bouse and left her with a society bow at the foot of the hall stairs she went up to her room and lit the gas and then as suddenly as the dreadful genie arose in vapor from the copper vase of the fisherman arose in that room the formidable shape of the new england conscience the terrible thing that medora had done was revealed to her in its full enormity she had sat in the presence of the un godly and looked upon the wine both when it was red and effervescent at midnight she wrote this letter mr berlah hoskins harmony vermont dear sir henceforth consider me as dead to you forever i have loved you too well to blight your career by bringing into it my guilty and sin stained life i have succumbed to the insidious wiles of this wicked world and have been drawn into the vortex of bohemia there is scarcely any depth of glittering iniquity that i have not sounded it is hopeless to combat my decision there is no rising from the depths to which i have sunk endeavor to forget me i am lost forever in the fair but brutal maze of awful bohemia farewell once your medora on the next day medora formed her resolutions beelzebub flung from heaven was no more cast down between her and the apple blossoms of harmony there was a fixed gulf flaming cherubim warded her from the gates of her lost paradise in one evening by the aid of binkley and mumm bohemia had gathered her into its awful midst there remained to her but one thing a life of brilliant but irremediable error vermont was a shrine that she never would dare to approach again but she would not sink there were great and com pelling ones in history upon whom she would model her meteoric career camille lola montez royal mary zaza such a name as one of these would that of medora martin be to future generations for two days medora kept her room on the third she opened a magazine at the portrait of the king of belgium and laughed sardonically if that far famed breaker of women s hearts should cross her path he would have to bow before her cold and im perious beauty she would not spare the old or the young all america all europe should do homage to her sinister but compelling charm as yet she could not bear to think of the life she had once desired a peaceful one in the shadow of the green mountains with beriah at her side and orders for expensive oil paintings coming in by each mail from new york her one fatal misstep had shattered that dream on the fourth day medora powdered her face and rouged her lips once she had seen carter in zaza she stood before the mirror in a reckless attitude and cried zut zut she rhymed it with nut but with the lawless word harmony seemed to pass away forever the vortex had her she belonged to bohemia for evermore and never would beriah the door opened and beriah walked in dory said he what s all that chalk and pink stuff on your face honey medora extended an arm too late she said solemnly the die is cast i belong in another world curse me if you will it is your right go and leave me in the path i have chosen bid them all at home never to men tion my name again and sometimes beriah pray for me when i am revelling in the gaudy but hol low pleasures of bohemia get a towel dory said beriah and wipe that paint off your face i came as soon as i got your letter them pictures of yours ain t amount ing to anything i ve got tickets for both of us back on the evening train hurry and get your things in your trunk fate was too strong for me beriah go while i am strong to bear it how do you fold this easel dory now begin to pack so we have time to eat before train time the maples is all out in full grown leaves dory you just ought to see em not this early beriah you ought to see em dory they re like an ocean of green in the morning sunlight oh beriah on the train she said to him suddenly i wonder why you came when you got my let ter oh shucks said beriah did you think you could fool me how could you be run away to that bohemia country like you said when your letter was postmarked new york as plain as day a philistine in bohemia george washington with his right arm upraised sits his iron horse at the lower corner of union square

unless his nerves are iron that rapid tran sit gloria mundi should the general raise his left hand as he has raised his right it would point to a quarter of the city that forms a haven for the oppressed and sup pressed of foreign lands in the cause of national or personal freedom they have found a refuge here and the patriot who made it for them sits his steed overlooking their district

waiter who serves your table d hote for the other half perhaps if the barber shops had tongues and who will dispute it they could tell their share titles are as plentiful as finger rings among these transitory exiles for lack of proper exploitation a stock of titled goods large enough to supply the trade of upper fifth avenue is here condemned to a mere pushcart traffic the new world landlords who en tertain these offshoots of nobility are not dazzled by coronets and crests they have doughnuts to sell instead of daughters with them it is a serious matter of trading in flour and sugar instead of pearl powder and bonbons these assertions are deemed fitting as an introduction to the tale which is of plebeians and contains no one with even the ghost of a title katy dempsey s mother kept a furnished room house in this oasis of the aliens the business was not profitable if the two scraped together enough to meet the landlord s agent on rent day and nego tiate for the ingredients of a daily irish stew they called it success often the stew lacked both meat and potatoes sometimes it became as bad as consomme with music in this mouldy old house katy waxed plump and pert and wholesome and as beautiful and freckled as a tiger lily she was the good fairy who was guilty of placing the damp clean towels and cracked pitchers of freshly laundered croton in the lodgers rooms you are informed by virtue of the privileges of astronomical discovery that the star lodger s name was mr brunelli his wearing a yellow tie and pay ing his rent promptly distinguished him from the other lodgers his raiment was splendid his com plexion olive his mustache fierce his manners a prince s his rings and pins as magnificent as those of a traveling dentist he had breakfast served in his room and he ate it in a red dressing gown with green tassels he left the house at noon and returned at midnight those were mysterious hours but there was nothing my terious about mrs dempsey s lodgers except the things that were not mysterious one of mr kip ling s poems is addressed to ye who hold the un written clue to all save all unwritten thing the same readers are invited to tackle the foregoing assertion mr brunelli being impressionable and a latin fell to conjugating the verb amare with katy in the objective case though not because of antipathy she talked it over with her mother

rig lar he s the same tbricks of spakin and blarneyin wid his hands sighed katy as the frinch noble man at mrs toole s that ran away wid mr toole s sunday pants and left the photograph of the bastile his grandfather s chat taw as security for tin weeks rint mr brunelli continued his calorific wooing katy continued to hesitate one day he asked her out to dine and she felt that a denouement was in the air while they are on their way with katy in her best muslin you must take as an entr acte a brief peep at new york s bohemia tonio s restaurant is in bohemia the very lo cation of it is secret if you wish to know where it is ask the first person you meet he will tell you in a whisper tonio discountenances custom he keeps his house front black and forbidding he gives you a pretty bad dinner he locks his door at the dining hour but he knows spaghetti as the boarding house knows cold veal and he has deposited many dol lars in a certain banco di something with many gold vowels in the name on its windows to this restaurant mr brunelli conducted katy the house was dark and the shades were lowered but mr brunelli touched an electric button by the base ment door and they were admitted along a long dark narrow hallway they went and then through a shining and spotless kitchen that opened directly upon a back yard the walls of houses hemmed three sides of the yard a high board fence surrounded by cats the other a wash of clothes was suspended high upon a line stretched from diagonal corners those were property clothes and were never taken in by tonio they were there that wits with defective pronuncia tion might make puns in connection with the ragout a dozen and a half little tables set upon the bare ground were crowded with bohemia hunters who flocked there because tonio pretended not to want them and pretended to give them a good dinner there was a sprinkling of real bohemians present who came for a change because they were tired of the real bohemia and a smart shower of the men who originate the bright sayings of congressmen and the little nephew of the well known general passen ger agent of the evansville and terre haute rail road company here is a bon mot that was manufactured at tonio s a dinner at tonio s said a bohemian always amounts to twice the price that is asked for it let us assume that an accommodating voice in quires how so the dinner costs you cents you give cents to the waiter and it makes you feel like cents most of the diners were confirmed table d hoters gastronomic adventuress forever seeking the el do rado of a good claret and consistently coming to grief in california mr brunelli escorted katy to a little table em bowered with shrubbery in tubs and asked her to excuse him for a while katy sat enchanted by a scene so brilliant to her the grand ladies in splendid dresses and plumes and sparkling rings the fine gentlemen who laughed so loudly the cries of garsong and we mon seer and hello mame that distinguish bo hemia the lively chatter the cigarette smoke the interchange of bright smiles and eye glances all this display and magnificence overpowered the daugh ter of mrs dempsey and held her motionless mr brunelli stepped into the yard and seemed to spread his smile and bow over the entire company and everywhere there was a great clapping of bands and a few cries of bravo and tonio tonio whatever those words might mean ladies waved their napkins at him gentlemen almost twisted their necks off trying to catch his nod when the ovation was concluded mr brunelli with a final bow stepped nimbly into the kitchen and flung off his coat and waistcoat flaherty the nimblest garsong among the waiters had been assigned to the special service of katy she was a little faint from hunger for the irish stew on the dempsey table had been particu larly weak that day delicious odors from unknown dishes tantalized her and flaherty began to bring to her table course after course of ambrosial food that the gods might have pronounced excellent but even in the midst of her lucullian repast katy laid down her knife and fork her heart sank as lead and a tear fell upon her filet mignon her haunting suspicions of the star lodger arose again fourfold thus courted and admired and smiled upon by that fashionable and gracious assembly what else could mr brunelli be but one of those dazzling titled patricians glorious of name but shy of rent money concerning whom experience had made her wise with a sense of his ineligibility growing within her there was mingled a torturing conviction that his personality was becoming more pleasing to her day by day and why had he left her to dine alone but here he was coming again now coatless his snowy shirt sleeves rolled high above his jeffries onian elbows a white yachting cap perched upon his jetty curls tonio tonio shouted many and the spaghetti the spaghetti shouted the rest never at tonio s did a waiter dare to serve a dish of spaghetti until tonio came to test it to prove the sauce and add the needful dash of seasoning that gave it perfection from table to table moved tonio like a prince in his palace greeting his guests white jewelled bands signalled him from every side a glass of wine with this one and that smiles for all a jest and repartee for any that might challenge truly few princes could be so agreeable a host and what artist could ask for further appreciation of his handiwork katy did not know that the proudest consummation of a new yorker s ambition is to shake bands with a spaghetti chef or to receive a nod from a broadway head waiter at last the company thinned leaving but a few couples and quartettes lingering over new wine and old stories and then came mr brunelli to katy s secluded table and drew a chair close to hers katy smiled at him dreamily she was eating the last spoonful of a raspberry roll with burgundy sauce you have seen said mr brunelli laying one hand upon his collar bone i am antonio brunelli yes i am the great tonio you have not suspect that i loave you katy and you shall marry with me is it not so call me antonio and say that you will be mine katy s head drooped to the shoulder that was now freed from all suspicion of having received the knightly accolade oh andy she sighed this is great sure i ll marry wid ye but why didn t ye tell me ye was the cook i was near turnin ye down for bein one of thim foreign counts from each according to his ability vuyning left his club cursing it softly without any particular anger from ten in the morning un til eleven it had bored him immeasurably kirk with his fish story brooks with his porto rico cigars old morrison with his anecdote about the widow hep burn with his invariable luck at billiards all these afflictions had been repeated without change of bill or scenery besides these morning evils miss allison had refused him again on the night before but that was a chronic trouble five times she had laughed at his offer to make her mrs vuyning he intended to ask her again the next wednesday evening vuyning walked along forty fourth street to broadway and then drifted down the great sluice that washes out the dust of the gold mines of gotham he wore a morning suit of light gray low dull kid shoes a plain finely woven straw hat and his visible linen was the most delicate possible shade of heliotrope his necktie was the blue gray of a november sky and its knot was plainly the outcome of a lordly carelessness combined with an accurate conception of the most recent dictum of fashion now to write of a man s haberdashery is a worse thing than to write a historical novel around paul jones or to pen a testimonial to a hay fever cure therefore let it be known that the description of vuyning s apparel is germane to the movements of the story and not to make room for the new fall stock of goods even broadway that morning was a discord in vuyning s ears and in his eyes it paralleled for a few dreamy dreary minutes a certain howling scorching seething malodorous slice of street that he remembered in morocco he saw the struggling mass of dogs beggars fakirs slave drivers and veiled women in carts without horses the sun blazing brightly among the bazaars the piles of rubbish from ruined temples in the street and then a lady passing jabbed the ferrule of a parasol in his side and brought him back to broadway five minutes of his stroll brought him to a certain corner where a number of silent pale faced men are accustomed to stand immovably for hours busy with the file blades of their penknives with their hat brims on a level with their eyelids wall street speculators driving home in their carriages love to point out these men to their visiting friends and tell them of this rather famous lounging place of the crooks on wall street the speculators never use the file blades of their knives vuyning was delighted when one of this company stepped forth and addressed him as he was passing he was hungry for something out of the ordinary and to be accosted by this smooth faced keen eyed low voiced athletic member of the under world with his grim yet pleasant smile had all the taste of an adventure to the convention weary vuyning excuse me friend said be could i have a few minutes talk with you on the level certainly said vuyning with a smile but suppose we step aside to a quieter place there is a divan a cafe over here that will do schrumm will give us a private corner schrumm established them under a growing palm with two seidls between them vuyning made a pleasant reference to meteorological conditions thus forming a binge upon which might be swung the door leading from the thought repository of the other in the first place said his companion with the air of one who presents his credentials i want you to understand that i am a crook out west i am known as rowdy the dude pickpocket supper man second story man yeggman boxman all round bur glar cardsharp and slickest con man west of the twenty third street ferry landing that s my his tory that s to show i m on the square with you my name s emerson confound old kirk with his fish stories said vuyning to himself with silent glee as he went through his pockets for a card it s pronounced vining he said as he tossed it over to the other and i ll be as frank with you i m just a kind of a loafer i guess living on my daddy s money at the club they call me left at the post i never did a day s work in my life and i haven t the heart to run over a chicken when i m motoring it s a pretty shabby record altogether there s one thing you can do said emerson admiringly you can carry duds i ve watched you several times pass on broadway you look the best dressed man i ve seen and i ll bet you a gold mine i ve got worth more gent s furnishings on my frame than you have that s what i wanted to see you about i can t do the trick take a look at me what s wrong stand up said vuyning emerson arose and slowly revolved you ve been outfitted declared the clubman some broadway window dresser has misused you that s an expensive suit though emerson a hundred dollars said emerson twenty too much said vuyning six months old in cut one inch too long and half an inch to much lapel your hat is plainly dated one year ago although there s only a sixteenth of an inch lacking in the brim to tell the story that english poke in your collar is too short by the distance between troy and london a plain gold link cuff button would take all the shine out of those pearl ones with dia mond settings those tan shoes would be exactly the articles to work into the heart of a brooklyn school ma am on a two weeks visit to lake ronkon koma i think i caught a glimpse of a blue silk sock embroidered with russet lilies of the valley when you improperly drew up your trousers as you sat down there are always plain ones to be had in the stores have i hurt your feelings emer son double the ante cried the criticised one greed ily give me more of it there s a way to tote the haberdashery and i want to get wise to it say you re the right kind of a swell anything else to the queer about me your tie said vuyning is tied with absolute precision and correctness thanks gratefully i spent over half an hour at it before i thereby interrupted vuyning completing your resemblance to a dummy in a broadway store window yours truly said emerson sitting down again it s bully of you to put me wise i knew there was something wrong but i couldn t just put my finger on it i guess it comes by nature to know how to wear clothes oh i suppose said vuyning with a laugh that my ancestors picked up the knack while they were peddling clothes from house to house a couple of hundred years ago i m told they did that and mine said emerson cheerfully were making their visits at night i guess and didn t have a chance to catch on to the correct styles i tell you what said vuyning whose ennui had taken wings i ll take you to my tailor he ll eliminate the mark of the beast from your exterior that is if you care to go any further in the way of expense play em to the ceiling said emerson with a boyish smile of joy i ve got a roll as big around as a barrel of black eyed peas and as loose as the wrapper of a two for fiver i don t mind telling you that i was not touring among the antipodes when the burglar proof safe of the farmers national bank of butterville ia flew open some moonless nights ago to the tune of aren t you afraid asked vuyning that i ll call a cop and hand you over you tell me said emerson coolly why i didn t keep them he laid vuyning s pocketbook and watch the vuyning year old family watch on the table man said vuyning revelling did you ever hear the tale kirk tells about the six pound trout and the old fisherman seems not said emerson politely i d like to but you won t said vuyning i ve heard it scores of times that s why i won t tell you i was just thinking how much better this is than a club now shall we go to my tailor boys and elderly gents said vuyning five days later at his club standing up against the window where his coterie was gathered and keeping out the breeze a friend of mine from the west will dine at our table this evening will he ask if we have heard the latest from denver said a member squirming in his chair will he mention the new twenty three story ma sonic temple in quincy ill inquired another dropping his nose glasses will he spring one of those western mississippi river catfish stories in which they use yearling calves for bait demanded kirk fiercely be comforted said vuyning he has none of the little vices he is a burglar and safe blower and a pal of mine oh mary ann said they must you always adorn every statement with your alleged humor it came to pass that at eight in the evening a calm smooth brilliant affable man sat at vuyning s right hand during dinner and when the ones who pass their lives in city streets spoke of skyscrapers or of the little czar on his far frozen throne or of insig nificant fish from inconsequential streams this big deep chested man faultlessly clothed and eyed like an emperor disposed of their lilliputian chatter with a wink of his eyelash and then he painted for them with hard broad strokes a marvellous lingual panorama of the west he stacked snow topped mountains on the table freezing the hot dishes of the waiting diners with a wave of his hand he swept the clubhouse into a pine crowned gorge turning the waiters into a grim posse and each listener into a blood stained fugitive climbing with torn fingers upon the ensanguined rocks he touched the table and spake and the five panted as they gazed on barren lava beds and each man took his tongue between his teeth and felt his mouth bake at the tale of a land empty of water and food as simply as homer sang while he dug a tine of his fork leisurely into the tablecloth he opened a new world to their view as does one who tells a child of the looking glass country as one of his listeners might have spoken of tea too strong at a madison square afternoon so he depicted the ravages of redeye in a border town when the caballeros of the lariat and forty five

next morning at ten he met vuyning by ap pointment at a forty second street cafe emerson was to leave for the west that day he wore a suit of dark cheviot that looked to have been draped upon him by an ancient grecian tailor who was a few thousand years ahead of the styles mr vuyning said he with the clear ingenuous smile of the successful crook it s up to me to go the limit for you any time i can do so you re the real thing and if i can ever return the favor you bet your life i ll do it what was that cow puncher s name asked vuyning who used to catch a mustang by the nose and mane and

right track for years said emerson you re the goods duty free and half way to the warehouse in a red wagon bacon toasted on a green willow switch over red coals ought to put broiled lobsters out of

miss allison but if he s your friend jimmy here goes the memento miss lynnette d armande turned her back on broadway this was but tit for tat be cause broadway had often done the same thing to miss d armande still the tats seemed to have it for the ex leading lady of the reaping the whirlwind company had everything to ask of broadway while there was no vice versa so miss lynnette d armande turned the back of her chair to her window that overlooked broadway and sat down to stitch in time the lisle thread heel of a black silk stocking the tumult and glitter of the roaring broadway beneath her window had no charm for her what she greatly desired was the stifling air of a dressing room on that fairyland street and the roar of an audience gathered in that capricious quarter in the meantime those stock ings must not be neglected silk does wear out so but after all isn t it just the only goods there is the hotel thalia looks on broadway as marathon looks on the sea it stands like a gloomy cliff above the whirlpool where the tides of two great thorough fares clash here the player bands gather at the end of their wanderings to loosen the buskin and dust the sock thick in the streets around it are booking offices theatres agents schools and the lobster pal aces to which those thorny paths lead wandering through the eccentric halls of the dim and fusty thalia you seem to have found yourself in some great ark or caravan about to sail or fly or roll away on wheels about the house lingers a sense of unrest of expectation of transientness even of anxiety and apprehension the halls are a labyrinth without a guide you wander like a lost soul in a sam loyd puzzle turning any corner a dressing sack or a cul de sac may bring you up short you meet alarming tragedians stalking in bath robes in search of ru mored bathrooms from hundreds of rooms come the buzz of talk scraps of new and old songs and the ready laughter of the convened players summer has come their companies have disbanded and they take their rest in their favorite caravansary while they besiege the managers for engagements for the coming season at this hour of the afternoon the day s work of tramping the rounds of the agents offices is over past you as you ramble distractedly through the mossy halls flit audible visions of houris with veiled starry eyes flying tag ends of things and a swish of silk bequeathing to the dull hallways an odor of gaiety and a memory of frangipanni serious young comedians with versatile adam s apples gather in doorways and talk of booth far reaching from somewhere comes the smell of ham and red cabbage and the crash of dishes on the american plan the indeterminate hum of life in the thalia is enlivened by the discreet popping at reasonable and salubrious intervals of beer bottle corks thus punctuated life in the genial hostel scans easily the comma being the favorite mark semicolons frowned upon and periods barred miss d armannde s room was a small one there was room for her rocker between the dresser and the wash stand if it were placed longitudinally on the dresser were its usual accoutrements plus the ex lead ing lady s collected souvenirs of road engagements and photographs of her dearest and best professional friends at one of these photographs she looked twice or thrice as she darned and smiled friendlily i d like to know where lee is just this minute she said half aloud if you had been privileged to view the photograph thus flattered you would have thought at the first glance that you saw the picture of a many petalled white flower blown through the air by a storm but the floral kingdom was not responsible for that swirl of petalous whiteness you saw the filmy brief skirt of miss rosalie ray as she made a complete heels over head turn in her wistaria entwined swing far out from the stage high above the heads of the audience you saw the cam era s inadequate representation of the graceful strong kick with which she at this exciting moment sent flying high and far the yellow silk garter that each evening spun from her agile limb and descended upon the delighted audience below you saw too amid the black clothed mainly mas culine patrons of select vaudeville a hundred hands raised with the hope of staying the flight of the bril liant aerial token forty weeks of the best circuits this act had brought miss rosalie ray for each of two years she did other things during her twelve minutes a song and dance imitations of two or three actors who are but imitations of themselves and a balancing feat with a step ladder and feather duster but when the blossom decked swing was let down from the flies and miss rosalie sprang smiling into the seat with the golden circlet conspicuous in the place whence it was soon to slide and become a soaring and coveted guerdon then it was that the audience rose in its seat as a single man or presumably so and in dorsed the specialty that made miss ray s name a favorite in the booking offices at the end of the two years miss ray suddenly an nounced to her dear friend miss d armande that she was going to spend the summer at an antediluvian village on the north shore of long island and that the stage would see her no more seventeen minutes after miss lynnette d armande had expressed her wish to know the whereabouts of her old chum there were sharp raps at her door doubt not that it was rosalie ray at the shrill command to enter she did so with something of a tired flutter and dropped a heavy hand bag on the floor upon my word it was rosalie in a loose travel stained automobileless coat closely tied brown veil with yard long flying ends gray walking suit and tan oxfords with lavender overgaiters when she threw off her veil and hat you saw a pretty enough face now flushed and disturbed by some unusual emotion and restless large eyes with discontent marring their brightness a heavy pile of dull auburn hair hastily put up was escaping in crinkly waving strands and curling small locks from the confining combs and pins the meeting of the two was not marked by the effusion vocal gymnastical osculatory and catecheti cal that distinguishes the greetings of their unpro fessional sisters in society there was a brief clinch two simultaneous labial dabs and they stood on the same footing of the old days very much like the short salutations of soldiers or of travellers in for eign wilds are the welcomes between the strollers at the corners of their crisscross roads i ve got the hall room two flights up above yours said rosalie but i came straight to see you before going up i didn t know you were here till they told me i ve been in since the last of april said lyn nette and i m going on the road with a fatal inheritance company we open next week in eliz abeth i thought you d quit the stage lee tell me about yourself rosalie settled herself with a skilful wriggle on the top of miss d armande s wardrobe trunk and leaned her head against the papered wall from long habit thus can peripatetic leading ladies and their sisters make themselves as comfort able as though the deepest armchairs embraced them i m going to tell you lynn she said with a strangely sardonic and yet carelessly resigned look on her youthful face and then to morrow i ll strike the old broadway trail again and wear some more paint off the chairs in the agents offices if anybody had told me any time in the last three months up to four o clock this afternoon that i d ever listen to that leave your name and address rot of the booking bunch again i d have given em the real mrs fiske laugh loan me a handkerchief lynn gee but those long island trains are fierce i ve got enough soft coal cinders on my face to go on and play topsy without using the cork and speaking of corks got anything to drink lynn miss d armande opened a door of the wash stand and took out a bottle there s nearly a pint of manhattan there s a cluster of carnations in the drinking glass but oh pass the bottle save the glass for com pany thanks that hits the spot the same to you my first drink in three months yes lynn i quit the stage at the end of last season i quit it because i was sick of the life and especially because my heart and soul were sick of men of the kind of men we stage people have to be up against you know what the game is to us it s a fight against em all the way down the line from the manager who wants us to try his new motor car to the bill posters who want to call us by our front names and the men we have to meet after the show are the worst of all the stage door kind and the man ager s friends who take us to supper and show their diamonds and talk about seeing dan and dave and charlie for us they re beasts and i hate em i tell you lynn it s the girls like us on the stage that ought to be pitied it s girls from good homes that are honestly ambitious and work hard to rise in the profession but never do get there you bear a lot of sympathy sloshed around on chorus girls and their fifteen dollars a week piffle there ain t a sorrow in the chorus that a lobster cannot heal if there s any tears to shed let em fall for the actress that gets a salary of from thirty to forty five dollars a week for taking a leading part in a bum show she knows she ll never do any better but she hangs on for years hoping for the chance i that never comes and the fool plays we have to work in having another girl roll you around the stage by the hind legs in a wheelbarrow chorus in a musical comedy is dignified drama compared with the idiotic things i ve had to do in the thirty centers but what i hated most was the men the men leering and blathering at you across tables trying to buy you with wurzburger or extra dry accord ing to their estimate of your price and the men in the audiences clapping yelling snarling crowding writhing gloating like a lot of wild beasts with their eyes fixed on you ready to eat you up if you come in reach of their claws oh how i hate em well i m not telling you much about myself am i lynn i had two hundred dollars saved up and i cut the stage the first of the summer i went over on long island and found the sweetest little village that ever was called soundport right on the water i was going to spend the summer there and study up on elocution and try to get a class in the fall there was an old widow lady with a cottage near the beach who sometimes rented a room or two just for com pany and she took me in she had another boarder too the reverend arthur lyle yes he was the head liner you re on lynn i ll tell you all of it in a minute it s only a one act play the first time he walked on lynn i felt myself going the first lines he spoke he had me he was different from the men in audiences he was tall and slim and you never heard him come in the room but you felt him he had a face like a picture of a knight like one of that round table bunch and a voice like a cello solo and his manners lynn if you d take john drew in his best draw ing room scene and compare the two you d have john arrested for disturbing the peace i ll spare you the particulars but in less than a month arthur and i were engaged he preached at a little one night stand of a methodist church there was to be a parsonage the size of a lunch wagon and hens and honeysuckles when we were married ar thur used to preach to me a good deal about heaven but be never could get my mind quite off those honey suckles and hens no i didn t tell him i d been on the stage i hated the business and all that went with it i d cut it out forever and i didn t see any use of stirring things up i was a good girl and i didn t have any thing to confess except being an elocutionist and that was about all the strain my conscience would stand oh i tell you lynn i was happy i sang in the choir and attended the sewing society and re cited that annie laurie thing with the whistling stunt in it in a manner bordering upon the profes sional as the weekly village paper reported it and arthur and i went rowing and walking in the woods and clamming and that poky little village seemed to me the best place in the world i d have been happy to live there always too if but one morning old mrs gurley the widow lady got gossipy while i was helping her string beans on the back porch and began to gush information as folks who rent out their rooms usually do mr lyle was her idea of a saint on earth as he was mine too she went over all his virtues and graces and wound up by telling me that arthur had had an exremely romantic love affair not long before that had ended unhappily she didn t seem to be on to the details but she knew that he had been hit pretty hard he was paler and thinner she said and he had some kind of a remembrance or keepsake of the lady in a little rosewood box that he kept locked in his desk drawer in his study several times says she i ve seen him gloomerin over that box of evenings and he always locks it up right away if anybody comes into the room well you can imagine how long it was before i got arthur by the wrist and led him down stage and hissed in his ear that same afternoon we were lazying around in a boat among the water lilies at the edge of the bay arthur says i you never told me you d had another love affair but mrs gurley did i went on to let him know i knew i hate to bear a man lie before you came says he looking me frankly in the eye there was a previous affection a strong one since you know of it i will be perfectly candid with you i am waiting says i my dear ida says arthur of course i went by my real name while i was in soundport this former affection was a spiritual one in fact al though the lady aroused my deepest sentiments and was as i thought my ideal woman i never met her and never spoke to her it was an ideal love my love for you while no less ideal is different you wouldn t let that come between us was she pretty i asked she was very beautiful said arthur did you see her often i asked something like a dozen times says he always from a distance says i always from quite a distance says he and you loved her i asked she seemed my ideal of beauty and grace and soul says arthur and this keepsake that you keep under lock and key and moon over at times is that a remembrance from her a memento says arthur that i have treasured did she send it to you it came to me from her says be in a roundabout way i asked somewhat roundabout says he and yet rather direct why didn t you ever meet her i asked were your positions in life so different she was far above me says arthur now ida he goes on this is all of the past you re not going to be jealous are you jealous says i why man what are you talking about it makes me think ten times as much of you as i did before i knew about it and it did lynn if you can understand it that ideal love was a new one on me but it struck me as being the most beautiful and glorious thing i d ever heard of think of a man loving a woman he d never even spoken to and being faithful just to what his mind and heart pictured her oh it sounded great to me the men i d always known come at you with either diamonds knock out drops or a raise of salary and their ideals well we ll say no more yes it made me think more of arthur than i did before i couldn t be jealous of that far away divin ity that he used to worship for i was going to have him myself and i began to look upon him as a saint on earth just as old lady gurley did about four o clock this afternoon a man came to the house for arthur to go and see somebody that was sick among his church bunch old lady gurley was taking her afternoon snore on a couch so that left me pretty much alone in passing by arthur s study i looked in and saw his bunch of keys hanging in the drawer of his desk where he d forgotten em well i guess we re all to the mrs bluebeard now and then ain t we lynn i made up my mind i d have a look at that memento he kept so secret not that i cared what it was it was just curiosity while i was opening the drawer i imagined one or two things it might be i thought it might be a dried rosebud she d dropped down to him from a balcony or maybe a picture of her he d cut out of a magazine she being so high up in the world i opened the drawer and there was the rosewood casket about the size of a gent s collar box i found the little key in the bunch that fitted it and unlocked it and raised the lid i took one look at that memento and then i went to my room and packed my trunk i threw a few things into my grip gave my hair a flirt or two with a side comb put on my hat and went in and gave the old lady s foot a kick i d tried awfully hard to use proper and correct language while i was there for arthur s sake and i had the habit down pat but it left me then stop sawing gourds says i and sit up and take notice the ghost s about to walk i m going away from here and i owe you eight dollars the expressman will call for my trunk i handed her the money dear me miss crosby says she is any thing wrong i thought you were pleased here dear me young women are so hard to understand and so different from what you expect em to be you re damn right says i some of em are but you can t say that about men when you know one man you know em all that settles the human race question and then i caught the four thirty eight soft coal unlimited and here i am you didn t tell me what was in the box lee said miss d armande anxiously one of those yellow silk garters that i used to kick off my leg into the audience during that old vaudeville swing act of mine is there any of the cocktail left lynn waifs and strays the red roses of tonia a trestle burned down on the international railroad the south bound from san antonio was cut off for the next forty eight hours on that train was tonia weaver s easter hat espirition the mexican who had been sent forty miles in a buckboard from the espinosa ranch to fetch it returned with a shrugging shoulder and hands empty except for a cigarette at the small station nopal he had learned of the delayed train and having no commands to wait turned his ponies toward the ranch again now if one supposes that easter the goddess of spring cares any more for the after church parade on fifth avenue than she does for her loyal outfit of subjects that assemble at the meeting house at cactus tex a mistake has been made the wives and daughters of the ranchmen of the frio country put forth easter blossoms of new hats and gowns as faithfully as is done anywhere and the southwest is for one day a mingling of prickly pear paris and paradise and now it was good friday and tonia weaver s easter hat blushed unseen in the desert air of an impotent express car beyond the burned trestle on saturday noon the rogers girls from the shoestring ranch and ella reeves from the anchor o and mrs bennet and ida from green valley would convene at the espinosa and pick up tonia with their easter hats and frocks carefully wrapped and bundled against the dust the fair aggregation would then merrily jog the ten miles to cactus where on the morrow they would array themselves subjugate man do homage to easter and cause jealous agitation among the lilies of the field tonia sat on the steps of the espinosa ranch house flicking gloomily with a quirt at a tuft of curly mesquite she displayed a frown and a contumelious lip and endeavored to radiate an aura of disagreeableness and tragedy i hate railroads she announced positively and men men pretend to run them can you give any excuse why a trestle should burn ida bennet s hat is to be trimmed with violets i shall not go one step toward cactus without a new hat if i were a man i would get one two men listened uneasily to this disparagement of their kind one was wells pearson foreman of the mucho calor cattle ranch the other was thompson burrows the prosperous sheepman from the quintana valley both thought tonia weaver adorable especially when she railed at railroads and menaced men either would have given up his epidermis to make for her an easter hat more cheerfully than the ostrich gives up his tip or the aigrette lays down its life neither possessed the ingenuity to conceive a means of supplying the sad deficiency against the coming sabbath pearson s deep brown face and sunburned light hair gave him the appearance of a schoolboy seized by one of youth s profound and insolvable melancholies tonia s plight grieved him through and through thompson burrows was the more skilled and pliable he hailed from somewhere in the east originally and he wore neckties and shoes and was made dumb by woman s presence the big water hole on sandy creek said pearson scarcely hoping to make a hit was filled up by that last rain oh was it said tonia sharply thank you for the information i suppose a new hat is nothing to you mr pearson i suppose you think a woman ought to wear an old stetson five years without a change as you do if your old water hole could have put out the fire on that trestle you might have some reason to talk about it i am deeply sorry said burrows warned by pearson s fate that you failed to receive your hat miss weaver deeply sorry indeed if there was anything i could do don t bother interrupted tonia with sweet sarcasm if there was anything you could do you d be doing it of course there isn t tonia paused a sudden sparkle of hope had come into her eye her frown smoothed away she had an inspiration there s a store over at lone elm crossing on the nueces she said that keeps hats eva rogers got hers there she said it was the latest style it might have some left but it s twenty eight miles to lone elm the spurs of two men who hastily arose jingled and tonia almost smiled the knights then were not all turned to dust nor were their rowels rust of course said tonia looking thoughtfully at a white gulf cloud sailing across the cerulean dome nobody could ride to lone elm and back by the time the girls call by for me to morrow so i reckon i ll have to stay at home this easter sunday and then she smiled well miss tonia said pearson reaching for his hat as guileful as a sleeping babe i reckon i ll be trotting along back to mucho calor there s some cutting out to be done on dry branch first thing in the morning and me and road runner has got to be on hand it s too bad your hat got sidetracked maybe they ll get that trestle mended yet in time for easter i must be riding too miss tonia announced burrows looking at his watch i declare it s nearly five o clock i must be out at my lambing camp in time to help pen those crazy ewes tonia s suitors seemed to have been smitten with a need for haste they bade her a ceremonious farewell and then shook each other s hands with the elaborate and solemn courtesy of the southwesterner hope i ll see you again soon mr pearson said burrows same here said the cowman with the serious face of one whose friend goes upon a whaling voyage be gratified to see you ride over to mucho calor any time you strike that section of the range pearson mounted road runner the soundest cow pony on the frio and let him pitch for a minute as he always did on being mounted even at the end of a day s travel what kind of a hat was that miss tonia he called that you ordered from san antone i can t help but be sorry about that hat a straw said tonia the latest shape of course trimmed with red roses that s what i like red roses there s no color more becoming to your complexion and hair said burrows admiringly it s what i like said tonia and of all the flowers give me red roses keep all the pinks and blues for yourself but what s the use when trestles burn and leave you without anything it ll be a dry old easter for me pearson took off his hat and drove road bunner at a gallop into the chaparral east of the espinosa ranch house as his stirrups rattled against the brush burrows s long legged sorrel struck out down the narrow stretch of open prairie to the southwest tonia hung up her quirt and went into the sitting room i m mighty sorry daughter that you didn t get your hat said her mother oh don t worry mother said tonia coolly i ll have a new hat all right in time to morrow when burrows reached the end of the strip of prairie he pulled his sorrel to the right and let him pick his way daintily across a sacuista flat through which ran the ragged dry bed of an arroyo then up a gravelly hill matted with bush the hoarse scrambled and at length emerged with a snort of satisfaction into a stretch of high level prairie grassy and dotted with the lighter green of mesquites in their fresh spring foliage always to the right burrows bore until in a little while he struck the old indian trail that followed the nueces southward and that passed twenty eight miles to the southeast through lone elm here burrows urged the sorrel into a steady lope as he settled himself in the saddle for a long ride he heard the drumming of hoofs the hollow thwack of chaparral against wooden stirrups the whoop of a comanche and wells pearson burst out of the brush at the right of the trail like a precocious yellow chick from a dark green easter egg except in the presence of awing femininity melancholy found no place in pearson s bosom in tonia s presence his voice was as soft as a summer bullfrog s in his reedy nest now at his gleesome yawp rabbits a mile away ducked their ears and sensitive plants closed their fearful fronds moved your lambing camp pretty far from the ranch haven t you neighbor asked pearson as road runner fell in at the sorrel s side twenty eight miles said burrows looking a little grim pearson s laugh woke an owl one hour too early in his water elm on the river bank half a mile away all right for you sheepman i like an open game myself we re two locoed he milliners hat hunting in the wilderness i notify you burr to mind your corrals we ve got an even start and the one that gets the headgear will stand some higher at the espinosa you ve got a good pony said burrows eyeing road runner s barrel like body and tapering legs that moved as regularly as the pistonrod of an engine it s a race of course but you re too much of a horseman to whoop it up this soon say we travel together till we get to the home stretch i m your company agreed pearson and i admire your sense if there s hats at lone elm one of em shall set on miss tonia s brow to morrow and you won t be at the crowning i ain t bragging burr but that sorrel of yours is weak in the fore legs my horse against yours offered burrows that miss tonia wears the hat i take her to cactus to morrow i ll take you up shouted pearson but oh it s just like horse stealing for me i can use that sorrel for a lady s animal when when somebody comes over to mucho calor and burrows dark face glowered so suddenly that the cowman broke off his sentence but pearson could never feel any pressure for long what s all this easter business about burr he asked cheerfully why do the women folks have to have new hats by the almanac or bust all cinches trying to get em it s a seasonable statute out of the testaments explained burrows it s ordered by the pope or somebody and it has something to do with the zodiac i don t know exactly but i think it was invented by the egyptians it s an all right jubilee if the heathens did put their brand on it said pearson or else tonia wouldn t have anything to do with it and they pull it off at church too suppose there ain t but one hat in the lone elm store burr then said burrows darkly the best man of us ll take it back to the espinosa oh man cried pearson throwing his hat high and catching it again there s nothing like you come off the sheep ranges before you talk good and collateral to the occasion and if there s more than one then said burrows we ll pick our choice and one of us ll get back first with his and the other won t there never was two souls proclaimed pearson to the stars that beat more like one heart than yourn and mine me and you might be riding on a unicorn and thinking out of the same piece of mind at a little past midnight the riders loped into lone elm the half a hundred houses of the big village were dark on its only street the big wooden store stood barred and shuttered in a few moments the horses were fastened and pearson was pounding cheerfully on the door of old sutton the storekeeper the barrel of a winchester came through a cranny of a solid window shutter followed by a short inquiry wells pearson of the mucho calor and burrows of green valley was the response we want to buy some goods in the store sorry to wake you up but we must have em come on out vncle tommy and get a move on you uncle tommy was slow but at length they got him behind his counter with a kerosene lamp lit and told him of their dire need easter hats said uncle tommy sleepily why yes i believe i have got just a couple left i only ordered a dozen this spring i ll show em to you now uncle tommy sutton was a merchant half asleep or awake in dusty pasteboard boxes under the counter he had two left over spring hats but alas for his commercial probity on that early saturday morn they were hats of two springs ago and a woman s eye would have detected the fraud at half a glance but to the unintelligent gaze of the cowpuncher and the sheepman they seemed fresh from the mint of contemporaneous april the hats were of a variety once known as cart wheels they were of stiff straw colored red and flat brimmed both were exactly alike and trimmed lavishly around their crowns with full blown immaculate artificial white roses that all you got uncle tommy said pearson all right not much choice here burr take your pick they re the latest styles lied uncle tommy you d see em on fifth avenue if you was in new york uncle tommy wrapped and tied each hat in two yards of dark calico for a protection one pearson tied carefully to his calfskin saddle thongs and the other became part of road runner s burden they shouted thanks and farewells to uncle tommy and cantered back into the night on the home stretch the horsemen jockeyed with all their skill they rode more slowly on their way back the few words they spoke were not unfriendly burrows had a winchester under his left leg slung over his saddle horn pearson had a six shooter belted around him thus men rode in the frio country at half past seven in the morning they rode to the top of a hill and saw the espinosa ranch a white spot under a dark patch of live oaks five miles away the sight roused pearson from his drooping pose in the saddle he knew what road runner could do the sorrel was lathered and stumbling frequently road runner was pegging away like a donkey engine pearson turned toward the sheepman and laughed good bye burr he cried with a wave of his hand it s a race now we re on the home stretch he pressed road runner with his knees and leaned toward the espinosa road runner struck into a gallop with tossing head and snorting nostrils as if he were fresh from a month in pasture pearson rode twenty yards and heard the unmistakable sound of a winchester lever throwing a cartridge into the barrel he dropped flat along his horse s back before the crack of the rifle reached his ears it is possible that burrows intended only to disable the horse he was a good enough shot to do that without endangering his rider but as pearson stooped the ball went through his shoulder and then through road runner s neck the horse fell and the cowman pitched over his head into the hard road and neither of them tried to move burrows rode on without stopping in two hours pearson opened his eyes and took inventory he managed to get to his feet and staggered back to where road runner was lying road runner was lying there but he appeared to be comfortable pearson examined him and found that the bullet had creased him he had been knocked out temporarily but not seriously hurt but he was tired and he lay there on miss tonia s hat and ate leaves from a mesquite branch that obligingly hung over the road pearson made the horse get up the easter hat loosed from the saddle thongs lay there in its calico wrappings a shapeless thing from its sojourn beneath the solid carcass of road runner then pearson fainted and fell head long upon the poor hat again crumpling it under his wounded shoulders it is hard to kill a cowpuncher in half an hour he revived long enough for a woman to have fainted twice and tried ice cream for a restorer he got up carefully and found road runner who was busy with the near by grass he tied the unfortunate hat to the saddle again and managed to get himself there too after many failures at noon a gay and fluttering company waited in front of the espinosa ranch the rogers girls were there in their new buckboard and the anchor o outfit and the green valley folks mostly women and each and every one wore her new easter hat even upon the lonely prairies for they greatly desired to shine forth and do honor to the coming festival at the gate stood tonia with undisguised tears upon her cheeks in her hand she held burrow s lone elm hat and it was at its white roses hated by her that she wept for her friends were telling her with the ecstatic joy of true friends that cart wheels could not be worn being three seasons passed into oblivion put on your old hat and come tonia they urged for easter sunday she answered i ll die first and wept again the hats of the fortunate ones were curved and twisted into the style of spring s latest proclamation a strange being rode out of the brush among them and there sat his horse languidly he was stained and disfigured with the green of the grass and the limestone of rocky roads hallo pearson

daddy weaver for i haven t got any more paint to spare round the circle this story is especially interesting as an early treatment of the theme afterward developed with a surer hand in the pendulum find yo shirt all right sam asked mrs webber from her chair under the live oak where she was comfortably seated with a paper back volume for company it balances perfeckly marthy answered sam with a suspicious pleasantness in his tone at first i was about ter be a little reckless and kick cause ther buttons was all off but since i diskiver that the button holes is all busted out why i wouldn t go so fur as to say the buttons is any loss to speak of oh well said his wife carelessly put on your necktie that ll keep it together sam webber s sheep ranch was situated in the loneliest part of the country between the nueces and the frio the ranch house a two room box structure was on the rise of a gently swelling hill in the midst of a wilderness of high chaparral in front of it was a small clearing where stood the sheep pens shearing shed and wool house only a few feet back of it began the thorny jungle sam was going to ride over to the chapman ranch to see about buying some more improved merino rams at length he came out ready for his ride this being a business trip of some importance and the chapman ranch being almost a small town in population and size sam had decided to dress up accordingly the result was that he had transformed himself from a graceful picturesque frontiersman into something much less pleasing to the sight the tight white collar awkwardly constricted his muscular mahogany colored neck the buttonless shirt bulged in stiff waves beneath his unbuttoned vest the suit of ready made effectually concealed the fine lines of his straight athletic figure his berry brown face was set to the melancholy dignity befitting a prisoner of state he gave randy his three year old son a pat on the head and hurried out to where mexico his favorite saddle horse was standing marthy leisurely rocking in her chair fixed her place in the book with her finger and turned her head smiling mischievously as she noted the havoc sam had wrought with his appearance in trying to fix up well ef i must say it sam she drawled you look jest like one of them hayseeds in the picture papers stead of a free and independent sheepman of the state o texas sam climbed awkwardly into the saddle you re the one ought to be shamed to say so he replied hotly stead of tendin to a man s clothes you re al ays setting around a readin them billy by dam yaller back novils oh shet up and ride along said mrs webber with a little jerk at the handles of her chair you always fussin bout my readin i do a plenty and i ll read when i wanter i live in the bresh here like a varmint never seein nor hearin nothin and what other musement kin i have not in listenin to you talk for it s complain complain one day after another oh go on sam and leave me in peace sam gave his pony a squeeze with his knees and shoved down the wagon trail that connected his ranch with the old open government road it was eight o clock and already beginning to be very warm he should have started three hours earlier chapman ranch was only eighteen miles away but there was a road for only three miles of the distance he had ridden over there once with one of the half moon cowpunchers and he had the direction well defined in his mind sam turned off the old government road at the split mesquite and struck down the arroyo of the quintanilla here was a narrow stretch of smiling valley upholstered with a rich mat of green curly mesquite grass and mexico consumed those few miles quickly with his long easy lope again upon reaching wild duck waterhole must he abandon well defined ways he turned now to his right up a little hill pebble covered upon which grew only the tenacious and thorny prickly pear and chaparral at the summit of this he paused to take his last general view of the landscape for from now on he must wind through brakes and thickets of chaparral pear and mesquite for the most part seeing scarcely farther than twenty yards in any direction choosing his way by the prairie dweller s instinct guided only by an occasional glimpse of a far distant hilltop a peculiarly shaped knot of trees or the position of the sun sam rode down the sloping hill and plunged into the great pear flat that lies between the quintanilla and the piedra in about two hours he discovered that he was lost then came the usual confusion of mind and the hurry to get somewhere mexico was anxious to redeem the situation twisting with alacrity along the tortuous labyrinths of the jungle at the moment his master s sureness of the route had failed his horse had divined the fact there were no hills now that they could climb to obtain a view of the country they came upon a few but so dense and interlaced was the brush that scarcely could a rabbit penetrate the mass they were in the great lonely thicket of the frio bottoms it was a mere nothing for a cattleman or a sheepman to be lost for a day or a night the thing often happened it was merely a matter of missing a meal or two and sleeping comfortably on your saddle blankets on a soft mattress of mesquite grass but in sam s case it was different he had never been away from his ranch at night marthy was afraid of the country afraid of mexicans of snakes of panthers even of sheep so he had never left her alone it must have been about four in the afternoon when sam s conscience awoke he was limp and drenched rather from anxiety than the heat or fatigue until now he had been hoping to strike the trail that led to the frio crossing and the chapman ranch he must have crossed it at some dim part of it and ridden beyond if so he was now something like fifty miles from home if he could strike a ranch a camp any place where he could get a fresh horse and inquire the road he would ride all night to get back to marthy and the kid so i have hinted sam was seized bv remorse there was a big lump in his throat as he thought of the cross words he had spoken to his wife surely it was hard enough for her to live in that horrible country witnout having to bear the burden of his abuse he cursed himself grimly and felt a sudden flush of shame that over glowed the summer heat as he remembered the many times he had flouted and railed at her because she had a liking for reading fiction ther only so ce ov amusement ther po gal s got said sam aloud with a sob which unaccustomed sound caused mexico to shy a bit a livin with a sore headed kiote like me a low down skunk that ought to be licked to death with a saddle cinch a cookin and a washin and a livin on mutton and beans and me abusin her fur takin a squint or two in a little book he thought of marthy as she had been when he first met her in dogtown smart pretty and saucy before the sun had turned the roses in her cheeks brown and the silence of the chaparral had tamed her ambitions ef i ever speaks another hard word to ther little gal muttered sam or fails in the love and affection that s coming to her in the deal i hopes a wildcat ll t ar me to pieces he knew what he would do he would write to garcia jones his san antonio merchants where he bought his supplies and sold his wool and have them send down a big box of novels and reading matter for marthy things were going to be different he wondered whether a little piano could be placed in one of the rooms of the ranch house without the family having to move out of doors in nowise calculated to allay his self reproach was the thought that marthy and randy would have to pass the night alone in spite of their bickerings when night came marthy was wont to dismiss her fears of the country and rest her head upon sam s strong arm with a sigh of peaceful content and dependence and were her fears so groundless sam thought of roving marauding mexicans of stealthy cougars that sometimes invaded the ranches of rattlesnakes centipedes and a dozen possible dangers marthy would be frantic with fear randy would cry and call for dada to come still the interminable succession of stretches of brush cactus and mesquite hollow after hollow slope after slope all exactly alike all familiar by constant repetition and yet all strange and new if he could only arrive somewhere the straight line is art nature moves in circles a straightforward man is more an artificial product than a diplomatist is men lost in the snow travel in exact circles until they sink exhausted as their footprints have attested also travellers in philosophy and other mental processes frequently wind up at their starting point it was when sam webber was fullest of contrition and good resolves that mexico with a heavy sigh subsided from his regular brisk trot into a slow complacent walk they were winding up an easy slope covered with brush ten or twelve feet high i say now mex demurred sam this here won t do i know you re plumb tired out but we got ter git along oh lordy ain t there no mo houses in the world he gave mexico a smart kick with his heels mexico gave a protesting grunt as if to say what s the use of that now we re so near he quickened his gait into a languid trot rounding a great clump of black chaparral he stopped short sam dropped the bridle reins and sat looking into the back door of his own house not ten yards away marthy serene and comfortable sat in her rocking chair before the door in the shade of the house with her feet resting luxuriously upon the steps randy who was playing with a pair of spurs on the ground looked up for a moment at his father and went on spinning the rowels and singing a little song marthy turned her head lazily against the back of the chair and considered the arrivals with emotionless eyes she held a book in her lap with her finger holding the place sam shook himself queerly like a man coming out of a dream and slowly dismounted he moistened his dry lips i see you are still a settin he said a readin of them billy by dam yaller back novils sam had traveled round the circle and was himself again the rubber plant s story we rubber plants form the connecting link between the vegetable kingdom and the decorations of a waldorf astoria scene in a third avenue theatre i haven t looked up our family tree but i believe we were raised by grafting a gum overshoe on to a cent table d hote stalk of asparagus you take a white bulldog with a bourke cockran air of independence about him and a rubber plant and there you have the fauna and flora of a flat what the shamrock is to ireland the rubber plant is to the dweller in flats and furnished rooms we get moved from one place to another so quickly that the only way we can get our picture taken is with a kinetoscope we are the vagrant vine and the flitting fig tree you know the proverb where the rubber plant sits in the window the moving van draws up to the door we are the city equivalent to the woodbine and the honeysuckle no other vegetable except the pittsburg stogie can withstand as much handling as we can when the family to which we belong moves into a flat they set us in the front window and we become lares and penates fly paper and the peripatetic emblem of home sweet home we aren t as green as we look i guess we are about what you would call the soubrettes of the conservatory you try sitting in the front window of a flat in manhattan and looking out into the street all day and back into the flat at night and see whether you get wise or not hey talk about the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden say suppose there had been a rubber plant there when eve but i was going to tell you a story the first thing i can remember i had only three leaves and belonged to a member of the pony ballet i was kept in a sunny window and was generally watered with seltzer and lemon i had plenty of fun in those days i got cross eyed trying to watch the numbers of the automobiles in the street and the dates on the labels inside at the same time well then the angel that was molting for the musical comedy lost his last feather and the company broke up the ponies trotted away and i was left in the window ownerless the janitor gave me to a refined comedy team on the eighth floor and in six weeks i had been set in the window of five different flats i took on experience and put out two more leaves miss carruthers of the refined comedy team did you ever see her cross both feet back of her neck gave me to a friend of hers who had made an unfortunate marriage with a man in a store consequently i was placed in the window of a furnished room rent in advance water two flights up gas extra after ten o clock at night two of my leaves withered off here also i was moved from one room to another so many times that i got to liking the odor of the pipes the expressmen smoked i don t think i ever had so dull a time as i did with this lady there was never anything amusing going on inside she was devoted to her husband and besides leaning out the window and flirting with the iceman she never did a thing toward breaking the monotony when the couple broke up they left me with the rest of their goods at a second hand store i was put out in front for sale along with the jobbiest lot you ever heard of being lumped into one bargain think of this little cornucopia of wonders all for henry james s works six talking machine records one pair of tennis shoes two bottles of horse radish and a rubber plant that was me one afternoon a girl came along and stopped to look at me she had dark hair and eyes and she looked slim and sad around the mouth oh oh she says to herself i never thought to see one up here she pulls out a little purse about as thick as one of my leaves and fingers over some small silver in it old koen always on the lockout is ready rubbing his hands this girl proceeds to turn down mr james and the other commodities rubber plants or nothing is the burden of her song and at last koen and she come together at cents and away she goes with me in her arms she was a nice girl but not my style too quiet and sober looking thinks i to myself i ll just about land on the fire escape of a tenement six stories up and i ll spend the next six months looking at clothes on the line but she carried me to a nice little room only three flights up in quite a decent street and she put me in the window of course and then she went to work and cooked dinner for herself and what do you suppose she had bread and tea and a little dab of jam nothing else not a single lobster nor so much as one bottle of champagne the carruthers comedy team had both every evening except now and then when they took a notion for pig s knuckle and kraut after she had finished her dinner my new owner came to the window and leaned down close to my leaves and cried softly to herself for a while it made me feel funny i never knew anybody to cry that way over a rubber plant before of course i ve seen a few of em turn on the tears for what they could get out of it but she seemed to be crying just for the pure enjoyment of it she touched my leaves like she loved em and she bent down her head and kissed each one of em i guess i m about the toughest specimen of a peripatetic orchid on earth but i tell you it made me feel sort of queer home never was like that to me before generally i used to get chewed by poodles and have shirt waists hung on me to dry and get watered with coffee grounds and peroxide of hydrogen this girl had a piano in the room and she used to disturb it with both hands while she made noises with her mouth for hours at a time i suppose she was practising vocal music one day she seemed very much excited and kept looking at the clock at eleven somebody knocked and she let in a stout dark man with towsled black hair he sat down at once at the piano and played while she sang for him when she finished she laid one hand on her bosom and looked at him he shook his head and she leaned against the piano two years already she said speaking slowly do you think in two more or even longer the man shook his head again you waste your time he said roughly i thought the voice is not there and then he looked at her in a peculiar way but the voice is not everything he went on you have looks i can place you as i told you if the girl pointed to the door without saying anything and the dark man left the room and then she came over and cried around me again it s a good thing i had enough rubber in me to be water proof about that time somebody else knocked at the door thank goodness i said to myself here s a chance to get the water works turned off i hope it s somebody that s game enough to stand a bird and a bottle to liven things up a little tell you the truth this little girl made me tired a rubber plant likes to see a little sport now and then i don t suppose there s another green thing in new york that sees as much of gay life unless it s the chartreuse or the sprigs of parsley around the dish when the girl opens the door in steps a young chap in a traveling cap and picks her up in his arms and she sings out oh dick and stays there long enough to well you ve been a rubber plant too sometimes i suppose good thing says i to myself this is livelier than scales and weeping now there ll be something doing you ve got to go back with me says the young man i ve come two thousand miles for you aren t you tired of it yet bess you ve kept all of us waiting so long haven t you found out yet what is best the bubble burst only to day says the girl come here dick and see what i found the other day on the sidewalk for sale she brings him by the hand and exhibits yours truly how one ever got away up here who can tell i bought it with almost the last money i had he looked at me but he couldn t keep his eyes off her for more than a second do you remember the night bess he said when we stood under one of those on the bank of the bayou and what you told me then geewillikins i said to myself both of them stand under a rubber plant seems to me they are stretching matters somewhat do i not says she looking up at him and sneaking close to his vest and now i say it again and it is to last forever look dick at its leaves how wet they are those are my tears and it was thinking of you that made them fall the dear old magnolias says the young man pinching one of my leaves i love them all magnolia well wouldn t that say those innocents thought i was a magnolia what the well wasn t that tough on a genuine little old new york rubber plant out of nazareth okochee in georgia had a boom and j pinkney bloom came out of it with a wad okochee came out of it with a half million dollar debt a two and a half per cent city property tax and a city council that showed a propensity for traveling the back streets of the town these things came about through a fatal resemblance of the river cooloosa to the hudson as set forth and expounded by a northern tourist okochee felt that new york should not be allowed to consider itself the only alligator in the swamp so to speak and then that harmless but persistent individual so numerous in the south the man who is always clamoring for more cotton mills and is ready to take a dollar s worth of stock provided he can borrow the dollar that man added his deadly work to the tourist s innocent praise and okochee fell the cooloosa river winds through a range of small mountains passes okochee and then blends its waters trippingly as fall the mellifluous indian syllables with the chattahoochee okochee rose as it were from its sunny seat on the post office stoop hitched up its suspender and threw a granite dam two hundred and forty feet long and sixty feet high across the cooloosa one mile above the town thereupon a dimpling sparkling lake backed up twenty miles among the little mountains thus in the great game of municipal rivalry did okochee match that famous drawing card the hudson it was conceded that nowhere could the palisades be judged superior in the way of scenery and grandeur following the picture card was played the ace of commercial importance fourteen thousand horsepower would this dam furnish cotton mills factories and manufacturing plants would rise up as the green corn after a shower the spindle and the flywheel and turbine would sing the shrewd glory of okochee along the picturesque heights above the lake would rise in beauty the costly villas and the splendid summer residences of capital the naphtha launch of the millionaire would spit among the romantic coves the verdured hills would take formal shapes of terrace lawn and park money would be spent like water in okochee and water would be turned into money the fate of the good town is quickly told capital decided not to invest of all the great things promised the scenery alone came to fulfilment the wooded peaks the impressive promontories of solemn granite the beautiful green slants of bank and ravine did all they could to reconcile okochee to the delinquency of miserly gold the sunsets gilded the dreamy draws and coves with a minting that should charm away heart burning okochee true to the instinct of its blood and clime was lulled by the spell it climbed out of the arena loosed its suspender sat down again on the post office stoop and took a chew it consoled itself by drawling sarcasms at the city council which was not to blame causing the fathers as has been said to seek back streets and figure perspiringly on the sinking fund and the appropriation for interest due the youth of okochee they who were to carry into the rosy future the burden of the debt accepted failure with youth s uncalculating joy for here was sport aquatic and nautical added to the meagre round of life s pleasures in yachting caps and flowing neckties they pervaded the lake to its limits girls wore silk waists embroidered with anchors in blue and pink the trousers of the young men widened at the bottom and their hands were proudly calloused by the oft plied oar fishermen were under the spell of a deep and tolerant jjoy sailboats and rowboats furrowed the lenient waves popcorn and ice cream booths sprang up about the little wooden pier two small excursion steamboats were built and plied the delectable waters okochee philosophically gave up the hope of eating turtle soup with a gold spoon and settled back not ill content to its regular diet of lotus and fried hominy and out of this slow wreck of great expectations rose up j pinkney bloom with his wad and his prosperous cheery smile needless to say j pinkney was no product of georgia soil he came out of that flushed and capable region known as the north he called himself a promoter his enemies had spoken of him as a grafter okochee took a middle course and held him to be no better nor no worse than a yank far up the lake eighteen miles above the town the eye of this cheerful camp follower of booms had spied out a graft he purchased there a precipitous tract of five hundred acres at forty five cents per acre and this he laid out and subdivided as the city of skyland the queen city of the switzerland of the south streets and avenues were surveyed parks designed corners of central squares reserved for the proposed opera house board of trade lyceum market public schools and exposition hall the price of lots ranged from five to five hundred dollars positively no lot would be priced higher than five hundred dollars while the boom was growing in okochee j pinkney s circulars maps and prospectuses were flying through the mails to every part of the country investors sent in their money by post and the skyland real estate company j pinkney bloom returned to each a deed duly placed on record to the best lot at the price on hand that day all this time the catamount screeched upon the reserved lot of the skyland board of trade the opossum swung by his tail over the site of the exposition hall and the owl hooted a melancholy recitative to his audience of young squirrels in opera house square later when the money was coming in fast j pinkney caused to be erected in the coming city half a dozen cheap box houses and persuaded a contingent of indigent natives to occupy them thereby assuming the role of poulation in subsequent prospectuses which became accordingly more seductive and remunerative so when the dream faded and okochee dropped back to digging bait and nursing its two and a half per cent tax j pinkney bloom unloving of checks and drafts and the cold interrogatories of bankers strapped about his fifty two inch waist a soft leather belt containing eight thousand dollars in big bills and said that all was very good one last trip he was making to skyland before departing to other salad fields skyland was a regular post office and the steamboat dixie belle under contract delivered the mail bag generally empty twice a week there was a little business there to be settled the postmaster was to be paid off for his light but lonely services and the inhabitants had to be furnished with another month s homely rations as per agreement and then skyland would know j pinkney bloom no more the owners of these precipitous barren useless lots might come and view the scene of their invested credulity or they might leave them to their fit tenants the wild hog and the browsing deer the work of the skyland real estate company was finished the little steamboat dixie belle was about to shove off on her regular up the lake trip when a rickety hired carriage rattled up to the pier and a tall elderly gentleman in black stepped out signaling courteously but vivaciously for the boat to wait time was of the least importance in the schedule of the dixie belle captain macfarland gave the order and the boat received its ultimate two passengers for upon the arm of the tall elderly gentleman as he crossed the gangway was a little elderly lady with a gray curl depending quaintly forward of her left ear captain macfarland was at the wheel therefore it seemed to j pinkney bloom who was the only other passenger that it should be his to play the part of host to the boat s new guests who were doubtless on a scenery viewing expedition he stepped forward with that translucent child candid smile upon his fresh pink countenance with that air of unaffected sincerity that was redeemed from bluffness only by its exquisite calculation with that promptitude and masterly decision of manner that so well suited his calling with all his stock in trade well to the front he stepped forward to receive colonel and mrs peyton blaylock with the grace of a grand marshal or a wedding usher he escorted the two passengers to a side of the upper deck from which the scenery was supposed to present itself to the observer in increased quantity and quality there in comfortable steamer chairs they sat and began to piece together the random lines that were to form an intelligent paragraph in the big history of little events our home sir said colonel blaylock removing his wide brimmed rather shapeless black felt hat is in holly springs holly springs georgia i am very proud to make your acquaintance mr bloom mrs blaylock and myself have just arrived in okochee this morning sir on business business of importance in connection with the recent rapid march of progress in this section of our state the colonel smoothed back with a sweeping gesture his long smooth locks his dark eyes still fiery under the heavy black brows seemed inappropriate to the face of a business man he looked rather to be an old courtier handed down from the reign of charles and re attired in a modern suit of fine but raveling and seam worn broadcloth yes sir said mr bloom in his heartiest prospectus voice things have been whizzing around okochee biggest industrial revival and waking up to natural resources georgia ever had did you happen to squeeze in on the ground floor in any of the gilt edged grafts colonel well sir said the colonel hesitating in courteous doubt if i understand your question i may say that i took the opportunity to make an investment that i believe will prove quite advantageous yes sir i believe it will result in both pecuniary profit and agreeable occupation colonel blaylock said the little edlerly lady shaking her gray curl and smiling indulgent explanation at j pinkney bloom is so devoted to businesss he has such a talent for financiering and markets and investments and those kind of things i think myself extremely fortunate in having secured him for a partner on life s journey i am so unversed in those formidable but very useful branches of learning colonel blaylock rose and made a bow a bow that belonged with silk stockings and lace ruffles and velvet practical affairs he said with a wave of his hand toward the promoter are if i may use the comparison the garden walks upon which we tread through life viewing upon either side of us the flowers which brighten that journey it is my pleasure to be able to lay out a walk or two mrs blaylock sir is one of those fortunate higher spirits whose mission it is to make the flowers grow perhaps mr bloom you have perused the lines of lorella the southern poetess that is the name above which mrs blaylock has contributed to the press of the south for many years unfortunately said mr bloom with a sense of the loss clearly written upon his frank face i m like the colonel in the walk making business myself and i haven t had time to even take a sniff at the flowers poetry is a line i never dealt in it must be nice though quite nice it is the region smiled mrs blaylock in which my soul dwells my shawl peyton if you please the breeze comes a little chilly from yon verdured hills the colonel drew from the tail pocket of his coat a small shawl of knitted silk and laid it solicitously about the shoulders of the lady mrs blaylock sighed contentedly and turned her expressive eyes still as clear and unworldly as a child s upon the steep slopes that were slowly slipping past very fair and stately they looked in the clear morning air they seemed to speak in familiar terms to the responsive spirit of lorella my native hills she murmured dreamily see how the foliage drinks the sunlight from the hollows and dells mrs blaylock s maiden days said the colonel interpreting her mood to j pinkney bloom were spent among the mountains of northern georgia mountain air and mountain scenery recall to her those days holly springs where we have lived for twenty years is low and flat i fear that she may have suffered in health and spirits by so long a residence there that is one portent reason for the change we are making my dear can you not recall those lines you wrote entitled i think the georgia hills the poem that was so extensively copied by the southern press and praised so highly by the atlanta critics mrs blaylock turned a glance of speaking tenderness upon the colonel fingered for a moment the silvery curl that drooped upon her bosom then looked again toward the mountains without preliminary or affectation or demurral she began in rather thrilling and more deeply pitched tones to recite these lines the georgia hills the georgia hills oh heart why dost thou pine are not these sheltered lowlands fair with mead and bloom and vine ah as the slow paced river here broods on its natal rills my spirit drifts in longing sweet back to the georgia hills and through the close drawn curtained night i steal on sleep s slow wings back to my heart s ease slopes of pine where end my wanderings oh heaven seems nearer from their tops and farther earthly ills even in dreams if i may but dream of my georgia hills the grass upon their orchard sides is a fine couch to me the common note of each small bird passes all minstrelsy it would not seem so dread a thing if when the reaper wills he might come there and take my hand up in the georgia hills thats great stuff ma am said j pinkney bloom enthusiastically when the poetess had concluded i wish i had looked up poetry more than i have i was raised in the pine hills myself the mountains ever call to their children murmured mrs blaylock i feel that life will take on the rosy hue of hope again in among these beautiful hills peyton a little taste of the currant wine if you will be so good the journey though delightful in the extreme slightly fatigues me colonel blaylock again visited the depths of his prolific coat and produced a tightly corked rough black bottle mr bloom was on his feet in an instant let me bring a glass ma am you come along colonel there s a little table we can bring too maybe we can scare up some fruit or a cup of tea on board i ll ask mac mrs blaylock reclined at ease few royal ladies have held their royal prerogative with the serene grace of the petted southern woman the colonel with an air as gallant and assiduous as in the days of his courtship and j pinkney bloom with a ponderous agility half professional and half directed by some resurrected unnamed long forgotten sentiment formed a diversified but attentive court the currant wine wine home made from the holly springs fruit went round and then j pinkney began to hear something of holly springs life it seemed from the conversation of the blaylocks that the springs was decadent a third of the population had moved away business and the colonel was an authority on business had dwindled to nothing after carefully studying the field of opportunities open to capital he had sold his little property there for eight hundred dollars and invested it in one of the enterprises opened up by the book in okochee might i inquire sir said mr bloom in what particular line of business you inserted your coin i know that town as well as i know the regulations for illegal use of the mails i might give you a hunch as to whether you can make the game go or not j pinkney somehow had a kindly feeling toward these unsophisticated representatives of by gone days they were so simple impractical and unsuspecting he was glad that he happened not to have a gold brick or a block of that western bad boy silver mine stock along with him he would have disliked to unload on people he liked so well as he did these but there are some temptations toe enticing to be resisted no sir said colonel blaylock pausing to arrange the queen s wrap i did not invest in okochee i have made an exhaustive study of business conditions and i regard old settled towns as unfavorable fields in which to place capital that is limited in amount some months ago through the kindness of a friend there came into my hands a map and description of this new town of skyland that has been built upon the lake the description was so pleasing the future of the town set forth in such convincing arguments and its increasing prosperity portrayed in such an attractive style that i decided to take advantage of the opportunity it offered i carefully selected a lot in the centre of the business district although its price was the highest in the schedule five hundred dollars and made the purchase at once are you the man i mean did you pay five hundred dollars for a lot in skyland asked j pinkney bloom i did sir answered the colonel with the air of a modest millionaire explaining his success a lot most excellently situated on the same square with the opera house and only two squares from the board of trade i consider the purchase a most fortuitous one it is my intention to erect a small building upon it at once and open a modest book and stationery store during past years i have met with many pecuniary reverses and i now find it necessary to engage in some commercial occupation that will furnish me with a livelihood the book and stationery business though an humble one seems to me not inapt nor altogether uncongenial i am a graduate of the university of virginia and mrs blaylock s really wonderful acquaintance with belles lettres and poetic literature should go far toward insuring success of course mrs blaylock would not personally serve behind the counter with the nearly three hundred dollars i have remaining i can manage the building of a house by giving a lien on the lot i have an old friend in atlanta who is a partner in a large book store and he has agreed to furnish me with a stock of goods on credit on extremely easy terms i am pleased to hope sir that mrs blaylock s health and happiness will be increased by the change of locality already i fancy i can perceive the return of those roses that were once the hope and despair of georgia cavaliers again followed that wonderful bow as the colonel lightly touched the pale cheek of the poetess mrs blaylock blushing like a girl shook her curl and gave the colonel an arch reproving tap secret of eternal youth where art thou every second the answer comes here here here listen to thine own heartbeats weary seeker after external miracles those years said mrs blaylock in holly springs were long long long but now is the promised land in sight skyland a lovely name doubtless said the colonel we shall be able to secure comfortable accommodations at some modest hotel at reasonable rates our trunks are in okochee to be forwarded when we shall have made permanent arrangements j pinkney bloom excused himself went forward and stood by the captain at the wheel mac said he do you remember my telling you once that i sold one of those five hundred dollar lots in skyland seems i do grinned captain macfarland i m not a coward as a general rule went on the promoter but i always said that if i ever met the sucker that bought that lot i d run like a turkey now you see that old babe in the wood over there well he s the boy that drew the prize that was the only five hundred dollar lot that went the rest ranged from ten dollars to two hundred his wife writes poetry she s invented one about the high grounds of georgia that s way up in g they re going to skyland to open a book store well said macfarland with another grin it s a good thing you are along j p you can show em around town until they begin to feel at home he s got three hundred dollars left to build a house and store with went on j pinkney as if he were talking to himself and he thinks there s an open house up there captain macfarland released the wheel long enough to give his leg a roguish slap you old fat rascal he chuckled with a wink mac you re a fool said j pinkney bloom coldly he went back and joined the blaylocks where he sat less talkative with that straight furrow between his brows that always stood as a signal of schemes being shaped within there s a good many swindles connected with these booms he said presently what if this skyland should turn out to be one that is suppose business should be sort of dull there and no special sale for books my dear sir said colonel blaylock resting his hand upon the back of his wife s chair three times i have been reduced to almost penury by the duplicity of others but i have not yet lost faith in humanity if i have been deceived again still we may glean health and content if not worldly profit i am aware that there are dishonest schemers in the world who set traps for the unwary but even they are not altogether bad my dear can you recall those verses entitled he giveth the increase that you composed for the choir of our church in holly springs that was four years ago said mrs blaylock perhans i can repeat a verse or two the lily springs from the rotting mould pearls from the deep sea slime good will come out of nazareth all in god s own time to the hardest heart the softening grace cometh at last to bless guiding it right to help and cheer and succor in distress i cannot remember the rest the lines were not ambitious they were written to the music composed by a dear friend it s a fine rhyme just the same declared mr bloom it seems to ring the bell all right i guess i gather the sense of it it means that the rankest kind of a phony will give you the best end of it once in a while mr bloom strayed thoughtfully back to the captain and stood meditating ought to be in sight of the spires and gilded domes of skyland now in a few minutes chirruped macfarland shaking with enjoyment go to the devil said mr bloom still pensive and now upon the left bank they caught a glimpse of a white village high up on the hills smothered among green trees that was cold branch no boom town but the slow growth of many years cold branch lay on the edge of the grape and corn lands the big country road ran just back of the heights cold branch had nothing in common with the frisky ambition of okochee with its impertinent lake mac said j pinkney suddenly i want you to stop at cold branch there s a landing there that they made to use sometimes when the river was up can t said the captain grinning more broadly i ve got the united states mails on board right to day this boat s in the government service do you want to have the poor old captain keelhauled by uncle sam and the great city of skyland all disconsolate waiting for its mail i m ashamed of your extravagance j p mac almost whispered j pinkney in his danger line voice i looked into the engine room of the dixie belle a while ago don t you know of somebody that needs a new boiler cement and black japan can t hide flaws from me and then those shares of building and loan that you traded for repairs they were all yours of course i hate to mention these things but oh come now j p said the captain you know i was just fooling i ll put you off at cold branch if you say so the other passengers get off there too said mr bloom further conversation was held and in ten minutes the dixie belle turned her nose toward a little cranky wooden pier on the left bank and the captain relinquishing the wheel to a roustabout came to the passenger deck and made the remarkable announcement all out for skyland the blaylocks and j pinkney bloom disembarked and the dixie belle proceeded on her way up the lake guided by the indefatigable promoter they slowly climbed the steep hillside pausing often to rest and admire the view finally they entered the village of cold branch warmly both the colonel and his wife praised it for its homelike and peaceful beauty mr bloom conducted them to a two story building on a shady street that bore the legend pine top inn here he took his leave receiving the cordial thanks of the two for his attentions the colonel remarking that he thought they would spend the remainder of the day in rest and take a look at his purchase on the morrow j pinkney bloom walked down cold branch s main street he did not know this town but he knew towns and his feet did not falter presently he saw a sign over a door frank e cooly attorney at law and notary public a young man was mr cooly and awaiting business get your hat son said mr bloom in his breezy way and a blank deed and come along it s a job for you now he continued when mr cooly had responded with alacrity is there a bookstore in town one said the lawyer henry williams s get there said mr bloom we re going to buy it henry williams was behind his counter his store was a small one containing a mixture of books stationery and fancy rubbish adjoining it was henry s home a decent cottage vine embowered and cosy henry was lank and soporific and not inclined to rush his business i want to buy your house and store said mr bloom i haven t got time to dicker name your price it s worth eight hundred said henry too much dazed to ask more than its value shut that door said mr bloom to the lawyer then he tore off his coat and vest and began to unbutton his shirt wanter fight about it do yer said henry williams jumping up and cracking his heels together twice all right hunky sail in and cut yer capers keep your clothes on said mr bloom i m only going down to the bank he drew eight one hundred dollar bills from his money belt and planked them down on the counter mr cooly showed signs of future promise for he already had the deed spread out and was reaching across the counter for the ink bottle never before or since was such quick action had in cold branch your name please asked the lawyer make it out to peyton blaylock said mr bloom god knows how to spell it within thirty minutes henry williams was out of business and mr bloom stood on the brick sidewalk with mr cooly who held in his hand the signed and attested deed you ll find the party at the pinetop inn said j pinkney bloom get it recorded and take it down and give it to him he ll ask you a hell s mint of questions so here s ten dollars for the trouble you ll have in not being able to answer em never run much to poetry did you young man well said the really talented cooly who even yet retained his right mind now and then dig into it said mr bloom it ll pay you never heard a poem now that run something like this did you a good thing out of nazareth comes up sometimes i guess on hand all right to help and cheer a sucker in distress i believe not said mr cooly it s a hymn said j pinkney bloom now show me the way to a livery stable son for i m going to hit the dirt road back to okochee confessions of a humorist there was a painless stage of incubation that lasted twenty five years and then it broke out on me and people said i was it but they called it humor instead of measles the employees in the store bought a silver inkstand for the senior partner on his fiftieth birthday we crowded into his private office to present it i had been selected for spokesman and i made a little speech that i had been preparing for a week it made a hit it was full of puns and epigrams and funny twists that brought down the house which was a very solid one in the wholesale hardware line old marlowe himself actually grinned and the employees took their cue and roared my reputation as a humorist dates from half past nine o clock on that morning for weeks afterward my fellow clerks fanned the flame of my self esteem one by one they came to me saying what an awfully clever speech that was old man and carefully explained to me the point of each one of my jokes gradually i found that i was expected to keep it up others might speak sanely on business matters and the day s topics but from me something gamesome and airy was required i was expected to crack jokes about the crockery and lighten up the granite ware with persiflage i was second bookkeeper and if i failed to show up a balance sheet without something comic about the footings or could find no cause for laughter in an invoice of plows the other clerks were disappointed by degrees my fame spread and i became a local character our town was small enough to make this possible the daily newspaper quoted me at social gatherings i was indispensable i believe i did possess considerable wit and a facility for quick and spontaneous repartee this gift i cultivated and improved by practice and the nature of it was kindly and genial not running to sarcasm or offending others people began to smile when they saw me coming and by the time we had met i generally had the word ready to broaden the smile into a laugh i had married early we had a charming boy of three and a girl of five naturally we lived in a vine covered cottage and were happy my salary as bookkeeper in the hardware concern kept at a distance those ills attendant upon superfluous wealth at sundry times i had written out a few jokes and conceits that i considered peculiarly happy and had sent them to certain periodicals that print such things all of them had been instantly accepted several of the editors had written to request further contributions one day i received a letter from the editor of a famous weekly publication he suggested that i submit to him a humorous composition to fill a column of space hinting that he would make it a regular feature of each issue if the work proved satisfactory i did so and at the end of two weeks he offered to make a contract with me for a year at a figure that was considerably higher than the amount paid me by the hardware firm i was filled with delight my wife already crowned me in her mind with the imperishable evergreens of literary success we had lobster croquettes and a bottle of blackberry wine for supper that night here was the chance to liberate myself from drudgery i talked over the matter very seriously with louisa we agreed that i must resign my place at the store and devote myself to humor i resigned my fellow clerks gave me a farewell banquet the speech i made there coruscated it was printed in full by the gazette the next morning i awoke and looked at the clock late by george i exclaimed and grabbed for my clothes louisa reminded me that i was no longer a slave to hardware and contractors supplies i was now a professional humorist after breakfast she proudly led me to the little room off the kitchen dear girl there was my table and chair writing pad ink and pipe tray and all the author s trappings the celery stand full of fresh roses and honeysuckle last year s calendar on the wall the dictionary and a little bag of chocolates to nibble between inspirations dear girl i sat me to work the wall paper is patterned with arabesques or odalisks or perhaps it is trapezoids upon one of the figures i fixed my eyes i bethought me of humor a voice startled me louisa s voice if you aren t too busy dear it said come to dinner i looked at my watch yes five hours had been gathered in by the grim scytheman i went to dinner you mustn t work too hard at first said louisa goethe or was it napoleon said five hours a day is enough for mental labor couldn t you take me and the children to the woods this afternoon i am a little tired i admitted so we went to the woods but i soon got the swing of it within a month i was turning out copy as regular as shipments of hardware and i had success my column in the weekly made some stir and i was referred to in a gossipy way by the critics as something fresh in the line of humorists i augmented my income considerably by contributing to other publications i picked up the tricks of the trade i could take a funny idea and make a two line joke of it earning a dollar with false whiskers on it would serve up cold as a quatrain doubling its producing value by turning the skirt and adding a ruffle of rhyme you would hardly recognize it as vers de societe with neatly shod feet and a fashion plate illustration i began to save up money and we had new carpets and a parlor organ my townspeople began to look upon me as a citizen of some consequence instead of the merry trifier i had been when i clerked in the hardware store after five or six months the spontaniety seemed to depart from my humor quips and droll sayings no longer fell carelessly from my lips i was sometimes hard run for material i found myself listening to catch available ideas from the conversation of my friends sometimes i chewed my pencil and gazed at the wall paper for hours trying to build up some gay little bubble of unstudied fun and then i became a harpy a moloch a jonah a vampire to my acquaintances anxious haggard greedy i stood among them like a veritable killjoy let a bright saying a witty comparison a piquant phrase fall from their lips and i was after it like a hound springing upon a bone i dared not trust my memory but turning aside guiltily and meanly i would make a note of it in my ever present memorandum book or upon my cuff for my own future use my friends regarded me in sorrow and wonder i was not the same man where once i had furnished them entertainment and jollity i now preyed upon them no jests from me ever bid for their smiles now they were too precious i could not afford to dispense gratuitously the means of my livelihood i was a lugubrious fox praising the singing of my friends the crow s that they might drop from their beaks the morsels of wit that i coveted nearly every one began to avoid me i even forgot how to smile not even paying that much for the sayings i appropriated no persons places times or subjects were exempt from my plundering in search of material even in church my demoralized fancy went hunting among the solemn aisles and pillars for spoil did the minister give out the long meter doxology at once i began doxology sockdology sockdolager meter meet her the sermon ran through my mental sieve its precepts filtering unheeded could i but glean a suggestion of a pun or a bon mot the solemnest anthems of the choir were but an accompaniment to my thoughts as i conceived new changes to ring upon the ancient comicalities concerning the jealousies of soprano tenor and basso my own home became a hunting ground my wife is a singularly feminine creature candid sympathetic and impulsive once her conversation was my delight and her ideas a source of unfailing pleasure now i worked her she was a gold mine of those amusing but lovable inconsistencies that distinguish the female mind i began to market those pearls of unwisdom and humor that should have enriched only the sacred precincts of home with devilish cunning i encouraged her to talk unsuspecting she laid her heart bare upon the cold conspicuous common printed page i offered it to the public gaze a literary judas i kissed her and betrayed her for pieces of silver i dressed her sweet confidences in the pantalettes and frills of folly and made them dance in the market place dear louisa of nights i have bent over her cruel as a wolf above a tender lamb hearkening even to her soft words murmured in sleep hoping to catch an idea for my next day s grind there is worse to come god help me next my fangs were buried deep in the neck of the fugitive sayings of my little children guy and viola were two bright fountains of childish quaint thoughts and speeches i found a ready sale for this kind of humor and was furnishing a regular department in a magazine with funny fancies of childhood i began to stalk them as an indian stalks the antelope i would hide behind sofas and doors or crawl on my hands and knees among the bushes in the yard to eavesdrop while they were at play i had all the qualities of a harpy except remorse once when i was barren of ideas and my copy must leave in the next mail i covered myself in a pile of autumn leaves in the yard where i knew they intended to come to play i cannot bring myself to believe that guy was aware of my hiding place but even if he was i would be loath to blame him for his setting fire to the leaves causing the destruction of my new suit of clothes and nearly cremating a parent soon my own children began to shun me as a pest often when i was creeping upon them like a melancholy ghoul i would hear them say to each other here comes papa and they would gather their toys and scurry away to some safer hiding place miserable wretch that i was and yet i was doing well financially before the first year had passed i had saved a thousand dollars and we had lived in comfort but at what a cost i am not quite clear as to what a pariah is but i was everything that it sounds like i had no friends no amusements no enjoyment of life the happiness of my family had been sacrificed i was a bee sucking sordid honey from life s fairest flowers dreaded and shunned on account of my stingo one day a man spoke to me with a pleasant and friendly smile not in months had the thing happened i was passing the undertaking establishment of peter heffelbower peter stood in the door and saluted me i stopped strangely wrung in my heart by his greeting he asked me inside the day was chill and rainy we went into the back room where a fire burned in a little stove a customer came and peter left me alone for a while presently i felt a new feeling stealing over me a sense of beautiful calm and content i looked around the place there were rows of shining rosewood caskets black palls trestles hearse plumes mourning streamers and all the paraphernalia of the solemn trade here was peace order silence the abode of grave and dignified reflections here on the brink of life was a little niche pervaded by the spirit of eternal rest when i entered it the follies of the world abandoned me at the door i felt no inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings my mind seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts a quarter of an hour ago i was an abandoned humorist now i was a philosopher full of serenity and ease i had found a refuge from humor from the hot chase of the shy quip from the degrading pursuit of the panting joke from the restless reach after the nimble repartee i had not known heffelbower well when he came back i let him talk fearful that he might prove to be a jarring note in the sweet dirgelike harmony of his establishment but no he chimed truly i gave a long sigh of happiness never have i known a man s talk to be as magnificently dull as peter s was compared with it the dead sea is a geyser never a sparkle or a glimmer of wit marred his words commonplaces as trite and as plentiful as blackberries flowed from his lips no more stirring in quality than a last week s tape running from a ticker quaking a little i tried upon him one of my best pointed jokes it fell back ineffectual with the point broken i loved that man from then on two or three evenings each week i would steal down to heffelbower s and revel in his back room that was my only joy i began to rise early and hurry through my work that i might spend more time in my haven in no other place could i throw off my habit of extracting humorous ideas from my surroundings peter s talk left me no opening had i besieged it ever so hard under this influence i began to improve in spirits it was the recreation from one s labor which every man needs i surprised one or two of my former friends by throwing them a smile and a cheery word as i passed them on the streets several times i dumfounded my family by relaxing long enough to make a jocose remark in their presence i had so long been ridden by the incubus of humor that i seized my hours of holiday with a schoolboy s zest mv work began to suffer it was not the pain and burden to me that it had been i often whistled at my desk and wrote with far more fluency than before i accomplished my tasks impatiently as anxious to be off to my helpful retreat as a drunkard is to get to his tavern my wife had some anxious hours in conjecturing where i spent my afternoons i thought it best not to tell her women do not understand these things poor girl she had one shock out of it one day i brought home a silver coffin handle for a paper weight and a fine fluffy hearse plume to dust my papers with i loved to see them on my desk and think of the beloved back room down at heffelbower s but louisa found them and she shrieked with horror i had to console her with some lame excuse for having them but i saw in her eyes that the prejudice was not removed i had to remove the articles though at double quick time one day peter heffelbower laid before me a temptation that swept me off my feet in his sensible uninspired way he showed me his books and explained that his profits and his business were increasing rapidly he had thought of taking in a partner with some cash he would rather have me than any one he knew when i left his place that afternoon peter had my check for the thousand dollars i had in the bank and i was a partner in his undertaking business i went home with feelings of delirious joy mingled with a certain amount of doubt i was dreading to tell my wife about it but i walked on air to give up the writing of humorous stuff once more to enjoy the apples of life instead of squeezing them to a pulp for a few drops of hard cider to make the pubic feel funny what a boon that would be at the supper table louisa handed me some letters that had come during my absence several of them contained rejected manuscript ever since i first began going to heffelbower s my stuff had been coming back with alarming frequency lately i had been dashing off my jokes and articles with the greatest fluency previously i had labored like a bricklayer slowly and with agony presently i opened a letter from the editor of the weekly with which i had a regular contract the checks for that weekly article were still our main dependence the letter ran thus dear sir as you are aware our contract for the year expires with the present month while regretting the necessity for so doing we must say that we do not care to renew same for the coming year we were quite pleased with your style of humor which seems to have delighted quite a large proportion of our readers but for the past two months we have noticed a decided falling off in its quality your earlier work showed a spontaneous easy natural flow of fun and wit of late it is labored studied and unconvincing giving painful evidence of hard toil and drudging mechanism again regretting that we do not consider your contributions available any longer we are yours sincerely the editor i handed this letter to my wife after she had read it her face grew extremely long and there were tears in her eyes the mean old thing she exclaimed indignantly i m sure your pieces are just as good as they ever were and it doesn t take you half as long to write them as it did and then i suppose louisa thought of the checks that would cease coming oh john she wailed what will you do now for an answer i got up and began to do a polka step around the supper table i am sure louisa thought the trouble had driven me mad and i think the children hoped it had for they tore after me yelling with glee and emulating my steps i was now something like their old playmate as of yore the theatre for us to night i shouted nothing less and a late wild disreputable supper for all of us at the palace restaurant lumpty diddle de dee de dum and then i explained my glee by declaring that i was now a partner in a prosperous undertaking establishment and that written jokes might go hide their heads in sackcloth and ashes for all me with the editor s letter in her hand to justify the deed i had done my wife could advance no objections save a few mild ones based on the feminine inability to appreciate a good thing such as the little back room of peter hef no of heffelbower co s undertaking establishment in conclusion i will say that to day you will find no man in our town as well liked as jovial and full of merry sayings as i my jokes are again noised about and quoted once more i take pleasure in my wife s confidential chatter without a mercenary thought while guy and viola play at my feet distributing gems of childish humor without fear of the ghastly tormentor who used to dog their steps notebook in hand our business has prospered finely i keep the books and look after the shop while peter attends to outside matters he says that my levity and high spirits would simply turn any funeral into a regular irish wake the sparrows in madison square the young man in straitened circumstances who comes to new york city to enter literature has but one thing to do provided he has studied carefully his field in advance he must go straight to madison square write an article about the sparrows there and sell it to the sun for i cannot recall either a novel or a story dealing with the popular theme of the young writer from the provinces who comes to the metropolis to win fame and fortune with his pen in which the hero does not get his start that way it does seem strange that some author in casting about for startlingly original plots has not hit upon the idea of having his hero write about the bluebirds in union square and sell it to the herald but a search through the files of metropolitan fiction counts up overwhelmingly for the sparrows and the old garden square and the sun always writes the check of course it is easy to understand why this first city venture of the budding author is always successful he is primed by necessity to a superlative effort mid the iron and stone and marble of the roaring city he has found this spot of singing birds and green grass and trees every tender sentiment in his nature is baffling with the sweet pain of homesickness his genius is aroused as it never may be again the birds chirp the tree branches sway the noise of wheels is forgotten he writes with his soul in his pen and he sells it to the sun for i had read of this custom during many years before i came to new york when my friends were using their strongest arguments to dissuade me from coming i only smiled serenely they did not know of that sparrow graft i had up my sleeve when i arrived in new york and the car took me straight from the ferry up twenty third street to madison square i could hear that check rustling in my inside pocket i obtained lodging at an unhyphenated hostelry and the next morning i was on a bench in madison square almost by the time the sparrows were awake their melodious chirping the benignant spring foliage of the noble trees and the clean fragrant grass reminded me so potently of the old farm i had left that tears almost came into my eyes then all in a moment i felt my inspiration the brave piercing notes of those cheerful small birds formed a keynote to a wonderful light fanciful song of hope and joy and altruism like myself they were creatures with hearts pitched to the tune of woods and fields as i was so were they captives by circumstance in the discordant dull city yet with how much grace and glee they bore the restraint and then the early morning people began to pass through the square to their work sullen people with sidelong glances and glum faces hurrying hurrying hurrying and i got my theme cut out clear from the bird notes and wrought it into a lesson and a poem and a carnival dance and a lullaby and then translated it all into prose and began to write for two hours my pencil traveled over my pad with scarcely a rest then i went to the little room i had rented for two days and there i cut it to half and then mailed it white hot to the sun the next morning i was up by daylight and spent two cents of my capital for a paper if the word sparrow was in it i was unable to find it i took it up to my room and spread it out on the bed and went over it column by column something was wrong three hours afterward the postman brought me a large envelope containing my ms and a piece of inexpensive paper about inches by i suppose some of you have seen them upon which was written in violet ink with the sun s thanks i went over to the square and sat upon a bench no i did not think it necessary to eat any breakfast that morning the confounded pests of sparrows were making the square hideous with their idiotic cheep cheep i never saw birds so persistently noisy impudent and disagreeable in all my life by this time according to all traditions i should have been standing in the office of the editor of the sun that personage a tall grave white haired man would strike a silver bell as he grasped my hand and wiped a suspicious moisture from his glasses mr mcchesney he would be saying when a subordinate appeared this is mr henry the young man who sent in that exquisite gem about the sparrows in madison square you may give him a desk at once your salary sir will be a week to begin with this was what i had been led to expect by all writers who have evolved romances of literary new york something was decidedly wrong with tradition i could not assume the blame so i fixed it upon the sparrows i began to hate them with intensity and heat at that moment an individual wearing an excess of whiskers two hats and a pestilential air slid into the seat beside me say willie he muttered cajolingly could you cough up a dime out of your coffers for a cup of coffee this morning i m lung weary my friend said i the best i can do is three cents and you look like a gentleman too said he what brung you down boozer birds i said fiercely the brown throated songsters carolling songs of hope and cheer to weary man toiling amid the city s dust and din the little feathered couriers from the meadows and woods chirping sweetly to us of blue skies and flowering fields the confounded little squint eyed nuisances yawping like a flock of steam pianos and stuffing themselves like aldermen with grass seeds and bugs while a man sits on a bench and goes without his breakfast yes sir birds look at them as i spoke i picked up a dead tree branch that lay by the bench and hurled it with all my force into a close congregation of the sparrows on the grass the flock flew to the trees with a babel of shrill cries but two of them remained prostrate upon the turf in a moment my unsavory friend had leaped over the row of benches and secured the fluttering victims which he thrust hurriedly into his pockets then he beckoned me with a dirty forefinger come on cully he said hoarsely you re in on the feed thank you very much weakly i followed my dingy acquaintance he led me away from the park down a side street and through a crack in a fence into a vacant lot where some excavating had been going on behind a pile of old stones and lumber he paused and took out his birds i got matches said he you got any paper to start a fire with i drew forth my manuscript story of the sparrows and offered it for burnt sacrifice there were old planks splinters and chips for our fire my frowsy friend produced from some interior of his frayed clothing half a loaf of bread pepper and salt in ten minutes each of us was holding a sparrow spitted upon a stick over the leaping flames say said my fellow bivouacker this ain t so bad when a fellow s hungry it reminds me of when i struck new york first about fifteen years ago i come in from the west to see if i could get a job on a newspaper i hit the madison square park the first mornin after and was sitting around on the benches i noticed the sparrows chirpin and the grass and trees so nice and green that i thought i was back in the country again then i got some papers out of my pocket and i know i interrupted you sent it to the sun and got say said my friend suspiciously you seem to know a good deal where was you i went to sleep on the bench there in the sun and somebody touched me for every cent i had hearts and hands at denver there was an influx of passengers into the coaches on the eastbound b m express in one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler among the newcomers were two young men one of handsome presence with a bold frank countenance and manner the other a ruffled glum faced person heavily built and roughly dressed the two were handcuffed together as they passed down the aisle of the coach the only vacant seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman here the linked couple seated themselves the young woman s glance fell upon them with a distant swift disinterest then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks she held out a little gray gloved hand when she spoke her voice full sweet and deliberate proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard well mr easton if you will make me speak first i suppose i must don t vou ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the west the younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly and then clasped her fingers with his left hand it s miss fairchild he said with a smile i ll ask you to excuse the other hand it s otherwise engaged just at present he slightly raised his right hand bound at the wrist by the shining bracelet to the left one of his companion the glad look in the girl s eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror the glow faded from her cheeks her lips parted in a vague relaxing distress easton with a little laugh as if amused was about to speak again when the other forestalled him the glum faced man had been watching the girl s countenance with veiled glances from his keen shrewd eyes you ll excuse me for speaking miss but i see you re acquainted with the marshall here if you ll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen he ll do it and it ll make things easier for me there he s taking me to leavenworth prison it s seven years for counterfeiting oh said the girl with a deep breath and returning color so that is what you are doing out here a marshal my dear miss fairchild said easton calmly i had to do something money has a way of taking wings unto itself and you know it takes money to keep step with our crowd in washington i saw this opening in the west and well a marshalship isn t quite as high a position as that of ambassador but the ambassador said the girl warmly doesn t call any more he needn t ever have done so you ought to know that and so now you are one of these dashing western heroes and you ride and shoot and go into all kinds of dangers that s different from the washington life you have been missed from the old crowd the girl s eyes fascinated went back widening a little to rest upon the glittering handcuffs don t you worry about them miss said the other man all marshals handcuff themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away mr easton knows his business will we see you again soon in washington asked the girl not soon i think said easton my butterfly days are over i fear i love the west said the girl irrelevantly her eyes were shining softly she looked away out the car window she began to speak truly and simply without the gloss of style and manner mamma and i spent the summer in denver she went home a week ago because father was slightly ill i could live and be happy in the west i think the air here agrees with me money isn t everything but people always misunderstand things and remain stupid say mr marshal growled the glum faced man this isn t quite fair i m needing a drink and haven t had a smoke all day haven t you talked long enough take me in the smoker now won t you i m half dead for a pipe the bound travelers rose to their feet easton with the same slow smile on his face i can t deny a petition for tobacco he said lightly it s the one friend of the unfortunate good bye miss fairchild duty calls you know he held out his hand for a farewell it s too bad you are not going east she said reclothing herself with manner and style but you must go on to leavenworth i suppose yes said easton i must go on to leavenworth the two men sidled down the aisle into the smoker the two passengers in a seat near by had heard most of the conversation said one of them that marshal s a good sort of chap some of these western fellows are all right pretty young to hold an office like that isn t he asked the other young exclaimed the first speaker why oh didn t you catch on say did you ever know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to his right hand the cactus the most notable thing about time is that it is so purely relative a large amount of reminiscence is by common consent conceded to the drowning man and it is not past belief that one may review an entire courtship while removing one s gloves that is what trysdale was doing standing by a table in his bachelor apartments on the table stood a singular looking green plant in a red earthen jar the plant was one of the species of cacti and was provided with long tentacular leaves that perpetually swayed with the slightest breeze with a peculiar beckoning motion trysdale s friend the brother of the bride stood at a sideboard complaining at being allowed to drink alone both men were in evening dress white favors like stars upon their coats shone through the gloom of the apartment as he slowly unbuttoned his gloves there passed through trysdale s mind a swift scarifying retrospect of the last few hours it seemed that in his nostrils was still the scent of the flowers that had been banked in odorous masses about the church and in his ears the lowpitched hum of a thousand well bred voices the rustle of crisp garments and most insistently recurring the drawling words of the minister irrevocably binding her to another from this last hopeless point of view he still strove as if it had become a habit of his mind to reach some conjecture as to why and how he had lost her shaken rudely by the uncompromising fact he had suddenly found himself confronted by a thing he had never before faced his own innermost unmitigated arid unbedecked self he saw all the garbs of pretence and egoism that he had worn now turn to rags of folly he shuddered at the thought that to others before now the garments of his soul must have appeared sorry and threadbare vanity and conceit these were the joints in his armor and how free from either she had always been but why as she had slowly moved up the aisle toward the altar he had felt an unworthy sullen exultation that had served to support him he had told himself that her paleness was from thoughts of another than the man to whom she was about to give herself but even that poor consolation had been wrenched from him for when he saw that swift limpid upward look that she gave the man when he took her hand he knew himself to be forgotten once that same look had been raised to him and he had gauged its meaning indeed his conceit had crumbled its last prop was gone why had it ended thus there had been no quarrel between them nothing for the thousandth time he remarshalled in his mind the events of those last few days before the tide had so suddenly turned she had always insisted upon placing him upon a pedestal and he had accepted her homage with royal grandeur it had been a very sweet incense that she had burned before him so modest he told himself so childlike and worshipful and he would once have sworn so sincere she had invested him with an almost supernatural number of high attributes and excellencies and talents and he had absorbed the oblation as a desert drinks the rain that can coax from it no promise of blossom or fruit as trysdale grimly wrenched apart the seam of his last glove the crowning instance of his fatuous and tardily mourned egoism came vividly back to him the scene was the night when he had asked her to come up on his pedestal with him and share his greatness he could not now for the pain of it allow his mind to dwell upon the memory of her convincing beauty that night the careless wave of her hair the tenderness and virginal charm of her looks and words but they had been enough and they had brought him to speak during their conversation she had said and captain carruthers tells me that you speak the spanish language like a native why have you hidden this accomplishment from me is there anything you do not know now carruthers was an idiot no doubt he trysdale had been guilty he sometimes did such things of airing at the club some old canting castilian proverb dug from the hotchpotch at the back of dictionaries carruthers who was one of his incontinent admirers was the very man to have magnified this exhibition of doubtful erudition but alas the incense of her admiration had been so sweet and flattering he allowed the imputation to pass without denial without protest he allowed her to twine about his brow this spurious bay of spanish scholarship he let it grace his conquering head and among its soft convolutions he did not feel the prick of the thorn that was to pierce him later how glad how shy how tremulous she was how she fluttered like a snared bird when he laid his mightiness at her feet he could have sworn and he could swear now that unmistakable consent was in her eyes but coyly she would give him no direct answer i will send you my answer to morrow she said and he the indulgent confident victor smilingly granted the delay the next day he waited impatient in his rooms for the word at noon her groom came to the door and left the strange cactus in the red earthen jar there was no note no message merely a tag upon the plant bearing a barbarous foreign or botanical name he waited until night but her answer did not come his large pride and hurt vanity kept him from seeking her two evenings later they met at a dinner their greetings were conventional but she looked at him breathless wondering eager he was courteous adamant waiting her explanation with womanly swiftness she took her cue from his manner and turned to snow and ice thus and wider from this on they had drifted apart where was his fault who had been to blame humbled now he sought the answer amid the ruins of his self conceit if the voice of the other man in the room querulously intruding upon his thoughts aroused him i say trysdale what the deuce is the matter with you you look unhappy as if you yourself had been married instead of having acted merely as an accomplice look at me another accessory come two thousand miles on a garlicky cockroachy banana steamer all the way from south america to connive at the sacrifice please to observe how lightly my guilt rests upon my shoulders only little sister i had too and now she s gone come now take something to ease your conscience i don t drink just now thanks said trysdale your brandy resumed the other coming over and joining him is abominable run down to see me some time at punta redonda and try some of our stuff that old garcia smuggles in it s worth the trip hallo here s an old acquaintance wherever did you rake up this cactus trysdale a present said trysdale from a friend know the species very well it s a tropical concern see hundreds of em around punta every day here s the name on this tag tied to it know any spanish trysdale no said trysdale with the bitter wraith of a smile is it spanish yes the natives imagine the leaves are reaching out and beckoning to you they call it by this name ventomarme name means in english come and take me the detective detector i was walking in central park with avery knight the great new york burglar highwayman and murderer but my dear knight said i it sounds incredible you have undoubtedly performed some of the most wonderful feats in your profession known to modern crime you have committed some marvellous deeds under the very noses of the police you have boldly entered the homes of millionaires and held them up with an empty gun while you made free with their silver and jewels you have sandbagged citizens in the glare of broadway s electric lights you have killed and robbed with superb openness and absolute impunity but when you boast that within forty eight hours after committing a murder you can run down and actually bring me face to face with the detective assigned to apprehend you i must beg leave to express my doubts remember you are in new york avery knight smiled indulgently you pique my professional pride doctor he said in a nettled tone i will convince you about twelve yards in advance of us a prosperous looking citizen was rounding a clump of bushes where the walk curved knight suddenly drew a revolver and shot the man in the back his victim fell and lay without moving the great murderer went up to him leisurely and took from his clothes his money watch and a valuable ring and cravat pin he then rejoined me smiling calmly and we continued our walk ten steps and we met a policeman running toward the spot where the shot had been fired avery knight stopped him i have just killed a man he announced seriously and robbed him of his possessions g wan said the policeman angrily or i ll run yez in want yer name in the papers don t yez i never knew the cranks to come around so quick after a shootin before out of th park now for yours or i ll fan yez what you have done i said argumentatively as knight and i walked on was easy but when you come to the task of hunting down the detective that they send upon your trail you will find that you have undertaken a difficult feat perhaps so said knight lightly i will admit that my success depends in a degree upon the sort of man they start after me if it should be an ordinary plain clothes man i might fail to gain a sight of him if they honor me by giving the case to some one of their celebrated sleuths i do not fear to match my cunning and powers of induction against his on the next afternoon knight entered my office with a satisfied look on his keen countenance how goes the mysterious murder i asked as usual said knight smilingly i have put in the morning at the police station and at the inquest it seems that a card case of mine containing cards with my name and address was found near the body they have three witnesses who saw the shooting and gave a description of me the case has been placed in the hands of shamrock jolnes the famous detective he left headquarters at on the assignment i waited at my address until two thinking he might call there i laughed tauntingly you will never see jolnes i continued until this murder has been forgotten two or three weeks from now i had a better opinion of your shrewdness knight during the three hours and a half that you waited he has got out of your ken he is after you on true induction theories now and no wrongdoer has yet been known to come upon him while thus engaged i advise you to give it up doctor said knight with a sudden glint in his keen gray eye and a squaring of his chin in spite of the record your city holds of something like a dozen homicides without a subsequent meeting of the perpetrator and the sleuth in charge of the case i will undertake to break that record to morrow i will take you to shamrock jolnes i will unmask him before you and prove to you that it is not an impossibility for an officer of the law and a manslayer to stand face to face in your city do it said i and you ll have the sincere thanks of the police department on the next day knight called for me in a cab i ve been on one or two false scents doctor he admitted i know something of detectives methods and i followed out a few of them expecting to find jolnes at the other end the pistol being a caliber i thought surely i would find him at work on the clue in forty fifth street then again i looked for the detective at the columbia university as the man s being shot in the back naturally suggested hazing but i could not find a trace of him nor will you i said emphatically not by ordinary methods said knight i might walk up and down broadway for a month without success but you have aroused my pride doctor and if i fail to show you shamrock jolnes this day i promise you i will never kill or rob in your city again nonsense man i replied when our burglars walk into our houses and politely demand thousands of dollars worth of jewels and then dine and bang the piano an hour or two before leaving how do you a mere murderer expect to come in contact with the detective that is looking for you avery knight sat lost in thought for a while at length he looked up brightly doc said he i have it put on your hat and come with me in half an hour i guarantee that you shall stand in the presence of shamrock jolnes i entered a cab with avery knight i did not hear his instructions to the driver but the vehicle set out at a smart pace up broadway turning presently into fifth avenue and proceeding northward again it was with a rapidly beating heart that i accompanied this wonderful and gifted assassin whose analytical genius and superb self confidence had prompted him to make me the tremendous promise of bringing me into the presence of a murderer and the new york detective in pursuit of him simultaneously even yet i could not believe it possible are you sure that you are not being led into some trap i asked suppose that your clue whatever it is should bring us only into the presence of the commissioner of police and a couple of dozen cops my dear doctor said knight a little stiffly i would remind you that i am no gambler i beg your pardon said i but i do not think you will find jolnes the cab stopped before one of the handsomest residences on the avenue walking up and down in front of the house was a man with long red whiskers with a detective s badge showing on the lapel of his coat now and then the man would remove his whiskers to wipe his face and then i would recognize at once the well known features of the great new york detective jolnes was keeping a sharp watch upon the doors and windows of the house well doctor said knight unable to repress a note of triumph in his voice have you seen it is wonderful wonderful i could not help exclaiming as our cab started on its return trip but how did you do it by what process of induction my dear doctor interrupted the great murderer the inductive theory is what the detectives use my process is more modern i call it the saltatorial theory without bothering with the tedious mental phenomena necessary to the solution of a mystery from slight clues i jump at once to a conclusion i will explain to you the method i employed in this case in the first place i argued that as the crime was committed in new york city in broad daylight in a public place and under peculiarly atrocious circumstances and that as the most skilful sleuth available was let loose upon the case the perpetrator would never be discovered do you not think my postulation justified by precedent perhaps so i replied doggedly but if big bill dev stop that interrupted knight with a smile i ve heard that several times it s too late now i will proceed if homicides in new york went undiscovered i reasoned although the best detective talent was employed to ferret them out it must be true that the detectives went about their work in the wrong way and not only in the wrong way but exactly opposite from the right way that was my clue i slew the man in central park now let me describe myself to you i am tall with a black beard and i hate publicity i have no money to speak of i do not like oatmeal and it is the one ambition of my life to die rich i am of a cold and heartless disposition i do not care for my fellowmen and i never give a cent to beggars or charity now my dear doctor that is the true description of myself the man whom that shrewd detective was to hunt down you who are familiar with the history of crime in new york of late should be able to foretell the result when i promised you to exhibit to your incredulous gaze the sleuth who was set upon me you laughed at me because you said that detectives and murderers never met in new york i have demonstrated to you that the theory is possible but how did you do it i asked again it was very simple replied the distinguished murderer i assumed that the detective would go exactly opposite to the clues he had i have given you a description of myself therefore he must necessarily set to work and trail a short man with a white beard who likes to be in the papers who is very wealthy is fond of oatmeal wants to die poor and is of an extremely generous and philanthropic disposition when thus far is reached the mind hesitates no longer i conveyed you at once to the spot where shamrock jolnes was piping off andrew carnegie s residence knight said i you re a wonder if there was no danger of your reforming what a rounds man you d make for the nineteenth precinct the dog and the playlet this story has been rewritten and published in strictly business under the title the proof of the pudding usually it is a cold day in july when you can stroll up broadway in that month and get a story out of the drama i found one a few breathless parboiling days ago and it seems to decide a serious question in art there was not a soul left in the city except hollis and me and two or three million sunworshippers who remained at desks and counters the elect had fled to seashore lake and mountain and had already begun to draw for additional funds every evening hollis and i prowled about the deserted town searching for coolness in empty cafes dining rooms and roofgardens we knew to the tenth part of a revolution the speed of every electric fan in gotham and we followed the swiftest as they varied hollis s fiancee miss loris sherman had been in the adirondacks at lower saranac lake for a month in another week he would join her party there in the meantime he cursed the city cheerfully and optimistically and sought my society because i suffered him to show me her photograph during the black coffee every time we dined together my revenge was to read to him my one act play it was one insufferable evening when the overplus of the day s heat was being hurled quiveringly back to the heavens by every surcharged brick and stone and inch of iron in the panting town but with the cunning of the two legged beasts we had found an oasis where the hoofs of apollo s steed had not been allowed to strike our seats were on an ocean of cool polished oak the white linen of fifty deserted tables flapped like seagulls in the artificial breeze a mile away a waiter lingered for a heliographic signal we might have roared songs there or fought a duel without molestation out came miss loris s photo with the coffee and i once more praised the elegant poise of the neck the extremely low coiled mass of heavy hair and the eyes that followed one like those in an oil painting she s the greatest ever said hollis with enthusiasm good as great northern preferred and a disposition built like a watch one week more and i ll be happy jonny on the spot old tom tolliver my best college chum went up there two weeks ago he writes me that loris doesn t talk about anything but me oh i guess rip van winkle didn t have all the good luck yes yes said i hurriedly pulling out my typewritten play she s no doubt a charming girl now here s that little curtain raiser you promised to listen to ever been tried on the stage asked hollis not exactly i answered i read half of it the other day to a fellow whose brother knows robert edeson but he had to catch a train before i finished go on said hollis sliding back in his chair like a good fellow i m no stage carpenter but i ll tell you what i think of it from a first row balcony standpoint i m a theatre bug during the season and i can size up a fake play almost as quick as the gallery can flag the waiter once more and then go ahead as hard as you like with it i ll be the dog i read my little play lovingly and i fear not without some elocution there was one scene in it that i believed in greatly the comedy swiftly rises into thrilling and unexpectedly developed drama capt marchmont suddenly becomes cognizant that his wife is an unscrupulous adventuress who has deceived him from the day of their first meeting the rapid and mortal duel between them from that moment she with her magnificent lies and siren charm winding about him like a serpent trying to recover her lost ground he with his man s agony and scorn and lost faith trying to tear her from his heart that scene i always thought was a crackerjack when capt marchmont discovers her duplicity by reading on a blotter in a mirror the impression of a note that she has written to the count he raises his hand to heaven and exclaims o god who created woman while adam slept and gave her to him for a companion take back thy gift and return instead the sleep though it last forever rot said hollis rudely when i had given those lines with proper emphasis i beg your pardon i said as sweetly as i could come now went on hollis don t be an idiot you know very well that nobody spouts any stuff like that these days that sketch went along all right until you rang in the skyrockets cut out that right arm exercise and the adam and eve stunt and make your captain talk as you or i or bill jones would i ll admit said i earnestly for my theory was being touched upon that on all ordinary occasions all of us use commonplace language to convey our thoughts you will rememberthat up to the moment when the captain makes his terrible discovery all the characters on the stage talk pretty much as they would in real life but i believe that i am right in allowing him lines suitable to the strong and tragic situation into which he falls tragic my eye said my friend irreverently in shakespeare s day he might have sputtered out some high cockalorum nonsense of that sort because in those days they ordered ham and eggs in blank verse and discharged the cook with an epic but not for b way in the summer of it is my opinion said i that great human emotions shake up our vocabulary and leave the words best suited to express them on top a sudden violent grief or loss or disappointment will bring expressions out of an ordinary man as strong and solemn and dramatic as those used in fiction or on the stage to portray those emotions that s where you fellows are wrong said hollis plain every day talk is what goes your captain would very likely have kicked the cat lit a cigar stirred up a highball and telephoned for a lawyer instead of getting off those robert mantell pyrotechnics possibly a little later i continued but just at the time just as the blow is delivered if something scriptural or theatrical and deep tongued isn t wrung from a man in spite of his modern and practical way of speaking then i m wrong of course said hollis kindly you ve got to whoop her up some degrees for the stage the audience expects it when the villain kidnaps little effie you have to make her mother claw some chunks out of the atmosphere and scream me chee ild me chee ild what she would actually do would be to call up the police by phone ring for some strong tea and get the little darling s photo out ready for the reporters when you get your villain in a corner a stage corner it s all right for him to clap his hand to his forehead and hiss all is lost off the stage he would remark this is a conspiracy against me i refer you to my lawyers i get no consolation said i gloomily from your concession of an accentuated stage treatment in my play i fondly hoped that i was following life if people in real life meet great crises in a commonplace way they should do the same on the stage and then we drifted like two trout out of our cool pool in the great hotel and began to nibble languidly at the gay flies in the swift current of broadway and our question of dramatic art was unsettled we nibbled at the flies and avoided the hooks as wise trout do but soon the weariness of manhattan in summer overcame us nine stories up facing the south was hollis s apartment and we soon stepped into an elevator bound for that cooler haven i was familiar in those quarters and quickly my play was forgotten and i stood at a sideboard mixing things with cracked ice and glasses all about me a breeze from the bay came in the windows not altogether blighted by the asphalt furnace over which it had passed hollis whistling softly turned over a late arrived letter or two on his table and drew around the coolest wicker armchairs i was just measuring the vermouth carefully when i heard a sound some man s voice groaned hoarsely false oh god false and love is a lie and friendship but the byword of devils i looked around quickly hollis lay across the table with his head down upon his outstretched arms and then he looked up at me and laughed in his ordinary manner i knew him he was poking fun at me about my theory and it did seem so unnatural those swelling words during our quiet gossip that i half began to believe i had been mistaken that my theory was wrong hollis raised himself slowly from the table you were right about that theatrical business old man he said quietly as he tossed a note to me i read it loris had run away with tom tolliver a little talk about mobs i see remarked the tall gentleman in the frock coat and black slouch hat that another street car motorman in your city has narrowly excaped lynching at the hands of an infuriated mob by lighting a cigar and walking a couple of blocks down the street do you think they would have lynched him asked the new yorker in the next seat of the ferry station who was also waiting for the boat not until after the election said the tall man cutting a corner off his plug of tobacco i ve been in your city long enough to know something about your mobs the motorman s mob is about the least dangerous of them all except the national guard and the dressmakers convention you see when little willie goldstein is sent by his mother for pigs knuckles with a nickel tightly grasped in his chubby fist he always crosses the street car track safely twenty feet ahead of the car and then suddenly turns back to ask his inother whether it was pale ale or a spool of white cotton that she wanted the motorman yells and throws himself on the brakes like a football player there is a horrible grinding and then a ripping sound and a piercing shriek and willie is sitting with part of his trousers torn away by the fender screaming for his lost nickel in ten seconds the car is surrounded by infuriated citizens crying lynch the motorman lynch the motorman at the top of their voices some of them run to the nearest cigar store to get a rope but they find the last one has just been cut up and labelled hundreds of the excited mob press close to the cowering motorman whose hand is observed to tremble perceptibly as he transfers a stick of pepsin gum from his pocket to his mouth when the bloodthirsty mob of maddened citizens has closed in on the motorman some bringing camp stools and sitting quite close to him and all shouting lynch him policeman fogarty forces his way through them to the side of their prospective victim hello mike says the motorman in a low voice nice day shall i sneak off a block or so or would you like to rescue me well jerry if you don t mind says the policeman i d like to disperse the infuriated mob singlehanded i haven t defeated a lynching mob since last tuesday and that was a small one of only that wanted to string up a dago boy for selling wormy pears it would boost me some down at the station all right mike says the motorman anything to oblige i ll turn pale and tremble and he does so and policeman fogarty draws his club and says g wan wid yez and in eight seconds the desperate mob has scattered and gone about its business except about a hundred who remain to search for willie s nickel i never heard of a mob in our city doing violence to a motorman because of an accident said the new yorker you are not liable to said the tall man they know the motorman s all right and that he wouldn t even run over a stray dog if he could help it and they know that not a man among em would tie the knot to hang even a thomas cat that had been tried and condemned and sentenced according to law then why do they become infuriated and make threats of lynching asked the new yorker to assure the motorman answered the tall man that he is safe if they really wanted to do him up they would go into the houses and drop bricks on him from the third story windows new yorkers are not cowards said the other man a little stiffly not one at a time agreed the tall man promptly you ve got a fine lot of single handed scrappers in your town i d rather fight three of you than one and i d go up against all the gas trust s victims in a bunch before i d pass two citizens on a dark corner with my watch chain showing when you get rounded up in a bunch you lose your nerve get you in crowds and you re easy ask the l road guards and george b cortelyou and the tintype booths at coney island divided you stand united you fall e pluribus nihil whenever one of your mobs surrounds a man and begins to holler lynch him he says to himself oh dear i suppose i must look pale to please the boys but i will forsooth let my life insurance premium lapse to morrow this is a sure tip for me to play methuselah straight across the board in the next handicap i can imagine the tortured feelings of a prisoner in the hands of new york policemen when an infuriated mob demands that he be turned over to them for lynching for god s sake officers cries the distracted wretch have ye hearts of stone that ye will not let them wrest me from ye sorry jimmy says one of the policemen but it won t do there s three of us me and darrel and the plain clothes man and there s only sivin thousand of the mob how d we explain it at the office if they took ye jist chase the infuriated aggregation around the corner darrel and we ll be movin along to the station some of our gatherings of excited citizens have not been so harmless said the new yorker with a faint note of civic pride i ll admit that said the tall man a cousin of mine who was on a visit here once had an arm broken and lost an ear in one of them that must have been during the cooper union riots remarked the new yorker not the cooper union explained the tall man but it was a union riot at the vanastor wedding you seem to be in favor of lynch law said the new yorker severely no sir i am not no intelligent man is but sir there are certain cases when people rise in their just majesty and take a righteous vengeance for crimes that the law is slow in punishing i am an advocate of law and order but i will say to you that less than six months ago i myself assisted at the lynching of one of that race that is creating a wide chasm between your section of country and mine sir it is a deplorable condition said the new yorker that exists in the south but i am from indiana sir said the tall man taking another chew and i don t think you will condemn my course when i tell you that the colored man in question had stolen in cash sir from my own brother the snow man editorial note before the fatal illness of william sydney porter known through his literary work as o henry this american master of short story writing had begun for hampton s magazine the story printed below illness crept upon him rapidly and he was compelled to give up writing about at the point where the girl enters the story when he realized that he could do no more it was his lifelong habit to write with a pencil never dictating to a stenographer o henry told in detail the remainder of the snow man to harris merton lyon whom he had often spoken of as one of the most effective short story writers of the present time mr porter had delineated all of the characters leaving only the rounding out of the plot in the final pages to mr lyon housed and windowpaned from it the greatest wonder to little children is the snow to men it is something like a crucible in which their world melts into a white star ten million miles away the man who can stand the test is a snow man and this is his reading by fahrenheit reaumur or moses s carven tablets of stone night had fluttered a sable pinion above the canyon of big lost river and i urged my horse toward the bay horse ranch because the snow was deepening the flakes were as large as an hour s circular tatting by miss wilkins s ablest spinster betokening a heavy snowfall and less entertainment and more adventure than the completion of the tatting could promise i knew ross curtis of the bay horse and that i would be welcome as a snow bound pilgrim both for hospitality s sake and because ross had few chances to confide in living creatures who did not neigh bellow bleat yelp or howl during his discourse the ranch house was just within the jaws of the canyon where its builder may have fatuously fancied that the timbered and rocky walls on both sides would have protected it from the wintry colorado winds but i feared the drift even now through the endless bottomless rift in the hills the speaking tube of the four winds came roaring the voice of the proprietor to the little room on the top floor at my hello a ranch hand came from an outer building and received my thankful horse in another minute ross and i sat by a stove in the dining room of the four room ranch house while the big simple welcome of the household lay at my disposal fanned by the whizzing norther the fine dry snow was sifted and bolted through the cracks and knotholes of the logs the cook room without a separating door appended in there i could see a short sturdy leisurely and weather beaten man moving with professional sureness about his red hot stove his face was stolid and unreadable something like that of a great thinker or of one who had no thoughts to conceal i thought his eye seemed unwarrantably superior to the elements and to the man but quickly attributed that to the characteristic self importance of a petty chef camp cook was the niche that i gave him in the hall of types and he fitted it as an apple fits a dumpling cold it was in spite of the glowing stove and ross and i sat and talked shuddering frequently half from nerves and half from the freezing draughts so he brought the bottle and the cook brought boiling water and we made prodigious hot toddies against the attacks of boreas we clinked glasses often they sounded like icicles dropping from the eaves or like the tinkle of a thousand prisms on a louis xiv chandelier that i once heard at a boarder s dance in the parlor of a ten a week boarding house in gramercy square sic transit silence in the terrible beauty of the snow and of the sphinx and of the stars but they who believe that all things from a without wine table d hote to the crucifixion may be interpreted through music might have found a nocturne or a symphony to express the isolation of that blotted out world the clink of glass and bottle the aeolian chorus of the wind in the house crannies its deeper trombone through the canyon below and the wagnerian crash of the cook s pots and pans united in a fit discordant melody i thought no less welcome an accompaniment was the sizzling of broiling ham and venison cutlet indorsed by the solvent fumes of true java bringing rich promises of comfort to our yearning souls the cook brought the smoking supper to the table he nodded to me democratically as he cast the heavy plates around as though he were pitching quoits or hurling the discus i looked at him with some appraisement and curiosity and much conciliation there was no prophet to tell us when that drifting evil outside might cease to fall and it is well when snow bound to stand somewhere within the radius of the cook s favorable consideration but i could read neither favor nor disapproval in the face and manner of our pot wrestler he was about five feet nine inches and two hundred pounds of commonplace bull necked pink faced callous calm he wore brown duck trousers too tight and too short and a blue flannel shirt with sleeves rolled above his elbows there was a sort of grim steady scowl on his features that looked to me as though he had fixed it there purposely as a protection against the weakness of an inherent amiability that he fancied were better concealed and then i let supper usurp his brief occupancy of my thoughts draw up george said ross let s all eat while the grub s hot you fellows go on and chew answered the cook i ate mine in the kitchen before sun down think it ll be a big snow george asked the ranchman george had turned to reenter the cook room he moved slowly around and looking at his face it seemed to me that he was turning over the wisdom and knowledge of centuries in his head it might was his delayed reply at the door of the kitchen he stopped and looked back at us both ross and i held our knives and forks poised and gave him our regard some men have the power of drawing the attention of others without speaking a word their attitude is more effective than a shout and again it mightn t said george and went back to his stove after we had eaten he came in and gathered the emptied dishes he stood for a moment while his spurious frown deepened it might stop any minute he said or it might keep up for days at the farther end of the cook room i saw george pour hot water into his dishpan light his pipe and put the tableware through its required lavation he then carefully unwrapped from a piece of old saddle blanket a paperback book and settled himself to read by his dim oil lamp and then the ranchman threw tobacco on the cleared table and set forth again the bottles and glasses and i saw that i stood in a deep channel through which the long dammed flood of his discourse would soon be booming but i was half content comparing my fate with that of the late thomas tucker who had to sing for his supper thus doubling the burdens of both himself and his host snow is a hell of a thing said ross by way of a foreword it ain t somehow it seems to me salubrious i can stand water and mud and two inches below zero and a hundred and ten in the shade and medium sized cyclones but this here fuzzy white stuff naturally gets me all locoed i reckon the reason it rattles you is because it changes the look of things so much it s like you had a wife and left her in the morning with the same old blue cotton wrapper on and rides in of a night and runs across her all outfitted in a white silk evening frock waving an ostrich feather fan and monkeying with a posy of lily flowers wouldn t it make you look for your pocket compass you d be liable to kiss her before you collected your presence of mind by and by the flood of ross s talk was drawn up into the clouds so it pleased me to fancy and there condensed into the finer snowflakes of thought and we sat silent about the stove as good friends and bitter enemies will do i thought of boss s preamble about the mysterious influence upon man exerted by that ermine lined monster that now covered our little world and knew he was right of all the curious knickknacks mysteries puzzles indian gifts rat traps and well disguised blessings that the gods chuck down to us from the olympian peaks the most disquieting and evil bringing is the snow by scientific analysis it is absolute beauty and purity so at the beginning we look doubtfully at chemistry it falls upon the world and lo we live in another it hides in a night the old scars and familiar places with which we have grown heart sick or enamored so as quietly as we can we hustle on our embroidered robes and hie us on prince camaralzaman s horse or in the reindeer sleigh into the white country where the seven colors converge this is when our fancy can overcome the bane of it but in certain spots of the earth comes the snow madness made known by people turned wild and distracted by the bewildering veil that has obscured the only world they know in the cities the white fairy who sets the brains of her dupes whirling by a wave of her wand is cast for the comedy role her diamond shoe buckles glitter like frost with a pirouette she invites the spotless carnival but in the waste places the snow is sardonic sponging out the world of the outliers it gives no foothold on another sphere in return it makes of the earth a firmament under foot it leaves us clawing and stumbling in space in an inimical fifth element whose evil outdoes its strangeness and beauty there nature low comedienne plays her tricks on man though she has put him forth as her highest product it appears that she has fashioned him with what seems almost incredible carelessness and indexterity one sided and without balance with his two halves unequally fashioned and joined must he ever jog his eccentric way the snow falls the darkness caps it and the ridiculous man biped strays in accurate circles until he succumbs in the ruins of his defective architecture in the throat of the thirsty the snow is vitriol in appearance as plausible as the breakfast food of the angels it is as hot in the mouth as ginger increasing the pangs of the water famished it is a derivative from water air and some cold uncanny fire from which the caloric has been extracted good has been said of it even the poets crazed by its spell and shivering in their attics under its touch have indited permanent melodies commemorative of its beauty still to the saddest overcoated optimist it is a plague a corroding plague that pharaoh successfully side stepped it beneficently covers the wheat fields swelling the crop and the flour trust gets us by the throat like a sudden quinsy it spreads the tail of its white kirtle over the red seams of the rugged north and the alaskan short story is born etiolated perfidy it shelters the mountain traveler burrowing from the icy air and melting to morrow drowns his brother in the valley below at its worst it is lock and key and crucible and the wand of circe when it corrals man in lonely ranches mountain cabins and forest huts the snow makes apes and tigers of the hardiest it turns the bosoms of weaker ones to glass their tongues to infants rattles their hearts to lawlessness and spleen it is not all from the isolation the snow is not merely a blockader it is a chemical test it is a good man who can show a reaction that is not chiefly composed of a drachm or two of potash and magnesia with traces of adam ananias nebuchadnezzar and the fretful porcupine this is no story you say well let it begin there was a knock at the door is the opening not full of context and reminiscence oh best buyers of best sellers we drew the latch and in stumbled etienne girod as he afterward named himself but just then he was no more than a worm struggling for life enveloped in a killing white chrysalis we dug down through snow overcoats mufflers and waterproofs and dragged forth a living thing with a van dyck beard and marvellous diamond rings we put it through the approved curriculum of snow rubbing hot milk and teaspoonful doses of whiskey working him up to a graduating class entitled to a diploma of three fingers of rye in half a glassful of hot water one of the ranch boys had already come from the quarters at ross s bugle like yell and kicked the stranger s staggering pony to some sheltered corral where beasts were entertained let a paragraphic biography of girod intervene etienne was an opera singer originally we gathered but adversity and the snow had made him non compos vocis the adversity consisted of the stranded san salvador opera company a period of hotel second story work and then a career as a professional palmist jumping from town to town for like other professional palmists every time he worked the heart line too strongly he immediately moved along the line of least resistance though etienne did not confide this to us we surmised that he had moved out into the dusk about twenty minutes ahead of a constable and had thus encountered the snow in his most sacred blue language he dilated upon the subject of snow for etienne was paris born and loved the snow with the same passion that an orchid does mee ser rhable commented etienne and took another three fingers complete cast iron pussy footed blank blank said ross and followed suit rotten said i the cook said nothing he stood in the door weighing our outburst and insistently from behind that frozen visage i got two messages via the m a m wireless one was that george considered our vituperation against the snow childish the other was that george did not love dagoes inasmuch as etienne was a frenchman i concluded i had the message wrong so i queried the other bright eyes you don t really mean dagoes do you and over the wireless came three deathly psychic taps yes then i reflected that to george all foreigners were probably dagoes i had once known another camp cook who had thought mons sig and millie trans mississippi for mlle were italian given names this cook used to marvel therefore at the paucity of neo roman precognomens and therefore why not i have said that snow is a test of men for one day two days etienne stood at the window fletcherizing his finger nails and shrieking and moaning at the monotony to me etienne was just about as unbearable as the snow and so seeking relief i went out on the second day to look at my horse slipped on a stone broke my collarbone and thereafter underwent not the snow test but the test of flat on the back a test that comes once too often for any man to stand however i bore up cheerfully i was now merely a spectator and from my couch in the big room i could lie and watch the human interplay with that detached impassive impersonal feeling which french writers tell us is so valuable to the litterateur and american writers to the faro dealer i shall go crazy in this abominable mee ser rhable place was etienne s constant prediction never knew mark twain to bore me before said ross over and over he sat by the other window hour after hour a box of pittsburg stogies of the length strength and odor of a pittsburg graft scandal deposited on one side of him and roughing it the jumping frog and life on the mississippi on the other for every chapter he lit a new stogy puffing furiously this in time gave him a recurrent premonition of cramps gastritis smoker s colic or whatever it is they have in pittsburg after a too deep indulgence in graft scandals to fend off the colic ross resorted time and again to old doctor still s amber colored u s a colic cure result after forty eight hours nerves positive fact i never knew mark twain to make me tired before positive fact ross slammed roughing it on the floor when you re snowbound this away you want tragedy i guess humor just seems to bring out all your cussedness you read a man s poor pitiful attempts to be funny and it makes you so nervous you want to tear the book up get out your bandana and have a good long cry at the other end of the room the frenchman took his finger nails out of his mouth long enough to exclaim humor humor at such a time as thees my god i shall go crazy in thees abominable supper announced george these meals were not the meals of rabelais who said the great god makes the planets and we make the platters neat by that time the ranch house meals were not affairs of gusto they were mental distraction not bodily provender what they were to be later shall never be forgotten by ross or me or etienne after supper the stogies and finger nails began again my shoulder ached wretchedly and with half closed eyes i tried to forget it by watching the deft movements of the stolid cook suddenly i saw him cock his ear like a dog then with a swift step he moved to the door threw it open and stood there the rest of us had heard nothing what is it george asked ross the cook reached out his hand into the darkness alongside the jamb with careful precision he prodded something then he made one careful step into the snow his back muscles bulged a little under the arms as he stooped and lightly lifted a burden another step inside the door which he shut methodically behind him and he dumped the burden at a safe distance from the fire he stood up and fixed us with a solemn eye none of us moved under that orphic suspense until a woman remarked george miss willie adams was her name vocation school teacher present avocation getting lost in the snow age yum yum the persian for twenty take to the woods if you would describe miss adams a willow for grace a hickory for fibre a birch for the clear whiteness of her skin for eyes the blue sky seen through treetops the silk in cocoons for her hair her voice the murmur of the evening june wind in the leaves her mouth the berries of the wintergreen fingers as light as ferns her toe as small as a deer track general impression upon the dazed beholder you could not see the forest for the trees psychology with a capital p and the foot of a lynx at this juncture stalks into the ranch house three men a cook a pretty young woman all snowbound count me out of it as i did not count anyway i never did with women count the cook out if you like but note the effect upon ross and etienne girod ross dumped mark twain in a trunk and locked the trunk also he discarded the pittsburg scandals also he shaved off a three days beard etienne being french began on the beard first he pomaded it from a little tube of grease hongroise in his vest pocket he combed it with a little aluminum comb from the same vest pocket he trimmed it with manicure scissors from the same vest pocket his light and gallic spirits underwent a sudden miraculous change he hummed a blithe san salvador opera company tune he grinned smirked bowed pirouetted twiddled twaddled twisted and tooralooed gayly the notorious troubadour could not have equalled etienne ross s method of advance was brusque domineering little woman he said you re welcome here and with what he thought subtle double meaning welcome to stay here as long as you like snow or no snow miss adams thanked him a little wildly some of the wintergreen berries creeping into the birch bark she looked around hurriedly as if seeking escape but there was none save the kitchen and the room allotted her she made an excuse and disappeared into her own room later i feigning sleep heard the following mees adams i was almost to perislh die of monotony w en your fair and beautiful face appear in thees mee ser rhable house i opened my starboard eye the beard was being curled furiously around a finger the svengali eye was rolling the chair was being hunched closer to the school teacher s i am french you see temperamental nervous i cannot endure thees dull hours in thees ranch house but a woman comes ah the shoulders gave nine rahs and a tiger what a difference all is light and gay ever ting smile w en you smile you have eart beauty grace my eart comes back to me w en i feel your eart so he laid his hand upon his vest pocket from this vantage point he suddenly snatched at the school teacher s own hand ah mees adams if i could only tell you how i ad dinner remarked george he was standing just behind the frenchman s ear his eyes looked straight into the school teacher s eyes after thirty seconds of survey his lips moved deep in the flinty frozen maelstrom of his face dinner he concluded will be ready in two minutes miss adams jumped to her feet relieved i must get ready for dinner she said brightly and went into her room ross came in fifteen minutes late after the dishes had been cleaned away i waited until a propitious time when the room was temporarily ours alone and told him what had happened he became so excited that he lit a stogy without thinking yeller hided unwashed palm readin skunk he said under his breath i ll shoot him full o holes if he don t watch out talkin that way to my wife i gave a jump that set my collarbone back another week your wife i gasped well i mean to make her that he announced the air in the ranch house the rest of that day was tense with pent up emotions oh best buyers of best sellers ross watched miss adams as a hawk does a hen he watched etienne as a hawk does a scarecrow etienne watched miss adams as a weasel does a henhouse he paid no attention to ross the condition of miss adams in the role of sought after was feverish lately escaped from the agony and long torture of the white cold where for hours nature had kept the little school teacher s vision locked in and turned upon herself nobody knows through what profound feminine introspections she had gone now suddenly cast among men instead of finding relief and security she beheld herself plunged anew into other discomforts even in her own room she could hear the loud voices of her imposed suitors i ll blow you full o holes shouted ross witnesses shrieked etienne waving his hand at the cook and me she could not have known the previous harassed condition of the men fretting under indoor conditions all she knew was that where she had expected the frank freemasonry of the west she found the subtle tangle of two men s minds bent upon exacting whatever romance there might be in her situation she tried to dodge ross and the frenchman by spells of nursing me they also came over to help nurse this combination aroused such a natural state of invalid cussedness on my part that they were all forced to retire once she did manage to whisper i am so worried here i don t know what to do to which i replied gently hitching up my shoulder that i was a hunch savant and that the eighth house under this sign the moon being in virgo showed that everything would turn out all right but twenty minutes later i saw etienne reading her palm and felt that perhaps i might have to recast her horoscope and try for a dark man coming with a bundle toward sunset etienne left the house for a few moments and ross who had been sitting taciturn and morose having unlocked mark twain made another dash it was typical ross talk he stood in front of her and looked down majestically at that cool and perfect spot where miss adams forehead met the neat part in her fragrant hair first however he cast a desperate glance at me i was in a profound slumber little woman he began it s certainly tough for a man like me to see you bothered this way you gulp you have been alone in this world too long you need a protector i might say that at a time like this you need a protector the worst kind a protector who would take a three ring delight in smashing the saffron colored kisser off of any yeller skinned skunk that made himself obnoxious to you hem hem i am a lonely man miss adams i have so far had to carry on my life without the gulp sweet radiance gulp of a woman around the house i feel especially doggoned lonely at a time like this when i am pretty near locoed from havin to stall indoors and hence it was with delight i welcomed your first appearance in this here shack since then i have been packed jam full of more different kinds of feelings ornery mean dizzy and superb than has fallen my way in years miss adams made a useless movement toward escape the ross chin stuck firm i don t want to annoy you miss adams but by heck if it comes to that you ll have to be annoyed and i ll have to have my say this palm ticklin slob of a frenchman ought to be kicked off the place and if you ll say the word off he goes but i don t want to do the wrong thing you ve got to show a preference i m gettin around to the point miss miss willie in my own brick fashion i ve stood about all i can stand these last two days and somethin s got to happen the suspense hereabouts is enough to hang a sheepherder miss willie he lassooed her hand by main force just say the word you need somebody to take your part all your life long will you mar supper remarked george tersely from the kitchen door miss adams hurried away ross turned angrily you i have been revolving it in my head said george he brought the coffee pot forward heavily then bravely the big platter of pork and beans then somberly the potatoes then profoundly the biscuits i have been revolving it in my mind there ain t no use waitin any longer for swengalley might as well eat now from my excellent vantage point on the couch i watched the progress of that meal ross muddled glowering disappointed etienne eternally blandishing attentive ogling miss adams nervous picking at her food hesitant about answering questions almost hysterical now and then the solid flitting shadow of the cook passing behind their backs like a dreadnaught in a fog i used to own a clock which gurgled in its throat three minutes before it struck the hour i know therefore the slow freight of anticipation for i have awakened at three in the morning heard the clock gurgle and waited those three minutes for the three strokes i knew were to come alors in ross s ranch house that night the slow freight of climax whistled in the distance etienne began it after supper miss aclams had suddenly displayed a lively interest in the kitchen layout and i could see her in there chatting brightly at george not with him the while he ducked his head and rattled his pans my fren said etienne exhaling a large cloud from his cigarette and patting ross lightly on the shoulder with a bediamonded hand which hung limp from a yard or more of bony arm i see i mus be frank with you firs because we are rivals second because you take these matters so serious i i am frenchman i love the women he threw back his curls bared his yellow teeth and blew an unsavory kiss toward the kitchen it is i suppose a trait of my nation all frenchmen love the women pretty women now look here i am he spread out his arms cold outside i detes the col l l snow i abominate the mees ser rhable snow two men this pointing to me an this pointing to ross i am distracted for two whole days i stan at the window an tear my air i am nervous upset pr r ro foun ly distress inside my ead an suddenly be old a woman a nice pretty charming innocen young woman i naturally rejoice i become myself again gay light earted appy i address myself to mademoiselle it passes the time that m sieu is wot the women are for pass the time entertainment like the music like the wine they appeal to the mood the caprice the temperamen to play with thees woman follow her through her humor pursue her ah that is the mos delightful way to sen the hours about their business ross banged the table shut up you miserable yeller pup he roared i object to your pursuin anything or anybody in my house now you listen to me you he picked up the box of stogies and used it on the table as an emphasizer the noise of it awoke the attention of the girl in the kitchen unheeded she crept into the room i don t know anything about your french ways of lovemakin an i don t care in my section of the country it s the best man wins and i m the best man here and don t you forget it this girl s goin to be mine there ain t g oing to be any playing or philandering or palm reading about it i ve made up my mind i ll have this girl and that settles it my word is the law in this neck o the woods she s mine and as soon as she says she s mine you pull out the box made one final tremendous punctuation point etienne s bravado was unruffled ah that is no way to win a woman he smiled easily i make prophecy you will never win er that way no not thees woman she mus be played along an then keessed this charming delicious little creature one kees an then you ave her again he displayed his unpleasant teeth i make you a bet i will kees her as a cheerful chronicler of deeds done well it joys me to relate that the hand which fell upon etienne s amorous lips was not his own there was one sudden sound as of a mule kicking a lath fence and then through the swinging doors of oblivion for etienne i had seen this blow delivered it was an aloof unstudied almost absent minded affair i had thought the cook was rehearsing the proper method of turning a flapjack silently lost in thought he stood there scratching his head then he began rolling down his sleeves you d better get your things on miss and we ll get out of here he decided wrap up warm i heard her heave a little sigh of relief as she went to get her cloak sweater and hat ross jumped to his feet and said george what are you goin to do george who had been headed in my direction slowly swivelled around and faced his employer bein a camp cook i ain t over burdened with hosses george enlightened us therefore i am going to try to borrow this feller s here for the first time in four days my soul gave a genuine cheer if it s for lochinvar purposes go as far as you like i said grandly the cook studied me a moment as if trying to find an insult in my words no he replied it s for mine and the young lady s purposes and we ll go only three miles to hicksville now let me tell you somethin ross suddenly i was confronted with the cook s chunky back and i heard a low curt carrying voice shoot through the room at my host george had wheeled just as ross started to speak you re nutty that s what s the matter with you you can t stand the snow you re getting nervouser and nuttier every day that and this dago he jerked a thumb at the half dead frenchman in the corner has got you to the point where i thought i better horn in i got to revolving it around in my mind and i seen if somethin wasn t done and done soon there d be murder around here and maybe his head gave an imperceptible list toward the girl s room worse he stopped but he held up a stubby finger to keep any one else from speaking then he plowed slowly through the drift of his ideas about this here woman i know you ross and i know what you reely think about women if she hadn t happened in here durin this here snow you d never have given two thoughts to the whole woman question likewise when the storm clears and you and the boys go hustlin out this here whole business ll clear out of your head and you won t think of a skirt again until kingdom come just because o this snow here don t forget you re living in the selfsame world you was in four days ago and you re the same man too now what s the use o getting all snarled up over four days of stickin in the house that there s what i been revolvin in my mind and this here s the decision i ve come to he plodded to the door and shouted to one of the ranch hands to saddle my horse ross lit a stogy and stood thoughtful in the middle of the room then he began i ve a durn good notion george to knock your confounded head off and throw you into that snowbank if you re wrong mister that ain t a durned good notion you ve got it s durned bad look here he pointed steadily out of doors until we were both forced to follow his finger you re in here for more n a week yet after allowing this fact to sink in he barked out at ross can you cook then at me can you cook then he looked at the wreck of etienne and sniffed there was an embarrassing silence as ross and i thought solemnly of a foodless week if you just use hoss sense concluded george and don t go for to hurt my feelin s all i want to do is to take this young gal down to hicksville and then i ll head back here and cook fer you the horse and miss adams arrived simultaneously both of them very serious and quiet the horse because he knew what he had before him in that weather the girl because of what she had left behind then all at once i awoke to a realization of what the cook was doing my god man i cried aren t you afraid to go out in that snow behind my back i heard ross mutter not him george lifted the girl daintily up behind the saddle drew on his gloves put his foot in the stirrup and turned to inspect me leisurely as i passed slowly in his review i saw in my mind s eye the algebraic equation of snow the equals sign and the answer in the man before me snow is my last name said george he swung into the saddle and they started cautiously out into the darkening swirl of fresh new currency just issuing from the snowdrop mint the girl to keep her place clung happily to the sturdy figure of the camp cook i brought three things away from ross curtis s ranch house yes four one was the appreciation of snow which i have so humbly tried here to render was a collarbone of which i am extra careful was a memory of what it is to eat very extremely bad food for a week and was the cause of a little note delivered at the end of the week and hand painted in blue pencil on a sheet of meat paper i cannot come back there to that there job mrs snow say no george i been revolvin it in my mind considerin circumstances she s right whirligigs the world and the door a favourite dodge to get your story read by the public is to assert that it is true and then add that truth is stranger than fiction i do not know if the yarn i am anxious for you to read is true but the spanish purser of the fruit steamer el carrero swore to me by the shrine of santa guadalupe that he had the facts from the u s vice consul at la paz a person who could not possibly have been cognizant of half of them as for the adage quoted above i take pleasure in punc turing it by affirming that i read in a purely fictional story the other day the line be it so said the police man nothing so strange has yet cropped out in truth when h ferguson hedges millionaire promoter investor and man about new york turned his thoughts upon matters convivial and word of it went down the line bouncers took a precautionary turn at the indian clubs waiters put ironstone china on his favourite tables cab drivers crowded close to the curbstone in front of all night caf s and careful cashiers in his regular haunts charged up a few bottles to his account by way of preface and introduction as a money power a one millionaire is of small account in a city where the man who cuts your slice of beef behind the free lunch counter rides to work in his own automobile but hedges spent his money as lavishly loudly and showily as though he were only a clerk squandering a week s wages and after all the bartender takes no interest in your reserve fund he would rather look you up on his cash register than in bradstreet on the evening that the material allegation of facts begins hedges was bidding dull care begone in the com pany of five or six good fellows acquaintances and friends who had gathered in his wake among them were two younger men ralph merriam a broker and wade his friend two deep sea cabmen were chartered at columbus circle they hove to long enough to revile the statue of the great navigator unpatriotically rebuking him for having voyaged in search of land instead of liquids midnight overtook the party marooned in the rear of a cheap caf far uptown hedges was arrogant overriding and quarrelsome he was burly and tough iron gray but vigorous good for the rest of the night there was a dispute about nothing that matters and the five fingered words were passed the words that represent the glove cast into the lists merriam played the r le of the verbal hotspur hedges rose quickly seized his chair swung it once and smashed wildly dowp at merriam s head merriam dodged drew a small revolver and shot hedges in the chest the leading roysterer stumbled fell in a wry heap and lay still wade a commuter had formed that habit of prompt ness he juggled merriam out a side door walked him to the corner ran him a block and caught a hansom they rode five minutes and then got out on a dark corner and dismissed the cab across the street the lights of a small saloon betrayed its hectic hospitality go in the back room of that saloon said wade and wait i ll go find out what s doing and let you know you may take two drinks while i am gone no more at ten minutes to one o clock wade returned brace up old chap he said the ambulance got there just as i did the doctor says he s dead you may have one more drink you let me run this thing for you you ve got to skip i don t believe a chair is legally a deadly weapon you ve got to make tracks that s all there is to it merriam complained of the cold querulously and asked for another drink did you notice what big veins he had on the back of his hands he said i never could stand i never could take one more said wade and then come on i ll see you through wade kept his promise so well that at eleven o clock the next morning merriam with a new suit case full of new clothes and hair brushes stepped quietly on board a little ton fruit steamer at an east river pier the vessel had brought the season s first cargo of limes from port limon and was homeward bound merriam had his bank balance of in his pocket in large bills and brief instructions to pile up as much water as he could between himself and new york there was no time for anything more from port limon merriam worked down the coast by schooner and sloop to colon thence across the isthmus to panama where he caught a tramp bound for callao and such intermediate ports as might tempt the discursive skipper from his course it was at la paz that merriam decided to land la paz the beautiful a little harbourless town smothered in a living green ribbon that banded the foot of a cloud piercing mountain here the little steamer stopped to tread water while the captain s dory took him ashore that he might feel the pulse of the cocoanut market merriam went too with his suit case and remained kalb the vice consul a gr co armenian citizen of the united states born in hessen darmstadt and edu cated in cincinnati ward primaries considered all ameri cans his brothers and bankers he attached himself to merriam s elbow introduced him to every one in la paz who wore shoes borrowed ten dollars and went back to his hammock there was a little wooden hotel in the edge of a banana grove facing the sea that catered to the tastes of the few foreigners that had dropped out of the world into the t ri qte peruvian town at kalb s introductory shake hands with he had obediently exchanged manual salutations with a german doctor one french and two italian merchants and three or four americans who were spoken of as gold men rubber men mahogany men anything but men of living tissue after dinner merriam sat in a corner of the broad front galeria with bibb a vermonter interested in hydraulic mining and smoked and drank scotch smoke the moonlit sea spreading infinitely before him seemed to separate him beyond all apprehension from his old life the horrid tragedy in which he had played such a disas trous part now began for the first time since he stole on board the fruiter a wretched fugitive to lose its sharper outlines distance lent assuagement to his view bibb had opened the flood gates of a stream of long dammed discourse overjoyed to have captured an audience that had not suffered under a hundred repetitions of his views and theories one year more said bibb and i ll go back to god s country oh i know it s pretty here and you get dolce far niente banded to you in chunks but this country wasn t made for a white man to live in you ve got to have to plug through snow now and then and see a game of baseball and wear a stiff collar and have a policeman cuss you still la paz is a good sort of a pipe dreamy old hole and mrs conant is here when any of us feels particularly like jumping into the sea we rush around to her house and propose it s nicer to be rejected by mrs conant than it is to be drowned and they say drowning is a delightful sensation many like her here asked merriam not anywhere said bibb with a comfortable sigh she s the only white woman in la paz the rest range from a dappled dun to the colour of a b flat piano key she s been here a year comes from well you know how a woman can talk ask em to say string and they ll say crow s foot or cat s cradle some times you d think she was from oshkosh and again from jacksonville florida and the next day from cape cod mystery ventured merriam m well she looks it but her talk s translucent enough but that s a woman i suppose if the sphinx were to begin talking she d merely say goodness me more visitors coming for dinner and nothing to eat but the sand which is here but you won t think about that when you meet her merriam you ll propose to her too to make a hard story soft merriam did meet her and propose to her he found her to be a woman in black with hair the colour of a bronze turkey s wings and mysterious remembering eyes that well that looked as if she might have been a trained nurse looking on when eve was created her words and manner though were translucent as bibb had said she spoke vaguely of friends in california and some of the lower parishes in louisiana the tropical climate and indolent life suited her she had thought of buying an orange grove later on la paz all in all charmed her merriam s courtship of the sphinx lasted three months although be did not know that he was courting her he was using her as an antidote for remorse until he found too late that he had acquired the habit during that time he had received no news from home wade did not know where he was and he was not sure of wade s exact address and was afraid to write he thought he had better let matters rest as they were for a while one afternoon he and mrs conant hired two ponies and rode out along the mountain trail as far as the little cold river that came tumbling down the foothills there they stopped for a drink and merriam spoke his piece he proposed as bibb had prophesied mrs conant gave him one glance of brilliant tenderness and then her face took on such a strange haggard look that merriam was shaken out of his intoxication and back to his senses i beg your pardon florence he said releasing her hand but i ll have to hedge on part of what i said i can t ask you to marry me of course i killed a man in new york a man who was my friend shot him down in quite a cowardly manner i understand of course the drinking didn t excuse it well i couldn t resist having my say and i ll always mean it i m here as a fugitive from justice and i suppose that ends our acquaintance mrs conant plucked little leaves assiduously from the low hanging branch of a lime tree i suppose so she said in low and oddly uneven tones but that depends upon you i ll be as honest as you were i poisoned my husband i am a self made widow a man cannot love a murderess so i suppose that ends our acquaintance she looked up at him slowly his face turned a little pale and he stared at her blankly like a deaf and dumb man who was wondering what it was all about she took a swift step toward him with stiffened arms and eyes blazing don t look at me like that she cried as though she were in acute pain curse me or turn your back on me but don t look that way am i a woman to be beaten if i could show you here on my arms and on my back are scars and it has been more than a year scars that he made in his brutal rages a holy nun would have risen and struck the fiend down yes i killed him the foul and horrible words that he hurled at me that last day are repeated in my ears every night when i sleep and then came his blows and the end of my endurance i got the poison that afternoon it was his custom to drink every night in the library before going to bed a hot punch made of rum and wine only from my fair hands would he receive it because he knew the fumes of spirits always sickened me that night when the maid brought it to me i sent her downstairs on an errand before taking him his drink i went to my little private cabinet and poured into it more than a tea spoonful of tincture of aconite enough to kill three men so i had learned i had drawn that i had in bank and with that and a few things in a satchel i left the house without any one seeing me as i passed the library i heard him stagger up and fall heavily on a couch i took a night train for new

don t care what you ve done if the world ralph she interrupted almost with a scream be my world her eyes melted she relaxed magnificentlv and swayed toward merriam so suddenly that he had to jump to

lilac with envy they were both very happy according to the strange mathematics of the god of mutual affinity the shadows that clouded their pasts when united became only half as dense instead of darker they shut the world out and bolted the doors each was the other s world mrs conant lived again the remembering look left her eyes merriam was with her every moment that was possible on a little plateau under a grove of palms and calabash trees they were going to build a fairy bungalow they were to be married in two months many hours of the day they had their heads together over the house plans their joint capital would set up a business in fruit or woods that would yield a comfortable support good night my world would say mrs conant every evening when merriam left her for his hotel they were very happy their love had circumstantially that element of melancholy in it that it seems to require to attain its supremest elevation and it seemed that their mutual great misfortune or sin

a boat came bobbing shoreward merriam strolled down on the beach to look on in the shallow water the carib sailors sprang out and dragged the boat with a mighty rush to the firm shingle out climbed the purser the captain and two passengers ploughing their way through the deep sand toward the hotel merriam glanced toward them with the mild interest due to strangers there was something familiar to him in the walk of one of the pas sengers he looked again and his blood seemed to turn to strawberry ice cream in his veins burly arrogant debonair as ever h ferguson hedges the man he had killed was coming toward him ten feet away when hedges saw merriam his face flushed a dark red then he shouted in his old bluff way hello merriam glad to see you didn t expect to find you out here quinby this is

stopping places thus do the beneficent voyagers scatter news and enter tainment among the prisoners of sea and mountains tio pancho the hotel proprietor set his great silver rimmed aiteojos upon his nose and divided the papers into a number of smaller rolls a barefooted muchacho dashed in desiring the post of messenger bien venido said tio pancho this to se ora conant that to el doctor s s schlegel dios what a name to say that to se or davis one for don alberto these two for the casa de huespedes numero en la calle de las buenas gracias and say to them all muchacho that the pajaro sails for panama at three this afternoon if any have letters to send by the post let them come quickly that they may first pass through the correo mrs conant received her roll of newspapers at four o clock the boy was late in delivering them because he had been deflected from his duty by an iguana that crossed his path and to which he immediately gave chase but it made no hardship for she had no letters to send she was idling in a hammock in the patio of the house that she occupied half awake half happily dreaming of the paradise that she and merriam had created out of the wrecks of their pasts she was content now for the horizon of that shimmering sea to be the horizon of her life they had shut out the world and closed the door merriam was coming to her house at seven after his dinner at the hotel she would put on a white dress and an apricot coloured lace mantilla and they would walk an hour under the cocoanut palms by the lagoon she smiled contentedly and chose a paper at random from the roll the boy had brought at first the words of a certain headline of a sunday newspaper meant nothing to her they conveyed only a visualized sense of familiarity the largest type ran thus lloyd b conant secures divorce and then the subheadings well known saint louis paint manufacturer wins suit pleading one year s absence of wife her mysterious disappearance recalled nothing has been heard of her since twisting herself quickly out of the hammock mrs conant s eye soon traversed the half column of the recall it ended thus it will be remembered that mrs conant disappeared one evening in march of last year it was freely rumoured that her marriage with lloyd b conant resulted in much unhappiness stories were not wanting to the effect that his cruelty toward his wife had more than once taken the form of physical abuse after her departure a full bottle of tincture of aconite a deadly poison was found in a small medicine cabinet in her bedroom this might have been an indication that she meditated suicide it is supposed abandoned such an intention if she possessed it and left her home instead mrs conant slowly dropped the paper and sat on a chair clasping her hands tightly let me think o god let me think she whis pered i took the bottle with me i threw it out of the window of the train i there was another bottle in the cabinet there were two side by side the aconite and the valerian that i took when i could not sleep if they found the aconite bottle full why but he is alive of course i gave him only a harmless dose of valerian i am not a murderess in fact ralph i god don t let this be a dream she went into the part of the house that she rented from the old peruvian man and his wife shut the door and walked up and down her room swiftly and feverishly for half an hour merriam s photograph stood in a frame on a table she picked it up looked at it with a smile of exquisite tenderness and dropped four tears on it and merriam only twenty rods away then she stood still for ten minutes looking into space she looked into space through a slowly opening door on her side of the door was the building material for a castle of romance love an arcady of waving palms a lullaby of waves on the shore of a haven of rest respite peace a lotus land of dreamy ease and security a life of poetry and heart s ease and refuge romanticist will you tell me what mrs conant saw on the other side of the door you cannot that is you will not very well then listen she saw herself go into a department store and buy five spools of silk thread and three yards of gingham to make an apron for the cook shall i charge it ma am asked the clerk as she walked out a lady whom she met greeted her cordially oh where did you get the pattern for those sleeves dear mrs conant she said at the corner a policeman helped her across the street and touched his helmet any callers she asked the maid when she reached home mrs waldron answered the maid and the tqvo misses jenkinson very well she said you may bring me a cup of tea maggie mrs conant went to the door and called angela the old peruvian woman if mateo is there send him to me mateo a half breed shuffling and old but efficient came is there a steamer or a vessel of any kind leaving this coast to night or to morrow that i can get passage on she asked mateo considered at punta reina thirty miles down the coast se ora he answered there is a small steamer loading with cinchona and dyewoods she sails for san francisco to morrow at sunrise so says my brother who arrived in his sloop to day passing by punta reina you must take me in that sloop to that steamer to night will you do that perhaps mateo shrugged a suggestive shoul der mrs conant took a handful of money from a drawer and gave it to him get the sloop ready behind the little point of land below the town she ordered get sailors and be ready to sail at six o clock in half an hour bring a cart partly filled with straw into the patio here and take my trunk to the sloop there is more money yet now hurry for one time mateo walked away without shuffling his feet angela cried mrs conant almost fiercely come and help me pack i am going away out with this trunk my clothes first stir yourself those dark dresses first hurry from the first she did not waver from her decision her view was clear and final her door had opened and let the world in her love for merriam was not lessened but it now appeared a hopeless and unrealizable thing the visions of their future that had seemed so blissful and complete had vanished she tried to assure herself that her renunciation was rather for his sake than for her own now that she was cleared of her burden at least technically would not his own weigh too heavily upon him if she should cling to him would not the difference forever silently mar and corrode their happiness thus she reasoned but there were a thousand little voices calling to her that she could feel rather than hear like the hum of distant powerful machinery the little voices of the world that when raised in unison can send their insistent call through the thickest door once while packing a brief shadow of the lotus dream came back to her she held merriam s picture to her heart with one hand while she threw a pair of shoes into the trunk with her other at six o clock mateo returned and reported the sloop ready he and his brother lifted the trunk into the cart covered it with straw and conveyed it to the point of embarkation from there they transferred it on board in the sloop s dory then mateo returned for additional orders mrs conant was ready she had settled all business matters with angela and was impatiently waiting she wore a long loose black silk duster that she often walked about in when the evenino s were chilly on her head was a small round hat and over it the apricot coloured lace mantilla dusk had quickly followed the short twilight mateo led her by dark and grass grown streets toward the point behind which the sloop was anchored on turning a corner they beheld the hotel orilla del mar three streets away nebulously aglow with its array of kerosene lamps mrs conant paused with streamin eyes i must i must see him once before i go she murmured in anguish but even then she did not falter in her decision quickly she invented a plan by which she might speak to him and yet make her departure without his knowing she would walk past the hotel ask some one to call him out and talk a few moments on some trivial excuse leaving him expecting to see her at her home at seven she unpinned her hat and gave it to mateo keep this and wait here till i come she ordered then she draped the mantilla over her head as she usually did when walking after sunset and went straight to the orilla del mar she was glad to see the bulky white clad figure of tio pancho standing alone on the gallery tio pancho she said with a charming smile may i trouble you to ask mr merriam to come out for just a few moments that i may speak with him tio pancho bowed as an elephant bows buenas tardes se ora conant he said as a cavalier talks and then he went on less at his ease but does not the se ora know that se or merriam sailed on the pajaro for panama at three o clock of this afternoon the theory and the hound not many days ago my old friend from the tropics j p bridger united states consul on the island of ratona was in the city we had wassail and jubilee and saw the flatiron building and missed seeing the bronxless menagerie by about a couple of nights and then at the ebb tide we were walking up a street that parallels and parodies broadway a woman with a comely and mundane countenance passed us holding in leash a wheezing vicious waddling brute of a yellow pug the dog entangled himself with bridger s legs and mumbled his ankles in a snarling peevish sulky bite bridger with a happy smile kicked the breath out of the brute the woman showered us with a quick rain of well conceived adjectives that left us in no doubt as to our place in her opinion and we passed on ten yards farther an old woman with dis ordered white hair and her bankbook tucked well hidden beneath her tattered shawl begged bridger stopped and disinterred for her a quarter from his holiday waist coat on the next corner a quarter of a ton of well clothed man with a rice powdered fat white jowl stood holding the chain of a devil born bulldog whose forelegs were strangers by the length of a dachshund a little woman in a last season s hat confronted him and wept which was plainly all she could do while he cursed her in low sweet practised tones bridger smiled again strictly to himself and this time he took out a little memorandum book and made a note of it this he had no right to do without due explanation and i said so it s a new theory said bridger that i picked up down in ratona i ve been gathering support for it as i knock about the world isn t ripe for it yet but well i ll tell you and then you run your mind back along the people you ve known and see what you make of it and so i cornered bridger in a place where they have artificial palms and wine and he told me the story which is here in my words and on his responsibility one afternoon at three o clock on the island of ratona a boy raced alongthe beach screaming pajaro ahoy thus he made known the keenness of his hearing and the justice of his discrimination in pitch he who first heard and made oral proclamation con cerning the toot of an approaching steamer s whistle and correctly named the steamer was a small hero in ratona until the next steamer came wherefore there was rivalry among the barefoot youth of ratona and many fell victims to the softly blown conch shells of sloops which as they enter harbour sound surprisingly like a distant steamer s signal and some could name you the vessel when its call in your duller ears sounded no louder than the sigh of the wind through the branches of the cocoa nut palms but to day he who proclaimed the pajaro gained his honours ratona bent its ear to listen and soon the deep tongued blast grew louder and nearer and at length ratona saw above the line of palms on the low joint the two black funnels of the fruiter slowly creeping toward the mouth of the harbour you must know that ratona is an island twenty miles off the south of a south american republic it is a port of that republic and it sleeps sweetly in a smiling sea toiling not nor spinning fed by the abundant tropics where all things ripen cease and fall toward the grave eight hundred people dream life away in a green embowered village that follows the horseshoe curve of its bijou harbour they are mostly spanish and indian mestizos with a shading of san domingo negroes a lightening of pure blood spanish officials and a slight leavening of the froth of three or four pioneering white races no steamers touch at ratona save the fruit steamers which take on their banana inspectors there on their way to the coast they leave sunday newspapers ice quinine bacon watermelons and vaccine matter at the island and that is about all the touch ratona gets with the world the pajaro paused at the mouth of the harbour roll ing heavily in the swell that sent the whitecaps racing beyond the smooth water inside already two dories from the village one conveying fruit inspectors the other going for what it could get were halfway out to the steamer the inspectors dory was taken on board with them and the pajaro steamed away for the mainland for its load of fruit the other boat returned to ratona bearing a contri bution from the pajaro s store of ice the usual roll of newspapers and one passenger taylor plunkett sheriff of chatham county kentucky bridger the united states consul at ratona was clean ing his rifle in the official shanty under a bread fruit tree twenty yards from the water of the harbour the consul occupied a place somewhat near the tail of his political party s procession the music of the band wagon sounded very faintly to him in the distance the plums of office went to others bridger s share of the spoils the consulship at ratona was little more than a prune a dried prune from the boarding house department of the public crib but yearly was opulence in ratona besides bridger had contracted a passion for shooting alligators in the lagoons near his consulate and was not unhappy he looked up from a careful inspection of his rifle lock a broad man filling his doorway a broad noiseless slow moving man sunburned almost to the vandyke a man of forty five neatly clothed in homespun with scanty light hair a close clipped brown and gray beard and pale blue eyes expressing mildness implicity you are mr bridger the consul said the broad man they directed me here can you tell me what those big bunches of things like gourds are in those trees that look like feather dusters along the edge of the water take that chair said the consul reoiling his clean ing rag no the other one that bamboo thing won t hold you why they re cocoanuts green cocoanuts the shell of em is always a light green before they re ripe much obliged said the other man sitting down carefully i didn t quite like to tell the folks at home they were olives unless i was sure about it my name is plunkett i m sheriff of chatham county kentucky i ve got extradition papers in my pocket authorizing the arrest of a man on this island they ve been signed by the president of this country and they re in correct shape the man s name is wade williams he s in the cocoa nut raising business what he s wanted for is the murder of his wife two years ago where can i find him the consul squinted an eye and looked through his rifle barrel there s nobody on the island who calls himself wil liams he remarked didn t suppose there was said plunkett mildly he ll do by any other name besides myself said bridger there are only two americans on ratona bob reeves and henry morgan the man i want sells cocoanuts suggested plunkett you see that cocoanut walk extending up to the point said the consul waving his hand toward the open door that belongs to bob reeves henry morgan owns half the trees to loo ard on the island one month ago said the sheriff wade williams wrote a confidential letter to a man in chatham county telling him where he was and how he was getting along the letter was lost and the person that found it gave it away they sent me after him and i ve got the papers i reckon he s one of your cocoanut men for certain you ve got his picture of course said bridger it might be reeves or morgan but i d hate to think it they re both as fine fellows as you d meet in an all day auto ride no doubtfully answered plunkett there wasn t any picture of williams to be had and i never saw him myself i ve been sheriff only a year but i ve got a pretty accurate description of him about feet dark hair and eyes nose inclined to be roman heavy about the shoulders strong white teeth with none miss ing laughs a good deal talkative drinks considerably but never to intoxication looks you square in the eye when talking age thirty five which one of your men does that description fit the consul grinned broadly i ll tell you what you do he said laying down his rifle and slipping on his dingy black alpaca coat you come along mr plunkett and i ll take you up to see the boys if you can tell which one of em your descrip tion fits better than it does the other you have the advan tage of me bridger conducted the sheriff out and along the hard beach close to which the tiny houses of the village were distributed immediately back of the town rose sudden small thickly wooded hills up one of these by means of steps cut in the hard clay the consul led plunkett the very verge of an eminence was perched a two room wooden cottage with a thatched roof a carib woman was washing clothes outside the consul ushered the sheriff to the door of the room that over looked the harbour two men were in the room about to sit down in their shirt sleeves to a table spread for dinner they bore little resemblance one to the other in detail but the general description given by plunkett could have been justly applied to either in height colour of hair shape of nose build and manners each of them tallied with it they were fair types of jovial ready witted broad gauged americans who had gravitated together for com panionship in an alien land hello bridger they called in unison at sight of the consul come and have dinner with us and then they noticed plunkett at his heels and came forward with hospitable curiosity gentlemen said the consul his voice taking on unaccustomed formality this is mr plunkett mr plunkett mr reeves and mr morgan the cocoanut barons greeted the newcomer joyously reeves seemed about an inch taller than morgan but his laugh was not quite as loud morgan s eyes were deep brown reeves s were black reeves was the host and busied himself with fetching other chairs and calling to the carib woman for supplemental table ware it was explained that morgan lived in a bamboo shack to loo ard but that every day the two friends dined together plunkett stood still during the preparations looking about mildly with his pale blue eyes bridger looked apologetic and uneasy at length two other covers were laid and the company was assigned to places reeves and morgan stood side by side across the table from the visitors reeves nodded genially as a signal for all to seat themselves and then suddenly plunkett raised his hand with a gesture of authority he was looking straight between reeves and morgan wade williams he said quietly you are under arrest for murder reeves and morgan instantly exchanged a quick bright glance the quality of which was interrogation with a seasoning of surprise then simultaneously they turned to the speaker with a puzzled and frank depre cation in their gaze can t say that we understand you mr plunkett said morgan cheerfully did you say williams what s the joke bridgy asked reeves turning to the consul with a smile before bridger could answer plunkett spoke again i ll explain he said quietly one of you don t need any explanation but this is for the other one one of you is wade williams of chatham county kentucky you murdered your wife on may two years ago after ill treating and abusing her continually for five years i have the proper papers in my pocket for taking you back with me and you are going we will return on the fruit steamer that comes back by this island to morrow to leave its inspectors i acknowledge gentlemen that i m not quite sure which one of you is williams but wade williams goes back to chatham county to morrow i want you to understand that a great sound of merry laughter from morgan and reeves went out over the still harbour two or three fishermen in the fleet of sloops anchored there looked up at the house of the diablos americanos on the hill and wondered my dear mr plunkett cried morgan conquering his mirth the dinner is getting cold let us sit down and eat i am anxious to get my spoon into that shark fin soup business afterward sit down gentlemen if you please added reeves pleasantly i am sure mr plunkett will not object perhaps a little time may be of advantage to him in identi fying the gentlemen he wishes to arrest no objections i m sure said plunkett dropping into his chair heavily i m hungry myself i didn t want to accept the hospitality of you folks without giving you notice that s all reeves set bottles and glasses on the table there s cognac he said and anisada and scotch smoke and rye take your choice bridger chose rye reeves poured three fingers of scotch for himself morgan took the same the sheriff against much protestation filled his glass from the water bottle here s to the appetite said reeves raising his glass of mr williams morgan s laugh and his drink encountering sent him into a choking splutter all began to pay attention to the dinner which was well cooked and palatable williams called plunkett suddenly and sharply all looked up wonderingly reeves found the sheriff s mild eye resting upon him he flushed a little see here he said with some asperity my name s reeves and i don t want you too but the comedy of the thing came to his rescue and he ended with a laugh i suppose mr plunkett said morgan carefully seasoning an alligator pear that you are aware of the fact that you will import a good deal of trouble for your self into kentucky if you take back the wrong man that is of course if you take anybody back thank you for the salt said the sheriff oh i ll take somebody back it ll be one of you two gentlemen yes i know i d get stuck for damages if i make a mis take but i m going to try to get the right man i ll tell you what you do said morgan leaning for ward with a jolly twinkle in his eyes you take me i ll go without any trouble the cocoanut business hasn t panned out well this year and i d like to make some extra money out of your bondsmen that s not fair chimed in reeves i got only a thousand for my last shipment take me mr plunkett i ll take wade williams said the sheriff patiently or i ll come pretty close to it it s like dining with a ghost remarked morgan with a pretended shiver the ghost of a murderer too will somebody pass the toothpicks to the shade of the naughty mr williams plunkett seemed as unconcerned as if he were dining at his own table in chatham county he was a gallant trencherman and the strange tropic viands tickled his palate heavy commonplace almost slothful in his movements he appeared to be devoid of all the cunning and watchfulness of the sleuth he even ceased to observe with any sharpness or attempted discrimination the two men one of whom he had undertaken with sur prising self confidence to drag away upon the serious charge of wife murder here indeed was a problem set before him that if wrongly solved would have amounted to his serious discomfiture yet there he sat puzzling his soul to all appearances over the novel flavour of a broiled iguana cutlet the consul felt a decided discomfort reeves and morgan were his friends and pals yet the sheriff from kentucky had a certain right to his official aid and moral support so bridger sat the silentest around the board and tried to estimate the peculiar situation his con clusion was that both reeves and morgan quickwitted as he knew them to be had conceived at the moment of plunkett s disclosure of his mission and in the brief space of a lightning flash the idea that the other might be the guilty williams and that each of them had decided in that moment loyally to protect his comrade against the doom that threatened him this was the consul s theory and if he had been a bookmaker at a race of wits for life and liberty he would have offered heavy odds against the plodding sheriff from chatham county kentucky when the meal was concluded the carib woman came and removed the dishes and cloth reeves strewed them table with excellent cigars and plunkett with the others lighted one of these with evident gratification i may be dull said morgan with a grin and a wink at bridger but i want to know if i am now i say this is all a joke of mr plunkett s concocted to frighten two babes in the woods is this williamson to be taken seriously or not williams corrected plunkett gravely i never got off any jokes in my life i know i wouldn t travel miles to get off a poor one as this would be if i didn t take wade williams back with me gentlemen continued the sheriff now letting his mild eyes travel impartially from one of the company to another see if you can find any joke in this case wade williams is listening to the words i utter now but out of politeness i will speak of him as a third person for five years he made his wife lead the life of a dog no i ll take that back no dog in kentucky was ever treated as she was he spent the money that she brought him spent it at races at the card table and on horses and hunting he was a good fellow to his friends but a cold sullen demon at home he wound up the five years of neglect by strik ing her with his closed hand a hand as hard as a stone when she was ill and weak from suffering she died the next day and he skipped that s all there is to it it s enough i never saw williams but i knew his wife i m not a man to tell half she and i were keep ing company when she met him she went to louisville on a visit and saw him there i ll admit that he spoilt my chances in no time i lived then on the edge of the cumberland mountains i was elected sheriff of chatham county a year after wade williams killed his wife my official duty sends me out here after him but i ll admit that there s personal feeling too and he s going back with me mr er reeves will you pass me a match awfully imprudent of williams said morgan putting his feet up against the wall to strike a kentucky lady seems to me i ve heard they were scrappers bad bad williams said reeves pouring out more scotch the two men spoke lightly but the consul saw and felt the tension and the carefulness in their actions and words good old fellows he said to himself they re both all right each of em is standing by the other like a little brick church and then a dog walked into the room where they sat a black and tan hound long eared lazy confident of welcome plunkett turned his head and looked at the animal which halted confidently within a few feet of his chair suddenly the sheriff with a deep mouthed oath left his seat and bestowed upon the dog a vicious and heavy kick with his ponderous shoe the hound heartbroken astonished with flapping ears and incurved tail uttered a piercing yelp of pain and surprise reeves and the consul remained in their chairs say ing nothing but astonished at the unexpected show of intolerance from the easy going man from chatham county but morgan with a suddenly purpling face leaped to his feet and raised a threatening arm above the guest you brute he shouted passionately why did you do that quickly the amenities returned plunkett muttered some indistinct apology and regained his seat morgan with a decided effort controlled his indignation and also returned to his chair and then plunkett with the spring of a tiger leaped around the corner of the table and snapped handcuffs on the paralyzed morgan s wrists hound lover and woman killer he cried get ready to meet your god when bridger had finished i asked him did he get the right man he did said the consul and how did he know i inquired being in a kind of bewilderment when he put morgan in the dory answered bridger the next day to take him aboard the pajaro this man plunkett stopped to shake hands with me and i asked him the same question mr bridger said he i m a kentuckian and i ve seen a great deal of both men and animals and i never yet saw a man that was overfond of horses and dogs but what was cruel to women the hypotheses of failure lawyer gooch bestowed his undivided attention upon the engrossing arts of his profession but one flight of fancy did he allow his mind to entertain he was fond of likening his suite of office rooms to the bot tom of a ship the rooms were three in number with a door opening from one to another these doors could also be closed ships lawyer gooch would say are constructed for safety with separate water tight compartments in their bottoms if one compartment springs a leak it fills with water but the good ship goes on unhurt were it not for the separating bulkheads one leak would sink the vessel now it often happens that while i am occu pied with clients other clients with conflicting interests call with the assistance of archibald an office boy with a future i cause the dangerous influx to be diverted into separate compartments while i sound with my legal plummet the depth of each if neces sary they may be haled into the hallway and permitted to escape by way of the stairs which we may term the lee scuppers thus the good ship of business is kept afloat whereas if the element that supports her were allowed to mingle freely in her hold we might be swamped ha ha ha the law is dry good jokes are few surely it might be permitted lawyer gooch to mitigate the bore of briefs the tedium of torts and the prosiness of processes with even so light a levy upon the good property of humour lawyer gooch s practice leaned largely to the settle ment of marital infelicities did matrimony languish through complications he mediated soothed and arbi trated did it suffer from implications he readjusted defended and championed did it arrive at the extremity of duplications he always got light sentences for his clients but not always was lawyer gooch the keen armed wily belligerent ready with his two edged sword to lop off the shackles of hymen he had been known to build up instead of demolishing to reunite instead of severing to lead erring and foolish ones back into the fold instead of scattering the flock often had he by his eloquent and moving appeals sent husband and wife weeping back into each other s arms frequently he had coached childhood so successfully that at the psychological moment and at a given signal the plaintive pipe of papa won t you turn home adain to me and muvver had won the day and upheld the pillars of a tottering home unprejudiced persons admitted that lawyer gooch received as big fees from these revoked clients as would have been paid him had the cases been contested in court prejudiced ones intimated that his fees were doubled because the penitent couples always came back later for the divorce anyhow there came a season in june when the legal ship of lawyer gooch to borrow his own figure was nearly becalmed the divorce mill grinds slowly in june it is the month of cupid and hymen lawyer gooch then sat idle in the middle room of his clientless suite a small anteroom connected or rather separated this apartment from the hallway here was stationed archibald who wrested from visitors their cards or oral nomenclature which he bore to his master while they waited suddenly on this day there came a great knocking at the outermost door archibald opening it was thrust aside as superfluous by the visitor who without due reverence at once pene trated to the office of lawyer gooch and threw himself with good natured insolence into a comfortable chair facing that gentlemen you are phineas c gooch attorney at law said the visitor his tone of voice and inflection making his words at once a question an assertion and an accusation before committing himself by a reply the lawyer esti mated his possible client in one of his brief but shrewd and calculating glances the man was of the emphatic type large sized active bold and debonair in demeanour vain beyond a doubt slightly swaggering ready and at ease he was well clothed but with a shade too much ornateness he was seeking a lawyer but if that fact would seem to saddle him with troubles they were not patent in his beaming eye and courageous air my name is gooch at length the lawyer admitted upon pressure he would also have confessed to the phineas c but he did not consider it good practice to volunteer information i did not receive your card he continued by way of rebuke so i i know you didn t remarked the visitor coolly and you won t just yet light up he threw a leg over an arm of his chair and tossed a handful of rich hued cigars upon the table lawyer gooch knew the brand he thawed just enough to accept the invitation to smoke you are a divorce lawyer said the cardless visitor this time there was no interrogation in his voice nor did his words constitute a simple assertion they formed a charge a denunciation as one would say to a dog you are a dog lawyer gooch was silent under the imputation you handle continued the visitor all the various ramifications of busted up connubiality you are a surgeon we might saw who extracts cupid s darts when he shoots em into the wrong parties you furnish patent incandescent lights for premises where the torch of hymen has burned so low you can t light a cigar at it am i right mr gooch i have undertaken cases said the lawyer guardedly in the line to which your figurative speech seems to refer do you wish to consult me professionally mr the lawyer paused with significance not yet said the other with an arch wave of his cigar not just yet let us approach the subject with the caution that should have been used in the original act that makes this pow wow necessary there exists a matrimonial jumble to be straightened out but before i give you names i want your honest well anyhow your professional opinion on the merits of the mix up i want you to size up the catastrophe abstractly you understand i m mr nobody and i ve got a story to tell you then you say what s what do you get my wireless you want to state a hypothetical case suggested lawyer gooch that s the word i was after apothecary was the best shot i could make at it in my mind the hypo thetical goes i ll state the case suppose there s a woman a deuced fine looking woman who has run away from her husband and home she s badly mashed on another man who went to her town to work up some real estate business now we may as well call this woman s husband thomas r billings for that s his name i m giving you straight tips on the cognomens the lothario chap is henry k jessup the billingses lived in a little town called susanville a good many miles from here now jessup leaves susanville two weeks ago the next day mrs billings follows him she s dead gone on this man jessup you can bet your law library on that lawyer gooch s client said this with such unctuous satisfaction that even the callous lawyer experienced a slight ripple of repulsion he now saw clearly in his fatuous visitor the conceit of the lady killer the egoistic complacency of the successful trifler now continued the visitor suppose this mrs billings wasn t happy at home we ll say she and her husband didn t gee worth a cent they ve got incom patibility to burn the things she likes billings wouldn t have as a gift with trading stamps it s tabby and rover with them all the time she s an educated woman in science and culture and she reads things out loud at meetings billings is not on he don t appreciate pro gress and obelisks and ethics and things of that sort old billings is simply a blink when it comes to such things the lady is out and out above his class now lawyer don t it look like a fair equalization of rights and wrongs that a woman like that should be allowed to throw down billings and take the man that can appreciate her incompatibility said lawyer gooch is undoubt edly the source of much marital discord and unhappiness where it is positively proved divorce would seem to be the equitable remedy are you excuse me is this man jessup one to whom the lady may safely trust her future oh you can bet on jessup said the client with a confident wag of his head jessup s all right he ll do the square thing why he left susanville just to keep pwple from talking about mrs billings but she fol lowed him up and now of course he ll stick to her when she gets a divorce all legal and proper jessup the proper thing and now said lawyer gooch continuing the hypo if you prefer and supposing that my services should ired in the case what the client rose impulsively to his feet oh dang the hypothetical business he exclaimed impatiently let s let her drop and get down to straight talk you ought to know who i am by this time i want that woman to have her divorce i ll pay for it the day you set mrs billings free i ll pay you five hundred dollars lawyer gooch s client banged his fist upon the table to punctuate his generosity if that is the case began the lawyer lady to see you sir bawled archibald bouncing in from his anteroom he had orders to always announce immediately any client that might come there was no sense in turning business away lawyer gooch took client number one by the arm and led him suavely into one of the adjoining rooms favour me by remaining here a few minutes sir said he i will return and resume our consultation with the least possible delay i am rather expecting a visit from a very wealthy old lady in connection with a will i will not keep you waiting long the breezy gentleman seated himself with obliging acquiescence aud took up a magazine the lawyer returned to the middle office carefully closing behind him the connecting door show the lady in archibald he said to the office boy who was awaiting the order a tall lady of commanding presence and sternly hand some entered the room she wore robes robes not clothes ample and fluent in her eye could be per ceived the lambent flame of genius and soul in her hand was a green bag of the capacity of a bushel and an umbrella that also seemed to wear a robe ample and fluent she accepted a chair are you mr phineas c gooch the lawyer she asked in formal and unconciliatory tones i am answered lawyer gooch without circum locution he never circumlocuted when dealing with a woman women circumlocute time is wasted when both sides in debate employ the same tactics as a lawyer sir began the lady you may have acquired some knowledge of the human heart do you believe that the pusillanimous and petty conventions of our artificial social life should stand as an obstacle in the way of a noble and affectionate heart when it finds its true mate among the miserable and worthless wretches in the world that are called men madam said lawyer gooch in the tone that he used in curbing his female clients this is an office for conducting the practice of law i am a lawyer not a philosopher nor the editor of an answers to the lovelorn column of a newspaper i have other clients waiting i will ask you kindly to come to the point well you needn t get so stiff around the gills about it said the lady with a snap of her luminous eves and a startling gyration of her umbrella business is what i ve come for i want your opinion in the matter of a suit for divorce as the vulgar would call it but which is really only the readjustment of the false and ignoble con ditions that the short sihhted laws of man have interposed between a loving i beg your pardon madam interrupted lawyer gooch with some impatience for reminding you again that this is a law office perhaps mrs wilcox mrs wilcox is all right cut in the lady with a hint of asperity and so are tolstoi and mrs gertrude atherton and omar khayyam and mr edward bok i ve read em all i would like to discuss with you the divine right of the soul as opposed to the freedom destroy ing restrictions of a bigoted and narrow minded society but i will proceed to business i would prefer to lay the matter before you in an impersonal way until vou pass upon its merits that is to describe it as a sup posable instance without you wish to state a hypothetical case said lawyer gooch i was going to say that said the lady sharply now suppose there is a woman who is all soul and heart and aspirations for a complete existence this woman has a husband who is far below her in intellect in taste in everything bah he is a brute he despises literature he sneers at the lofty thoughts of the world s great thinkers he thinks only of real estate and such sordid things he is no mate for a woman with soul we will say that this unfortunate wife one day meets with her ideal a man with brain and heart and force she loves him although this man feels the thrill of a new found affinity he is too noble too honourable to declare himself he flies from the presence of his beloved she flies after him trampling with superb indifference upon the fetters with which an unenlightened social system would bind her now what will a divorce cost eliza ann timmins the poetess of sycamore gap got one for three hundred and forty dollars can i i mean can this lady i speak of get one that cheap madam said lawyer gooch your last two or three sentences delight me with their intelligence and clearness can we not now abandon the hypothetical and come down to names and business i should say so exclaimed the lady adopting the practical with admirable readiness thomas r bil lings is the name of the low brute who stands between the happiness of his legal his legal but not his spiri tual wife and henry k jessup the noble man whom nature intended for her mate i concluded the client with an air of dramatic revelation am mrs billings gentlemen to see you sir shouted archibald invad ing the room almost at a handspring lawyer gooch arose from his chair mrs billings he said courteously allow me to conduct you into the adjoining office apartment for a few minutes i am expecting a very wealthy old gentleman on busines connected with a will in a very short while i will join you and continue our consultation with his accustomed chivalrous manner lawyer gooch ushered his soulful client into the remaining unoccupied room and came out closing the door with circumspection the next visitor introduced by archibald was a thin nervous irritable looking man of middle age with a worried and apprehensive expression of countenance he carried in one hand a small satchel which he set down upon the floor beside the chair which the lawyer placed for him his clothing was of good quality but it was worn without regard to neatness or style and appeared to be covered with the dust of travel you make a specialty of divorce cases he said in an agitated but business like tone i may say began lawyer gooch that my prac tice has not altogether avoided i know you do interrupted client number three you needn t tell me i ve heard all about you i have a case to lay before you without necessarily disclosing any connection that i might have with it that is you wish said lawyer gooch to state a hvpo thetical case you may call it that i am a plain man of business i will be as brief as possible we will first take up hypothetical woman we will say she is married uncon genially in many ways she is a superior woman phys ically she is considered to be handsome she is devoted to what she calls literature poetry and prose and such stuff her husband is a plain man in the business walks of life their home has not been happy although the husband has tried to make it so some time ago a man a stranger came to the peaceful town in which they lived and engaged in some real estate operations this woman met him and became unaccountably infatu ated with him her attentions became so open that the man felt the community to be no safe place for him so he left it she abandoned husband and home and followed him she forsook her home where she was provided with every comfort to follow this man who had inspired her with such a strange affection is there any thing more to be deplored concluded the client in a trembling voice than the wrecking of a home by a woman s uncalculating folly lawyer gooch delivered the cautious opinion that there was not this man she has gone to join resumed the visitor is not the man to make her happy it is a wild and foolish self deception that makes her think he will her husband in spite of their many disagreements is the only one capable of dealing with her sensitive and peculiar nature but this she does not realize now would you consider a divorce the logical cure in the case you present asked lawyer gooch who felt that the conversation was wandering too far from the field of business a divorce exclaimed the client feelingly almost tearfully no no not that i have read mr gooch of many instances where your sympathy and kindly inter est led you to act as a mediator between estranged hus band and wife and brought them together again let us drop the hypothetical case i need conceal no longer that it is i who am the sufferer in this sad affair the names you shall have thomas r billings and wife and henry k jessup the man with whom she is infatuated client number three laid his hand upon mr gooch s arm deep emotion was written upon his careworn face for heaven s sake he said fervently help me in this hour of trouble seek out mrs billings and persuade her to abandon this distressing pursuit of her lamentable folly tell her mr gooch that her husband is willing to receive her back to his heart and home promise her anything that will induce her to return i have heard of your success in these matters mrs bil lings cannot be very far away i am worn out with travel and weariness twice during the pursuit i saw her but various circumstances prevented our having an inter view will you undertake this mission for me mr gooch and earn my everlasting gratitude it is true said lawver gooch frowning slightly at the other s last words but immediately calling up an expression of virtuous benevolence that on a number of occasions i have been successful in persuading couples who sought the severing of their matrimonial bonds to think better of their rash intentions and return to their homes reconciled but i assure you that the work is often exceedingly difficult the amount of argument perseverance and if i may be allowed to say it eloquence that it requires would astonish you but this is a case in which my sympathies would be wholly enlisted i feel deeply for you sir and i would be most happy to see husband and wife reunited but my time concluded the lawyer looking at his watch as if suddenly reminded of the fact is valuable i am aware of that said the client and if you will take the case and persuade mrs billings to return home and leave the man alone that she is following on that day i will pay you the sum of one thousand dollars i have made a little money in real estate during the recent boom in susanville and i will not begrudge that amount retain your seat for a few moments please said lawyer gooch arising and again consulting his watch i have another client waiting in an adjoining room whom i had very nearly forgotten i will return in the briefest possible space the situation was now one that fully satisfied lawyer gooch s love of intricacy and complication he revelled in cases that presented such subtle problems and possi bilities it pleased him to think that he was master of the happiness and fate of the three individuals who sat uncon cious of one another s presence within his reach his old figure of the ship glided into his mind but now the figure failed for to have filled every compartment of an actual vessel would have been to endanger her safety with his compartments full his ship of affairs could but sail on to the advantageous port of a fine fat fee the thing for him to do of course was to wring the best bargain he could from some one of his anxious cargo first he called to the office boy lock the outer door archibald and admit no one then he moved with long silent strides into the room in which client number one waited that gentleman sat patiently scanning the pictures in the magazine with a cigar in his mouth and his feet upon a table well he remarked cheerfully as the lawyer entered have you made up your mind does five hundred dollars go for getting the fair lady a divorce you mean that as a retainer asked lawyer gooch softly interrogative hey no for the whole job it s enough ain t it my fee said lawyer gooch would be one thousand five hundred dollars five hundred dollars down and the remainder upon issuance of the divorce a loud whistle came from client number one his feet descended to the floor guess we can t close the deal he said arising i cleaned up five hunderd dollars in a little real estate dicker down in susanville i d do anything i could to free the lady but it out sizes my pile could you stand one thousand two hundred dollars asked the lawyer insinuatingly five hundred is my limit i tell you guess i ll have to hunt up a cheaper lawyer the client put on his hat out this way please said lawyer gooch opening the door that led into the hallway as the gentleman flowed out of the compartment and down the stairs lawyer gooch smiled to himself exit mr jessup he murmured as he fingered the henry clay tuft of hair at his ear and now for the forsaken husband he returned to the middle office and assumed a businesslike manner i understand he said to client number three that you agree to pay one thousand dollars if i bring about or am instrumental in bringing about the return of mrs billings to her home and her abandonment of her infatu ated pursuit of the man for whom she has conceived such a violent fancy also that the case is now unreservedly in my hands on that basis is that correct entirely said the other eagerly and i can produce the cash any time at two hours notice lawyer gooch stood up at his full height his thin figure seemed to expand his thumbs sought the arm holes of his vest upon his face was a look of sym pathetic benignity that he always wore during such undertakings then sir he said in kindly tones i think i can promise you an early relief from your troubles i have that much confidence in my powers of argument and persuasion in the natural impulses of the human heart toward good and in the strong influence of a husband s unfaltering love mrs billinos sir is here in that room the lawyer s long arm pointed to the door i will call her in at once and our united pleadings lawyer gooch paused for client number three had leaped from his chair as if propelled by steel springs and clutched his satchel what the devil he exclaimed harshly do vou mean that woman in there i thought i shook her off forty miles back he ran to the open window looked out below and threw one leg over the sill stop cried lawyer gooch in amazement what would you do come mr billings and face your erring but innocent wife our combined entreaties cannot fail to billings shouted the now thoroughly moved client i ll billings you you old idiot turning he hurled his satchel with fury at the lawyer s head it struck that astounded peacemaker between the eyes causing him to stagger backward a pace or two when lawyer gooch recovered his wits he saw that his client had disappeared rushing to the window he leaned out and saw the recreant gathering himself up from the top of a shed upon which he had dropped from the second story window without stopping to collect his hat he then plunged downward the remaining ten feet to the alley up which he flew with prodigious celerity until the surrounding building swallowed him up from view lawyer gooch passed his hand tremblingly across his brow it was a habitual act with him serving to clear his thoughts perhaps also it now seemed to soothe the spot where a very hard alligator hide satchel had struck the satchel lay upon the floor wide open with its con tents spilled about mechanically lawyer gooch stooped to gather up the articles the first was a collar and the omniscient eye of the man of law perceived wonder ingly the initials h k j marked upon it then came a comb a brush a folded map and a piece of soap lastly a handful of old business letters addressed every one of them to henry k jessup esq lawyer gooch closed the satchel and set it upon the table he hesitated for a moment and then put on his hat and walked into the office boy s anteroom archibald he said mildly as he opened the hall door i am going around to the supreme court rooms in five minutes you may step into the inner office and inform the lady who is waiting there that here lawyer gooch made use of the vernacular that there s nothing doing calloway s code the new york enterprise sent h b calloway as special correspondent to the russo japanese portsmouth war for two months calloway hung about yokohama and tokio shaking dice with the other correspondents for drinks of rickshaws oh no that s something to ride in anyhow he wasn t earning the salary that his paper was paying him but that was not calloway s fault the little brown men who held the strings of fate between their fingers were not ready for the readers of the enterprise to season their breakfast bacon and eggs with the battles of the descendants of the gods but soon the column of correspondents that were to go out with the first army tightened their field glass belts and went down to the yalu with kuroki calloway was one of these now this is no history of the battle of the yalu river that has been told in detail by the correspondents who gazed at the shrapnel smoke rings from a distance of three miles but for justice s sake let it be understood that the japanese commander prohibited a nearer view calloway s feat was accomplished before the battle what he did was to furnish the enterprise with the biggest beat of the war that paper published exclu sively and in detail the news of the attack on the lines of the russian general on the same day that it was made no other paper printed a word about it for two days afterward except a london paper whose account was absolutely incorrect and untrue calloway did this in face of the fact that general kuroki was making his moves and living his plans with the pro foundest secrecy as far as the world outside his camps was concerned the correspondents were forbidden to send out any news whatever of his plans and every message that was allowed on the wires was censored with rigid severity the correspondent for the london paper handed in a cablegram describing kuroki s plans but as it was wrong from beginning to end the censor grinned and let it go through so there they were kuroki on one side of the yalu with forty two thousand infantry five thousand cavalry and one hundred and twenty four guns on the other side zassulitch waited for him with only twenty three thousand men and with a long stretch of river to guard and calloway had got hold of some important inside information that he knew would bring the enterprise staff around a cablegram as thick as flies around a park row lemonade stand if he could only get that message past the censor the new censor who had arrived and taken his post that day calloway did the obviously proper thing he lit his pipe and sat down on a gun carriage to think it over and there we must leave him for the rest of the story belongs to vesey a sixteen dollar a week reporter on the enterprise calloway s cablegram was handed to the managing editor at four o clock in the afternoon he read it three times and then drew a pocket mirror from a pigeon hole in his desk and looked at his reflection carefully then he went over to the desk of boyd his assistant he usually called boyd when he wanted him and laid the cablegram before him it s from calloway he said see what you make of it the message was dated at wi ju and these were the words of it foregone preconcerted rash witching goes muffled rumour mine dark silent unfortunate richmond existing great hotly brute select mooted parlous beggars ye angel incontrovertible boyd read it twice it s either a cipher or a sunstroke said he ever hear of anything like a code in the office a secret code asked the m e who had held his desk for only two years managing editors come and go none except the vernacular that the lady specials write in said boyd couldn t be an acrostic could it i thought of that said the m e but the beginning letters contain only four vowels it must be a code of some sort try em in groups suggested boyd let s see rash witching goes not with me it doesn t muf fled rumour mine must have an underground wire dark silent unfortunate richmond no reason why he should knock that town so hard existing great hotly no it doesn t pan out i ll call scott the city editor came in a hurry and tried his luck a city editor must know something about everything so scott knew a little about cipher writing it may be what is called an inverted alphabet cipher said he i ll try that r seems to be the oftenest used initial letter with the exception of m assuming r to mean e the most frequently used vowel we transpose the letters so scott worked rapidly with his pencil for two minutes and then showed the first word according to his reading the word scejtzez great cried boyd it s a charade my first is a russian general go on scott no that won t work said the city editor it s undoubtedly a code it s impossible to read it without the key has the office ever used a cipher code just what i was asking said the m e hustle everybody up that ought to know we must get at it some way calloway has evidently got hold of some thing big and the censor has put the screws on or he wouldn t have cabled in a lot of chop suey like this throughout the office of the enterprise a dragnet was sent hauling in such members of the staff as would be likely to know of a code past or present by reason of their wisdom information natural intelligence or length of servitude they got together in a group in the city room with the m e in the centre no one had heard of a code all began to explain to the head investi gator that newspapers never use a code anyhow that is a cipher code of course the associated press stuff is a sort of code an abbreviation rather but the m e knew all that and said so he asked each man how long he had worked on the paper not one of them had drawn pay from an enterprise envelope for longer than six years calloway had been on the paper twelve years try old heffelbauer said the m e he was here when park row was a potato patch heffelbauer was an institution he was half janitor half handy man about the office and half watchman thus becoming the peer of thirteen and one half tailors sent for he came radiating his nationality heffelbauer said the m e did you ever hear of a code belonging to the office a long time ago a private code you know what a code is don t you yah said heffelbauer sure i know vat a code is yah apout dwelf or fifteen year ago der office had a code der reborters in der city room haf it here ah said the m e we re getting on the trail now where was it kept heffelbauer what do you know about it somedimes said the retainer dey keep it in der little room behind der library room can you find it asked the m e eagerly do you know where it is mein gott said heffelbauer how long you dink a code live der reborters call him a maskeet but von day he butt mit his head der editor und oh he s talking about a goat said boyd get out heffelbauer again discomfited the concerted wit and resource of the enterprise huddled around calloway s puzzle con sidering its mysterious words in vain then vesey came in vesey was the youngest reporter he had a thirty two inch chest and wore a number fourteen collar but his bright scotch plaid suit gave him presence and con ferred no obscurity upon his whereabouts he wore his hat in such a position that people followed him about to see him take it off convinced that it must be hung upon a peg driven into the back of his head he was never without an immense knotted hard wood cane with a german silver tip on its crooked handle vesey was the best photograph hustler in the office scott said it was because no living human being could resist the per sonal triumph it was to hand his picture over to vesey vesey always wrote his own news stories except the big ones which were sent to the rewrite men add to this fact that among all the inhabitants temples and groves of the earth nothing existed that could abash vesey and his dim sketch is concluded vesey butted into the circle of cipher readers very much as heffelbauer s code would have done and asked what was up some one explained with the touch of half familiar condescension that they always used toward him vesey reached out and took the cablegram from the m e s hand under the protection of some special providence he was always doing appalling things like that and coming off unscathed it s a code said vesey anybody got the key the office has no code said boyd reaching for the message vesey held to it then old callowav expects us to read it anyhow said he he s up a tree or something and he s made this up so as to get it by the censor it s up to us gee i wish they had sell me too say we can t afford to fall down on our end of it foregone preconcerted rash witching h m vesey sat down on a table corner and began to whistle softly frowning at the cablegram let s have it please said the m e we ve got to get to work on it i believe i ve got a line on it said vesey give me ten minutes he walked to his desk threw his hat into a waste basket spread out flat on his chest like a gorgeous lizard and started his pencil going the wit and wisdom of the enterprise remained in a loose group and smiled at one another nodding their heads toward vesey then they began to exchange their theories about the cipher it took vesey exactly fifteen minutes he brought to the m e a pad with the code key written on it i felt the swing of it as soon as i saw it said vesey hurrah for old calloway he s done the japs and every paper in town that prints literature instead of news take a look at that thus had vesey set forth the reading of the code foregone conclusion preconcerted arrangement rash act witching hour of midnight goes without saying muffled report rumour hath it mine host dark horse silent majority unfortunate pedestrians richmond in the field existing conditions great white way hotly contested brute force select few mooted question parlous times beggars description ye correspondent angel unawares incontrovertible fact mr vesey afterward explained that the logical journalistic complement of the word unfortunate was once the word victim but since the automobile became so popular the correct following word is now pedestrians of course in calloway s code it meant infantry it s simply newspaper english explained vesey i ve been reporting on the enterprise long enough to know it by heart old calloway gives us the cue word and we use the word that naturally follows it just as we em in the paper read it over and you ll see how pat they drop into their places now here s the message he intended us to get vesey handed out another sheet of paper concluded arrangement to act at hour of midnight without saying report hath it that a large body of cavalry and an overwhelming force of infantry will be thrown into the field conditions white way con tested by only a small force question the times description its correspondent is unaware of the facts great stuff cried boyd excitedly kuroki crosses the yalu to night and attacks oh we won t do a thing to the sheets that make up with addison s essays real estate transfers and bowling scores mr vesey said the m e with his jollying which you should regard as a favour manner you have cast a serious reflection upon the literary standards of the paper that employs you you have also assisted materially in giving us the biggest beat of the year i will let you know in a day or two whether you are to be discharged or retained at a larger salary somebody send ames to me ames was the king pin the snowy petalled marguerite the star bright looloo of the rewrite men he saw attempted murder in the pains of green apple colic cyclones in the summer zephyr lost children in every top spinning urchin an uprising of the down trodden masses in every hurling of a derelict potato at a passing automobile when not rewriting ames sat on the porch of his brooklyn villa playing checkers with his ten year old son ames and the war editor shut themselves in a room there was a map in there stuck full of little pins that represented armies and divisions their fingers had been itching for days to move those pins along the crooked line of the yalu they did so now and in words of fire ames translated calloway s brief message into a front page masterpiece that set the world talking he told of the secret councils of the japanese officers gave kuroki s flaming speeches in full counted the cavalry and infantry to a man and a horse described the quick and silent building of the bridge at stuikauchen across which the mikado s legions were hurled upon the surprised zassulitch whose troops were widely scattered along the river and the battle well you know what ames can do with a battle if you give him just one smell of smoke for a foundation and in the same story with seemingly supernatural knowledge he gleefully scored the most profound and ponderous paper in england for the false and misleading account of the intended movements of the japanese first army printed in its issue of the same date only one error was made and that was the fault of the cable operator at wi ju calloway pointed it out after he came back the word great in his code should have been gage and its complemental words of battle but it went to ames conditions white and of course he took that to mean snow his description of the japanese army strum struggling through the snowstorm blinded by the whirling flakes was thrillingly vivid the artists turned out some effective illustrations that made a hit as pictures of the artillery dragging their guns through the drifts but as the attack was made on the first day of may conditions white excited some amusement but it in made no difference to the enterprise anyway it was wonderful and calloway was wonderful in having made the new censor believe that his jargon of words meant no more than a complaint of the dearth of news and a petition for more expense money and vesey was wonderful and most wonderful of all are words and how they make friends one with another being oft associated until not even obituary notices them do part on the second day following the city editor halted at vesey s desk where the reporter was writing the story of a man who had broken his leg by falling into a coal hole ames having failed to find a murder motive in it the old man says your salary is to be raised to twenty a week said scott all right said vesey every little helps say mr scott which would you say we can state without fear of successful contradiction or on the whole it can be safely asserted a matter of mean elevation one winter the alcazar opera company of new orleans made a speculative trip along the mexican central american and south american coasts the venture proved a most successful one the music loving impressionable spanish americans deluged the company with dollars and vivas the manager waxed plump and amiable but for the prohibitive climate he would have put forth the distinctive flower of his prosperity the overcoat of fur braided frogged and opulent almost was he persuaded to raise the salaries of his company but with a mighty effort he conquered the impulse toward such an unprofitable effervescence of joy at macuto on the coast of venezuela the company scored its greatest success imagine coney island translated into spanish and you will comprehend macuto the fashionable season is from november to march down from la guayra and caracas and valencia and other interior towns flock the people for their holiday sea son there are bathing and fiestas and bull fights and scandal and then the people have a passion for music that the bands in the plaza and on the sea beach stir but do not satisfy the coming of the alcazar opera com pany aroused the utmost ardour and zeal among the pleasure seekers the illustrious guzman blanco president and dic tator of venezuela sojourned in macuto with his court for the season that potent ruler who himself paid a subsidy of pesos each year to grand opera in caracas ordered one of the government warehouses to be cleared for a temporary theatre a stage was quickly constructed and rough wooden benches made for the audience private boxes were added for the use of the president and the notables of the army and government the company remained in macuto for two weeks each performance filled the house as closely as it could be packed then the music mad people fought for room in the open doors and windows and crowded about hundreds deep on the outside those audiences formed a brilliantly diversified patch of colour the hue of their faces ranged from the clear olive of the pure blood span iards down through the yellow and brown shades of the mestizos to the coal black carib and the jamaica negro scattered among them were little groups of indians with faces like stone idols wrapped in gaudy fibre woven blankets indians down from the mountain states of zamora and los andes and miranda to trade their gold dust in the coast towns the spell cast upon these denizens of the interior fastnesses was remarkable they sat in petrified ecstasy conspicuous among the excitable macutians who wildly strove with tongue and hand to give evidence of their delight only once did the sombre rapture of these aboriginals find expression during the rendition of faust guzman blanco extravagantly pleased by the jewel song cast upon the stage a purse of gold pieces other distinguished citizens followed his lead to the extent of whatever loose coin they had convenient while some of the fair and fashionable se oras were moved in imita tion to fling a jewel or a ring or two at the feet of the marguerite who was according to the bills mlle nina giraud then from different parts of the house rose sundry of the stolid hillmen and cast upon the stage little brown and dun bags that fell with soft thumps and did not rebound it was no doubt pleasure at the tribute to her art that caused mlle giraud s eyes to shine so brightly when she opened these little deerskin bags in her dressing room and found them to contain pure gold dust if so the pleasure was rightly hers for her voice in song pure strong and thrilling with the feeling of the emotional artist deserved the tribute that it earned but the triumph of the alcazar opera company is not the theme it but leans upon and colours it there happened in macuto a tragic thing an unsolvable mystery that sobered for a time the gaiety of the happy season one evening between the short twilight and the time when she should have whirled upon the stage in the red and black of the ardent carmen mlle nina giraud dis appeared from the sight and ken of pairs of eyes and as many minds in macuto there was the usual turmoil and hurrying to seek her messengers flew to the little french kept hotel where she stayed others of the company hastened here or there where she might be lingering in some tienda or unduly prolonging her bath upon the beach all search was fruitless mademoi selle had vanished half an hour passed and she did not appear the dictator unused to the caprices of prime donne became impatient he sent an aide from his box to say to the manager that if the curtain did not at once rise he would immediately hale the entire company to the calabosa though it would desolate his heart indeed to be com pelled to such an act birds in macuto could be made to sing the manager abandoned hope for the time of mlle giraud a member of the chorus who had dreamed hopelessly for years of the blessed opportunity quickly carmenized herself and the opera went on afterward when the lost cantatrice appeared not the aid of the authorities was invoked the president at once set the army the police and all citizens to the search not one clue to mlle giraud s disappearance was found the alcazar left to fill engagements farther down the coast on the way back the steamer stopped at macuto and the manager made anxious inquiry not a trace of the lady had been discovered the alcazar could do no more the personal belongings of the missing lady were stored in the hotel against her possible later reappearance and the opera company continued upon its homeward voyage to new orleans on the camino real along the beach the two saddle mules and the four pack mules of don se or johnny armstrong stood patiently awaiting the crack of the whip of the arriero luis that would be the signal for the start on another long journey into the mountains the pack mules were loaded with a varied assortment of hard ware and cutlery these articles don johnny traded to the interior indians for the gold dust that they washed from the andean streams and stored in quills and bags against his coming it was a profitable business and se or armstrong expected soon to be able to purchase the coffee plantation that he coveted armstrong stood on the narrow sidewalk exchanging garbled spanish with old peralto the rich native merchant who had just charged him four prices for half a gross of pot metal hatchets and abridged english with rucker the little german who was consul for the united states take with you se or said peralto the blessings of the saints upon your journey better try quinine growled rucker through his pipe take two grains every night and don t make your trip too long johnny because we haf needs of you it is ein villainous game dot melville play of whist and dere is no oder substitute auf wiedersehen und keep your eyes dot mule s ears between when you on der edge of der brecipices ride the bells of luis s mule jingled and the pack train filed after the warning note armstrong waved a good bye and took his place at the tail of the procession up the narrow street they turned and passed the two story wooden hotel ingles where ives and dawson and rich ards and the rest of the chaps were dawdling on the broad piazza reading week old newspapers they crowded to the railing and shouted many friendly and wise and foolish farewells after him across the plaza they trotted slowly past the bronze statue of guzman blanco within its fence of bayoneted rifles captured from revolutionists and out of the town between the rows of thatched huts swarming with the unclothed youth of macuto they plunged into the damp coolness of banana groves at length to emerge upon a bright stream where brown women in scant raiment laundered clothes destructively upon the rocks then the pack train fording the stream attacked the sudden ascent and bade adieu to such civilization as the coast afforded for weeks armstrong guided by luis followed his regular route among the mountains after he had col lected an arroba of the precious metal winning a profit of nearly the heads of the lightened mules were turned down trail again where the head of the guarico river springs from a great gash in the mountain side luis halted the train half a day s journey from here se or said he is the village of tacuzama which we have never visited i think many ounces of gold may be procured there it is worth the trial armstrong concurred and they turned again upward toward tacuzama the trail was abrupt and precipi tous mounting through a dense forest as night fell dark and gloomy luis once more halted before them was a black chasm bisecting the path as far as they could see luis dismounted there should be a bridge he called and ran along the cleft a distance it is here he cried and remounting led the way in a few moments armstrong heard a sound as though a thunderous drum were beating somewhere in the dark it was the falling of the mules hoofs upon the bridge made of strong hides lashed to poles and stretched across the chasm half a mile further was tacuzama the village was a congre gation of rock and mud huts set in the profundity of an obscure wood as they rode in a sound inconsistent with that brooding solitude met their ears from a long low mud hut that they were nearing rose the glorious voice of a woman in song the words were english the air familiar to armstrong s memory but not to his musical knowledge he slipped from his mule and stole to a narrow window in one end of the house peering cautiously inside he saw within three feet of him a woman of marvellous imposing beauty clothed in a splendid loose robe of leopard skins the hut was packed close to the small space in which she stood with the squatting figures of indians the woman finished her song and seated herself close to the little window as if grateful for the unpolluted air that entered it when she had ceased several of the audience rose and cast little softly falling bags at her feet a harsh murmur no doubt a barbarous kind of applause and comment went through the grim assembly armstrong was used to seizing opportunities promptly taking advantage of the noise he called to the woman in a low but distinct voice do not turn your head this way but listen i am an american if you need assistance tell me how i can render it answer as briefly as you can the woman was worthy of his boldness only by a sudden flush of her pale cheek did she acknowledge understanding of his words then she spoke scarcely moving her lips i am held a prisoner by these indians god knows i need help in two hours come to the little hut twenty yards toward the mountainside there will be a light and a red curtain in the window there is always a guard at the door whom you will have to overcome for the love of heaven do not fail to come the story seems to shrink from adventure and rescue and mystery the theme is one too gentle for those brave and quickening tones and yet it reaches as far back as time itself it has been named environment which is as weak a word as any to express the unnameable kinship of man to nature that queer fraternity that causes stones and trees and salt water and clouds to play upon our emotions why are we made serious and solemn and sublime by mountain heights grave and contempla tive by an abundance of overhanging trees reduced to inconstancy and monkey capers by the ripples on a sandy beach did the protoplasm but enough the chem ists are looking into the matter and before long they will have all life in the table of the symbols briefly then in order to confine the story within scientific bounds john armstrong went to the hut choked the indian guard and carried away mlle giraud with her was also conveyed a number of pounds of gold dust she had collected during her six months forced engage ment in tacuzama the carabobo indians are easily the most enthusiastic lovers of music between the equator and the french opera house in new orleans they are also strong believers that the advice of emerson was good when he said the thing thou wantest discon tented man take it and pay the price a number of them had attended the performance of the alcazar opera company in macuto and found mlle giraud s style and technique satisfactory they wanted her so they took her one evening suddenly and without any fuss they treated her with much consideration exacting only one song recital each day she was quite pleased at being rescued by mr armstrong so much for mystery and adventure now to resume the theory of the proto plasm john armstrong and mlle giraud rode among the andean peaks enveloped in their greatness and sublimity the mightiest cousins furthest removed in nature s great family become conscious of the tie among those huge piles of primordial upheaval amid those gigantic silences and elongated fields of distance the littlenesses of men are precipitated as one chemical throws down a sediment from another they moved reverently as in a temple their souls were uplifted in unison with the stately heights they travelled in a zone of majesty and peace to armstrong the woman seemed almost a holy thing yet bathed in the white still dignity of her martyrdom that purified her earthly beauty and gave out it seemed an aura of transcendent loveliness in those first hours of companionship she drew from him an adoration that was half human love half the worship of a descended goddess never yet since her rescue had she smiled over her dress she still wore the robe of leopard skins for mountain air was cold she looked to be some splendid princess belonging to those wild and awesome altitudes the spirit of the region chimed with hers her eyes were always turned upon the sombre cliffs the blue gorges and the snow clad turrets looking a sublime melancholy equal to their own at times on the journey she sang thrilling te deums and misereres that struck the true note of the hills and made their route seem like a solemn march down a cathedral aisle the rescued one spoke but seldom her mood partaking of the hush of nature that surrounded them armstrong looked upon her as an angel he could not bring himself to the sacrilege of attempting to woo her as other women may be wooed on the third day they had descended as far as the tierra templada the zona of the table lands and foot hills the mountains were receding in their rear but still towered exhibiting yet impressively their formidable heads here they met signs of man they saw the white houses of coffee plantations gleam across the clear ings they struck into a road where they met travellers and pack mules cattle were grazing on the slopes they passed a little village where the round eyed ni os shrieked and called at sight of them mlle giraud laid aside her leopard skin robe it seemed to be a trifle incongruous now in the moun tains it had appeared fitting and natural and if arm strong was not mistaken she laid aside with it something of the high dignity of her demeanour as the country became more populous and significant of comfortable life he saw with a feeling of joy that the exalted princess and priestess of the andean peaks was changing to a woman an earth woman but no less enticing a little colour crept to the surface of her marble cheek she arranged the conventional dress that the removal of the robe now disclosed with the solicitous touch of one who is conscious of the eyes of others she smoothed the careless sweep of her hair a mundane interest long latent in the chilling atmosphere of the ascetic peaks showed in her eyes this thaw in his divinity sent armstrong s heart going faster so might an arctic explorer thrill at his first ken of green fields and liquescent waters they were on a lower plane of earth and life and were succumbing to its peculiar subtle influence the austerity of the hills no longer thinned the air they breathed about them was the breath of fruit and corn and builded homes the comfortable smell of smoke and warm earth and the consolations man has placed between himself and the dust of his brother earth from which he sprung while traversing those awful mountains mile giraud had seemed to be wrapped in their spirit of reverent reserve was this that same woman now palpitating warm eager throbbing with conscious life and charm feminine to her finger tips pondering over this armstrong felt certain misgivings intrude upon his thoughts he wished he could stop there with this changing creature descending no farther here was the elevation and environment to which her nature seemed to respond with its best he feared to go down upon the man dominated levels would her spirit not yield still further in that artificial zone to which they were descending now from a little plateau they saw the sea flash at the edge of the green lowlands mile giraud gave a little catching sigh oh look mr armstrong there is the sea isn t it lovely i m so tired of mountains she heaved a pretty shoulder in a gesture of repugnance those horrid indians just think of what i suffered although i suppose i attained my ambition of becoming a stellar attraction i wouldn t care to repeat the engagement it was very nice of you to bring me away tell me mr armstrong honestly now do i look such an awful awful fright i haven t looked into a mirror you know for months armstrong made answer according to his changed moods also he laid his hand upon hers as it rested upon the horn of her saddle luis was at the head of the pack train and could not see she allowed it to remain there and her eyes smiled frankly into his then at sundown they dropped upon the coast level under the palms and lemons among the vivid greens and searlets and ochres of the tierra caliente they rode into macuto and saw the line of volatile bathers frolick ing in the surf the mountains were very far away mlle giraud s eyes were shining with a joy that could not have existed under the chaperonage of the mountain tops there were other spirits calling to her nymphs of the orange groves pixies from the chattering surf imps born of the music the perfumes colours and the insinuating presence of humanity she laughed aloud musically at a sudden thought won t there be a sensation she called to armstrong don t i wish i had an engagement just now though what a picnic the press agent would have held a prisoner by a band of savage indians subdued by the spell of her wonderful voice wouldn t that make great stuff but i guess i quit the game winner anyhow there ought to be a couple of thousand dollars in that sack of gold dust i collected as encores don t you think he left her at the door of the little hotel de buen descansar where she had stopped before two hours later he returned to the hotel he glanced in at the open door of the little combined reception room and cafe half a dozen of macuto s representative social and official caballeros were distributed about the room sefior villablanca the wealthy rubber concessionist reposed his fat figure on two chairs with an emollient smile beaming upon his chocolate coloured face guil bert the french mining engineer leered through his polished nose glasses colonel mendez of the regular army in gold laced uniform and fatuous grin was busily extracting corks from champagne bottles other pat terns of macutian gallantry and fashion pranced and posed the air was hazy with cigarette smoke wine dripped upon the floor perched upon a table in the centre of the room in an attitude of easy preeminence was mlle giraud a chic costume of white lawn and cherry ribbons supplanted her travelling garb there was a suggestion of lace and a frill or two with a discreet small implication of hand embroidered pink hosiery upon her lap rested a guitar in her face was the light of resurrection the peace of elysium attained through fire and suffering she was singing to a lively accompaniment a little song when you see de big round moon comin up like a balloon dis nigger skips fur to kiss de lips ob his stylish black faced coon the singer caught sight of armstrong hi there johnny she called i ve been expecting you for an hour what kept you gee but these smoked guys are the slowest you ever saw they ain t on at all come along in and i ll make this coffee coloured old sport with the gold epaulettes open one for you right off the ice thank you said armstrong not just now i believe i ve several things to attend to he walked out and down the street and met rucker coming up from the consulate play you a game of billiards said armstrong i want something to take the taste of the sea level out of my mouth girl in gilt letters on the ground glass of the door of room no were the words robbins hartley brokers the clerks had gone it was past five and with the solid tramp of a drove of prize percherons scrub women were invading the cloud capped twenty story office building a puff of red hot air flavoured with lemon peelings soft coal smoke and train oil came in through the half open windows robbins fifty something of an overweight beau and addicted to first nights and hotel palm rooms pretended to be envious of his partner s commuter s joys going to be something doing in the humidity line to night he said you out of town chaps will be the people with your katydids and moonlight and long drinks and things out on the front porch hartley twenty nine serious thin good looking ner vous sighed and frowned a little yes said he we always have cool nights in floral hurst especially in the winter a man with an air of mystery came in the door and went up to hartley i ve found where she lives he announced in the portentous half whisper that makes the detective at work a marked being to his fellow men hartley scowled him into a state of dramatic silence and quietude but by that time robbins had got his cane and set his tie pin to his liking and with a debonair nod went out to his metropolitan amusements here is the address said the detective in a natural tone being deprived of an audience to foil hartley took the leaf torn out of the sleuth s dingy memorandum book on it were pencilled the words vivienne arlington no east th street care of mrs mccomus moved there a week ago said the detective now if you want any shadowing done mr hartley i can do you as fine a job in that line as anybody in the city it will be only a day and expenses can send in a daily typewritten report covering you needn t go on interrupted the broker it isn t a case of that kind i merely wanted the address how much shall i pay you one day s work said the sleuth a tenner will cover it hartley paid the man and dismissed him then he left the office and boarded a broadway car at the first large crosstown artery of travel he took an eastbound car that deposited him in a decaying avenue whose ancient structures once sheltered the pride and glory of the town walking a few squares he came to the building that he sought it was a new flathouse bearing carved upon its cheap stone portal its sonorous name the vallambrosa fire escapes zigzagged down its front these laden with household goods drying clothes and squalling children evicted by the midsummer heat here and there a pale rubber plant peeped from the miscellaneous mass as if wondering to what kingdom it belonged vegetable animal or artificial hartley pressed the mccomus button the door latch clicked spasmodically now hospitably now doubt fully as though in anxiety whether it might be admitting friends or duns hartley entered and began to climb the stairs after the manner of those who seek their friends in city flat houses which is the manner of a boy who climbs an apple tree stopping when he comes upon what he wants on the fourth floor he saw vivienne standing in an open door she invited him inside with a nod and a bright genuine smile she placed a chair for him near a window and poised herself gracefully upon the edge of one of those jekyll and hyde pieces of furniture that are masked and mysteriously hooded unguessable bulks by day and inquisitorial racks of torture by night hartley cast a quick critical appreciative glance at her before speaking and told himself that his taste in choosing had been flawless vivienne was about twenty one she was of the purest saxon type her hair was a ruddy golden each filament of the neatly gathered mass shining with its own lustre and delicate graduation of colour in perfect harmony were her ivory clear complexion and deep sea blue eyes that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness and yet with all her north ern clearness and frankness of line and colouring there seemed to be something of the tropics in her something of languor in the droop of her pose of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing something that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beauti ful milk white dove among its sober hued companions she was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt that discreet masquerade of goose girl and duchess vivienne said hartley looking at her pleadingly you did not answer my last letter it was only by nearly a week s search that i found where you had moved to why have you kept me in suspense when you knew how anxiously i was waiting to see you and hear from you the girl looked out the window dreamily mr hartley she said hesitatingly i hardly know what to say to you i realize all the advantages of your offer and sometimes i feel sure that i could be contented with you but again i am doubtful i was born a city girl and i am afraid to bind myself to a quiet sub urban life my dear girl said hartley ardently have i not told you that you shall have everything that your heart can desire that is in my power to give you you shall come to the city for the theatres for shopping and to visit your friends as often as you care to you can trust me can you not to the fullest she said turning her frank eyes upon him with a smile i know you are the kindest of men and that the girl you get will be a lucky one i learned all about you when i was at the montgomerys ah exclaimed hartley with a tender reminiscent light in his eye i remember well the evening i first saw you at the montgomerys mrs montgomery was sound ing your praises to me all the evening and she hardly did you justice i shall never forget that supper come vivienne promise me i want you you ll never regret coming with me no one else will ever give you as pleasant a home the girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands a sudden jealous suspicion seized hartley tell me vivienne he asked regarding her keenly is there another is there some one else a rosy flush crept slowly over her fair cheeks and neck you shouldn t ask that mr hartley she said in some confusion but i will tell you there is one other but he has no right i have promised him nothing his name demanded hartley sternly townsend rafford townsend exclaimed hartley with a grim tightening of his jaw how did that man come to know you after all i ve done for him his auto has just stopped below said vivienne bending over the window sill he s coming for his answer oh i don t know what to do the bell in the flat kitchen whirred vivienne hurried to press the latch button stay here said hartley i will meet him in the hall townsend looking like a spanish grandee in his light tweeds panama hat and curling black mustache came up the stairs three at a time he stopped at sight of hartley and looked foolish go back said hartley firmly pointing downstairs with his forefinger hullo said townsend feigning surprise what s up what are you doing here old man go back repeated hartley inflexibly the law of the jungle do you want the pack to tear you in pieces the kill is mine i came here to see a plumber about the bathroom connections said townsend bravely all right said hartley you shall have that lying plaster to stick upon your traitorous soul but go back townsend went downstairs leaving a bitter word to be wafted up the draught of the staircase hartley went back to his wooing vivienne said he masterfully i have got to have you i will take no more refusals or dilly dallying when do you want me she asked now as soon as you can get ready she stood calmly before him and looked him in the eye do you think for one moment she said that i would enter your home while h loise is there hartley cringed as if from an unexpected blow he folded his arms and paced the carpet once or twice she shall go he declared grimly drops stood upon his brow why should i let that woman make my life miserable never have i seen one day of freedom from trouble since i have known her you are right vivienne h loise must be sent away before i can take you home but she shall go i have decided i will turn her from my doors when will you do this asked the girl hartley clinched his teeth and bent his brows together to night he said resolutely i will send her away to night then said vivienne my answer is yes come for me when you will she looked into his eyes with a sweet sincere light in her own hartley could scarcely believe that her sur render was true it was so swift and complete promise me he said feelingly on your word and honour on my word and honour repeated vivienne softly at the door he turned and gazed at her happily but yet as one who scarcely trusts the foundations of his joy to morrow he said with a forefinger of reminder uplifted to morrow she repeated with a smile of truth and candour in an hour and forty minutes hartley stepped off the train at floralhurst a brisk walk of ten minutes brought him to the gate of a handsome two story cottage set upon a wide and well tended lawn halfway to the house he was met by a woman with jet black braided hair and flowing white summer gown who half strangled him without apparent cause when they stepped into the hall she said mamma s here the auto is coming for her in half an hour she came to dinner but there s no dinner i ve something to tell you said hartley i thought to break it to you gently but since your mother is here we may as well out with it he stooped and whispered something at her ear his wife screamed her mother came running into the hall the dark haired woman screamed again the joyful scream of a well beloved and petted woman oh mamma she cried ecstatically what do you think vivienne is coming to cook for us she is the one that stayed with the montgomerys a whole year and now billy dear she concluded you must go right down into the kitchen and discharge h loise she has been drunk again the whole day long sociology in serge and straw the season of irresponsibility is at hand come let us twine round our brows wreaths of poison ivy that is for idiocy and wander hand in hand with sociology in the summer fields likely as not the world is flat the wise men have tried to prove that it is round with indifferent success they pointed out to us a ship going to sea and bade us observe that at length the convexity of the earth hid from our view all but the vessel s topmast but we picked up a telescope and looked and saw the decks and hull again then the wise men said oh pshaw anyhow the variation of the intersection of the equator and the ecliptic proves it we could not see this through our telescope so we remained silent but it stands to reason that if the world were round the queues of china men would stand straight up from their heads instead of hanging down their backs as travellers assure us they do another hot weather corroboration of the flat theory is the fact that all of life as we know it moves in little unavailing circles more justly than to anything else it can be likened to the game of baseball crack we hit the ball and away we go if we earn a run in life we call it success we get back to the home plate and sit upon a bench if we are thrown out we walk back to the home plate and sit upon a bench the circumnavigators of the alleged globe may have sailed the rim of a watery circle back to the same port again the truly great return at the high tide of their attainments to the simplicity of a child the billionaire sits down at his mahogany to his bowl of bread and milk when you reach the end of your career just take down the sign goal and look at the other side of it you will find beginning point there it has been reversed while you were going around the track but this is humour and must be stopped let us get back to the serious questions that arise whenever sociology turns summer boarder you are invited to consider the scene of the story wild atlantic waves thundering against a wooded and rock bound shore in the greater city of new york the town of fishampton on the south shore of long island is noted for its clam fritters and the summer residence of the van plushvelts the van plushvelts have a hundred million dollars and their name is a household word with tradesmen and photographers on the fifteenth of june the van plushvelts boarded up the front door of their city house carefully deposited their cat on the sidewalk instructed the caretaker not to allow it to eat any of the ivy on the walls and whizzed away in a horse power to fishampton to stray alone the shade amaryllis not being in their class if a subscriber to the toadies magazine you have often you say you are not well you buy it at a news stand thinking that the newsdealer is not wise to you but he knows about it all he knows he knows i say that you have often seen in the toadies magazine pictures of the van plushvelts summer home so it will not be described here our business is with young haywood van plushvelt sixteen years old heir to the century of millions darling of the financial gods and great grandson of peter van plushvelt former owner of a particularly fine cabbage patch that has been ruined by an intrusive lot of downtown skyscrapers one afternoon young haywood van plushvelt strolled out between the granite gate posts of dolce far niente that s what they called the place and it was an improve ment on dolce far rockaway i can tell you haywood walked down into the village he was human after all and his prospective millions weighed upon him wealth had wreaked upon him its direfullest he was the product of private tutors even under his first hobby horse had tan bark been strewn he had been born with a gold spoon lobster fork and fish set in his mouth for which i hope later to submit justification i must ask your consideration of his haberdashery and tailoring young fortunatus was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge a neat white straw hat neat low cut tan shoes of the well known immaculate trade mark a neat narrow four in hand tie and carried a slender neat bamboo cane down persimmon street there s never tree north of hagerstown md came from the village smoky dodson fifteen and a half worst boy in fishampton smoky was dressed in a ragged red sweater wrecked and weather worn golf cap run over shoes and trousers of the serviceable brand dust clinging to the mois ture induced by free exercise darkened wide areas of his face smoky carried a baseball bat and a league ball that advertised itself in the rotundity of his trousers pocket haywood stopped and passed the time of day going to play ball he asked smoky s eyes and countenance confronted him with a frank blue and freckled scrutiny me he said with deadly mildness sure not can t you see i ve got a divin suit on i m goin up in a submarine balloon to catch butterflies with a two inch auger excuse me said haywood with the insulting polite ness of his caste for mistaking you for a gentleman i might have known better how might you have known better if you thought i was one said smoky unconsciously a logician by your appearances said haywood no gentle man is dirty ragged and a liar smoky hooted once like a ferry boat spat on his hand got a firm grip on his baseball bat and then dropped it against the fence say said he i knows you you re the pup that belongs in that swell private summer sanitarium for city guys over there i seen you come out of the gate you can t bluff nobody because you re rich and because you got on swell clothes arabella yah ragamuffin said hay wood smoky picked up a fence rail splinter and laid it on his shoulder dare you to knock it off he challenged i wouldn t soil my hands with you said the aristocrat fraid said smoky concisely youse city ducks ain t got the i sand i kin lick you with one hand i don t wish to have any trouble with you said haywood i asked you a civil question and you replied like a like a a cad wot s a cad asked smoky a cad is a disagreeable person answered haywood who lacks manners and doesn t know his place they sometimes play baseball i can tell you what a mollycoddle is said smoky it s a monkey dressed up by its mother and sent out too pick daisies on the lawn when you have the honour to refer to the members of my family said haywood with some dim ideas of a code in his mind you d better leave the ladies out of your remarks ho ladies mocked the rude one i say ladies i know what them rich women in the city does they drink cocktails and swear and give parties to gorillas the papers says so then haywood knew that it must be he took off his coat folded it neatly and laid it on the roadside grass placed his hat upon it and began to unknot his blue silk tie hadn t yer better ring fer yer maid arabella taunted smoky wot yer going to do go to bed i m going to give you a good trouncing said the hero he did not hesitate although the enemy was far beneath him socially he remembered that his father once thrashed a cabman and the papers gave it two col umns first page and the toadies magazine had a special article on upper cuts by the upper classes and ran new pictures of the van plushvelt country seat at fishampton wot s trouncing asked smoky suspiciously i don t want your old clothes i m no oh you mean to scrap my my i won t do a thing to mamma s pet criminy i d hate to be a hand laundered thing like you smoky waited with some awkwardness for his adversary to prepare for battle his own decks were always clear for action when he should spit upon the palm of his terrible right it was equivalent to you may fire now gridley the hated patrician advanced with his shirt sleeves neatly rolled up smoky waited in an attitude of ease expecting the affair to be conducted according to fishampton s rules of war these allowed combat to be prefaced by stigma recrimination epithet abuse and insult gradually increasing in emphasis and degree after a round of these you re anothers would come the chip knocked from the shoulder or the advance across the dare line drawn with a toe on the ground next light taps given and taken these also increasing in force until finally the blood was up and fists going at their best but haywood did not know fishampton s rules noblesse oblige kept a faint smile on his face as he walked slowly up to smoky and said going to play ball smoky quickly understood this to be a putting of the previous question giving him the chance to make practical apology by answering it with civility and relevance listen this time said he i m goin skatin on the river don t you see me automobile with chinese lanterns on it standin and waitin for me haywood knocked him down smoky felt wronged to thus deprive him of preliminary wrangle and objurgation was to send an armoured knight full tilt against a crashing lance without permitting him first to caracole around the list to the flourish of trumpets but he scrambled up and fell upon his foe head feet and fists the fight lasted one round of an hour and ten minutes it was lengthened until it was more like a war or a family feud than a fight haywood had learned some of the science of boxing and wrestling from his tutors but these he discarded for the more instinctive methods of battle handed down by the cave dwelling van plushvelts so when he found himself during the m l e seated upon the kicking and roaring smoky s chest he improved the opportunity by vigorously kneading hand fuls of sand and soil into his adversary s ears eyes and mouth and when smoky got the proper leg hold and turned him he fastened both hands in the plushvelt hair and pounded the plushvelt head against the lap of mother earth of course the strife was not incessantly active there were seasons when one sat upon the other holding him down while each blew like a grampus spat out the more inconveniently large sections of gravel and and strove to subdue the spirit of his opponent with a frightful and soul paralyzing glare at last it seemed that in the language of the ring their efforts lacked steam they broke away and each disappeared in a cloud as he brushed away the dust of the conflict as soon as his breath permitted haywood walked close to smoky and said going to play ball smoky looked pensively at the sky at his bat lying on the ground and at the leaguer rounding his pocket sure he said offhandedly the yellowjackets plays the long islands i m cap n of the long islands i guess i didn t mean to say you were ragged said haywood but you are dirty you know sure said smoky yer get that way knockin around say i don t believe them new york papers about ladies drinkin and havin monkeys dinin at the table with em i guess they re lies like they print about people eatin out of silver plates and ownin dogs that cost certainly said haywood what do you play on your team ketcher ever play any never in my life said haywood i ve never known any fellows except one or two of my cousins jer like to learn we re goin to have a practice game before the match wanter come along i ll put yer in left field and yer won t be long ketchin on i d like it bully said haywood i ve alway wanted to play baseball the ladies maids of new york and the families of western mine owners with social ambitions will remember well the sensation that was created by the report that the young multi millionaire haywood van plushvelt was playing ball with the village youths of fishampton it was conceded that the millennium of democracy had come reporters and photographers swarmed to the island the papers printed half page pictures of him as short stop stopping a hot grounder the toadies magazine got out a bat and ball number that covered the subject historically beginning with the vampire bat and ending with the patriarchs ball illustrated with interior views of the van plushvelt country seat ministers educators and sociologists everywhere hailed the event as the tocsin call that proclaimed the universal brotherhood of man one afternoon i was reclining under the trees near the shore at fishampton in the esteemed company of an eminent bald headed young sociologist by way of note it may be inserted that all sociologists are more or less bald and exactly thirty two look em over the sociologist was citing the van plushvelt case as the most important uplift symptom of a generation and as an excuse for his own existence immediately before us were the village baseball grounds and now came the sportive youth of fishampton and distributed themselves shouting about the diamond there said the sociologist pointing there is young van plushvelt i raised myself so far a cosycophant with mary ann and gazed young van plushvelt sat upon the ground he was dressed in a ragged red sweater wrecked and weather worn golf cap run over shoes and trousers of the ser viceable brand dust clinging to the moisture induced by free exercise darkened wide areas of his face that is he repeated the sociologist if he had said him i could have been less vindictive on a bench with an air sat the young millionaire s chum he was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge a neat white straw hat neat low cut tan shoes linen of the well known immaculate trade mark a neat narrow four in hand tie and carried a slender neat bamboo cane i laughed loudly and vulgarly what you want to do said i to the sociologist is to establish a reformatory for the logical vicious circle or else i ve got wheels it looks to me as if things are running round and round in circles instead of getting anywhere what do you mean asked the man of progress why look what he has done to smoky i replied you will always be a fool said my friend the sociologist getting up and walking away the ransom of red chief it looked like a good thing but wait till i tell you we were down south in alabama bill driscoll and myself when this kidnapping idea struck us it was as bill afterward expressed it during a moment of temporary mental apparition but we didn t find that out till later there was a town down there as flat as a flannel cake and called summit of course it contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and self satisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a maypole bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town lot scheme in western illinois with we talked it over on the front steps of the hotel philoprogenitiveness says we is strong in semi rural communities therefore and for other reasons a kidnapping project ought to do better there than in the radius of newspapers that send reporters out in plain clothes to stir up talk about such things we knew that summit couldn t get after us with anything stronger than constables and maybe some lackadaisical blood hounds and a diatribe or two in the weekly farmers budget so it looked good we selected for our victim the only child of a prominent citizen named ebenezer dorset the father was respect able and tight a mortgage fancier and a stern upright collection plate passer and forecloser the kid was a boy of ten with bas relief freckles and hair the colour of the cover of the magazine you buy at the news stand when you want to catch a train bill and me figured that ebenezer would melt down for a ransom of two thousand dollars to a cent but wait till i tell you about two miles from summit was a little mountain covered with a dense cedar brake on the rear elevation of this mountain was a cave there we stored provisions one evening after sundown we drove in a buggy past old dorset s house the kid was in the street throw ing rocks at a kitten on the opposite fence hey little boy says bill would you like to have a bag of candy and a nice ride the boy catches bill neatly in the eye with a piece of brick that will cost the old man an extra five hundred dollars says bill climbing over the wheel that boy put up a fight like a welter weight cinnamon bear but at last we got him down in the bottom of the buggy and drove away we took him up to the cave and i hitched the horse in the cedar brake after dark i drove the buggy to the little village three miles away where we had hired it and walked back to the moun tain bill was pasting court plaster over the scratches and bruises on his features there was a burning behind the big rock at the entrance of the cave and the boy was watching a pot of boiling coffee with two buzzard tail feathers stuck in his red hair he points a stick at me when i come up and says ha cursed paleface do you dare to enter the camp of red chief the terror of the plains he s all right now says bill rolling up his trousers and examining some bruises on his shins we re playing indian we re making buffalo bill s show look like magic lantern views of palestine in the town hall i m old hank the trapper red chief s captive and i m to be scalped at daybreak by geronimo that kid can kick hard yes sir that boy seemed to be having the time of his life the fun of camping out in a cave had made him forget that he was a captive himself he immediately christened me snake eye the spy and announced that when his braves returned from the warpath i was to be broiled at the stake at the rising of the sun then we had supper and he filled his mouth full of bacon and bread and gravy and began to talk he made a during dinner speech something like this i like this fine i never camped out before but i had a pet possum once and i was nine last birthday i hate to go to school rats ate up sixteen of jimmy talbot s aunt s speckled hen s eggs are there any real indians in these woods i want some more gravy does the trees moving make the wind blow we had five puppies what makes your nose so red hank my father has lots of money are the stars hot i whipped ed walker twice saturday i don t like girls you dassent catch toads unless with a string do oxen make any noise why are oranges round have you got beds to sleep on in this cave amos murray has got six toes a parrot can talk but a monkey or a fish can t how many does it take to make twelve every few minutes he would remember that he was a pesky redskin and pick up his stick rifle and tiptoe to the mouth of the cave to rubber for the scouts of the hated paleface now and then he would let out a war whoop that made old hank the trapper shiver that boy had bill terrorized from the start red chief says i to the kid would you like to go home aw what for says he i don t have any fun at home i hate to go to school i like to camp out you won t take me back home again snake eye will you not right away says i we ll stay here in the cave a while all right says he that ll be fine i never had such fun in all my life we went to bed about eleven o clock we spread down some wide blankets and quilts and put red chief between us we weren t afraid he d run away he kept us awake for three hours jumping up and reaching for his rifle and screeching hist pard in mine and bill s ears as the fancied crackle of a twig or the rustle of a leaf revealed to his young imagination the stealthy approach of the outlaw band at last i fell into a troubled sleep and dreamed that i had been kidnapped and chained to a tree by a ferocious pirate with red hair just at daybreak i was awakened by a series of awful screams from bill they weren t yells or howls or shouts or whoops or yalps such as you d expect from a manly set of vocal organs they were simply indecent terrifying humiliating screams such as women emit when they see ghosts or caterpillars it s an awful thing to hear a strong desperate fat man scream incontinently in a cave at daybreak i jumped up to see what the matter was red chief was sitting on bill s chest with one hand twined in bill s hair in the other he had the sharp case knife we used for slicing bacon and he was industriously and realistically trying to take bill s scalp according to the sentence that had been pronounced upon him the evening before i got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again but from that moment bill s spirit was broken he laid down on his side of the bed but he never closed an eye again in sleep as long as that boy was with us i dozed off for a while but along toward sun up i remem bered that red chief had said i was to be burned at the stake at the rising of the sun i wasn t nervous or afraid but i sat up and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock what you getting up so soon for sam asked bill me says i oh i got a kind of a pain in my shoulder i thought sitting up would rest it you re a liar says bill you re afraid you was to be burned at sunrise and you was afraid he d do it and he would too if he could find a match ain t it awful sam do you think anybody will pay out money to get a little imp like that back home sure said i a rowdy kid like that is just the kind that parents dote on now you and the chief get up and cook breakfast while i go up on the top of this mountain and reconnoitre i went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the contiguous vicinity over toward summit i expected to see the sturdy yeomanry of the village armed with scythes and pitchforks beating the countryside for the dastardly kidnappers but what i saw was a peaceful landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule nobody was dragging the creek no couriers dashed hither and yon bringing tidings of no news to the distracted parents there was a sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness pervading that section of the external outward surface of alabama that lay exposed to my view perhaps says i to myself it has not yet been discov ered that the wolves have home away the tender lambkin from the fold heaven help the wolves says i and i went down the mountain to breakfast when i got to the cave i found bill backed up against the side of it breathing hard and the boy threatening to smash him with a rock half as big as a cocoanut he put a red hot boiled potato down my back explained bill and the mashed it with his foot and i boxed his ears have you got a gun about you sam i took the rock away from the boy and kind of patched up the argument i ll fix you says the kid to bill no man ever yet struck the red chief but what he got paid for it you better beware after breakfast the kid takes a piece of leather with strings wrapped around it out of his pocket and goes out side the cave unwinding it what s he up to now says bill anxiously you don t think he ll run away do you sam no fear of it says i he don t seem to be much of a home body but we ve got to fix up some plan about the ransom there don t seem to be much excitement around summit on account of his disappearance but maybe they haven t realized yet that he s gone his folks may think he s spending the night with aunt jane or one of the neighbours anyhow he ll be missed to day to night we must get a message to his father demanding the two thousand dollars for his return just then we heard a kind of war whoop such as david might have emitted when he knocked out the champion goliath it was a sling that red chief had pulled out of his pocket and he was whirling it around his head i dodged and heard a heavy thud and a kind of a sigh from bill like a horse gives out when you take his saddle off a niggerhead rock the size of an egg had caught bill just behind his left ear he loosened himself all over and fell in the fire across the frying pan of hot water for washing the dishes i dragged him out and poured cold water on his head for half an hour by and by bill sits up and feels behind his ear and says sam do you know who my favourite biblical character is take it easy says i you ll come to your senses presently king herod says he you won t go away and leave me here alone will you sam i went out and caught that boy and shook him until his freckles rattled if you don t behave says i i ll take you straight home now are you going to be good or not i was only funning says he sullenly i didn t mean to hurt old hank but what did he hit me for i ll behave snake eye if you won t send me home and if you ll let me play the black scout to day i don t know the game says i that s for you and mr bill to decide he s your playmate for the day i m going away for a while on business now you come in and make friends with him and say you are sorry for hurting him or home you go at once i made him and bill shake hands and then i took bill aside and told him i was going to poplar cove a little village three miles from the cave and find out what i could about how the kidnapping had been regarded in summit also i thought it best to send a peremptory letter to old man dorset that day demanding the ransom and dictating how it should be paid you know sam says bill i ve stood by you with out batting an eye in earthquakes fire and flood in poker games dynamite outrages police raids train robberies and cyclones i never lost my nerve yet till we kidnapped that two legged skyrocket of a kid he s got me going you won t leave me long with him will you sam i ll be back some time this afternoon says i you must keep the boy amused and quiet till i return and now we ll write the letter to old dorset bill and i got paper and pencil and worked on the letter while red chief with a blanket wrapped around him strutted up and down guarding the mouth of the cave bill begged me tearfully to make the ransom fifteen hundred dollars instead of two thousand i ain t attempting says he to decry the celebrated moral aspect of parental affection but we re dealing with humans and it ain t human for anybody to give up two thousand dollars for that forty pound chunk of freckled wildcat i m willing to take a chance at fifteen hundred dollars you can charge the difference up to me so to relieve bill i acceded and we collaborated a letter that ran this way ebenezer dorset esq we have your boy concealed in a place far from summit it is useless for you or the most skilful detectives to attempt to find him absolutely the only terms on which you can have him restored to you are these we demand fifteen hundred dollars in large bills for his return the money to be left at midnight to night at the same spot and in the same box as your reply as hereinafter described if you agree to these terms send your answer in writing by a solitary messenger to night at half past eight o clock after crossing owl creek on the road to poplar cove there are three large trees about a hundred yards apart close to the fence of the wheat field on the right hand side at the bottom of the fence post opposite the third tree will be found a small pasteboard box the messenger will place the answer in this box and return immediately to summit if you attempt any treachery or fail to comply with our demand as stated you will never see your boy again if you pay the money as demanded he will be returned to you safe and well within three hours these terms are final and if you do not accede to them no further coin munication will be attempted two desperate men i addressed this letter to dorset and put it in my pocket as i was about to start the kid comes up to me and says aw snake eye you said i could play the black scout while you was gone play it of course says i mr bill will play with you what kind of a game is it i m the black scout says red chief and i have to ride to the stockade to warn the settlers that the indians are coming i m tired of playing indian myself i want to be the black scout all right says i it sounds harmless to me i guess mr bill will help you foil the pesky savages what am i to do asks bill looking at the kid suspiciously you are the hoss says black scout get down on your hands and knees how can i ride to the stockade without a hoss you d better keep him interested said i till we get the scheme going loosen up bill gets down on his all fours and a look comes in his eye like a rabbit s when you catch it in a trap how far is it to the stockade kid he asks in a husky manner of voice ninety miles says the black scout and you have to hump yourself to get there on time whoa now the black scout jumps on bill s back and digs his heels in his side for heaven s sake says bill hurry back sam as soon as you can i wish we hadn t made the ransom more than a thousand say you quit kicking me or i ll get up and warm you good i walked over to poplar cove and sat around the post office and store talking with the chawbacons that came in to trade one whiskerando says that he hears summit is all upset on account of elder ebenezer dorset s boy having been lost or stolen that was all i wanted to know i bought some smoking tobacco referred casually to the price of black eyed peas posted my letter surreptitiously and came away the postmaster said the mail carrier would come by in an hour to take the mail on to summit when i got back to the cave bill and the boy were not to be found i explored the vicinity of the cave and risked a yodel or two but there was no response so i lighted my pipe and sat down on a mossy bank to await developments in about half an hour i heard the bushes rustle and bill wabbled out into the little glade in front of the cave behind him was the kid stepping softly like a scout with a broad grin on his face bill stopped took off his hat and wiped his face with a red handkerchief the kid stopped about eight feet behind him sam says bill i suppose you ll think i m a rene gade but i couldn t help it i m a grown person with masculine proclivities and habits of self defense but there is a time when all systems of egotism and predominance fail the boy is gone i have sent him home all is off there was martyrs in old times goes on bill that suffered death rather than give up the particular graft they enjoyed none of em ever was subjugated to such supernatural tortures as i have been i tried to be faithful to our articles of depredation but there came a limit what s the trouble bill i asks him i was rode says bill the ninety miles to the stockade not barring an inch then when the settlers was rescued i was given oats sand ain t a palatable substitute and then for an hour i had to try to explain to him why there was nothin in holes how a road can run both ways and what makes the grass green i tell you sam a human can only stand so much i takes him by the neck of his clothes and drags him down the mountain on the way he kicks my legs black and blue from the knees down and i ve got to have two or three bites on my thumb and hand cauterized but he s gone continues bill gone home i showed him the road to summit and kicked him about eight feet nearer there at one kick i m sorry we lose the ransom but it was either that or bill driscoll to the madhouse bill is puffing and blowing but there is a look of ineffable peace and growing content on his rose pink features bill says i there isn t any heart disease in your family is there no says bill nothing chronic except malaria and accidents why then you might turn around says i and have a took behind you bill turns and sees the boy and loses his complexion and sits down plump on the round and begins to pluck aimlessly at grass and little sticks for an hour i was afraid for his mind and then i told him that my scheme was to put the whole job through immediately and that we would get the ransom and be off with it by midnight if old dorset fell in with our proposition so bill braced up enough to give the kid a weak sort of a smile and a promise to play the russian in a japanese war with him is soon as he felt a little better i had a scheme for collecting that ransom without danger of being caught by counterplots that ought to commend itself to professional kidnappers the tree under which the answer was to be left and the money later on was close to the road fence with big bare fields on all sides if a gang of constables should be watching for any one to come for the note they could see him a long way off crossing the fields or in the road but no sirree at half past eight i was up in that tree as well hidden as a tree toad waiting for the messenger to arrive exactly on time a half grown boy rides up the road on a bicycle locates the pasteboard box at the foot of the fence post slips a folded piece of paper into it and pedals away again back toward summit i waited an hour and then concluded the thing was square i slid down the tree got the note slipped along the fence till i struck the woods and was back at the cave in another half an hour i opened the note got near the lantern and read it to bill it was written with a pen in a crabbed hand and the sum and substance of it was this two desperate men gentlemen i received your letter to day by post in regard to the ransom you ask for the return of my son i think you are a little high in your demands and i hereby make you a counter proposition which i am inclined to believe you will accept you bring johnny home and pay me two hundred and fifty dollars in cash and i agree to take him off your hands you had better come at night for the neighbours believe he is lost and i couldn t be responsible for what they would do to anybody they saw bringing him back very respectfully ebenezer dorset great pirates of penzance says i of all the impudent but i glanced at bill and hesitated he had the most appealing look in his eyes i ever saw on the face of a dumb or a talking brute sam says he what s two hundred and fifty dollars after all we ve got the money one more night of this kid will send me to a bed in bedlam besides being a thorough gentleman i think mr dorset is a spend thrift for making us such a liberal offer you ain t going to let the chance go are you tell you the truth bill says i this little he ewe lamb has somewhat got on my nerves too we ll take him home pay the ransom and make our get away we took him home that night we got him to go by telling him that his father had bought a silver mounted rifle and a pair of moccasins for him and we were going to hunt bears the next day it was just twelve o clock when we knocked at ebene zer s front door just at the moment when i should have been abstracting the fifteen hundred dollars from the box under the tree according to the original proposition bill was counting out two hundred and fifty dollars into dorset s hand when the kid found out we were going to leave him at home he started up a howl like a calliope and fastened himself as tight as a leech to bill s leg his father peeled him away gradually like a porous plaster how long can you hold him asks bill i m not as strong as i used to be says old dorset but i think i can promise you ten minutes enough says bill in ten minutes i shall cross the central southern and middle western states and be legging it trippingly for the canadian border and as dark as it was and as fat as bill was and as good a runner as i am he was a good mile and a half out of summit before i could

how goes it old girl this may who is no goddess but circe masquerading at the dance given in honour of the fair d butante sum mer puts the kibosh on us all old mr coulson groaned a little and then sat up straight in his invalid s chair he had the gout very bad in one foot a house near gramercy park half a million dollars and a daughter and he had a house keeper mrs widdup the fact and the name deserve a sentence each they have it when may poked mr coulson he became elder brother to the turtle dove in the window near which he sat were boxes of jonquils of hyacinths geraniums and pansies the breeze brought their odour into the room immediately there was a well contested round between the breath of the flowers and the able and active effluvium from gout liniment the liniment won easily but not before the flowers got an uppercut to old mr coulson s nose the deadly work of the implacable false enchant ress may was done across the park to the olfactories of mr coulson came other unmistakable characteristic copyrighted smells of spring that belong to the big city above the subway alone the smells of hot asphalt underground caverns gasoline patchouli orange peel sewer gas albany grabs egyptian cigarettes mortar and the undried ink on news papers the inblowing air was sweet and mild sparrows wrangled happily everywhere outdoors never trust may mr coulson twisted the ends of his white mustache cursed his foot and pounded a bell on the table by his side in came mrs widdup she was comely to the eye fair flustered forty and foxy higgins is out sir she said with a smile suggestive of vibratory massage he went to post a letter can i do anything for you sir it s time for my aconite said old mr coulson drop it for me the bottle s there three drops in water d that is confound higgins there s nobody in this house cares if i die here in this chair for want of attention mrs widdup sighed deeply don t be saying that sir she said there s them that would care more than any one knows thirteen drops you said sir three said old man coulson he took his dose and then mrs widdup s hand she blushed oh yes it can be done just hold your breath and compress the diaphragm mrs widdup said mr coulson the springtime s full upon us ain t that right said mrs widdup the air s real warm and there s bock beer signs on every corner and the park s all yaller and pink and blue with flowers and i have such shooting pains up my legs and body in the spring quoted mr coulson curling his mustache a y that is a man s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love lawsy now exclaimed mrs widdup ain t that right seems like it s in the air in the spring continued old mr coulson a livelier iris shines upon the burnished dove they do be lively the irish sighed mrs widdup pensively mrs widdup said mr coulson making a face at a twinge of his gouty foot this would be a lonesome house without you i m an that is i m an elderly man but i m worth a comfortable lot of money if half a million dollars worth of government bonds and the true affection of a heart that though no longer beating with the first ardour of youth can still throb with genuine the loud noise of an overturned chair near the porti res of the adjoining room interrupted the venerable and scarcely suspecting victim of may in stalked miss van meeker constantia coulson bony durable tall high nosed frigid well bred thirty five in the neighbourhood of gramercy parkish she put up a lorgnette mrs widdup hastily stooped and arranged the bandages on mr coulson s gouty foot i thought higgins was with you said miss van meeker constantia higgins went out explained her father and mrs widdup answered the bell that is better now mrs widdup thank you no there is nothing else i require the housekeeper retired pink under the cool inquiring stare of miss coulson this spring weather is lovely isn t it daughter said the old man consciously conscious that s just it replied miss van meeker constantia coulson somewhat obscurely when does mrs wid dup start on her vacation papa i believe she said a week from to day said mr coulson miss van meeker constantia stood for a minute at the window gazing toward the little park flooded with the mellow afternoon sunlight with the eye of a botanist she viewed the flowers most potent weapons of insid ious may with the cool pulses of a virgin of cologne she withstood the attack of the ethereal mildness the arrows of the pleasant sunshine fell back frostbitten from the cold panoply of her unthrilled bosom the odour of the flowers waked no soft sentiments in the unexplored recesses of her dormant heart the chirp of the sparrows gave her a pain she mocked at may but although miss coulson was proof against the season she was keen enough to estimate its power she knew that elderly men and thick waisted women jumped as educated fleas in the ridiculous train of may the merry mocker of the months she had heard of foolish old gentlemen marrying their housekeepers before what a humiliating thing after all was this feeling called love the next morning at o clock when the iceman called the cook told him that miss coulson wanted to see him in the basement well ain t i the olcott and depew not mentioning the first name at all said the iceman admiringly of himself as a concession he rolled his sleeves down dropped his icehooks on a syringe and went back when miss van meeker constantia coulson addressed him he took off his bat there is a rear entrance to this basement said miss coulson which can be reached by driving into the vacant lot next door where they are excavating for a building i want you to bring in that way within two hours pounds of ice you may have to bring another man or two to help you i will show you where i want it placed i also want pounds a day delivered the same way for the next four days your company may charge the ice on our regular bill this is for your extra trouble miss coulson tendered a ten dollar bill the iceman bowed and held his hat in his two hands behind him not if you ll excuse me lady it ll be a pleasure to fix things up for you any way you please alas for may about noon mr coulson knocked two glasses off his table broke the spring of his bell and yelled for higgins at the same time bring an axe commanded mr coulson sardoni cally or send out for a quart of prussic acid or have a policeman come in and shoot me i d rather that than be frozen to death it does seem to be getting cool sir said higgins i hadn t noticed it before i ll close the window sir do said mr coulson they call this spring do they if it keeps up long i ll go back to palm beach house feels like a morgue later miss coulson dutifully came in to inquire how the gout was progressing stantia said the old man how is the weather out doors bright answered miss coulson but chilly feels like the dead of winter to me said mr coulson an instance said constantia gazing abstractedly out the window of winter lingering in the lap of spring though the metaphor is not in the most refined taste a little later she walked down by the side of the little park and on westward to broadway to accomplish a little shopping a little later than that mrs widdup entered the invalid s room did you ring sir she asked dimpling in many places i asked higgins to go to the drug store and i thought i heard your bell i did not said mr coulson i m afraid said mrs widdup i interrupted you sir yesterday when you were about to say something how comes it mrs widdup said old man coulson sternly that i find it so cold in this house cold sir said the housekeeper why now since you speak of it it do seem cold in this room but out doors it s as warm and fine as june sir and how this weather do seem to make one s heart jump out of one s shirt waist sir and the ivy all leaved out on the side of the house and the hand organs playing and the children dancing on the sidewalk tis a great time for speaking out what s in the heart you were saying yesterday sir woman roared mr coulson you are a fool i pay you to take care of this house i am freezing to death in my own room and you come in and drivel to me about ivy and hand organs get me an overcoat at once see that all doors and windows are closed below an old fat irresponsible one sided object like you prat ing about springtime and flowers in the middle of winter when higgins comes back tell him to bring me a hot rum punch and now get out but who shall shame the bright face of may rogue though she be and disturber of sane men s peace no wise virgins cunning nor cold storage shall make her bow her head in the bright galaxy of months oh yes the story was not quite finished a night passed and higgins helped old man coulson in the morning to his chair by the window the cold of the room was gone heavenly odours and fragrant mild ness entered in hurried mrs widdup and stood by his chair mr coulson reached his bony hand and grasped her plump one mrs widdup he said this house would be no home without you i have half a million dollars if that and the true affection of a heart no lonoer in its youthful prime but still not cold could i found out what made it cold said mrs widdup leanin against his chair twas ice tons of it in the basement and in the furnace room everywhere i shut off the registers that it was coming through into your room mr coulson poor soul and now it s maytime again a true heart went on old man coulson a little wanderingly that the springtime has brought to life again and but what will my daughter say mrs widdup never fear sir said mrs widdup cheerfully miss coulson she ran away with the iceman last night sir a technical error i never cared especially for feuds believing them to be even more overrated products of our country than grapefruit scrapple or honeymoons nevertheless if i may be allowed i will tell you of an indian territory feud of which i was press agent camp follower and inaccessory during the fact i was on a visit to sam durkee s ranch where i had a great time falling off unmanicured ponies and waving my bare hand at the lower jaws of wolves about two miles away sam was a hardened person of about twenty five with a reputation for going home in the dark with perfect equanimity though often with reluctance over in the creek nation was a family bearing the name of tatum i was told that the durkees and tatums had been feuding for years several of each family had bitten the grass and it was expected that more nebuchad nezzars would follow a younger generation of each family was growing up and the grass was keeping pace with them but i gathered that they had fought fairly that they had not lain in cornfields and aimed at the division of their enemies suspenders in the back partly perhaps because there were no cornfields and nobody wore more than one suspender nor had any woman or child of either house ever been harmed in those days and you will find it so yet their women were safe sam durkee had a girl if it were an all fiction magazine that i expect to sell this story to i should say mr durkee rejoiced in a fianc e her name was ella baynes they appeared to be devoted to each other and to have perfect confidence in each other as all couples do who are and have or aren t and haven t she was tolerably pretty with a heavy mass of brown hair that helped her along he introduced me to her which seemed not to lessen her preference for him so i reasoned that they were surely soul mates miss baynes lived in kingfisher twenty miles from the ranch sam lived on a gallop between the two places one day there came to kingfisher a courageous young man rather small with smooth face and regular features he made many inquiries about the business of the town and especially of the inhabitants cognominally he said he was from muscogee and he looked it with his yellow shoes and crocheted four in hand i met him once when i rode in for the mail he said his name was beverly travers which seemed rather improbable there were active times on the ranch just then and sam was too busy to go to town often as an incom petent and generally worthless guest it devolved upon me to ride in for little things such as post cards barrels of flour baking powder smoking tobacco and letters from ella one day when i was messenger for half a gross of cigarette papers and a couple of wagon tires i saw the alleged beverly travers in a yellow wheeled buggy with ella baynes driving about town as ostentatiously as the black waxy mud would permit i knew that this infor mation would bring no balm of gilead to sam s soul so i refrained from including it in the news of the city that i retailed on my return but on the next afternoon an elongated ex cowboy of the name of simmons an old time pal of sam s who kept a feed store in kingfisher rode out to the ranch and rolled and burned many cigar ettes before he would talk when he did make oration his words were these say sam there s been a description of a galoot miscallin himself bevel edged travels impairing the atmospheric air of kingfisher for the past two weeks you know who he was he was not otherwise than ben tatum from the creek nation son of old gopher tatum that your uncle newt shot last february you know what he done this morning he killed your brother lester shot him in the co t house yard i wondered if sam had heard he pulled a twig from a mesquite bush chewed it gravely and said he did did he he killed lester the same said simmons and he did more he run away with your girl the same as to say miss ella baynes i thought you might like to know so i rode out to impart the information i am much obliged jim said sam taking the chewed twig from his mouth yes i m glad you rode out yes i m right glad well i ll be ridin back i reckon that boy i left in the feed store don t know hay from oats he shot lester in the back shot him in the back yes while he was hitchin his hoss i m much obliged jim i kind of thought you d like to know as soon as you could come in and have some coffee before you ride back jim why no i reckon not i must get back to the store and you say yes sam everybody seen em drive away together in a buckboard with a big bundle like clothes tied up in the back of it he was drivin the team he brought over with him from muscogee they ll be hard to over take right away and which i was goin on to tell you they left on the guthrie road but there s no tellin which forks they ll take you know that all right jim much obliged you re welcome sam simmons rolled a cigarette and stabbed his pony with both heels twenty yards away he reined up and called back you don t want no assistance as you might say not any thanks i didn t think you would well so long sam took out and opened a bone handled pocket knife and scraped a dried piece of mud from his left boot i thought at first he was going to swear a vendetta on the blade of it or recite the gipsy s curse the few feuds i had ever seen or read about usually opened that way this one seemed to be presented with a new treat ment thus offered on the stage it would have been hissed off and one of belasco s thrilling melodramas demanded instead i wonder said sam with a profoundly thoughtful expression if the cook has any cold beans left over he called wash the negro cook and finding that he had some ordered him to heat up the pot and make some strong coffee then we went into sam s private room where he slept and kept his armoury dogs and the sad dles of his favourite mounts he took three or four six shooters out of a bookcase and began to look them over whistling the cowboy s lament abstractedly after ward he ordered the two best horses on the ranch saddled and tied to the hitching post now in the feud business in all sections of the country i have observed that in one particular there is a delicate but strict etiquette belonging you must not mention the word or refer to the subject in the presence of a feudist it would be more reprehensible than commenting upon the mole on the chin of your rich aunt i found later on that there is another unwritten rule but i think that belongs solely to the west it yet lacked two hours to supper time but in twenty minutes sam and i were plunging deep into the reheated beans hot coffee and cold beef nothing like a good meal before a long ride said sam eat hearty i had a sudden suspicion why did you have two horses saddled i asked one two one two said sam you can count can t you his mathematics carried with it a momentary qualm and a lesson the thought had not occurred to him that the thought could possibly occur to me not to ride at his side on that red road to revenge and justice it was the higher calculus i was booked for the trail i began to eat more beans in an hour we set forth at a steady gallop eastward our horses were kentucky bred strengthened by the mesquite grass of the west ben tatum s steeds may have been swifter and he had a good lead but if he had heard the punctual thuds of the hoofs of those trailers of ours born in the heart of feudland he might have felt that retribution was creeping up on the hoof prints of his dapper nags i knew that ben tatum s card to play was flight flight until he came within the safer territory of his own henchmen and supporters he knew that the man pur suing him would follow the trail to any end where it might lead during the ride sam talked of the prospect for rain of the price of beef and of the musical glasses you would have thought he had never had a brother or a sweetheart or an enemy on earth there are some sub jects too big even for the words in the unabridged knowing this phase of the feud code but not having practised it sufficiently i overdid the thing by telling some slightly funny anecdotes sam laughed at exactly the right place laughed with his mouth when i caught sight of his mouth i wished i had been blessed with enough sense of humour to have suppressed those anecdotes our first sight of them we had in guthrie tired and hungry we stumbled unwashed into a little yellow pine hotel and sat at a table in the opposite corner we saw the fugitives they were bent upon their meal but looked around at times uneasily the girl was dressed in brown one of these smooth half shiny silky looking affairs with lace collar and cuffs and what i believe they call an accordion plaited skirt she wore a thick brown veil down to her nose and a broad brimmed straw hat with some kind of feathers adorning it the man wore plain dark clothes and his hair was trimmed very short he was such a man as you might see anywhere there they were the murderer and the woman he had stolen there we were the rightful avenger according to the code and the supernumerary who writes these words for one time at least in the heart of the supernumerary there rose the killing instinct for one moment he joined the force of combatants orally what are you waiting for sam i said in a whisper let him have it now sam gave a melancholy sigh you don t understand but he does he said he knows mr tenderfoot there s a rule out here among white men in the nation that you can t shoot a man when he s with a woman i never knew it to be broke yet you can t do it you ve got to get him in a gang of men or by himself that s why he knows it too we all know so that s mr ben tatum one of the pretty men i ll cut him out of the herd before they leave the hotel and regulate his account after supper the flying pair disappeared quickly although sam haunted lobby and stairway and halls half the night in some mysterious way the fugitives eluded him and in the morning the veiled lady in the brown dress with the accordion plaited skirt and the dapper young man with the close clipped hair and the buckboard with the prancing nags were gone it is a monotonous story that of the ride so it shall be curtailed once again we overtook them on a road we were about fifty yards behind they turned in the buckboard and looked at us then drove on without whipping up their horses their safety no longer lay in speed ben tatum knew he knew that the only rock of safety left to him was the code there is no doubt that had he been alone the matter would have been settled quickly with sam durkee in the usual way but he had something at his side that kept still the trigger finger of both it seemed likely that he was no coward so you may perceive that woman on occasions may postpone instead of precipitating conflict between man and man but not willingly or consciously she is oblivious of codes five miles farther we came upon the future great western city of chandler the horses of pursuers and pursued were starved and weary there was one hotel that offered danger to man and entertainment to beast so the four of us met again in the dining room at the ringing of a bell so resonant and large that it had cracked the welkin long ago the dining room was not as large as the one at guthrie just as we were eating apple pie how ben davises and tragedy impinge upon each other i noticed sam looking with keen intentness at our quarry where they were seated at a table across the room the girl still wore the brown dress with lace collar and cuffs and the veil drawn down to her nose the man bent over his plate with his close cropped head held low there s a code i heard sam say either to me or to himself that won t let you shoot a man in the company of a woman but by thunder there ain t one to keep you from killing a woman in the company of a man and quicker than my mind could follow his argument he whipped a colt s automatic from under his left arm and pumped six bullets into the body that the brown dress covered the brown dress with the lace collar and cuffs and the accordion plaited skirt the young person in the dark sack suit from whose head and from whose life a woman s glory had been clipped laid her head on her arms stretched upon the table while people came running to raise ben tatum from the floor in his feminine masquerade that had given sam the opportunity to set aside technically the obliga tions of the code suite homes and their romance few young couples in the big city of bluff began their married existence with greater promise of happiness than did mr and mrs claude turpin they felt no especial animosity toward each other they were comfort ably established in a handsome apartment house that had a name and accommodations like those of a sleeping car they were living as expensively as the couple on the next floor above who had twice their income and their marriage had occurred on a wager a ferry boat and first acquaintance thus securing a sensational newspaper notice with their names attached to pictures of the queen of roumania and m santos dumont turpin s income was per month on pay day after calculating the amounts due for rent instalments on furniture and piano gas and bills owed to the florist confectioner milliner tailor wine merchant and cab company the turpins would find that they still had left to spend how to do this is one of the secrets of metropolitan life the domestic life of the turpins was a beautiful picture to see but you couldn t gaze upon it as you could at an oleograph of don t wake grandma or brook lyn by moonlight you had to blink when looked at it and you heard a fizzing sound just like the machine with a scope at the end of it yes there wasn t much repose about the picture of the turpins domestic life it was something like spearing salmon in the columbia river or jap anese artillery in action every day was just like another as the days are in new york in the morning turpin would take bromo seltzer his pocket change from under the clock his hat no breakfast and his departure for the office at noon mrs turpin would get out of bed and humour put on a kimono airs and the water to boil for coffee turpin lunched downtown he came home at to dress for dinner they always dined out they strayed from the chop house to chop sueydom from terrace to table d h te from rathskeller to roadhouse from caf to casino from maria s to the martha wash ington such is domestic life in the great city your vine is the mistletoe your fig tree bears dates your household gods are mercury and john howard payne for the wedding march you now hear only come with the gypsy bride you rarely dine at the same place twice in succession you tire of the food and besides you want to give them time for the question of that souve nir silver sugar bowl to blow over the turpins were therefore happy they made many warm and delightful friends some of whom they remem bered the next day their home life was an ideal one according to the rules and regulations of the book of bluff there came a time when it dawned upon turpin that his wife was getting away with too much money if you belong to the near swell class in the big city and your income is per month and you find at the end of the month after looking over the bills for current expenses that you yourself have spent you very naturally wonder what has become of the other so you suspect your wife and perhaps you give her a hint that something needs explanation i say vivien said turpin one afternoon when they were enjoying in rapt silence the peace and quiet of their cozy apartment you ve been creating a hiatus big enough for a dog to crawl through in this month s hon orarium you haven t been paying your dressmaker anything on account have you there was a moment s silence no sounds could be heard except the breathing of the fox terrier and the subdued monotonous sizzling of vivien s fulvous locks against the insensate curling irons claude turpin sitting upon a pillow that he had thoughtfully placed upon the convolutions of the apartment sofa narrowly watched the riante lovely face of his wife claudie dear said she touching her finger to her ruby tongue and testing the unresponsive curling irons you do me an injustice mme toinette has not seen a cent of mine since the day you paid your tailor ten dollars on account turpin s suspicions were allayed for the time but one day soon there came an anonymous letter to him that read watch your wife she is blowing in your money secretly i was a sufferer just as you are the place is no blank street a word to the wise etc a man who knows turpin took this letter to the captain of police of the precinct that he lived in my precinct is as clean as a hound s tooth said the captain the lid s shut down as close there as it is over the eye of a williamsburg girl when she s kissed at a party but if you think there s anything queer at the address i ll go there with ye on the next afternoon at turpin and the captain crept softly up the stairs of no blank street a dozen plain clothes men dressed in full police uniforms so as to allay suspicion waited in the hall below at the top of the stairs was a door which was found to be locked the captain took a key from his pocket and unlocked it the two men entered they found themselves in a large room occupied by twenty or twenty five elegantly clothed ladies racing charts hung against the walls a ticker clicked in one corner with a telephone receiver to his ear a man was calling out the various positions of the horses in a very exciting race the occupants of the room looked up at the intruders but as if reassured by the sight of the captain s uniform they reverted their attention to the man at the telephone you see said the captain to turpin the value of an anonymous letter no high minded and self respect ing gentleman should consider one worthy of notice is your wife among this assembly mr turpin she is not said turpin and if she was continued the captain would she be within the reach of the tongue of slander these ladies constitute a browning society they meet to discuss the meaning of the great poet the telephone is connected with boston whence the parent society transmits frequently its interpretations of the poems be ashamed of yer suspicions mr turpin go soak your shield said turpin vivien knows how to take care of herself in a pool room she s not dropping anything on the ponies there must be some thing queer going on here nothing but browning said the captain hear that thanatopsis by a nose drawled the man at the telephone that s not browning that s longfellow said turpin who sometimes read books back to the pasture exclaimed the captain long fellow made the pacing to wagon record of way back in i believe there s something queer about this joint repeated turpin i don t see it said the captain i know it looks like a pool room all right persisted turpin but that s all a blind vivien has been dropping a lot of coin somewhere i believe there s some under handed work going on here a number of racing sheets were tacked close together covering a large space on one of the walls turpin suspicious tore several of them down a door pre viously hidden was revealed turpin placed an ear to the crack and listened intently he heard the soft hum of many voices low and guarded laughter and a sharp metallic clicking and scraping as if from a multitude of tiny but busy objects my god it is as i feared whispered turpin to himself summon your men at once he called to the captain she is in there i know at the blowing of the captain s whistle the uniformed plain clothes men rushed up the stairs into the pool room when they saw the betting paraphernalia distrib uted around they halted surprised and puzzled to know why they had been summoned but the captain pointed to the lock ed door and bade them break it down in a few moments they demolished it with the axes they carried into the other room sprang claude turpin with the captain at his heels the scene was one that lingered long in turpin s mind nearly a score of women women expensively and fashionably clothed many beautiful and of refined appearance had been seated at little marble topped tables when the police burst open the door they shrieked and ran here and there like gayly plumed birds that had been disturbed in a tropical grove some became hysterical one or two fainted several knelt at the feet of the officers and besought them for mercy on account of their families and social position a man who had been seated behind a desk had seized a roll of currency as large as the ankle of a paradise roof gardens chorus girl and jumped out of the window half a dozen attendants huddled at one end of the room breathless from fear upon the tables remained the damning and incon trovertible evidences of the guilt of the habitu es of that sinister room dish after dish heaped high with ice cream and surrounded by stacks of empty ones scraped to the last spoonful ladies said the captain to his weeping circle of prisoner i ll not hold any of yez some of yez i recog nize as having fine houses and good standing in the community with hard working husbands and childer at home but i ll read ye a bit of a lecture before ye go in the next room there s a to shot just dropped in under the wire three lengths ahead of the field is this the way ye waste your husbands money instead of help ing earn it home wid yez the lid s on the ice cream freezer in this precinct claude turpin s wife was among the patrons of the raided room he led her to their apartment in stem silence there she wept so remorsefully and besought his forgiveness so pleadingly that he forgot his just anger and soon he gathered his penitent golden haired vivien in his arms and forgave her darling she murmured half sobbingly as the moon light drifted through the open window glorifying her sweet upturned face i know i done wrong i will never touch ice cream again i forgot you were not a millionaire i used to go there every day but to day i felt some strange sad presentiment of evil and i was not myself i ate only eleven saucers say no more said claude gently as he fondly caressed her waving curls and you are sure that you fully forgive me asked vivien gazing at him entreatingly with dewy eyes of heavenly blue almost sure little one answered claude stooping and lightly touching her snowy forehead with his lips i ll let you know later on i ve got a month s salary down on vanilla to win the three year old steeplechase to morrow and if the ice cream hunch is to the good you are it again see the whirligig of life justice of the peace benaja widdup sat in the door of his office smoking his elder stem pipe half way to the zenith the cumberland range rose blue gray in the afternoon haze a speckled hen swaggered down the main street of the settlement cackling foolishly up the road came a sound of creaking axles and then a slow cloud of dust and then a bull cart bearing ransie bilbro and his wife the cart stopped at the justice s door and the two climbed down ransie was a narrow six feet of sallow brown skin and yellow hair the imperturbability of the mountains hung upon him like a suit of armour the woman was calicoed angled snuff brushed and weary with unknown desires through it all gleamed a faint protest of cheated youth unconscious of its loss the justice of the peace slipped his feet into his shoes for the sake of dignity and moved to let them enter we all said the woman in a voice like the wind blowing through pine boughs wants a divo ce she looked at ransie to see if he noted any flaw or ambiguity or evasion or partiality or self partisanship in her state ment of their business a divo ce repeated ransie with a solemn dod we all can t git along together nohow it s lonesome enough fur to live in the mount ins when a man and a woman keers fur one another but when she s a spittin like a wildcat or a sullenin like a hoot owl in the cabin a man ain t got no call to live with her when he s a no count varmint said the woman

a sight of doin s when he s al ays a fightin the revenues and gits a hard name in the mount ins fur a mean man who s gwine to be able fur to sleep o nights the justice of the peace stirred deliberately to his duties he placed his one chair and a wooden stool for his petitioners he opened his book of statutes on the table and scanned the index presently he wiped his spectacles and shifted his inkstand the law and the statutes said he air silent on the subjeck of divo ce as fur as the jurisdiction of this co t air concerned but accordin to equity and the con stitution and the golden rule it s a bad barg in that can t run both ways if a justice of the peace can marry a couple it s plain that he is bound to be able to divo ce em this here office will issue a decree of divo ce and abide by the decision of the supreme co t to hold it good ransie bilbro drew a small tobacco bag from his trousers pocket out of this he shook upon the table a five dollar note sold a b arskin and two foxes fur that he remarked it s all the money we got the regular price of a divo ce in this co t said the justice air five dollars he stuffed the bill into the pocket of his homespun vest with a deceptive air of indiffer ence with much bodily toil and mental travail he wrote the decree upon half a sheet of foolscap and then copied it upon the other ransie bilbro and his wife listened to his reading of the document that was to give them freedom know all men by these presents that ransie bilbro and his wife ariela bilbro this day personally appeared before me and promises that hereinafter

been no previous hint of alimony women were always bringing up startling and unlooked for issues justice benaja widdup felt that the point demanded judicial decision the authorities were also silent on the subject of alimony but the woman s feet were bare the trail to hogback mountain was steep and flinty ariela bilbro he asked in official tones how much did you low would be good and sufficient ali money in the case befo the co t i lowed she answered fur the shoes and all to say five dollars that ain t much fur ali money but i reckon that ll git me to up brother ed s the amount said the

climbed into the cart on one side and ariela climbed in on the other obeying the flap of his rope the little red bull slowly came around on a tack and the cart crawled away in the nimbus arising from its wheels justice of the peace benaja widdup smoked his elder stem pipe late in the afternoon he got his weekly paper and read it until the twilight dimmed its lines then he lit the tallow candle on his table and read until the moon rose marking the time for supper he lived in the double log cabin on the slope near the girdled poplar going home to supper he crossed a little branch darkened by a laurel thicket the dark figure of a man stepped from the laurels and pointed a rifle at his breast his hat was pulled down low and something covered most of his face i want yo money said the figure thout any talk i m gettin nervous and my finger s a wabblin on this here trigger i ve only got f f five dollars said the justice pro ducing it from his vest pocket roll it up came the order and stick it in the end of this here gun bar l the bill was crisp and new even fingers that were clumsy and trembling found little difficulty in making a spill of it and inserting it this with less ease into the muzzle of the rifle now i reckon you kin be goin along said the robber the justice lingered not on his way the next day came the little red bull drawing the cart to the office door justice benaja widdup had his shoes on for he was expecting the visit in his presence ransie bilbro handed to his wife a five dollar bill the official s eye sharply viewed it it seemed to curl up as though it had been rolled and inserted into the end of a gun barrel but the justice refrained from comment it is true that other bills might be inclined to curl he handed each one a decree of divorce each stood awkwardly silent slowly folding the guarantee of freedom the woman cast a shy glance full of constraint at ransie i reckon you ll be goin back up to the cabin she said along ith the bull cart there s bread in the tin box settin on the shelf i put the bacon in the b ilin pot to keep the hounds from gittin it don t forget to wind the clock to night you air a goin to your brother ed s asked ransie

air so anxious to git away that you don t want me to say it ariela was silent she folded the five dollar bill and her decree carefully and placed them in the bosom of her dress benaja widdup watched the money disappear with mournful eyes behind his spectacles and then with his next words he achieved rank as his thoughts ran with either the great crowd of the world s sympathizers or the little crowd of its great financiers be kind o lonesome in the old cabin to night ranse he said ransie bilbro stared out at the cumberlands clear blue now in the sunlight he did not look at ariela i low it might be lonesome he said but when folks gits mad and wants a divo ce you can t make folks stay there s others wanted a divo ce said ariela speaking to the wooden stool besides nobody don t want no body to stay nobody never said they didn t nobody never said they did i reckon i better start on now to brother ed s nobody can t wind that old clock want me to go back along ith you in the cart and wind it fur you ranse the mountaineer s countenance was proof against emotion but he reached out a big hand and enclosed ariela s thin brown one her soul peeped out once through her impassive face

lovin hearts but it air the duty of the co t to p eserve the morals and integrity of the state the co t reminds you that you air no longer man and wife but air divo ced by regular decree and as such air not entitled to the benefits and purtenances of the mattermonal estate ariela caught ransie s arm did those words mean that she must lose him now when they had just learned the lesson of life but the co t air prepared went on the justice fur to remove the disabilities set up by the decree of divo ce the co t air on hand to perform the solemn ceremony of marri ge thus fixin things up and enablin the parties in the case to resume the honour ble and elevatin state of mattermony which they desires the fee fur per formin said ceremony will be in this case to wit five dollars aricla caught the gleam of promise in his words swiftly her hand went to her bosom freely as an alighting dove the bill fluttered to the justice s table her sallow cheek coloured as she stood hand in hand with ransie and listened to the reuniting words ransie helped her into the cart and climbed in beside her the little red bull turned once more and they set out hand clasped for the mountains justice of the peace benaja widdup sat in his door and took off his shoes once again he fingered the bill tucked down in his vest pocket once again he smoked his elder stem pipe once again the speck led hen swag gered down the main street of the settlement cackling foolishly a sacrifice hit the editor of the hearthstone magazine his own ideas about the selection of manuscript for his publication his theory is no secret in fact he will expound it to you willingly sitting at his mahogany desk smiling benignantly and tapping his knee gently with his gold rimmed eye glasses the hearthstone he will say does not employ a staff of readers we obtain opinions of the manuscripts submitted to us directly from types of the various classes of our readers that is the editor s theory and this is the way he carries it out when a batch of mss is received the editor stuffs every one of his pockets full of them and distributes them as he goes about during the day the office employees the hall porter the janitor the elevator man messenger boys the waiters at the caf where the editor has luncheon the man at the news stand where he buys his evening paper the grocer and milkman the guard on the uptown elevated train the ticket chopper at sixty th street the cook and maid at his home these are the readers who pass upon mss sent in to the hearthstone magazine if his pockets are not entirely emptied by the time he reaches the bosom of his family the remaining ones are handed over to his wife to read after the baby goes to sleep a few days later the editor gathers in the mss during his regular rounds and con siders the verdict of his assorted readers this system of making up a magazine has been very successful and the circulation paced by the advertising rates is making a wonderful record of speed the hearthstone company also publishes books and its imprint is to be found on several successful works all recommended says the editor by the hearthstone army of volunteer readers now and then according to talkative members of the editorial staff the hearthstone has allowed manuscripts to slip through its fingers on the advice of its heterogeneous readers that afterward proved to be famous sellers when brought out by other houses for instance the gossips say the rise and fall of silas latham was unfavourably passed upon by the elevator man the office boy unanimously rejected the boss in the bishop s carriage was contemptuously looked upon by the street car conductor the deliver ance was turned down by a clerk in the subscription department whose wife s mother had just begun a two months visit at his home the queen s quair came back from the janitor with the comment so is the book but nevertheless the hearthstone adheres to its theory and system and it will never lack volunteer readers for each one of the widely scattered staff from the young lady stenographer in the editorial office to the man who shovels in coal whose adverse decision lost to the hearth stone company the manuscript of the under world has expectations of becoming editor of the magazine some day this method of the hearthstone was well known to allen slayton when he wrote his novelette entitled love is all slayton had hung about the editorial offices of all the magazines so persistently that he was acquainted with the inner workings of every one in gotham he knew not only that the editor of the hearthstone handed his mss around among different types of people for reading but that the stories of sentimental love interest went to miss puffkin the editor s stenographer another of the editor s peculiar customs was to conceal invariably the name of the writer from his readers of mss so that a glittering name might not influence the sincerity of their reports slayton made love is all the effort of his life he gave it six months of the best work of his heart and brain it was a pure love story fine elevated romantic passionate a prose poem that set the divine blessing of love i am transposing from the manuscript high above all earthly gifts and honours and listed it in the catalogue of heaven s choicest rewards slayton s literary ambition was intense he would have sacrificed all other worldly possessions to have gained fame in his chosen art he would almost have cut off his right hand or have offered himself to the knife of the appendi citis fancier to have realized his dream of seeing one of his efforts published in the hearthstone slayton finished love is all and took it to thy hearthstone in person the office of the magazine was in a large conglomerate building presided under by a janitor as the writer stepped inside the door on his way to the elevator a potato masher flew through the hall wreck ing slayton s hat and smashing the glass of the door closely following in the wake of the utensil flew the janitor a bulky unwholesome man suspenderless and sordid panic stricken and breathless a frowsy tall woman with flying hair followed the missile the janitor s foot slipped on the tiled floor he fell in a heap with an exclamation of despair the woman pounced upon him and seized his hair the man bellowed lustily her vengeance wreaked the virago rose and stalked triumphant as minerva back to some cryptic domestic retreat at the rear the janitor got to his feet blown and humiliated this is married life he said to slayton with a certain bruised humour that s the girl i used to lay awake of nights thinking about sorry about your hat mister say don t snitch to the tenants about this will yer i don t want to lose me job slayton took the elevator at the end of the hall and went up to the offices of the hearthstone he left the ms of love is all with the editor who agreed to give him an answer as to its availability at the end of a week slayton formulated his great winning scheme on his way down it struck him with one brilliant flash and he could not refrain from admiring his own genius in conceiving the idea that very night he set about carry ing it into execution miss puffkin the hearthstone stenographer boarded in the same house with the author she was an oldish thin exclusive languishing sentimental maid and slayton had been introduced to her some time before the writer s daring and self sacrificing project was this he knew that the editor of the hearthstone relied strongly upon miss puffkin s judgment in the manuscript of romantic and sentimental fiction her taste represented the immense average of mediocre women who devour novels and stories of that type the central idea and keynote of love is all was love at first sight the enrapturing irresistible soul thrilling feeling that com pels a man or a woman to recognize his or her spirit mate as soon as heart speaks to heart suppose he should impress this divine truth upon miss puffkin personally would she not surely indorse her new and rapturous sensations by recommending highly to the editor of the hearthstone the novelette love is all slayton thought so and that night he took miss puffkin to the theatre the next night he made vehement love to her in the dim parlour of the boarding house he quoted freely from love is all and he wound up with miss puffkin s head on his shoulder and visions of literary fame dancing in his head but slayton did not stop at love making this he said to himself was the turning point of his life and like a true sportsman he went the limit on thursday night he and miss puffkin walked over to the big church in the middle of the block and were married brave slayton chateaubriand died in a garret byron courted a widow keats starved to death poe mixed his drinks de quincey hit the pipe ade lived in chica o james kept on doing it dic kens wore white socks de maupassant wore a strait jacket tom watson became a populist jeremiah wept all these authors did these things for the sake of literature but thou didst cap them all thou marriedst a wife for to carve for thyself a niche in the temple of fame on friday morning mrs slayton said she would go over to the hearthstone office hand in one or two manu ripts that the editor had given to her to read and resign her position as stenographer was there anything er that er you particu larly fancied in the stories you are going to turn in asked slayton with a thumping heart there was one a novelette that i liked so much said his wife i haven t read anything in years that i thought was half as nice and true to life that afternoon slayton hurried down to the hearth stone office he felt that his reward was close at hand with a novelette in the hearthstone literary reputation would soon be his the office boy met him at the railing in the outer office it was not for unsuccessful authors to hold personal colloquy with the editor except at rare intervals slayton hugging himself internally was nursing in his heart the exquisite hope of being able to crush the office boy with his forthcoming success he inquired concerning his novelette the office boy went into the sacred precincts and brought forth a large envelope thick with more than the bulk of a thousand diecks the boss told me to tell you he s sorry said the boy but your manuscript ain t available for the magazine slayton stood dazed can you tell me he stammered whether or no miss puff that is my i mean miss ruffkin handed in a novelette this morning that she had been asked to read sure she did answered the office boy wisely i heard the old man say that miss puffkin said it was a daisy the name of it was married for the mazuma or a working girl s triumph say you said the office boy confidentially your name s slayton ain t it i guess i mixed cases on vou without meanin to do it the boss give me some manu script to hand around the other day and i got the ones for miss puffkin and the janitor mixed i guess it s all right though and then slayton looked closer and saw on the cover of his manuscript under the title love is all the janitor s comment scribbled with a piece of charcoal the you say the roads we take twienty miles west of tucson the sunset express stopped at a tank to take on water besides the aqueous addition the engine of that famous flyer acquired some other things that were not good for it while the fireman was lowering the feeding hose bob tidball shark dodson and a quarter bred creek indian called john big dog climbed on the engine and showed the engineer three round orifices in pieces of ordnance that the carried these orifices so impressed the engineer with their possibilities that he raised both hands in a gesture such as accompanies the ejaculation do tell at the crisp command of shark dodson who was leader of the attacking force the engineer descended to the ground and uncoupled the engine and tender then john big dog perched upon the coal sportively held two guns upon the engine driver and the fireman and suggested that they run the engine fifty yards away and there await further orders shark dodson and bob tidball scorning to put such low grade ore as the passengers through the mill struck out for the rich pocket of the express car they found the messenger serene in the belief that the sunset express was taking on nothing more stimulating and dangerous than aqua pura while bob was knocking this idea out of his head with the butt end of his six shooter shark dodson was already dosing the express car safe with dynamite the safe exploded to the tune of all gold and currency the passengers thrust their heads casually out of the windows to look for the thunder cloud the conductor jerked at the bell rope which sagged down loose and unresisting at his tug shark dodson and bob tidball with their booty in a stout canvas bag tumbled out of the express car and ran awkwardly in their high heeled boots to the engine the engineer sullenly angry but wise ran the engine according to orders rapidly away from the inert train but before this was accomplished the express messenger recovered from bob tidball s persuader to neutrality jumped out of his car with a winchester rifle and took a trick in the game mr john big dog sitting on the coal tender unwittingly made a wrong lead by giving an imitation of a target and the messenger trumped him with a ball exactly between his shoulder blades the creek chevalier of industry rolled off to the ground thus increasing the share of his comrades in the loot by one sixth each two miles from the tank the engineer was ordered to stop the robbers waved a defiant adieu and plunged down the steep slope into the thick woods that lined the track five minutes of crashing through a thicket of chapparal brought them to open woods where three horses were tied to low hanging branches one was waiting for john big dog who would never ride by night or day again this animal the robbers divested of saddle and bridle and set free they mounted the other two with the bag across one pommel and rode fast and with discre tion through the forest and up a primeval lonely gorge here the animal that bore bob tidball slipped on a mossy boulder and broke a foreleg they shot him through the head at once and sat down to hold a council of flight made secure for the present by the tortuous trail they had travelled the question of time was no longer so big many miles and hours lay between them and the spryest posse that could follow shark dodson s horse with trailing rope and dropped bridle panted and cropped thankfully of the grass along the stream in the gorge bob tidball opened the sack drew out double handfuls of the neat packages of currency and the one sack of gold and chuckled with the glee of a child say you old double decked pirate he called joyfully to dodson you said we could do it you got a head for financing that knocks the horns off of anything in arizona what are we going to do about a hoss for you bob we ain t got long to wait here they ll be on our trail before daylight in the mornin oh i guess that cayuse of yourn ll carry double for a while answered the sanguine bob we ll annex the first animal we come across by jingoes we made a haul didn t we accordin to the marks on this money there s apiece it s short of what i expected said shark dodson kicking softly at the packages with the toe of his boot and then he looked pensively at the wet sides of his tired horse old bolivar s mighty nigh played out he said slowly i wish that sorrel of yours hadn t got hurt so do i said bob heartily but it can t be helped bolivar s got plenty of bottom he ll get us both far enough to get fresh mounts dang it shark i can t belp thinkin how funny it is that an easterner like you can come out here and give us western fellows cards and spades in the desperado business what part of the east was you from anyway new york state said shark dodson sitting down on a boulder and chewing a twig i was born on a farm in ulster county i ran away from home when i was seventeen it was an accident my coming west i was walkin along the road with my clothes in a bundle makin for new york city i had an idea of goin there and makin lots of money i always felt like i could do it i came to a place one evenin where the road forked and i didn t know which fork to take i studied about it for half an hour and then i took the left hand that night i run into the camp of a wild west show that was travellin among the little towns and i went west with it i ve often wondered if i wouldn t have turned out different if i d took the other road oh i reckon you d have ended up about the same said bob tidball cheerfully philosophical it ain t the roads we take it s what s inside of us that makes us turn out the way we do shark dodson got up and leaned against a tree i d a good deal rather that sorrel of yourn hadn t hurt himself bob he said again almost pathetically same here agreed bob he was sure a first rate kind of a crowbait but bolivar he ll pull us through all right reckon we d better be movin on hadn t we shark i ll bag this boodle ag in and we ll hit the trail for higher timber bob tidball replaced the spoil in the bag and tied the mouth of it tightly with a cord when he looked up the most prominent object that he saw was the muzzle of shark dodson s held upon him without a waver stop your funnin said bob with a grin we got to be hittin the breeze set still said shark you ain t goin to hit no breeze bob i hate to tell you but there ain t any chance for but one of us bolivar he s plenty tired and he can t carry double we been pards me and you shark dodson for three year bob said quietly we ve risked our lives together time and again i ve always give you a square deal and i thought you was a man i ve heard some queer stories about you shootin one or two men in a peculiar way but i never believed em now if you re just havin a little fun with me shark put your gun up and we ll get on bolivar and vamose if you mean to shoot shoot you blackhearted son of a tarantula shark dodson s face bore a deeply sorrowful look you don t know how bad i feel he sighed about that sorrel of yourn breakin his leg bob the expression on dodson s face changed in an instant to one of cold ferocity mingled with inexorable cupidity the soul of the man showed itself for a moment like an evil face in the window of a reputable house truly bob tidball was never to hit the breeze again the deadly of the false friend cracked and filled the gorge with a roar that the walls hurled back with indignant echoes and bolivar unconscious accomplice swiftly bore away the last of the holders up of the sunset express not put to the stress of carrying double but as shark dodson galloped away the woods seemed to fade from his view the revolver in his right hand turned to the curved arm of a mahogany chair his saddle was strangely upholstered and he opened his eyes and saw his feet not in stirrups but resting quietly on the edge of a quartered oak desk i am telling you that dodson of the firm of dodson decker wall street brokers opened his eyes peabody the confidential clerk was standing by his chair hesitating to speak there was a confused hum of wheels below and the sedative buzz of an electric fan ahem peabody said dodson blinking i must have fallen asleep i had a most remarkable dream what is it peabody mr williams sir of tracy williams is outside he has come to settle his deal in x y z the market caught him short sir if you remember yes i remember what is x y z quoted at to day peabody one eighty five sir then that s his price excuse me said peabody rather nervously for speaking of it but i ve been talking to williams he s an old friend of yours mr dodson and you practically have a corner in x y z i thought you might that is i thought you might not remember that he sold you the stock at if he settles at the market price it will take every cent he has in the world and his home too to deliver the shares the expression on dodson s face changed in an instant to one of cold ferocity mingled with inexorable cupidity the soul of the man showed itself for a moment like an evil face in the window of a reputable house he will settle at one eighty five said dodson bolivar cannot carry double a blackjack bargainer the most disreputable thing in yancey goree s law office was goree himself sprawled in his creakv old arm chair the rickety little office built of red brick was set flush with the street the main street of the town of bethel bethel rested upon the foot hills of the blue ridge above it the mountains were piled to the sky far below it the turbid catawba gleamed yellow along its disconsolate valley the june day was at its sultriest hour bethel dozed in the tepid shade trade was not it was so still that goree reclining in his chair distinctly heard the clicking of the chips in the grand jury room where the court house gang was playing poker from the open back door of the office a well worn path meandered across the grassy lot to the court house the treading out of that path had cost goree all he ever had first inheritance of a few thousand dollars next the old family home and latterly the last shreds of his self respect and manhood the gang had cleaned him out the broken gambler had turned drunkard and parasite he had lived to see this day come when the men who had stripped him denied him a seat at the game his word was no longer to be taken the daily bouts at cards had arranged itself accordingly and to him was assigned the ignoble part of the onlooker the sheriff the county clerk a sportive deputy a gay attorney and a chalk faced man hailing from the valley sat at table and the sheared one was thus tacitly advised to go and grow more wool soon wearying of his ostracism goree had departed for his office muttering to himself as he unsteadily traversed the unlucky pathway after a drink of corn whiskey from a demijohn under the table he had flung himself into the chair staring in a sort of maudlin apathy out at the mountains immersed in the summer haze the little white patch he saw away up on the side of blackjack was laurel the village near which he had been born and bred there also was the birthplace of the feud between the gorees and the coltranes now no direct heir of the gorees survived except this plucked and singed bird of misfortune to the coltranes also but one male supporter was left colonel abner col trane a man of substance and standing a member of the state legislature and a contemporary with goree s father the feud had been a typical one of the region it had left a red record of hate wrong and slaughter but yancey goree was not thinking of feuds his befuddled brain was hopelessly attacking the problem of the future maintenance of himself and his favourite follies of late old friends of the family had seen to it that he had whereof to eat and a place to sleep but whiskey they would not buy for him and he must have whiskey his law business was extinct no case had been intrusted to him in two years he had been a borrower and a sponge and it seemed that if he fell no lower it would be from lack of opportunity one more chance he was saying to himself if he had one more stake at the game he thought he could win but he had nothing left to sell and his credit was more than exhausted he could not help smiling even in his misery as he thought of the man to whom six months before he had sold the old goree homestead there had come from back yan in the mountains two of the strangest creatures a man named pike garvey and his wife back yan with a wave of the hand toward the hills was understood among the mountaineers to designate the remotest fastnesses the unplumbed gorges the haunts of lawbreakers the wolf s den and the boudoir of the bear in the cabin far up on blackjack s shoulder in the wildest part of these retreats this odd couple had lived for twenty years they had neither dog nor children to mitigate the heavy silence of the hills pike garvey was little known in the settlements but all who had dealt with him pronounced him crazy as a loon he acknowledged no occupation save that of a squirrel hunter but he moonshined occasionally by way of diversion once the revenues had dragged him from his lair fighting silently and desperately like a terrier and he had been sent to state s prison for two years released he popped back into his hole like an angry weasel fortune passing over many anxious wooers made a freakish flight into blackjack s bosky pockets to smile upon pike and his faithful partner one day a party of spectacled knickerbockered and altogether absurd prospectors invaded the vicinity of the garvey s cabin pike lifted his squirrel rifle off the hooks and took a shot at them at long range on the chance of their being revenues happily he missed and the unconscious agents of good luck drew nearer disclosing their innocence of anything resembling law or justice later on they offered the garveys an enormous quantity of ready green crisp money for their thirty acre patch of cleared land mentioning as an excuse for such a mad action some irrelevant and inadequate nonsense about a bed of mica underlying the said property when the garveys became possessed of so many dol lars that they faltered in computing them the deficiencies of life on blackjack began to grow prominent pike began to talk of new shoes a hogshead of tobacco to set in the corner a new lock to his rifle and leading martella to a certain spot on the mountain side he pointed out to her how a small cannon doubtless a thing not beyond the scope of their fortune in price might be planted so as to command and defend the sole accessible trail to the cabin to the confusion of revenues and meddling strangers forever but adam reckoned without his eve these things represented to him the applied power of wealth but there slumbered in his dingy cabin an ambition that soared far above his primitive wants somewhere in mrs garvey s bosom still survived a spot of femininity unstarved by twenty years of blackjack for so long a time the sounds in her ears had been the scaly barks dropping in the woods at noon and the wolves singing among the rocks at night and it was enough to have purged her of vanities she had grown fat and sad and yellow and dull but when the means came she felt a rekindled desire to assume the perquisites of her sex to sit at tea tables to buy futile things to whitewash the hideous veracity of life with a little form and ceremony so she coldly vetoed pike s proposed system of fortifica tions and announced that thev would descend upon the world and gyrate socially and thus at length it was decided and the thing done the village of laurel was their compromise between mrs garvey s preference for one of the large valley towns and pike s hankering for primeval solitudes laurel yielded a halting round of feeble social distractions omportable with martella s ambitions and was not entirely without recommendation to pike its contiguity to the mountains presenting advantages for sudden retreat in case fashionable society should make it advisable their descent upon laurel had been coincident with yancey goree s feverish desire to convert property into cash and they bought the old goree homestead paying four thousand dollars ready money into the spendthrift s shaking hands thus it happened that while the disreputable last of the gorees sprawled in his disreputable office at the end of his row spurned by the cronies whom he had gorged strangers dwelt in the halls of his fathers a cloud of dust was rolling slowly up the parched street with something travelling in the midst of it a little breeze wafted the cloud to one side and a new brightly painted carryall drawn by a slothful gray horse became visible the vehicle deflected from the middle of the street as it neared goree s office and stopped in the gutter directly in front of his door on the front seat sat a gaunt tall man dressed in black broadcloth his rigid hands incarcerated in yellow kid gloves on the back seat was a lady who triumphed over the june heat her stout form was armoured in a skintight silk dress of the description known as change able being a gorgeous combination of shifting hues she sat erect waving a much omamented fan with her eyes fixed stonily far down the street however martella garvey s heart might be rejoicing at the pleasures of her new life blackjack had done his work with her exterior he had carved her countenance to the image of emptiness and inanity had imbued her with the stolidity of his crags and the reserve of his hushed interiors she always seemed to hear whatever her surroundings were the scaly barks falling and pattering down the mountain side she could always hear the awful silence of black jack sounding through the stillest of nights goree watched this solemn equipage as it drove to his door with only faint interest but when the lank driver wrapped the reins about his whip awkwardly descended and stepped into the office he rose unsteadily to receive him recognizing pike garvey the new the transformed the recently civilized the mountaineer took the chair goree offered him they who cast doubts upon garvey s soundness of mind had a strong witness in the man s countenance his face was too long a dull saffron in hue and immobile as a statue s pale blue unwinking round eyes without lashes added to the singularity of his gruesome visage goree was at a loss to account for the visit everything all right at laurel mr garvey he inquired everything all right sir and mighty pleased is missis garvey and me with the property missis garvey likes yo old place and she likes the neighbourhood society is what she lows she wants and she is gettin of it the rogerses the hapgoods the pratts and the troys hev been to see missis garvey and she hev et meals to most of thar houses the best folks hev axed her to differ nt kinds of doin s i cyan t say mr goree that sech things suits me fur me give me them thar garvey s huge yellow gloved hand flourished in the direction of the mountains that s whar i b long mongst the wild honey bees and the b ars but that ain t what i come fur to say mr goree thar s somethin you got what me and missis garvey wants to buy buy echoed goree from me then he laughed harshly i reckon you are mistaken about that i reckon you are mistaken about that i sold out to you as you yourself expressed it lock stock and barrel there isn t even a ramrod left to sell you ve got it and we uns want it take the money says missis garvey and buy it fa r and squared goree shook his head the cupboard s bare he said we ve riz pursued the mountaineer undetected from his object a heap we was pore as possums and now we could hev folks to dinner every day we been recognized missis garvey says by the best society but there s somethin we need we ain t got she says it ought to been put in the ventory ov the sale but it tain t thar take the money then says she and buy it fa r and squar out with it said goree his racked nerves growing impatient garvey threw his slouch bat upon the table and leaned forward fixing his unblinking eves upon goree s there s a old feud he said distinctly and slowly tween you uns and the coltranes goree frowned ominously to speak of his feud to a feudist is a serious breach of the mountain etiquette the man from back yan knew it as well as the lawyer did na offense he went on but purely in the way of business missis garvey hev studied all about feuds most of the quality folks in the mountains hev em the settles and the goforths the rankins and the boyds the silers and the galloways hev all been cyarin on feuds f om twenty to a hundred year the last man to drap was when yo uncle jedge paisley goree journed co t and shot len coltrane f om the bench missis garvey and me we come f om the po white trash nobody wouldn t pick a feud with we uns no mo n with a fam ly of tree toads quality people everywhar says missis garvey has feuds we uns ain t quality but we re uyin into it as fur as we can take the money then says missis garvey and buy mr goree s feud fa r and squar the squirrel hunter straightened a leg half across the room drew a roll of bills from his pocket and threw them on the table thar s two hundred dollars mr goree what you would call a fa r price for a feud that s been lowed to run down like yourn hev thar s only you left to cyar on yo side of it and you d make mighty po killin i ll take it off yo hands and it ll set me and missis garvey up among the quality thar s the money the little roll of currency on the table slowly untwisted itself writhing and jumping as its folds relaxed in the silence that followed garvey s last speech the rattling of the poker chips in the court house could be plainly heard goree knew that the sheriff had just won a pot for the subdued whoop with which he always greeted a victory floated across the sqquare upon the crinkly heat waves beads of moisture stood on goree s brow stooping he drew the wicker covered demijohn from under the table and filled a tumbler from it a little corn liquor mr garvey of course you are joking about what you spoke of opens quite a new market doesn t it feuds prime two fifty to three feuds slightly damaged two hundred i believe you said mr garvey goree laughed self consciously the mountaineer took the glass goree handed him and drank the whisky without a tremor of the lids of his staring eyes the lawyer applauded the feat by a look of envious admiration he poured his own drink and took it like a drunkard by gulps and with shudders at the smell and taste two hundred repeated garvey thar s the money a sudden passion flared up in goree s brain he struck the table with his fist one of the bills flipped over and touched his hand he flinched as if something had stung him do you come to me he shouted seriously with such a ridiculous insulting darned fool proposition it s fa r and squar said the squirrel hunter but he reached out his hand as if to take back the money and then goree knew that his own flurry of rage had not been from pride or resentment but from anger at himself knowing that he would set foot in the deeper depths that were being opened to him he turned in an instant from an outraged gentleman to an anxious chafferer recom mending his goods don t be in a hurry garvey he said his face crimson and his speech thick i accept your p p proposition though it s dirt cheap at two hundred a t trade s all right when both p purchaser and b buyer are s satisfied shall i w wrap it up for you mr garvey garvey rose and shook out his broadcloth missis garvev will be pleased you air out of it and it stands coltrane and garvey just a scrap ov writin mr goree you bein a lawyer to show we traded goree seized a sheet of paper and a pen the money was clutched in his moist hand everything else sud denly seemed to grow trivial and light bill of sale by all means right title and interest in and to forever warrant and no garvey we ll have to leave out that defend said goree with a loud laugh you ll have to defend this title yourself the mountaineer received the amazing screed that the lawyer handed him folded it with immense labour and laced it carefully in his pocket goree was standing near the window step here said raising his finger and i ll show you your recently purchased enemy there he goes down the other side of the street the mountaineer crooked his long frame to look through the window in the direction indicated by the other colonel abner coltrane an erect portly gentleman of about fifty wearing the inevitable long double breasted frock coat of the southern lawmaker and an old high silk hat was passing on the opposite sidewalk as garvey looked goree glanced at his face if there be such a thing as a yellow wolf here was its counterpart garvey snarled as his unhuman eyes followed the moving figure disclosing long amber coloured fangs is that him why that s the man who sent me to the penitentiary once he used to be district attorney said goree care lessly and by the way he s a first class shot i kin hit a squirrel s eye at a hundred yard said garvey so that thar s coltrane i made a better trade than i was thinkin i ll take keer ov this feud mr goree better n you ever did he moved toward the door but lingered there betray ing a slight perplexity anything else to day inquired goree with frothy sarcasm any family traditions ancestral ghosts or skeletons in the closet prices as low as the lowest thar was another thing replied the unmoved squirrel hunter that missis garvey was thinkin of tain t so much in my line as t other but she wanted partic lar that i should inquire and ef you was willin pay fur it she says fa r and squar thar s a buryin groun as you know mr goree in the yard of yo old place under the cedars them that lies thar is yo folks what was killed by the coltranes the monyments has the names on em missis garvev says a fam ly buryin groun is a sho sign of quality she says ef we git the feud thar s somethin else ought to go with it the names on them moiivments is goree but they can be changed to ourn by go go screamed goree his face turning purple he stretched out both hands toward the mountaineer his fingers hooked and shaking go you ghoul even a ch chinaman protects the g graves of his ancestors go the squirrel hunter slouched out of the door to his carryall while he was climbing over the wheel goree was collecting with feverish celerity the money that had fallen from his hand to the floor as the vehicle slowly turned about the sheep with a coat of newly grown wool was hurrying in indecent haste along the path to the court house at three o clock in the morning they brought him back to his office shorn and unconscious the sheriff the sportive deputy the county clerk and the gay attorney carried him the chalk faced man from the valley acting as escort on the table said one of them and they deposited him there among the litter of his unprofitable books and papers yance thinks a lot of a pair of deuces when he s liquored up sighed the sheriff reflectively too much said the gay attorney a man has no business to play poker who drinks as much as he does i wonder how much he dropped to night close to two hundred what i wonder is whar he got it yance ain t had a cent fur over a month i know struck a client maybe well let s get home before daylight he ll be all right when he wakes up except for a sort of beehive about the cranium the gang slipped away through the early morning twilight the next eye to gaze upon the miserable goree was the orb of day he peered through the uncurtained window first deluging the sleeper in a flood of faint gold but soon pouring upon the mottled red of his flesh a searching white summer heat goree stirred half unconsciously among the table s d bris and turned his face from the window his movement dislodged a heavy law book which crashed upon the

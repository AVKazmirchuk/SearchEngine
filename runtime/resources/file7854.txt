anger as one looks at a stray dog and nodded his head in the direction of the door the back stairs giuseppi he said briefly somebody pitch your hat down after you maggie walked up to dempsey donovan there was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks down which slow tears were running but she looked him bravely in the eye i knew it dempsey she said as her eyes grew dull even in their tears i knew he was a guinea his name s tony spinelli i hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin them guineas always carries knives but you don t understand dempsey i never had a fellow in my life i got tired of comin with anna and jimmy every night so i fixed it with him to call himself o sullivan and brought him along i knew there d be nothin doin for him if he came as a dago i guess i ll resign from the club now dempsey turned to andy geoghan chuck that cheese slicer out of the window he said and tell em inside that mr o sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to tammany hall and then he turned back to maggie say mag he said i ll see you home and how about next saturday night will you come to the hop with me if i call around for you it was remarkable how quickly maggie s eyes could change from dull to a shining brown with you dempsey she stammered say will a duck swim man about town there were two or three things that i wanted to know i do not care about a mystery so i began to inquire it took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases and then i began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces this serious query was at first received with suspicion because it sounded like a conundrum i was at last assured that its double form of construction was designed to make lighter the burden of woman who makes up beds i was so foolish as to persist begging to know why then they were not made in two equal pieces whereupon i was shunned the third draught that i craved from the fount of knowledge was enlightenment concerning the character known as a man about town he was more vague in my mind than a type should be we must have a concrete idea of anything even if it be an imaginary idea before we can comprehend it now i have a mental picture of john doe that is as clear as a steel engraving his eyes are weak blue he wears a brown vest and a shiny black serge coat he stands always in the sunshine chewing something and he keeps half shutting his pocket knife and opening it again with his thumb and if the man higher up is ever found take my assurance for it he will be a large pale man with blue wristlets showing under his cuffs and he will be sitting to have his shoes polisbed within sound of a bowling alley and there will be somewhere about him turquoises but the canvas of my imagination when it came to limning the man about town was blank i fancied that he bad a detachable sneer like the smile of the cheshire cat and attached cuffs and that was all whereupon i asked a newspaper reporter about him why said he a man about town something between a rounder and a clubman he isn t exactly well he fits in between mrs fish s receptions and private boxing bouts he doesn t well he doesn t belong either to the lotos club or to the jerry mcgeogheghan galvanised iron workers apprentices left hook chowder association i don t exactly know how to describe him to you you ll see him everywhere there s anything doing yes i suppose he s a type dress clothes every evening knows the ropes calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first names no he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives you generally see him alone or with another man my friend the reporter left me and i wandered further afield by this time the electric lights on the rialto were alight people passed but they held me not paphian eyes rayed upon me and left me unscathed diners heimgangers shop girls confidence men panhandlers actors highwaymen millionaires and outlanders hurried skipped strolled sneaked swaggered and scurried by me but i took no note of them i knew them all i had read their hearts they had served i wanted my man about town he was a type and to drop him would be an error a typograph but no let us continue let us continue with a moral digression to see a family reading the sunday paper gratifies the sections have been separated papa is earnestly scanning the page that pictures the young lady exercising before an open window and bending but there there mamma is interested in trying to guess the missing letters in the word nw yok the oldest girls are eagerly perusing the financial reports for a certain young man remarked last sunday night that he had taken a flyer in q x z willie the eighteen year old son who attends the new york public school is absorbed in the weekly article describing how to make over an old skirt for he hopes to take a prize in sewing on graduation day grandma is holding to the comic supplement with a two hours grip and little tottie the baby is rocking along the best she can with the real estatc transfers this view is intended to be reassuring for it is desirable that a few lines of this story be skipped for it introduces strong drink i went into a cafe to and while it was being mixed i asked the man who grabs up your hot scotch spoon as soon as you lay it down what he undcrstood by the term epithet description designation characterisation or appellation viz a man about town why said he carefully it means a fly guy that s wise to the all night push see it s a hot sport that you can t bump to the rail anywhere between the flatirons see i guess that s about what it means i thanked him and departed on the sidewalk a salvation lassie shook her contribution receptacle gently against my waistcoat pocket would you mind telling me i asked her if you ever meet with the character commonly denominated as a man about town during your daily wanderings i think i know whom you mean she answered with a gentle smile we see them in the same places night after night they are the devil s body guard and if the soldiers of any army are as faithful as they are their commanders are well served we go among them diverting a few pennies from their wickedness to the lord s service she shook the box again and i dropped a dime into it in front of a glittering hotel a friend of mine a critic was climbing from a cab he seemed at leisure and i put my question to him he answered me conscientiously as i was sure he would there is a type of man about town in new york he answered the term is quite familiar to me but i don t think i was ever called upon to define the character before it would be difficult to point you out an exact specimen i would say offhand that it is a man who had a hopeless case of the peculiar new york disease of wanting to see and know at o clock each day life begins with him he follows rigidly the conventions of dress and manners but in the business of poking his nose into places where he does not belong he could give pointers to a civet cat or a jackdaw he is the man who has chased bohemia about the town from rathskeller to roof garden and from hester street to harlem until you can t find a place in the city where they don t cut their spaghetti with a knife your man about town has done that he is always on the scent of something new he is curiosity impudence and omnipresence hansoms were made for him and gold banded cigars and the curse of music at dinner there are not so many of him but his minority report is adopted everywhere i m glad you brought up the subject i ve felt the influence of this nocturnal blight upon our city but i never thought to analyse it before i can see now that your man about town should havc been classified long ago in his wake spring up wine agents and cloak models and the orchestra p ays let s all go up to maud s for him by request instead of handel he makes his rounds every evening while you and i see the elephant once a week when the cigar store is raided he winks at the officer familiar with his ground and walks away immune while you and i search among the presidents for names and among the stars for addresses to give the desk sergeant my friend the critic paused to acquire breath for fresh eloquence i seized my advantage you have classified him i cried with joy you have painted his portrait in the gallery of city types but i must meet one face to face i must study the man about town at first hand where shall i find him how shall i know him without seeming to hear me the critic went on and his cab driver was waiting for his fare too he is the sublimated essence of butt in the refined intrinsic extract of rubber the concentrated purified irrefutable unavoidable spirit of curiosity and inquisitiveness a new sensation is the breath in his nostrils when his experience is exhausted he explores new fields with the indefatigability of a excuse me i interrupted but can you produce one of this type it is a new thing to me i must study it i will search the town over until i find one its habitat must be here on broadway i am about to dine here said my friend come inside and if there is a man about town present i will point him out to you i know most of the regular patrons here i am not dining yet i said to him you will excuse me i am going to find my man about town this night if i have to rake new york from the battery to little coney island i left the hotel and walked down broadway the pursuit of my type gave a pleasant savour of life and interest to the air i breathed i was glad to be in a city so great so complex and diversified leisurely and with something of an air i strolled along with my heart expanding at the thought that i was a citizen of great gotham a sharer in its magnificence and pleasures a partaker in its glory and prestige i turned to cross the street i heard something buzz like a bee and then i took a long pleasant ride with santos dumont when i opened my eyes i remembered a smell of gasoline and i said aloud hasn t it passed yet a hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow that was not at all fevered a young doctor came along grinned and handed me a morning newspaper want to see how it happened he asked cheerily i read the article its headlines began where i heard the buzzing leave off the night before it closed with these lines bellevue hospital where it was said that his injuries were not serious he appeared to be a typica man about town the cop and the anthem on his bench in madison square soapy moved uneasily when wild geese honk high of nights and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands and when soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park you may know that winter is near at hand a dead leaf fell in soapy s lap that was jack frost s card jack is kind to the regular denizens of madison square and gives fair warning of his annual call at the corners of four streets he hands his pasteboard to the north wind footman of the mansion of all outdoors so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready soapy s mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him to resolve himself into a singular committee of ways and means to provide against the coming rigour and therefore he moved uneasily on his bench the hibernatorial ambitions of soapy were not of the highest in them there were no considerations of mediterranean cruises of soporific southern skies drifting in the vesuvian bay three months on the island was what his soul craved three months of assured board and bed and congenial company safe from boreas and bluecoats seemed to soapy the essence of things desirable for years the hospitable blackwell s had been his winter quarters just as his more fortunate fellow new yorkers had bought their tickets to palm beach and the riviera each winter so soapy had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the island and now the time was come on the previous night three sabbath newspapers distributed beneath his coat about his ankles and over his lap had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square so the island loomed big and timely in soapy s mind he scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the city s dependents in soapy s opinion the law was more benign than philanthropy there was an endless round of institutions municipal and eleemosynary on which he might set out and receive lodging and food accordant with the simple life but to one of soapy s proud spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered if not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy as caesar had his brutus every bed of charity must have its toll of a bath every loaf of bread its compensation of a private and personal inquisition wherefore it is better to be a guest of the law which though conducted by rules does not meddle unduly with a gentleman s private affairs soapy having decided to go to the island at once set about accomplishing his desire there were many easy ways of doing this the pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive restaurant and then after declaring insolvency be handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman an accommodating magistrate would do the rest soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of asphalt where broadway and fifth avenue flow together up broadway he turned and halted at a glittering cafe where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the grape the silkworm and the protoplasm soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest upward he was shaven and his coat was decent and his neat black ready tied four in hand had been presented to him by a lady missionary on thanksgiving day if he could reach a table in the restaurant unsuspected success would be his the portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter s mind a roasted mallard duck thought soapy would be about the thing with a bottle of chablis and then camembert a demi tasse and a cigar one dollar for the cigar would be enough the total would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the cafe management and yet the meat would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge but as soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter s eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of the menaced mallard soapy turned off broadway it seemed that his route to the coveted island was not to be an epicurean one some other way of entering limbo must be thought of at a corner of sixth avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed wares behind plate glass made a shop window conspicuous soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass people came running around the corner a policeman in the lead soapy stood still with his hands in his pockets and smiled at the sight of brass buttons where s the man that done that inquired the officer excitedly don t you figure out that i might have had something to do with it said soapy not without sarcasm but friendly as one greets good fortune the policeman s mind refused to accept soapy even as a clue men who smash windows do not remain to parley with the law s minions they take to their heels the policeman saw a man half way down the block running to catch a car with drawn club he joined in the pursuit soapy with disgust in his heart loafed along twice unsuccessful on the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great pretensions it catered to large appetites and modest purses its crockery and atmosphere were thick its soup and napery thin into this place soapy took his accusive shoes and telltale trousers without challenge at a table he sat and consumed beefsteak flapjacks doughnuts and pie and then to the waiter be betrayed the fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers now get busy and call a cop said soapy and don t keep a gentleman waiting no cop for youse said the waiter with a voice like butter cakes and an eye like the cherry in a manhattan cocktail hey con neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched soapy he arose joint by joint as a carpenter s rule opens and beat the dust from his clothes arrest seemed but a rosy dream the island seemed very far away a policeman who stood before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the street five blocks soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo capture again this time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself a cinch a young woman of a modest and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands and two yards from the window a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water plug it was soapy s design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated masher the refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm that would insure his winter quarters on the right little tight little isle soapy straightened the lady missionary s readymade tie dragged his shrinking cuffs into the open set his hat at a killing cant and sidled toward the young woman he made eyes at her was taken with sudden coughs and hems smiled smirked and went brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of the masher with half an eye soapy saw that the policeman was watching him fixedly the young woman moved away a few steps and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving mugs soapy followed boldly stepping to her side raised his hat and said ah there bedelia don t you want to come and play in my yard the policeman was still looking the persecuted young woman had but to beckon a finger and soapy would be practically en route for his insular haven already he imagined he could feel the cozy warmth of the station house the young woman faced him and stretching out a hand caught soapy s coat sleeve sure mike she said joyfully if you ll blow me to a pail of suds i d have spoke to you sooner but the cop was watching with the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak soapy walked past the policeman overcome with gloom he seemed doomed to liberty at the next corner he shook off his companion and ran he halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets hearts vows and librettos women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air a sudden fear seized soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest the thought brought a little of panic upon it and when he came upon another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of disorderly conduct on the sidewalk soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice he danced howled raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin the policeman twirled his club turned his back to soapy and remarked to a citizen tis one of them yale lads celebratin the goose egg they give to the hartford college noisy but no harm we ve instructions to lave them be disconsolate soapy ceased his unavailing racket would never a policeman lay hands on him in his fancy the island seemed an unattainable arcadia he buttoned his thin coat against the chilling wind in a cigar store he saw a well dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light his silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering soapy stepped inside secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it slowly the man at the cigar light followed hastily my umbrella he said sternly oh is it sneered soapy adding insult to petit larceny well why don t you call a policeman i took it your umbrella why don t you call a cop there stands one on the corner the umbrella owner slowed his steps soapy did likewise with a presentiment that luck would again run against him the policeman looked at the two curiously of course said the umbrella man that is well you know how these mistakes occur i if it s your umbrella i hope you ll excuse me i picked it up this morning in a restaurant if you recognise it as yours why i hope you ll of course it s mine said soapy viciously the ex umbrella man retreated the policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements he hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation he muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs because he wanted to fall into their clutches they seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong at length soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil was but faint he set his face down this toward madison square for the homing instinct survives even when the home is a park bench but on an unusually quiet corner soapy came to a standstill here was an old church quaint and rambling and gabled through one violet stained window a soft light glowed where no doubt the organist loitered over the keys making sure of his mastery of the coming sabbath anthem for there drifted out to soapy s ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence the moon was above lustrous and serene vehicles and pedestrians were few sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves for a little while the scene might have been a country churchyard and the anthem that the organist played cemented soapy to the iron fence for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars the conjunction of soapy s receptive state of mind and the influences about the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul he viewed with swift horror the pit into which he had tumbled the degraded days unworthy desires dead hopes wrecked faculties and base motives that made up his existence and also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood an instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate he would pull himself out of the mire he would make a man of himself again he would conquer the evil that had taken possession of him there was time he was comparatively young yet he would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him to morrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and find work a fur importer had once offered him a place as driver he would find him to morrow and ask for the position he would be somebody in the world he would soapy felt a hand laid on his arm he looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman what are you doin here asked the officer nothin said soapy then come along said the policeman three months on the island said the magistrate in the police court the next morning an adjustment of nature in an art exhibition the other day i saw a painting that had been sold for the painter was a young scrub out of the west named kraft who had a favourite food and a pet theory his pabulum was an unquenchable belief in the unerring artistic adjustment of nature his theory was fixed around corned beef hash with poached egg there was a story behind the picture so i went home and let it drip out of a fountain pen the idea of kraft but that is not the beginning of the story three years ago kraft bill judkins a poet and i took our meals at cypher s on eighth avenue i say took when we had money cypher got it off of us as he expressed it we had no credit we went in called for food and ate it we paid or we did not pay we had confidence in cypher s sullenness end smouldering ferocity deep down in his sunless soul he was either a prince a fool or an artist he sat at a worm eaten desk covered with files of waiters checks so old that i was sure the bottomest one was for clams that hendrik hudson had eaten and paid for cypher had the power in common with napoleon iii and the goggle eyed perch of throwing a film over his eyes rendering opaque the windows of his soul once when we left him unpaid with egregious excuses i looked back and saw him shaking with inaudible laughter behind his film now and then we paid up back scores but the chief thing at cypher s was milly milly was a waitress she was a grand example of kraft s theory of the artistic adjustment of nature she belonged largely to waiting as minerva did to the art of scrapping or venus to the science of serious flirtation pedestalled and in bronze she might have stood with the noblest of her heroic sisters as liver and bacon enlivening the world she belonged to cypher s you expected to see her colossal figure loom through that reeking blue cloud of smoke from frying fat just as you expect the palisades to appear through a drifting hudson river fog there amid the steam of vegetables and the vapours of acres of ham and the crash of crockery the clatter of steel the screaming of short orders the cries of the hungering and all the horrid tumult of feeding man surrounded by swarms of the buzzing winged beasts bequeathed us by pharaoh milly steered her magnificent way like some great liner cleaving among the canoes of howling savages our goddess of grub was built on lines so majestic that they could be followed only with awe her sleeves were always rolled above her elbows she could have taken us three musketeers in her two hands and dropped us out of the window she had seen fewer years than any of us but she was of such superb evehood and simplicity that she mothered us from the beginning cypher s store of eatables she poured out upon us with royal indifference to price and quantity as from a cornucopia that knew no exhaustion her voice rang like a great silver bell her smile was many toothed and frequent she seemed like a yellow sunrise on mountain tops i never saw her but i thought of the yosemite and yet somehow i could never think of her as existing outside of cypher s there nature had placed her and she had taken root and grown mightily she seemed happy and took her few poor dollars on saturday nights with the flushed pleasure of a child that receives an unexpected donation it was kraft who first voiced the fear that each of us must have held latently it came up apropos of course of certain questions of art at which we were hammering one of us compared the harmony existing between a haydn symphony and pistache ice cream to the exquisite congruity between milly and cypher s there is a certain fate hanging over milly said kraft and if it overtakes her she is lost to cypher s and to us she will grow fat asked judkins fearsomely she will go to night school and become refined i ventured anxiously it is this said kraft punctuating in a puddle of spilled coffee with a stiff forefinger caesar had his brutus the cotton has its boliworm the chorus girl has her pittsburger the summer boarder has his poison ivy the hero has his carnegie medal art has its morgan the rose has its speak i interrupted much perturbed you do not think that milly will begin to lace one day concluded kraft solemnly there will come to cypher s for a plate of beans a millionaire lumberman from wisconsin and he will marry milly never exclaimed judkins and t in horror a lumberman repeated kraft hoarsely and a millionaire lumberman i sighed despairingly from wisconsin groaned judkins we agreed that the awful fate seemed to menace her few things were less improbable milly like some vast virgin stretch of pine woods was made to catch the lumberman s eye and well we knew the habits of the badgers once fortune smiled upon them straight to new york they hie and lay their goods at the feet of the girl who serves them beans in a beanery why the alphabet itself connives the sunday newspaper s headliner s work is cut for him winsome waitress wins wealthy wisconsin woodsman for a while we felt that milly was on the verge of being lost to us it was our love of the unerring artistic adjustment of nature that inspired us we could not give her over to a lumberman doubly accursed by wealth and provincialism we shuddered to think of milly with her voice modulated and her elbows covered pouring tea in the marble teepee of a tree murderer no in cypher s she belonged in the bacon smoke the cabbage perfume the grand wagnerian chorus of hurled ironstone china and rattling casters our fears must have been prophetic for on that same evening the wildwood discharged upon us milly s preordained confiscator our fee to adjustment and order but alaska and not wisconsin bore the burden of the visitation we were at our supper of beef stew and dried apples when he trotted in as if on the heels of a dog team and made one of the mess at our table with the freedom of the camps he assaulted our ears and claimed the fellowship of men lost in the wilds of a hash house we embraced him as a specimen and in three minutes we had all but died for one another as friends he was rugged and bearded and wind dried he had just come off the trail he said at one of the north river ferries i fancied i could see the snow dust of chilcoot yet powdering his shoulders and then he strewed the table with the nuggets stuffed ptarmigans bead work and seal pelts of the returned kiondiker and began to prate to us of his millions bank drafts for two millions was his summing up and a thousand a day piling up from my claims and now i want some beef stew and canned peaches i never got off the train since i mushed out of seattle and i m hungry the stuff the niggers feed you on pullmans don t count you gentlemen order what you want and then milly loomed up with a thousand dishes on her bare arm loomed up big and white and pink and awful as mount saint elias with a smile like day breaking in a gulch and the kiondiker threw down his pelts and nuggets as dross and let his jaw fall half way and stared at her you could almost see the diamond tiaras on milly s brow and the hand embroidered silk paris gowns that he meant to buy for her at last the bollworm had attacked the cotton the poison ivy was reaching out its tendrils to entwine the summer boarder the millionaire lumberman thinly disguised as the alaskan miner was about to engulf our milly and upset nature s adjustment kraft was the first to act he leaped up and pounded the klondiker s back come out and drink he shouted drink first and eat afterward judkins seized one arm and i the other gaily roaringly irresistibly in jolly good fellow style we dragged him from the restaurant to a cafe stuffing his pockets with his embalmed birds and indigestible nuggets there he rumbled a roughly good humoured protest that s the girl for my money he declared she can eat out of my skillet the rest of her life why i never see such a fine girl i m going back there and ask her to marry me i guess she won t want to sling hash any more when she sees the pile of dust i ve got you ll take another whiskey and milk now kraft persuaded with satan s smile i thought you up country fellows were better sports kraft spent his puny store of coin at the bar and then gave judkins and me such an appealing look that we went down to the last dime we had in toasting our guest then when our ammunition was gone and the klondiker still somewhat sober began to babble again of milly kraft whispered into his ear such a polite barbed insult relating to people who were miserly with their funds that the miner crashed down handful after handful of silver and notes calling for all the fluids in the world to drown the imputation thus the work was accomplished with his own guns we drove him from the field and then we had him carted to a distant small hotel and put to bed with his nuggets and baby seal skins stuffed around him he will never find cypher s again said kraft he will propose to the first white apron he sees in a dairy restaurant to morrow and milly i mean the natural adjustment is saved and back to cypher s went we three and finding customers scarce we joined hands and did an indian dance with milly in the centre this i say happened three years ago and about that time a little luck descended upon us three and we were enabled to buy costlier and less wholesome food than cypher s our paths separated and i saw kraft no more and judkins seldom but as i said i saw a painting the other day that was sold for the title was boadicea and the figure seemed to fill all out of doors but of all the picture s admirers who stood before it i believe i was the only one who longed for boadicea to stalk from her frame bringing me corned beef hash with poached egg i hurried away to see kraft his satanic eyes were the same his hair was worse tangled but his clothes had been made by a tailor i didn t know i said to him we ve bought a cottage in the bronx with the money said he any evening at then said i when you led us against the lumberman the klondiker it wasn t altogether on account of the unerring artistic adjustment of nature well not altogether said kraft with a grin memoirs of a yellow dog i don t suppose it will knock any of you people off your perch to read a contribution from an animal mr kipling and a good many others have demonstrated the fact that animals can express themselves in remunerative english and no magazine goes to press nowadays without an animal story in it except the old style monthlies that are still running pictures of bryan and the mont pelee horror but you needn t look for any stuck up literature in my piece such as bearoo the bear and snakoo the snake and tammanoo the tiger talk in the jungle books a yellow dog that s spent most of his life in a cheap new york flat sleeping in a corner on an old sateen underskirt the one she spilled port wine on at the lady longshoremen s banquet mustn t be expcctcd to perform any tricks with the art of speech i was born a yellow pup date locality pedigree and weight unknown the first thing i can recollect an old woman had me in a basket at broadway and twenty third trying to sell me to a fat lady old mother hubbard was boosting me to beat the band as a genuine pomeranian hambletonian red irish cochin china stoke pogis fox terrier the fat lady chased a v around among the samples of gros grain flannelette in her shopping bag till she cornered it and gave up from that moment i was a pet a mamma s own wootsey squidlums say gentle reader did you ever have a pound woman breathing a flavour of camembert cheese and peau d espagne pick you up and wallop her nose all over you remarking all the time in an emma eames tone of voice oh oo s um oodlum doodlum woodlum toodlum bitsy witsy skoodlums from a pedigreed yellow pup i grew up to be an anonymous yellow cur looking like a cross between an angora cat and a box of lemons but my mistress never tumbled she thought that the two primeval pups that noah chased into the ark were but a collateral branch of my ancestors it took two policemen to keep her from entering me at the madison square garden for the siberian bloodhound prize i ll tell you about that flat the house was the ordinary thing in new york paved with parian marble in the entrance hall and cobblestones above the first floor our fiat was three well not flights climbs up my mistress rented it unfurnished and put in the regular things antique unholstered parlour set oil chromo of geishas in a harlem tea house rubber plant and husband by sirius there was a biped i felt sorry for he was a little man with sandy hair and whiskers a good deal like mine henpecked well toucans and flamingoes and pelicans all had their bills in him he wiped the dishes and listened to my mistress tell about the cheap ragged things the lady with the squirrel skin coat on the second floor hung out on her line to dry and every evening while she was getting supper she made him take me out on the end of a string for a walk if men knew how

minutes before time for him to come home from work she straightens up the house fixes her rat so it won t show and gets out a lot of sewing for a ten minute bluff i led a dog s life in that flat most all day i lay there in my corner watching that fat woman kill time i slept sometimes and had pipe dreams about being out chasing cats into basements and growling at old ladies with black mittens as a dog was intended to do then she would pounce upon me with a lot of that drivelling poodle palaver and kiss me on the nose but what could i do a dog can t chew cloves i began to feel sorry for hubby dog my cats if i didn t we looked so much alike that people noticed it when we went out so we shook the streets that morgan s cab drives down and took to climbing the piles of last december s snow on the streets where cheap people live one evening when we were thus promenading and i was trying to look like a prize st bernard and the old man was trying to look like he wouldn t have murdered the first organ grinder he heard play mendelssohn s wedding march i looked up at him and said in my way what are you looking so sour about you oakum trimmed lobster she don t kiss you you don t have to sit on her lap and listen to talk that would make the book of a musical comedy sound like the maxims of epictetus you ought to be thankful you re not a dog brace up benedick and bid the blues begone

us lived a lady with a black and tan terrier her husband strung it and took it out every evening but he always came home cheerful and whistling one day i touched noses with the black and tan in the hall and i struck him for an elucidation see here wiggle and skip i says you know that it ain t the nature of a real man to play dry nurse to a dog in public i never saw one leashed to a bow wow yet that didn t look like he d like to lick every other man that looked at him but your boss comes in every day as perky and set up as an amateur prestidigitator doing the egg trick how does he do it don t tell me he likes it him says the black and tan why he uses nature s own remedy he gets spifflicated at first when we go out he s as shy as the man on the steamer who would rather play pedro when they make em all jackpots by the time we ve been in eight saloons he don t care whether the thing on the end of his line is a dog or a catfish i ve lost two inches of my tail trying to sidestep those swinging doors the pointer i got from that terrier vaudeville please copy set me to thinking one evening about o clock my mistress ordered him to get busy and do the ozone act for lovey i have concealed it until now but that is what she called me the black and tan was called tweetness i consider that i have the bulge on him as far as you could chase a rabbit still lovey is something of a nomenclatural tin can on the tail of one s self respect at a quiet place on a safe street i tightened the line of my custodian in front of an attractive refined saloon i made a dead ahead scramble for the doors whining like a dog in the press despatches that lets the family know that little alice is bogged while gathering lilies in the brook why darn my eyes says the old man with a grin darn my eyes if the saffron coloured son of a seltzer lemonade ain t asking me in to take a drink lemme see how long s it been since i saved shoe leather by keeping one foot on the foot rest i believe i ll i knew i had him hot scotches he took sitting at a table for an hour he kept the campbells coming i sat by his side rapping for the waiter with my tail and eating free lunch such as mamma in her flat never equalled with her homemade truck bought at a delicatessen store eight minutes before papa comes home when the products of scotland were all exhausted except the rye bread the old man unwound me from the table leg and played me outside like a fisherman plays a salmon out there he took off my collar and threw it into the street poor doggie says he good doggie she shan t kiss you any more s a darned shame good doggie go away and get run over by a street car and be happy i refused to leave i leaped and frisked around the old man s legs happy as a pug on a rug you old flea headed woodchuck chaser i said to him you moon baying rabbit pointing eggstealing old beagle can t you see that i don t want to leave you can t you see that we re both pups in the wood and the missis is the cruel uncle after you with the dish towel and me with the flea liniment and a pink bow to tie on my tail why not cut that all out and be pards forever more maybe you ll say he didn t understand maybe he didn t but he kind of got a grip on the hot scotches and stood still for a minute thinking doggie says he finally we don t live more than a dozen lives on this earth and very few of us live to be more than if i ever see that flat any more i m a flat and if you do you re flatter and that s no flattery i m offering to that westward ho wins out by the length of a dachshund there was no string but i frolicked along with my master to the twenty third street ferry and the cats on the route saw reason to give thanks that prehensile claws had been given them on the jersey side my master said to a stranger who stood eating a currant bun me and my doggie we are bound for the rocky mountains but what pleased me most was when my old man pulled both of my ears until i howled and said you common monkey headed rat tailed sulphur coloured son of a door mat do you know what i m going to call you i thought of lovey and i whined dolefully i m going to call you pete says my master and if i d had five tails i couldn t have done enough wagging to do justice to the occasion the love philtre of ikey schoenstein the blue light drug store is downtown between the bowery and first avenue where the distance between the two streets is the shortest the blue light does not consider that pharmacy is a thing of bric a brac scent and ice cream soda if you ask it for pain killer it will not give you a bonbon the blue light scorns the labour saving arts of modern pharmacy it macerates its opium and percolates its own laudanum and paregoric to this day pills are made behind its tall prcscription desk pills rolled out on its own pill tile divided with a spatula rolled with the finger and thumb dusted with calcined magnesia and delivered in little round pasteboard pill boxes the store is on a corner about which coveys of ragged plumed hilarious children play and become candidates for the cough drops and soothing syrups that wait for them inside ikey schoenstein was the night clerk of the blue light and the friend of his customers thus it is on the east side where the heart of pharmacy is not g ace there as it should be the druggist is a counsellor a confessor an adviser an able and willing missionary and mentor whose learning is respected whose occult wisdom is venerated and whose medicine is often poured untasted into the gutter therefore ikey s corniform be spectacled nose and narrow knowledge bowed figure was well known in the vicinity of the blue light and his advice and notice were much desired ikey roomed and breakfasted at mrs riddle s two squares away mrs riddle had a daughter named rosy the circumlocution has been in vain you must have guessed it ikey adored rosy she tinctured all his thoughts she was the compound extract of all that was chemically pure and officinal the dispensatory contained nothing equal to her but ikey was timid and his hopes remained insoluble in the menstruum of his backwardness and fears behind his counter he was a superior being calmly conscious of special knowledge and worth outside he was a weak kneed purblind motorman cursed rambler with ill fitting clothes stained with chemicals and smelling of socotrine aloes and valerianate of ammonia the fly in ikey s ointment thrice welcome pat trope was chunk mcgowan mr mcgowan was also striving to catch the bright smiles tossed about by rosy but he was no outfielder as ikey was he picked them off the bat at the same time he was ikey s friend and customer and often dropped in at the blue light drug store to have a bruise painted with iodine or get a cut rubber plastered after a pleasant evening spent along the bowery one afternoon mcgowan drifted in in his silent easy way and sat comely smooth faced hard indomitable good natured upon a stool ikey said he when his friend had fetched his mortar and sat opposite grinding gum benzoin to a powder get busy with your ear it s drugs for me if you ve got the line i need ikey scanned the countenance of mr mcgowan for the usual evidences of conflict but found none take your coat off he ordered i guess already that you have been stuck in the ribs with a knife i have many times told you those dagoes would do you up mr mcgowan smiled not them he said not any dagoes but you ve located the diagnosis all right enough it s under my coat near the ribs say ikey rosy and me are goin to run away and get married to night ikey s left forefinger was doubled over the edge of the mortar holding it steady he gave it a wild rap with the pestle but felt it not meanwhile mr mcgowan s smile faded to a look of perplexed gloom that is he continued if she keeps in the notion until the time comes we ve been layin pipes for the getaway for two weeks one day she says she will the same evenin she says nixy we ve agreed on to night and rosy s stuck to the affirmative this time for two whole days but it s five hours yet till the time and i m afraid she ll stand me up when it comes to the scratch you said you wanted drugs remarked ikey mr mcgowan looked ill at ease and harassed a condition opposed to his usual line of demeanour he made a patent medicine almanac into a roll and fitted it with unprofitable carefulness about his finger i wouldn t have this double handicap make a false start to night for a million he said i ve got a little flat up in harlem all ready with chrysanthemums on the table and a kettle ready to boil and i ve engaged a pulpit pounder to be ready at his house for us at it s got to come off and if rosy don t change her mind again mr mcgowan ceased a prey to his doubts i don t see then yet said ikey shortly what makes it that you talk of drugs or what i can be doing about it old man riddle don t like me a little bit went on the uneasy suitor bent upon marshalling his arguments for a week he hasn t let rosy step outside the door with me if it wasn t for losin a boarder they d have bounced me long ago i m makin a week and she ll never regret flyin the coop with chunk mcgowan you will excuse me chunk said ikey i must make a prescription that is to be called for soon say said mcgowan looking up suddenly say ikey ain t there a drug of some kind some kind of powders that ll make a girl like you better if you give em to her ikey s lip beneath his nose curled with the scorn of superior enlightenment but before he could answer mcgowan continued tim lacy told me he got some once from a croaker uptown and fed em to his girl in soda water from the very first dose he was ace high and everybody else looked like thirty cents to her they was married in less than two weeks strong and simple was chunk mcgowan a better reader of men than ikey was could have seen that his tough frame was strung upon fine wires like a good general who was about to invade the enemy s territory he was seeking to guard every point against possible failure i thought went on chunk hopefully that if i had one of them powders to give rosy when i see her at supper to night it might brace her up and keep her from reneging on the proposition to skip i guess she don t need a mule team to drag her away but women are better at coaching than they are at running bases if the stuff ll work just for a couple of hours it ll do the trick when is this foolishness of running away to be happening asked ikey nine o clock said mr mcgowan supper s at seven at eight rosy goes to bed with a headache at nine old parvenzano lets me through to his back yard where there s a board off riddle s fence next door i go under her window and help her down the fire escape we ve got to make it early on the preacher s account it s all dead easy if rosy don t balk when the flag drops can you fix me one of them powders ikey ikey schoenstein rubbed his nose slowly chunk said he it is of drugs of that nature that pharmaceutists must have much carefulness to you alone of my acquaintance would i intrust a powder like that but for you i shall make it and you shall see how it makes rosy to think of you ikey went behind the prescription desk there he crushed to a powder two soluble tablets each containing a quarter of a grain of morphia to them he added a little sugar of milk to increase the bulk and folded the mixture neatly in a white paper taken by an adult this powder would insure several hours of heavy slumber without danger to the sleeper this he handed to chunk mcgowan telling him to administer it in a liquid if possible and received the hearty thanks of the backyard lochinvar the subtlety of ikey s action becomes apparent upon recital of his subsequent move he sent a messenger for mr riddle and disclosed the plans of mr mcgowan for eloping with rosy mr riddle was a stout man brick dusty of complexion and sudden in action much obliged he said briefly to ikey the lazy irish loafer my own room s just above rosy s i ll just go up there myself after supper and load the shot gun and wait if he comes in my back yard he ll go away in a ambulance instead of a bridal chaise with rosy held in the clutches of morpheus for a many hours deep slumber and the bloodthirsty parent waiting armed and forewarned ikey felt that his rival was close indeed upon discomfiture all night in the blue light drug store he waited at his duties for chance news of the tragedy but none came at eight o clock in the morning the day clerk arrived and ikey started hurriedly for mrs riddle s to learn the outcome and lo as he stepped out of the store who but chunk mcgowan sprang from a passing street car and grasped his hand chunk mcgowan with a victor s smile and flushed with joy pulled it off said chunk with elysium in his grin rosy bit the fire escape on time to a second and we was under the wire at the reverend s at o she s up at the flat she cooked eggs this mornin in a blue kimono lord how lucky i am you must pace up some day ikey and feed with us i ve got a job down near the bridge and that s where i m heading for now the the powder stammered ikey oh that stuff you gave me said chunk broadening his grin well it was this way i sat down at the supper table last night at riddle s and i looked at rosy and i says to myself chunk if you get the girl get her on the square don t try any hocus pocus with a thoroughbred like her and i keeps the paper you give me in my pocket and then my lamps fall on another party present who i says to myself is failin in a proper affection toward his comin son in law so i watches my chance and dumps that powder in old man riddle s coffee

through the dilatory correspondence with the few friends to whom he still wrote still he could not repress a little thrill of satisfaction at knowing that she had not yet married tolliver or any one else but evidently tolliver had not yet abandoned hope well it made no difference to him now he had eaten of the lotus he was happy and content in this land of perpetual afternoon those old days of life in the states seemed like an irritating dream he hoped ida would be as happy as he was the climate as balmy as that of distant avalon the fetterless idyllic round of enchanted days the life among this indolent romantic people a life full of music flowers and low laughter the influence of the imminent sea and mountains and the many shapes of love and magic and beauty that bloomed in the white tropic nights with all he was more than content also there was paula brannigan geddie intended to marry paula if of course she would consent but he felt rather sure that she would do that somehow he kept postponing his proposal several times he had been quite near to it but a mysterious something always held him back perhaps it was only the unconscious instinctive conviction that the act would sever the last tie that bound him to his old world he could be very happy with paula few of the native girls could be compared with her she had attended a convent school in new orleans for two years and when she chose to display her accomplishments no one could detect any difference between her and the girls of norfolk and manhattan but it was delicious to see her at home dressed as she sometimes was in the native costume with bare shoulders and flowing sleeves bernard brannigan was the great merchant of coralio besides his store he maintained a train of pack mules and carried on a lively trade with the interior towns and villages he had married a native lady of high castilian descent but with a tinge of indian brown showing through her olive cheek the union of the irish and the spanish had produced as it so often has an offshoot of rare beauty and variety they were very excellent people indeed and the upper story of the house was ready to be placed at the service of geddie and paula as soon as he should make up his mind to speak about it by the time two hours were whiled away the consul tired of reading the papers lay scattered about him on the gallery reclining there he gazed dreamily out upon an eden a clump of banana plants interposed their broad shields between him and the sun the gentle slope from the consulate to the sea was covered with the dark green foliage of lemon trees and orange trees just bursting into bloom a lagoon pierced the land like a dark jagged crystal and above it a pale ceiba tree rose almost to the clouds the waving coconut palms on the beach flared their decorative green leaves against the slate of an almost quiescent sea his senses were cognizant of brilliant scarlet and ochres and the vert of the coppice of odors of fruit and bloom and the smoke from chanca s clay oven under the calabash tree of the treble laughter of the native women in their huts the song of the robin the salt taste of the breeze the diminuendo of the faint surf running along the shore and gradually of a white speck growing to a blur that intruded itself upon the drab prospect of the sea lazily interested he watched this blur increase until it became the idalia steaming at full speed coming down the coast without changing his position he kept his eyes upon the beautiful white yacht as she drew swiftly near and came opposite to coralio then sitting upright he saw her float steadily past and on he had seen the frequent splash of her polished brass work and the stripes of her deck awnings so much and no more like a ship on a magic lantern slide the idalia had crossed the illuminated circle of the consul s little world and was gone save for the tiny cloud of smoke that was left hanging over the brim of the sea she might have been an immaterial thing a chimera of his idle brain geddie went into his office and sat down to dawdle over his report if the reading of the article in the paper had left him unshaken this silent passing of the idalia had done for him still more it had brought the calm and peace of a situation from which all uncertainty had been erased he knew that men sometimes hope without being aware of it now since she had come two thousand miles and had passed without a sign not even his unconscious self need cling to the past any longer after dinner when the sun was low behind the mountains geddie walked on the little strip of beach under the coconuts the wind was blowing mildly landward and the surface of the sea was rippled by tiny wavelets a miniature breaker spreading with a soft swish upon the sand brought with its something round and shiny that rolled back again as the wave receded the next influx beached it clear and geddie picked it up the thing was a long necked wine bottle of colorless glass the cork had been driven in tightly to the level of the mouth and the end covered with dark red sealing wax the bottle contained only what seemed to be a sheet of paper much curled from the manipulation it had undergone while being inserted in the sealing wax was the impression of a seal probably of a signet ring bearing the initials of a monogram but the impression had been hastily made and the letters were past anything more certain than a shrewd conjecture ida payne had always worn a signet ring in preference to any other finger decoration geddie thought he could make out the familiar i p and a queer sensation of disquietude went over him more personal and intimate was this reminder of her than had been the sight of the vessel she was doubtless on he walked back to his house and set the bottle on his desk throwing off his hat and coat and lighting a lamp for the night had crowded precipitately upon the brief twilight he began to examine his piece of sea salvage by holding the bottle near the light and turning it judiciously he made out that it contained a double sheet of note paper filled with close writing further that the paper was of the same size and shade as that always used by ida and that to the best of his belief the handwriting was hers the imperfect glass of the bottle so distorted the rays of light that he could read no word of the writing but certain capital letters of which he caught comprehensive glimpses were ida s he felt sure there was a little smile both of perplexity and amusement in geddie s eyes as he set the bottle down and laid three cigars side by side on his desk he fetched his steamer chair from the gallery and stretched himself comfortably he would smoke those three cigars while considering the problem for it amounted to a problem he almost wished that he had not found the bottle but the bottle was there why should it have drifted in from the sea whence come so many disquieting things to disturb his peace in this dreamy land where time seemed so redundant he had fallen into the habit of bestowing much thought upon even trifling matters he bagan to speculate upon many fanciful theories concerning the story of the bottle rejecting each in turn ships in danger of wreck or disablement sometimes cast forth such precarious messengers calling for aid but he had seen the idalia not three hours before safe and speeding suppose the crew had mutinied and imprisoned the passengers below and the message was one begging for succor but premising such an improbable outrage would the agitated captives have taken the pains to fill four pages of note paper with carefully penned arguments to their rescue thus by elimination he soon rid the matter of the more unlikely theories and was reduced though aversely to the less assailable ones that the bottle contained a message to himself ida knew he was in coralio she must have launched the bottle while the yacht was passing and the wind blowing fairly toward the shore as soon as geddie reached this conclusion a wrinkle came between his brows and a stubborn look settled around his mouth he sat looking out through the doorway at the gigantic fire flies traversing the quiet streets if this was a message to him from ida what could it mean save an overture at reconciliation and if that why had she not used the same methods of the post instead of this uncertain and even flippant means of communication a note in an empty bottle cast into the sea there was something light and frivolous about it if not actually contemptuous the thought stirred his pride and subdued whatever emotions had been resurrected by the finding of the bottle geddie put on his coat and hat and walked out he followed a street that led him along the border of the little plaza where a band was playing and people were rambling care free and indolent some timorous senoritas scurrying past with fire flies tangled in the jetty braids of their hair glanced at him with shy flattering eyes the air was languorous with the scent of jasmin and orange blossoms the consul stayed his steps at the house of bernard brannigan paula was swinging in a hammock on the gallery she rose from it like a bird from its nest the color came to her cheeck at the sound of geddie s voice he was charmed at the sight of her costume a flounced muslin dress with a little jacket of white flannel all made with neatness and style he suggested a stroll and they walked out to the old indian well on the hill road they sat on the curb and there geddie made the expected but long deferred speech certain though he had been that she would not say him nay he was still thrilled at the completeness and sweetness of her surrender here was surely a heart made for love and steadfastness here was no caprice or questionings or captious standards of convention when geddie kissed paula at her door that night he was happier than he had ever been before here in this hollow lotus land ever to live and lie reclined seemed to him as it has seemed to many mariners the best as well as the easiest his future would be an ideal one he had attained a paradise without a serpent his eve would be indeed a part of him unbeguiled and therefore more beguiling he had made his decision tonight and his heart was full of serene assured content geddie went back to his house whistling that finest and saddest love song la golondrina at the door his tame monkey leaped down from his shelf chattering briskly the consul turned to his desk to get him some nuts he usually kept there reaching in the half darkness his hand struck against the bottle he started as if he had touched the cold rotundity of a serpent he had forgotten that the bottle was there he lighted the lamp and fed the monkey then very deliberately he lighted a cigar and took the bottle in his hand and walked down the path to the beach there was a moon and the sea was glorious the breeze had shifted as it did each evening and was now rushing steadily seaward stepping to the water s edge geddie hurled the unopened bottle far out into the sea it disappeared for a moment and then shot upward twice its length geddie stood still watching it the moonlight was so bright that he could see it bobbing up and down with the little waves slowly it receded from the shore flashing and turning as it went the wind was carrying it out to sea soon it became a mere speck doubtfully discerned at irregular intervals and then the mystery of it was swallowed up by the greater mystery of the ocean geddie stood still upon the beach smoking and looking out upon the water simon oh simon wake up there simon bawled a sonorous voice at the edge of the water old simon cruz was a half breed fisherman and smuggler who lived in a hut on the beach out of his earliest nap simon was thus awakened he slipped on his shoes and went outside just landing from one of the valhalla s boats was the third mate of that vessel who was an acquaintance of simon s and three sailors from the fruiter go up simon called the mate and find doctor gregg or mr goodwin or anybody that s a friend to mr geddie and bring em here at once saints of the skies said simon sleepily nothing has happened to mr geddie he s under that tarpauling said the mate pointing to the boat and he s rather more than half drowned we seen him from the steamer nearly a mile out from shore swimmin like mad after a bottle that was floatin in the water outward bound we lowered the gig and started for him he nearly had his hand on the bottle when he gave out and went under we pulled him out in time to save him maybe but the doctor is the one to decide that a bottle said the old man rubbing his eyes he was not yet fully awake where is the bottle driftin along out there some eres said the mate jerking his thumb toward the sea get on with you simon iii smith goodwin and the ardent patriot zavalla took all the precautions that their foresight could contrive to prevent the escape of president miraflores and his companion the sent trusted messengers up the coast to solitas and alazan to warn the local leaders of the flight and to instruct them to patrol the water line and arrest the fugitives at all hazards should they reveal themselves in that territory after this was done there remained only to cover the district about coralio and await the coming of the quarry the nets were well spread the roads were so few the opportunities for embarkation so limited and the two or three probable points of exit so well guarded that it would be strange indeed if there should slip through the meshes so much of the country s dignity romance and collateral the president would without doubt move as secretly as possible and endeavor to board a vessel by stealth from some secluded point along the shore on the fourth day after the receipt of englehart s telegram the karlsefin a norwegian steamer chartered by the new orleans fruit trade anchored off coralio with three horse toots of her siren the karlesfin ws not one of the line operated by the vesuvius fruit company she was something of a dilettante doing odd jobs for a company that was scarcely important enough to figure as a rival to the vesuvius the movements of the karlesfin were dependent upon the state of the market sometimes she would ply steadily between the spanish main and new orleans in the regular transport of fruit next she would be maing erratic trips to mobile or charleston or even as far north as new york according to the distribution of the fruit supply goodwin lounged upon the beach with the susual crowd of idlers that had gathered to view the steamer now that president miraflores might be expected to reach the borders of his abjured country at any time the orders were to keep a strict and unrelenting watch every vessel that approached the shores might now be considered a possible means of escape for the fugitives and an eye was kept even on the slopes and dories that belonged to the sea going contingent of coralio goodwin and zavalla moved everywhere but without ostentation watching the loopholes of escape the customs official crowded importantly into their boat and rowed out to the karlesfin a boat from the steamer landed her purser with his papers and took out the quarantine doctor with his green umbrella and clinical thermometer next a swarm of caribs began to load upon lighters the thousands of bunches of bananas heaped upon the shore and row them out to the steamer the karlesfin had no passenger list and was soon done with the attention of the authorities the purser declared that the steamer would remain at anchor until morning taking on her fruit during the night the karlesfin had come he said from new york to which port her latest load of oranges and coconuts had been conveyed two or three of the freighter sloops were engaged to assist in the work for the captain was anxious to make a quick return in order to reap the advantage offered by a certain dearth of fruit in the states about four o clock in the afternoon another of those marine monsters not very familiar in those waters hove in sight following the fateful idalia a graceful steam yacht painted a light buff clean cut as a steel engraving the beautiful vessel hovered off shore see sawing the waves as lightly as a duck in a rain barrel a swift boat manned by a crew in uniform came ashore and a stocky built man leaped to the sands the newcomer seemed to turn a disapproving eye upon the rather motley congregation of native anchurians and made his way at once toward goodwin who was the most conspicuously anglo saxon figure present goodwin greeted him with courtesy conversation developed that the newly landed one was named smith and that he had come in a yacht a meagre biography truly for the yacht was most apparent and the smith not beyond a reasonable guess before the revelation yet to the eye of goodwin who has seen several things there was a discrepancy between smith and his yacht a bullet headed man smith was with an oblique dead eye and the moustache of a cocktail mixer and unless he had shifted costumes before putting off for shore he had affronted the deck of his correct vessel clad in a pearl gray derby a gay plaid suit and vaudeville neckwear men owning pleasure yachts generally harmonize better with them smith looked business but he was no advertiser he commented upon the scenery remarking upon its fidelity to the pictures in the geography and then inquired for the united states consul goodwin pointed out the starred and striped bunting hanging from above the little consulate which was concealed behind the orange trees mr geddie the consul will be sure to be there said goodwin he was very nearly drowned a few days ago while taking a swim in the sea and the doctor has ordered him to remain indoors for some time smith ploughed his way through the sand to the consulate his haberdashery creating violent discord against the smooth tropical blues and greens geddie was lounging in his hammock somewhat pale of face and languid in pose on that night when the valhalla s boat had brought him ashore apparently drenched to death by the sea doctor gregg and his other friends had toiled for hours to preserve the little spark of life that remained to him the bottle with its impotent message was gone out to sea and the problem that it had provoked was reduced to a simple sum in addition one and one make two by the rule of arithmetic one by the rule of romance there is a quaint old theory that man may have two souls a peripheral one which serves ordinarily and a central one which is stirred only at certain times but then with activity and vigor while under the domination of the former a man will shave vote pay taxes give money to his family buy subscription books and comport himself on the average plan but let the central soul suddenly become dominant and he may in the twinkling of an eye turn upon the partner of his joys with furious execration he may change his politics while you could snap your fingers he may deal out deadly insult to his dearest friend he may get him instanter to a monastery or a dance hall he may elope or hang himself or he may write a song or poem or kiss his wife unasked or give his funds to the search of a microbe then the peripheral soul will return and we have our safe sane citizen again it is but the revolt of the ego against order and its effect is to shake up the atoms only that they may settle where they belong geddie s revulsion had been a mild one no more than a swim in a summer sea after so inglorious an object as a drifting bottle and now he was himself again upon his desk ready for the post was a letter to his government tendering his resignation as consul to be effective as soon as another could be appointed in his place for bernard brannigan who never did things in a half way manner was to take geddie at once for a partner in his very profitable and various enterprises and paula was happily engaged in plans for refurnishing and decorating the upper story of the brannigan house the consul rose from his hammock when he saw the conspicuous stranger at this door keep your seat old man said the visitor with an airy wave of his large hand my name s smith and i ve come in a yacht you are the consul is that right a big cool guy on the beach directed me here thought i d pay my respects to the flag sit down said geddie i ve been admiring your craft ever since it came in sight looks like a fast sailer what s her tonnage search me said smith i don t know what she weighs in at but she s got a tidy gait the rambler that s her name don t take the dust of anything afloat this is my first trip on her i m taking a squint along this coast just to get an idea of the countries where the rubber and red pepper and revolutions come from i had no idea there was so much scenery down here why central park ain t in it with this neck of the woods i m from new york they get monkeys and coconuts and parrots down here is that right we have them all said geddie i m quite sure that our fauna and flora would take a prize over central park maybe they would admitted smith cheerfully i haven t seen them yet but i guess you ve got us skinned on the animal and vegetation question you don t have much travel here do you travel queried the consul i suppose you mean passengers on steamers no very few people land in coralio an investor now and then tourists and sightseers generally go further down the coast to one of the larger towns where there is a harbor i see a ship out there loading up with bananas said smith any passengers come on her that s the karlesfin said the consul she s a tramp fruiter made her last trip to new york i believe no she brought no passengers i saw her boat come ashore and there was no one about the only exciting recreation we have here is watching steamers when they arrive and a passenger on one of them generally causes the whole town to turn out if you are going to remain in coralio a while mr smith i ll be glad to take you around to meet some people there are four or five american chaps that are good to know besides the native high fliers thanks said the yachtsman but i wouldn t put you the trouble i d like to meet the guys you speak of but i won t be here long enough to do much knocking around that cool gent on the beach spoke of a doctor can you tell me where to find him the rambler ain t quite as steady on her feet as a broadway hotel and a fellow gets a touch of seasickness now and then thought i d strike the croaker for a handful of the little sugar pills in case i need em you will be apt to find doctor gregg at the hotel said the consul you can see it from the door it s that two story building with the balcony where the orange trees are the hotel de los extranjeros was a dreary hostelry in great disuse both by strangers and friends it stood at a corner of the street of the holy sepulchre a grove of small orange trees crowded against one side of it enclosed by a low rock wall over which a tall man might easily step the house was of plastered adobe stained a hundred shades of color by the salt breeze and the sun upon its upper balcony opened a central door and two windows containing broad jalousies instead of sashes the lower floor communicated by two doorways with the narrow rock paved sidewalk the pulperia or drinking shop of the proprietess madama timotea ortiz occupied the ground floor on the bottles of brandy anisada scotch smoke and inexpensive wines behind the little counter the dust lay thick save where the fingers of infrequent customers had left irregular prints the upper story contained four or five guest rooms which were rarely put to their destined use sometimes a fruitgrower riding in from his plantation to confer with his agent would pass a melancholy night in the dismal upper story sometimes a minor native official on some trifling government quest would have his pomp and majesty awed by madama s sepulchral hospitality but madama sat behind her bar content not desiring to quarrel with fate if any one required meat drink or lodging at the hotel de los extranjeros they had but to come and be served esta bueno if they came not why then they came not esta bueno as the exceptional yachtsman was making his way down the precarious sidewalk of the street of the holy sepulchre the solitary permanent guest of that decaying hotel sat at its door enjoying the breeze from the sea doctor gregg the quarantine physician was a man of fifty or sixty with a florid face and the longest beard between topeka and terra del fuego he held his position by virtue of an appointment by the board of health of a seaport city in one of the southern states that city feared the ancient enemy of every southern seaport the yellow fever and it was the duty of doctor gregg to examine crew and passengers of every vessel leaving coralio for preliminary symptoms the duties were light and the salary for one who lived in coralio ample surplus time there was in plenty and the good doctor added to his gains by a large private practice among the residents of the coast the fact that he did not know ten words of spanish was no obstacle a pulse could be felt and a fee collected without one being a linguist add to the description the facts that the doctor had a story to tell concerning the operation of trepanning which no listener had ever allowed him to conclude and that he believed in brandy as a prophylactic and the special points of interest possessed by doctor gregg will have become exhausted the doctor had dragged a chair to the sidewalk he was coatless and he leaned back against the wall and smoked while he stroked his beard surprise came into his pale blue eyes when he caught sight of smith in his unusual and prismatic clothes you re doctor gregg is that right said smith feeling the dog s head pin in his tie the constable i mean the consul told me you hung out at this caravansary my name s smith and i came in a yacht taking a cruise around looking at the monkeys and pineapple trees come inside and have a drink doc this cafe looks on the blink but i guess it can set out something wet i will join you sir in just a taste of brandy said doctor gregg rising quickly i find that as a prophylactic a little brandy is almost a necessity in this climate as they turned to enter the pulperia a native man barefoot glided noiselessly up and addressed the doctor in spanish he was yellowish brown like an over ripe lemon he wore a cotton shirt and ragged linen trousers girded by a leather belt his face was like an animal s live and wary but without promise of much intelligence this man jabbered with animation and so much seriousness that it seemed a pity that his words were to be wasted doctor gregg felt his pulse you sick he inquired mi mujer es enferma en la casa said the man thus endeavoring to convey the news in the only language open to him that his wife lay ill in her palm thatched hut the doctor drew a handful of capsules filled with a white powder from his trousers pocket he counted out ten of them into the native s hand and held up his forefinger impressively take one said the doctor every two hours he then held up two fingers shaking them emphatically before the native s face next he pulled out his watch and ran his finger round the dial twice again the two fingers confronted the patient s nose two two two hours repeated the doctor si senor said the native sadly he pulled a cheap silver watch from his own pocket and laid it in the doctor s hand me bring said he struggling painfully with his scant english other watchy tomorrow then he departed downheartedly with his capsules a very ignorant race of people sir said the doctor as he slipped the watch into his pocket he seems to have mistaken my directions for taking the physic for the fee however it is all right he owes me an account anyway the chances are that he won t bring the other watch you can t depend on anything they promise you about that drink now how did you come to coralio mr smith i was not aware that any boats except the karlesfin had arrived for some days the two leaned against the deserted bar and madama set out a bottle without waiting for the doctor s order there was no dust on it after they had drank twice smith said you say there were no passengers on the karlesfin doc are you sure about that it seems to me i heard somebody down on the beach say that there was one or two aboard they were mistaken sir i myself went out and put all hands through a medical examination as usual the karlesfin sails as soon as she gets her bananas loaded which will be about daylight in the morning and she got everything ready this afternoon no sir there was no passenger list like that three star a french schooner landed two slooploads of it a month ago if any customs duties on it went to the distinguished republic of anchuria you may have my hat if you won t have another come out and let s sit in the cool a while it isn t often we exiles get a chance to talk with somebody from the outside world the doctor brought out another chair to the sidewalk for his new acquaintance the two seated themselves you are a man of the world said doctor gregg a man of travel and experience your decision in a matter of ethics and no doubt on the points of equity ability and professional probity should be of value i would be glad if you will listen to the history of a case that i think stands unique in medical annals about nine years ago while i was engaged in the practice of medicine in my native city i was called to treat a case of contusion of the skull i made the diagnosis that a splinter of bone was pressing upon the brain and that the surgical operation known as trepanning was required however as the patient was a gentleman of wealth and position i called in for consultation doctor smith rose from his chair and laid a hand soft with apology upon the doctor s shirt sleeve say doc he said solemnly i want to hear that story you ve got me interrested and i don t want to miss the rest of it i know it s a loola by the way it begins and i want to tell it at the next meeting of the barney o flynn association if you don t mind but i ve got one or two matters to attend to first if i get em attended to in time i ll come right back and hear you spiel the rest before bedtime is that right by all means said the doctor get your business attended to and then return i shall wait up for you you see one of the most prominent physicians at the consultation diagnosed the trouble as a blood clot another said it was an abscess but i don t tell me now doc don t spoil the story wait till i come back i want to hear it as it runs off the reel is that right the mountains reached up their bulky shoulders to receive the level gallop of apollo s homing steeds the day died in the lagoons and in the shadowed banana groves and in the mangrove swamps where the great blue crabs were beginning to crawl to land for their nightly ramble and it died at last upon the highest peaks then the brief twilight ephemeral as the flight of a moth came and went the southern cross peeped with its topmost eye above a row of palms and the fire flies heralded with their torches and approach of soft footed night in the offing the karlesfin swayed at anchor her lights seeming to penetrate the water to countless fathoms with their shimmering lanceolate reflections the caribs were busy loading her by means of the great lighters heaped full from the piles of fruit ranged upon the shore on the sandy beach with his back against a coconut tree and the stubs of many cigars lying around him smith sat waiting never relaxing his sharp gaze in the direction of the steamer the incongruous yachtsman had concentrated his interest upon the innocent fruiter twice had he been assured that no passengers had come to coralio on board of her and yet with a persistence not to be attributed to an idling voyager he had appealed the case to the higher court of his own eyesight surprisingly like some gay coated lizard he crouched at the foot of the coconut palm and with the beady shifting eyes of the selfsame reptile sustained his espionage on the karlesfin on the white sands a whiter gig belonging to the yacht was drawn up guarded by one of the white ducked crew not far away in a pulperia on the shore following calle grande three other sailors swaggerred with their cues around coralio s solitary billiard table the boat lay there as if under orders to be ready for use at any moment there was in the atmosphere a hint of expectation of waiting for something to occur which was foreign to the air of coralio like some passing bird of brilliant plumage smith alights on this palmy shore but to preen his wings for an instant and then to fly away upon silent pinions when morning dawned there was no smith no waiting gig no yacht in the offing smith left no intimation of his mission there no footprints to show where he had followed the trail of his mystery on the sands of coralio that night he came he spake his strange jargon of the asphalt and the cafes he sat under the coconut tree and vanished the next morning coralio smithless ate its fried plantain and said the man of pictured clothing went himself away with the siesta the incident passed yawning into history so for a time must smith pass behind the scenes of the play he comes no more to coralio nor to doctor gregg who sits in vain wagging his redundant beard waiting to enrich his derelict audience with his moving tale of trepanning and jealousy but prosperously to the lucidity of these loose pages smith shall flutter among them again in the nick of time he shall come to tell us why he strewed so many anxious cigar stumps around the coconut palm that night this he must do for when he sailed away before the dawn in his yacht rambler he carried with him the answer to a riddle so big and preposterous that few in anchuria had ventured even to propound it iv caught the plans for the detention of the flying president miraflores and his companion at the coast line seemed hardly likely to fail doctor zavalla himself had gone to the port of alazan to establish a guard at that point at solitas the liberal patriot varras could be depended upon to keep close watch goodwin held himself responsible for the district about coralio the news of the president s flight had been disclosed to no one in the coast towns save trusted members of the ambitious political party that was desirous of succeeding to power the telegraph wire running from san mateo to the coast had been cut far up on the mountain trail by an emissary of zavalla s long before this could be repaired and word received along it from the capital the fugitives would have reached the coast and the question of escape or capture been solved goodwin had stationed armed sentinels at frequent intervals along the shore for a mile in each direction from coralio they were instructed to keep a vigilant lookout during the night to prevent miraflores from attempting to embark stealthily by means of some boat or sloop found by chance at the water s edge a dozen patrols walked the streets of coralio unsuspected ready to intercept the truant official should he show himself there goodwin was very well convinced that no precautions had been overlooked he strolled about the streets that bore such high sounding names and were but narrow grass covered lanes lending his own aid to the vigil that had been intrusted to him by bob englehart the town had begun the tepid round of its nightly diversions a few leisurely dandies cald in white duck with flowing neckties and swinging slim bamboo canes threaded the grassy by ways toward the houses of their favored senoritas those who wooed the art of music dragged tirelessly at whining concertinas or fingered lugubrious guitars at doors and windows an occasional soldier from the cuartel with flapping straw hat without coat or shoes hurried by balancing his long gun like a lance in one hand from every density of the foliage the giant tree frogs sounded their loud and irritating clatter further out the guttural cries of marauding baboons and the coughing of the alligators in the black estuaries fractured the vain silence of the wood by ten o clock the streets were deserted the oil lamps that had burned a sickly yellow at random corners had been extinguished by some economical civic agent coralio lay sleeping calmly between toppling mountains and encroaching sea like a stolen babe in the arms of its abductors somewhere over in that tropical darkness perhaps already threading the profundities of the alluvial lowlands the high adventurer and his mate were moving toward land s end the game of fox in the morning should be coming soon to its close goodwin at his deliberate gait passed the long low cuartel where coralio s contingent of anchuria s military force slumbered with its bare toes pointed heavenward there was a law that no civilian might come so near the headquarters of that citadel of war after nine o clock but goodwin was always forgetting the minor statutes quien vive shrieked the sentinel wrestling prodigiously with his lengthy musket americano growled goodwin without turning his head and passed on unhalted to the right he turned and to the left up the street that ultimately reached the plaza nacional when within the toss of a cigar stump from the intersecting street of the holy sepulchre he stopped suddenly in the pathway he saw the form of a tall man clothed in black and carrying a large valise hurry down the cross street in the direction of the beach and goodwin s second glance made him aware of a woman at the man s elbow on the farther side who seemed to urge forward if not even to assist her companion in their swift but silent progress they were no coralians those two goodwin followed at increased speed but without any of the artful tactics that are so dear to the heart of the sleuth the american was too broad to feel the instinct of the detective he stood as an agent for the people of anchuria and but for political reasons he would have demanded then and there the money it was the design of his party to secure the imperilled fund to restore it to the treasury of the country and to declare itself in power without bloodshed or resistance the couple halted at the door of the hotel de los extranjeros and the man struck upon the wood with the impatience of one unused to his entry being stayed madama was long in response but after a time her light showed the door was opened and the guests housed goodwin stoodin the quiet street lighting another cigar in two minutes a faint gleam began to show between the slats of the jalousies in the upper story of the hotel they have engaged rooms said goodwin to himself so then their arrangements for sailing have yet to be made at the moment there came along one esteban delgado a barber an enemy to existing government a jovial plotter against stagnation in any form this barber was one of coralio s saddest dogs often remaining out of doors as late as eleven post meridian he was a partisan liberal and he greeted goodwin with flatulent importance as a brother in the cause but he had something important to tell what think you don frank he cried in the universal tone of the conspirator i have tonight shaved la barba what you call the weeskers of the presidente himself of this countree consider he sent for me to come in the poor casita of an old woman he awaited me in a verree leetle house in a dark place carramba el senor

him an old indian woman senor that belonged with the casa and one senorita a ladee of so much beautee ah dios all right esteban said goodwin it s very lucky that you happened along with your tonsorial information the new administration will be likely to remember you for this then in a few words he made the barber acquainted with the crisis into which the affairs of the nation had culminated and instructed him to remain outside keeping watch upon the two sides of the hotel that looked upon the street and observing whether any one should attempt to leave the house by any door or window goodwin himself went to the door through which the guests had entered opened it and stepped inside madama had returned downstairs from her journey above to see after the comfort of her lodgers her candle stood upon the bar she was about to take a thimbleful of rum as a solace for having her rest disturbed she looked up without surprise or alarm as her third caller entered ah it is the senor goodwin not often does he honor my poor house with his presence i must come oftener said goodwin with a goodwin smile i hear that your cognac is the best between belize to the north and rio to the south set out the bottle madama and let us have the proof in un vasito for each of us my aguardiente said madama with pride is the best it grows in beautiful bottles in the dark places among the banana trees si senor only at midnight can they be picked by sailor men who bring them before daylight comes to your back door good aguardiente is a verree difficult fruit to handle senor goodwin smuggling in coralio was much nearer than competition to being the life of trade one spoke of it slyly yet with a certain conceit when it had been well accomplished you have guests in the house tonight said goodwin laying a silver dollar upon the counter why not said madama counting the change two but the smallest while finished to arrive one senor not quite old and one senorita of sufficient hadsomeness to their rooms they have ascended not desiring the to eat nor the to drink two rooms numero and numero i was expecting that gentleman and that lady said goodwin i have important negocios that must be transacted will you allow me to see them why not sighed madama placidly why should not senor goodwin ascend and speak to his friends esta bueno romm numero and romm numero goodwin loosened in his coat pocket the american revolver that he carried and ascended the steep dark stairway in the hallway above the saffron light from a hanging lamp allowed him to select the gaudy numbers on the doors he turned the knob on number entered and closed the door behind him if that was isabel guilbert seated by the table in that poorly furnished room report had failed to do her charms justice she rested her head upon one hand extreme fatigue was signified in every line of her figure and upon her countenance a deep perplexity was written her eyes were gray irised and of that mold that seems to have belonged to the orbs of all the famous queens of hearts their whites were singularly clear and brilliant concealed above the irises by heavy horizontal lids and showing a snowy line between them such eyes denote great nobility vigor and if you can conceive of it a most generous selfishness she looked up when the american entered with an expression of surprised inquiry but without alarm goodwin took off his hat and seated himself with his characteristic deliberate ease upon a corner of the table he held a lighted cigar between his fingers he took this familiar course because he was sure that preliminaries would be wasted upon miss guilbert he knew her history and the small part that the conventions had played in it good evening he said now madame let us come to business at once you will observe that i mention no names but i know who is in the next room and what he carries in that valise that is the point which brings me here i have come to dictate terms of surrender the lady neither moved nor replied but steadily regarded the cigar in goodwin s hand we continued the dictator thoughtfully regarding the neat buckskin shoe on his gently swinging foot i speak for a considerable majority of the people demand the return of the stolen funds belonging to them our terms go very little further than that they are very simple as an accredited spokesman i promise that our interference will cease if they are accepted give up the money and you and your companion will be permitted to proceed wherever you will in fact assistance will be given you in the matter of securing a passage by any outgoing vessel you may choose it is on my personal responsibility that i add congratulations to the gentleman in number upon his taste in feminine charms returning his cigar to his mouth goodwin observed her and saw that her eyes followed it and rested upon it with icy and significant concentration apparently she had not heard a word he had said he understood tossed the cigar out the window and with an amused laugh slid from the table to his feet that is better said the lady it makes it possible for me to listen to you for a second lesson in good manners you might now tell me by whom i am being insulted i am sorry said goodwin leaning one hand on the table that my time is too brief for devoting much of it to a course of etiquette come now i appeal to you good sense you have shown yourself in more than one instance to be well aware of what is to your advantage this is an occasion that demands the exercise of your undoubted intelligence there is no mystery here i am frank goodwin and i have come for the money i entered this room at a venture had i entered the other i would have had it before me now do you want it in words the gentleman in number has betrayed a great trust he has robbed his people of a large sum and it is i who will prevent their losing it i do not say who that gentleman is but if i should be forced to see him and he should prove to be a certain high official of the republic it will be my duty to arrest him the house is guarded i am offering you liberal terms it is not absolutely necessary that i confer personally with the gentleman in the next room bring me the valise containing the money and we will call the affair ended the lady arose from her chair and stood for a moment thinking deeply do you live here mr goodwin she asked presently yes what is your authority for this intrusion i am an instrument of the republic i was advised by wire of the movements of the gentleman in number may i ask you two or three questions i believe you to be a man more apt to be truthful than timid what sort of town is this coralio i think they call it not much of a town said goodwin smiling a banana town as they run grass huts dobes five or six two story houses accomodations limited population half breed spanish and indian caribs and blackamoors no sidewalks to speak of no amusements rather unmoral that a an offhand sketch of course are there any inducements say in a social or in a business way for people to reside here oh yes answered goodwin smiling broadly there are no afternoon teas no hand organs no department stores and there is no extradition treaty he told me went on the lady speaking as if to herself and with a slight frown that there were towns on this coast of beauty and importance that there was a pleasing social order especially an american colony of cultured residents there is an american colony said goodwin gazing at her in some wonder some of the members are all right some are fugitives from justice from the states i recall two exiled bank presidents one army paymaster under a cloud a couple of manslayers and a widow arsenic i believe was the suspicion in her case i myself complete the colony but as yet i have not distinguished myself by any particular crime do not lose hope said the lady dryly i see nothing in your actions tonight to guarantee you further obscurity some mistake has been made i do not know just where but him you shall not disturb tonight the journey has fatigued him so that he has fallen asleep i think in his clothes you talk of stolen money i do not understand you some mistake has been made i will convince you remain where you are and i will bring you the valise that you seem to covet so and show it to you she moved toward the closed door that connected the two rooms but stopped and half turned and bestowed upon goodwin a grave searching look that ended in a quizzical smile you force my door she said and you follow your ruffianly behavior with the basest accusations and yet she hesitated as if to reconsider what she was about to say and yet it is a puzzling thing i am sure there has been some mistake she took a step toward the door but goodwin stayed her by a light touch upon her arm i have said before that women turned to look at him in the streets he was the viking sort of man big good looking and with an air of kindly truculence she was dark and proud glowing or pale as her mood moved her i do not know if eve were light or dark but if such a woman had stood in the garden i know that the apple would have been eaten this woman was to be goodwin s fate and he did not know it but he must have felt the first throes of destiny for as he faced her the knowledge of what report named her turned bitter in her throat if there has been any mistake he said hotly it was yours i do not blame the man who has lost his country his honor and is about to lose the poor consolation of his stolen riches as much as i blame you for by heaven i can very well see how he was brought to it i can understand and pity him it is such women as you that strew this degraded coast with wretched exiles that make men forget their trusts that drag the lady interrupted him with a weary gesture there is no need to continue your insults she said coldly i do not understand what you are saying nor do i know what mad blunder you are making but if the inspection of the contents of a gentleman s portmanteau will rid me of you let us delay it no longer she passed quickly and noiselessly into the other room and returned with the heavy leather valise which she handed to the american with an air of patient contempt goodwin set the valise quickly upon the table and began to unfasten the straps the lady stood by with an expression of infinite scorn and weariness upon her face the valise opened wide to a powerful sidelong wrench goodwin dragged out two or three articles of clothing exposing the bulk of its contents package after package of tightly packed united states bank and treasury notes of large denomination reckoning from the high figures written upon the paper bands that bound them the total must have come closely upon the hundred thousand mark goodwin glanced swiftly at the woman and saw with surprise and a thrill of pleasure that he wondered at that she had experienced an unmistakeable shock her eyes grew wide she gasped and leaned heavily against the table she had been ignorant then he inferred that her companion had looted the government treasury but why he angrily asked himself should he be so well pleased to think this wandering and unscrupulous singer not so black as report had painted her a noise in the other room startled them both the door swung open and a tall elderly dark complexioned man recently shaven hurried into the room all the pictures of president miraflores represent him as the possessor of a luxuriant supply of dark and carefully tended whiskers but the story of the barber esteban had prepared goodwin for the change the man stumbled in from the dark room his eyes blinking at the lamplight and heavy from sleep what does this mean he demanded in excellent english with a keen and perturbed look at the american robbery very near it answered goodwin but i rather think i m in time to prevent it i represent the people to whom this money belongs and i have come to convey it back to them he thrust his hand into a pocket of his loose linen coat the other man s hand went quickly behind him don t draw called goodwin sharply i ve got you covered from my pocket the lady stepped forward and laid one hand upon the shoulder of her hesitating companion she pointed to the table tell me the truth the truth she said in a low voice whose money is that the man did not answer he gave a deep long drawn sigh leaned and kissed her on the forehead stepped back into the other room and closed the door goodwin foresaw his purpose and jumped for the door but the report of the pistol echoed as his hand touched the knob a heavy fall followed and some one swept him aside and struggled into the room of the fallen man a desolation thought goodwin greater than that derived from the loss of cavalier and gold must have been in the heart of the enchantress to have wrung from her in that moment the cry of one turning to the all forgiving all comforting earthly consoler to have made her call out from that bloody and dishonored room oh mother mother mother but there was an alarm outside the barber esteban at the sound of the shot had raised his voice and the shot itself had aroused half the town a pattering of feet came up the street and official orders rang out on the still air goodwin had a duty to perform circumstances had made him the custodian of his adopted country s treasure swiftly cramming the money into the valise he closed it leaned far out of the window and dropped it into a thick orange tree in the little inclosure below they will tell you in coralio as they delight in telling the stranger of the conclusion of that tragic flight they will tell you how the upholders of the law came apace when the alarm was sounded the comandante in red slippers and a jacket like a head waiter s and girded sword the soldiers with their interminable guns

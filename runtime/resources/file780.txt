was here when park row was a potato patch heffelbauer was an institution he was half janitor half handy man about the office and half watchman thus becoming the peer of thirteen and one half tailors sent for he came radiating his nationality heffelbauer said the m e did you ever hear of a code belonging to the office a long time ago a private code you know what a code is don t you yah said heffelbauer sure i know vat a code is yah apout dwelf or fifteen year ago der office had a code der reborters in der city room haf it here ah said the m e we re getting on the trail now where was it kept heffelbauer what do you know about it somedimes said the retainer dey keep it in der little room behind der library room can you find it asked the m e eagerly do you know where it is mein gott said heffelbauer how long you dink a code live der reborters call him a maskeet but von day he butt mit his head der editor und oh he s talking about a goat said boyd get out heffelbauer again discomfited the concerted wit and resource of the enterprise huddled around calloway s puzzle con sidering its mysterious words in vain then vesey came in vesey was the youngest reporter he had a thirty two inch chest and wore a number fourteen collar but his bright scotch plaid suit gave him presence and con ferred no obscurity upon his whereabouts he wore his hat in such a position that people followed him about to see him take it off convinced that it must be hung upon a peg driven into the back of his head he was never without an immense knotted hard wood cane with a german silver tip on its crooked handle vesey was the best photograph hustler in the office scott said it was because no living human being could resist the per sonal triumph it was to hand his picture over to vesey vesey always wrote his own news stories except the big ones which were sent to the rewrite men add to this fact that among all the inhabitants temples and groves of the earth nothing existed that could abash vesey and his dim sketch is concluded vesey butted into the circle of cipher readers very much as heffelbauer s code would have done and asked what was up some one explained with the touch of half familiar condescension that they always used toward him vesey reached out and took the cablegram from the m e s hand under the protection of some special providence he was always doing appalling things like that and coming off unscathed it s a code said vesey anybody got the key the office has no code said boyd reaching for the message vesey held to it then old callowav expects us to read it anyhow said he he s up a tree or something and he s made this up so as to get it by the censor it s up to us gee i wish they had sell me too say we can t afford to fall down on our end of it foregone preconcerted rash witching h m vesey sat down on a table corner and began to whistle softly frowning at the cablegram let s have it please said the m e we ve got to get to work on it i believe i ve got a line on it said vesey give me ten minutes he walked to his desk threw his hat into a waste basket spread out flat on his chest like a gorgeous lizard and started his pencil going the wit and wisdom of the enterprise remained in a loose group and smiled at one another nodding their heads toward vesey then they began to exchange their theories about the cipher it took vesey exactly fifteen minutes he brought to the m e a pad with the code key written on it i felt the swing of it as soon as i saw it said vesey hurrah for old calloway he s done the japs and every paper in town that prints literature instead of news take a look at that thus had vesey set forth the reading of the code foregone conclusion preconcerted arrangement rash act witching hour of midnight goes without saying muffled report rumour hath it mine host dark horse silent majority unfortunate pedestrians richmond in the field existing conditions great white way hotly contested brute force select few mooted question parlous times beggars description ye correspondent angel unawares incontrovertible fact mr vesey afterward explained that the logical journalistic complement of the word unfortunate was once the word victim but since the automobile became so popular the correct following word is now pedestrians of course in calloway s code it meant infantry it s simply newspaper english explained vesey i ve been reporting on the enterprise long enough to know it by heart old calloway gives us the cue word and we use the word that naturally follows it just as we em in the paper read it over and you ll see how pat they drop into their places now here s the message he intended us to get vesey handed out another sheet of paper concluded arrangement to act at hour of midnight without saying report hath it that a large body of cavalry and an overwhelming force of infantry will be thrown into the field conditions white way con tested by only a small force question the times description its correspondent is unaware of the facts great stuff cried boyd excitedly kuroki crosses the yalu to night and attacks oh we won t do a thing to the sheets that make up with

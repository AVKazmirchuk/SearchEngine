from beginning to end the censor grinned and let it go through so there they were kuroki on one side of the yalu with forty two thousand infantry five thousand cavalry and one hundred and twenty four guns on the other side zassulitch waited for him with only twenty three thousand men and with a long stretch of river to guard and calloway had got hold of some important inside information that he knew would bring the enterprise staff around a cablegram as thick as flies around a park row lemonade stand if he could only get that message past the censor the new censor who had arrived and taken his post that day calloway did the obviously proper thing he lit his pipe and sat down on a gun carriage to think it over and there we must leave him for the rest of the story belongs to vesey a sixteen dollar a week reporter on the enterprise calloway s cablegram was handed to the managing editor at four o clock in the afternoon he read it three times and then drew a pocket mirror from a pigeon hole in his desk and looked at his reflection carefully then he went over to the desk of boyd his assistant he usually called boyd when he wanted him and laid the cablegram before him it s from calloway he said see what you make of it the message was dated at wi ju and these were the words of it foregone preconcerted rash witching goes muffled rumour mine dark silent unfortunate richmond existing great hotly brute select mooted parlous beggars ye angel incontrovertible boyd read it twice it s either a cipher or a sunstroke said he ever hear of anything like a code in the office a secret code asked the m e who had held his desk for only two years managing editors come and go none except the vernacular that the lady specials write in said boyd couldn t be an acrostic could it i thought of that said the m e but the beginning letters contain only four vowels it must be a code of some sort try em in groups suggested boyd let s see rash witching goes not with me it doesn t muf fled rumour mine must have an underground wire dark silent unfortunate richmond no reason why he should knock that town so hard existing great hotly no it doesn t pan out i ll call scott the city editor came in a hurry and tried his luck a city editor must know something about everything so scott knew a little about cipher writing it may be what is called an inverted alphabet cipher said he i ll try that r seems to be the oftenest used initial letter with the exception of m assuming r to mean e the most frequently used vowel we transpose the letters so scott worked rapidly with his pencil for two minutes and then showed the first word according to his reading the word scejtzez great cried boyd it s a charade my first is a russian general go on scott no that won t work said the city editor it s undoubtedly a code it s impossible to read it without the key has the office ever used a cipher code just what i was asking said the m e hustle everybody up that ought to know we must get at it some way calloway has evidently got hold of some thing big and the censor has put the screws on or he wouldn t have cabled in a lot of chop suey like this throughout the office of the enterprise a dragnet was sent hauling in such members of the staff as would be likely to know of a code past or present by reason of their wisdom information natural intelligence or length of servitude they got together in a group in the city room with the m e in the centre no one had heard of a code all began to explain to the head investi gator that newspapers never use a code anyhow that is a cipher code of course the associated press stuff is a sort of code an abbreviation rather but the m e knew all that and said so he asked each man how long he had worked on the paper not one of them had drawn pay from an enterprise envelope for longer than six years calloway had been on the paper twelve years try old heffelbauer said the m e he was here when park row was a potato patch heffelbauer was an institution he was half janitor half handy man about the office and half watchman thus becoming the peer of thirteen and one half tailors sent for he came radiating his nationality heffelbauer said the m e did you ever hear of a code belonging to the office a long time ago a private code you know what a code is don t you yah said heffelbauer sure i know vat a code is yah apout dwelf or fifteen year ago der office had a code der reborters in der city room haf it here ah said the m e we re getting on the trail now where was it kept heffelbauer what do you know about it somedimes said the retainer dey keep it in der little room behind der library room can you find it asked the m e eagerly do you know where it is mein gott said heffelbauer how long you dink a code live der reborters call him a maskeet but von day he butt mit his head der editor und oh he s talking about a goat said boyd get out heffelbauer again discomfited the concerted wit and resource of the enterprise huddled around calloway s puzzle con sidering its mysterious words in vain then vesey came in vesey was the youngest reporter he had a thirty two inch chest and wore a number fourteen collar but his bright scotch plaid suit gave him presence and con ferred no obscurity upon his whereabouts he wore his hat in such a position that people followed him about to see him take it off convinced that it must be hung upon a peg driven into the back of his head he was never without an immense knotted hard wood cane with a german silver tip on its crooked handle vesey was the best photograph hustler in the office scott said it was because no living human being could resist the per sonal triumph it was to hand his picture over to vesey vesey always wrote his own news stories except the big ones which were sent to the rewrite men add to this fact that among all the inhabitants temples and groves of the earth nothing existed that could abash vesey and his dim sketch is concluded vesey butted into the circle of cipher readers very much as heffelbauer s code would have done and asked what was up some one explained with the touch of half familiar condescension that they always used toward him vesey reached out and took the cablegram from the m e s hand under the protection of some special providence he was always doing appalling things like that and coming off unscathed it s a code said vesey anybody got the key the office has no code said boyd reaching for the message vesey held to it then old callowav expects us to read it anyhow said he he s up a tree or something and he s made this up so as to get it by the censor it s up to us gee i wish they had sell me too say we can t afford to fall down on our end of it foregone preconcerted rash witching h m vesey sat down on a table corner and began to whistle softly frowning at the cablegram let s have it please said the m e we ve got to get to work on it i believe i ve got a line on it said vesey give me ten minutes he walked to his desk threw his hat into a waste basket spread out flat on his chest like a gorgeous lizard and started his pencil going the wit and wisdom of the enterprise remained in a loose group and smiled at one another nodding their heads toward vesey then they began to exchange their theories about the cipher it took vesey exactly fifteen minutes he brought to the m e a pad with the code key written on it i felt the swing of it as soon as i saw it said vesey hurrah for old calloway he s done the japs and every paper in town that prints literature instead of news take a look at that thus had vesey set forth the reading of the code foregone conclusion preconcerted arrangement rash act witching hour of midnight goes without saying muffled report rumour hath it mine host dark horse silent majority unfortunate pedestrians richmond in the field existing conditions great white way hotly contested brute force select few mooted question parlous times beggars description ye correspondent angel unawares incontrovertible fact mr vesey afterward explained that the logical journalistic complement of the word unfortunate was once the word victim but since the automobile became so popular the correct following word is now pedestrians of course in calloway s code it meant infantry it s simply newspaper english explained vesey i ve been reporting on the enterprise long enough to know it by heart old calloway gives us the cue word and we use the word that naturally follows it just as we em in the paper read it over and you ll see how pat they drop into their places now here s the message he intended us to get vesey handed out another sheet of paper concluded arrangement to act at hour of midnight without saying report hath it that a large body of cavalry and an overwhelming force of infantry will be thrown into the field conditions white way con tested by only a small force question the times description its correspondent is unaware of the facts great stuff cried boyd excitedly kuroki crosses the yalu to night and attacks oh we won t do a thing to the sheets that make up with addison s essays real estate transfers and bowling scores mr vesey said the m e with his jollying which you should regard as a favour manner you have cast a serious reflection upon the literary standards of the paper that employs you you have also assisted materially in giving us the biggest beat of the year i will let you know in a day or two whether you are to be discharged or retained at a larger salary somebody send ames to me ames was the king pin the snowy petalled marguerite the star bright looloo of the rewrite men he saw attempted murder in the pains of green apple colic cyclones in the summer zephyr lost children in every top spinning urchin an uprising of the down trodden masses in every hurling of a derelict potato at a passing automobile when not rewriting ames sat on the porch of his brooklyn villa playing checkers with his ten year old son ames and the war editor shut themselves in a room there was a map in there stuck full of little pins that represented armies and divisions their fingers had been itching for days to move those pins along the crooked line of the yalu they did so now and in words of fire ames translated calloway s brief message into a front page masterpiece that set the world talking he told of the secret councils of the japanese officers gave kuroki s flaming speeches in full counted the cavalry and infantry to a man and a horse described the quick and silent building of the bridge at stuikauchen across which the mikado s legions were hurled upon the surprised zassulitch whose troops were widely scattered along the river and the battle well you know what ames can do with a battle if you give him just one smell of smoke for a foundation and in the same story with seemingly supernatural knowledge he gleefully scored the most profound and ponderous paper in england for the false and misleading account of the intended movements of the japanese first army printed in its issue of the same date only one error was made and that was the fault of the cable operator at wi ju calloway pointed it out after he came back the word great in his code should have been gage and its complemental words of battle but it went to ames conditions white and of course he took that to mean snow his description of the japanese army strum struggling through the snowstorm blinded by the whirling flakes was thrillingly vivid the artists turned out some effective illustrations that made a hit as pictures of the artillery dragging their guns through the drifts but as the attack was made on the first day of may conditions white excited some amusement but it in made no difference to the enterprise anyway it was wonderful and calloway was wonderful in having made the new censor believe that his jargon of words meant no more than a complaint of the dearth of news and a petition for more expense money and vesey was wonderful and most wonderful of all are words and how they make friends one with another being oft associated until not even obituary notices them do part on the second day following the city editor halted at vesey s desk where the reporter was writing the story of a man who had broken his leg by falling into a coal hole ames having failed to find a murder motive in it the old man says your salary is to be raised to twenty a week said scott all right said vesey every little helps say mr scott which would you say we can state without fear of successful contradiction or on the whole it can be safely asserted a matter of mean elevation one winter the alcazar opera company of new orleans made a speculative trip along the mexican central american and south american coasts the venture proved a most successful one the music loving impressionable spanish americans deluged the company with dollars and vivas the manager waxed plump and amiable but for the prohibitive climate he would have put forth the distinctive flower of his prosperity the overcoat of fur braided frogged and opulent almost was he persuaded to raise the salaries of his company but with a mighty effort he conquered the impulse toward such an unprofitable effervescence of joy at macuto on the coast of venezuela the company scored its greatest success imagine coney island translated into spanish and you will comprehend macuto the fashionable season is from november to march down from la guayra and caracas and valencia and other interior towns flock the people for their holiday sea son there are bathing and fiestas and bull fights and scandal and then the people have a passion for music that the bands in the plaza and on the sea beach stir but do not satisfy the coming of the alcazar opera com pany aroused the utmost ardour and zeal among the pleasure seekers the illustrious guzman blanco president and dic tator of venezuela sojourned in macuto with his court for the season that potent ruler who himself paid a subsidy of pesos each year to grand opera in caracas ordered one of the government warehouses to be cleared for a temporary theatre a stage was quickly constructed and rough wooden benches made for the audience private boxes were added for the use of the president and the notables of the army and government the company remained in macuto for two weeks each performance filled the house as closely as it could be packed then the music mad people fought for room in the open doors and windows and crowded about hundreds deep on the outside those audiences formed a brilliantly diversified patch of colour the hue of their faces ranged from the clear olive of the pure blood span iards down through the yellow and brown shades of the mestizos to the coal black carib and the jamaica negro scattered among them were little groups of indians with faces like stone idols wrapped in gaudy fibre woven blankets indians down from the mountain states of zamora and los andes and miranda to trade their gold dust in the coast towns the spell cast upon these denizens of the interior fastnesses was remarkable they sat in petrified ecstasy conspicuous among the excitable macutians who wildly strove with tongue and hand to give evidence of their delight only once did the sombre rapture of these aboriginals find expression during the rendition of faust guzman blanco extravagantly pleased by the jewel song cast upon the stage a purse of gold pieces other distinguished citizens followed his lead to the extent of whatever loose coin they had convenient while some of the fair and fashionable se oras were moved in imita tion to fling a jewel or a ring or two at the feet of the marguerite who was according to the bills mlle nina giraud then from different parts of the house rose sundry of the stolid hillmen and cast upon the stage little brown and dun bags that fell with soft thumps and did not rebound it was no doubt pleasure at the tribute to her art that caused mlle giraud s eyes to shine so brightly when she opened these little deerskin bags in her dressing room and found them to contain pure gold dust if so the pleasure was rightly hers for her voice in song pure strong and thrilling with the feeling of the emotional artist deserved the tribute that it earned but the triumph of the alcazar opera company is not the theme it but leans upon and colours it there happened in macuto a tragic thing an unsolvable mystery that sobered for a time the gaiety of the happy season one evening between the short twilight and the time when she should have whirled upon the stage in the red and black of the ardent carmen mlle nina giraud dis appeared from the sight and ken of pairs of eyes and as many minds in macuto there was the usual turmoil and hurrying to seek her messengers flew to the little french kept hotel where she stayed others of the company hastened here or there where she might be lingering in some tienda or unduly prolonging her bath upon the beach all search was fruitless mademoi selle had vanished half an hour passed and she did not appear the dictator unused to the caprices of prime donne became impatient he sent an aide from his box to say to the manager that if the curtain did not at once rise he would immediately hale the entire company to the calabosa though it would desolate his heart indeed to be com pelled to such an act birds in macuto could be made to sing the manager abandoned hope for the time of mlle giraud a member of the chorus who had dreamed hopelessly for years of the blessed opportunity quickly carmenized herself and the opera went on afterward when the lost cantatrice appeared not the aid of the authorities was invoked the president at once set the army the police and all citizens to the search not one clue to mlle giraud s disappearance was found the alcazar left to fill engagements farther down the coast on the way back the steamer stopped at macuto and the manager made anxious inquiry not a trace of the lady had been discovered the alcazar could do no more the personal belongings of the missing lady were stored in the hotel against her possible later reappearance and the opera company continued upon its homeward voyage to new orleans on the camino real along the beach the two saddle mules and the four pack mules of don se or johnny armstrong stood patiently awaiting the crack of the whip of the arriero luis that would be the signal for the start on another long journey into the mountains the pack mules were loaded with a varied assortment of hard ware and cutlery these articles don johnny traded to the interior indians for the gold dust that they washed from the andean streams and stored in quills and bags against his coming it was a profitable business and se or armstrong expected soon to be able to purchase the coffee plantation that he coveted armstrong stood on the narrow sidewalk exchanging garbled spanish with old peralto the rich native merchant who had just charged him four prices for half a gross of pot metal hatchets and abridged english with rucker the little german who was consul for the united states take with you se or said peralto the blessings of the saints upon your journey better try quinine growled rucker through his pipe take two grains every night and don t make your trip too long johnny because we haf needs of you it is ein villainous game dot melville play of whist and dere is no oder substitute auf wiedersehen und keep your eyes dot mule s ears between when you on der edge of der brecipices ride the bells of luis s mule jingled and the pack train filed after the warning note armstrong waved a good bye and took his place at the tail of the procession up the narrow street they turned and passed the two story wooden hotel ingles where ives and dawson and rich ards and the rest of the chaps were dawdling on the broad piazza reading week old newspapers they crowded to the railing and shouted many friendly and wise and foolish farewells after him across the plaza they trotted slowly past the bronze statue of guzman blanco within its fence of bayoneted rifles captured from revolutionists and out of the town between the rows of thatched huts swarming with the unclothed youth of macuto they plunged into the damp coolness of banana groves at length to emerge upon a bright stream where brown women in scant raiment laundered clothes destructively upon the rocks then the pack train fording the stream attacked the sudden ascent and bade adieu to such civilization as the coast afforded for weeks armstrong guided by luis followed his regular route among the mountains after he had col lected an arroba of the precious metal winning a profit of nearly the heads of the lightened mules were turned down trail again where the head of the guarico river springs from a great gash in the mountain side luis halted the train half a day s journey from here se or said he is the village of tacuzama which we have never visited i think many ounces of gold may be procured there it is worth the trial armstrong concurred and they turned again upward toward tacuzama the trail was abrupt and precipi tous mounting through a dense forest as night fell dark and gloomy luis once more halted before them was a black chasm bisecting the path as far as they could see luis dismounted there should be a bridge he called and ran along the cleft a distance it is here he cried and remounting led the way in a few moments armstrong heard a sound as though a thunderous drum were beating somewhere in the dark it was the falling of the mules hoofs upon the bridge made of strong hides lashed to poles and stretched across the chasm half a mile further was tacuzama the village was a congre gation of rock and mud huts set in the profundity of an obscure wood as they rode in a sound inconsistent with that brooding solitude met their ears from a long low mud hut that they were nearing rose the glorious voice of a woman in song the words were english the air familiar to armstrong s memory but not to his musical knowledge he slipped from his mule and stole to a narrow window in one end of the house peering cautiously inside he saw within three feet of him a woman of marvellous imposing beauty clothed in a splendid loose robe of leopard skins the hut was packed close to the small space in which she stood with the squatting figures of indians the woman finished her song and seated herself close to the little window as if grateful for the unpolluted air that entered it when she had ceased several of the audience rose and cast little softly falling bags at her feet a harsh murmur no doubt a barbarous kind of applause and comment went through the grim assembly armstrong was used to seizing opportunities promptly taking advantage of the noise he called to the woman in a low but distinct voice do not turn your head this way but listen i am an american if you need assistance tell me how i can render it answer as briefly as you can the woman was worthy of his boldness only by a sudden flush of her pale cheek did she acknowledge understanding of his words then she spoke scarcely moving her lips i am held a prisoner by these indians god knows i need help in two hours come to the little hut twenty yards toward the mountainside there will be a light and a red curtain in the window there is always a guard at the door whom you will have to overcome for the love of heaven do not fail to come the story seems to shrink from adventure and rescue and mystery the theme is one too gentle for those brave and quickening tones and yet it reaches as far back as time itself it has been named environment which is as weak a word as any to express the unnameable kinship of man to nature that queer fraternity that causes stones and trees and salt water and clouds to play upon our emotions why are we made serious and solemn and sublime by mountain heights grave and contempla tive by an abundance of overhanging trees reduced to inconstancy and monkey capers by the ripples on a sandy beach did the protoplasm but enough the chem ists are looking into the matter and before long they will have all life in the table of the symbols briefly then in order to confine the story within scientific bounds john armstrong went to the hut choked the indian guard and carried away mlle giraud with her was also conveyed a number of pounds of gold dust she had collected during her six months forced engage ment in tacuzama the carabobo indians are easily the most enthusiastic lovers of music between the equator and the french opera house in new orleans they are also strong believers that the advice of emerson was good when he said the thing thou wantest discon tented man take it and pay the price a number of them had attended the performance of the alcazar opera company in macuto and found mlle giraud s style and technique satisfactory they wanted her so they took her one evening suddenly and without any fuss they treated her with much consideration exacting only one song recital each day she was quite pleased at being rescued by mr armstrong so much for mystery and adventure now to resume the theory of the proto plasm john armstrong and mlle giraud rode among the andean peaks enveloped in their greatness and sublimity the mightiest cousins furthest removed in nature s great family become conscious of the tie among those huge piles of primordial upheaval amid those gigantic silences and elongated fields of distance the littlenesses of men are precipitated as one chemical throws down a sediment from another they moved reverently as in a temple their souls were uplifted in unison with the stately heights they travelled in a zone of majesty and peace to armstrong the woman seemed almost a holy thing yet bathed in the white still dignity of her martyrdom that purified her earthly beauty and gave out it seemed an aura of transcendent loveliness in those first hours of companionship she drew from him an adoration that was half human love half the worship of a descended goddess never yet since her rescue had she smiled over her dress she still wore the robe of leopard skins for mountain air was cold she looked to be some splendid princess belonging to those wild and awesome altitudes the spirit of the region chimed with hers her eyes were always turned upon the sombre cliffs the blue gorges and the snow clad turrets looking a sublime melancholy equal to their own at times on the journey she sang thrilling te deums and misereres that struck the true note of the hills and made their route seem like a solemn march down a cathedral aisle the rescued one spoke but seldom her mood partaking of the hush of nature that surrounded them armstrong looked upon her as an angel he could not bring himself to the sacrilege of attempting to woo her as other women may be wooed on the third day they had descended as far as the tierra templada the zona of the table lands and foot hills the mountains were receding in their rear but still towered exhibiting yet impressively their formidable heads here they met signs of man they saw the white houses of coffee plantations gleam across the clear ings they struck into a road where they met travellers and pack mules cattle were grazing on the slopes they passed a little village where the round eyed ni os shrieked and called at sight of them mlle giraud laid aside her leopard skin robe it seemed to be a trifle incongruous now in the moun tains it had appeared fitting and natural and if arm strong was not mistaken she laid aside with it something of the high dignity of her demeanour as the country became more populous and significant of comfortable life he saw with a feeling of joy that the exalted princess and priestess of the andean peaks was changing to a woman an earth woman but no less enticing a little colour crept to the surface of her marble cheek she arranged the conventional dress that the removal of the robe now disclosed with the solicitous touch of one who is conscious of the eyes of others she smoothed the careless sweep of her hair a mundane interest long latent in the chilling atmosphere of the ascetic peaks showed in her eyes this thaw in his divinity sent armstrong s heart going faster so might an arctic explorer thrill at his first ken of green fields and liquescent waters they were on a lower plane of earth and life and were succumbing to its peculiar subtle influence the austerity of the hills no longer thinned the air they breathed about them was the breath of fruit and corn and builded homes the comfortable smell of smoke and warm earth and the consolations man has placed between himself and the dust of his brother earth from which he sprung while traversing those awful mountains mile giraud had seemed to be wrapped in their spirit of reverent reserve was this that same woman now palpitating warm eager throbbing with conscious life and charm feminine to her finger tips pondering over this armstrong felt certain misgivings intrude upon his thoughts he wished he could stop there with this changing creature descending no farther here was the elevation and environment to which her nature seemed to respond with its best he feared to go down upon the man dominated levels would her spirit not yield still further in that artificial zone to which they were descending now from a little plateau they saw the sea flash at the edge of the green lowlands mile giraud gave a little catching sigh oh look mr armstrong there is the sea isn t it lovely i m so tired of mountains she heaved a pretty shoulder in a gesture of repugnance those horrid indians just think of what i suffered although i suppose i attained my ambition of becoming a stellar attraction i wouldn t care to repeat the engagement it was very nice of you to bring me away tell me mr armstrong honestly now do i look such an awful awful fright i haven t looked into a mirror you know for months armstrong made answer according to his changed moods also he laid his hand upon hers as it rested upon the horn of her saddle luis was at the head of the pack train and could not see she allowed it to remain there and her eyes smiled frankly into his then at sundown they dropped upon the coast level under the palms and lemons among the vivid greens and searlets and ochres of the tierra caliente they rode into macuto and saw the line of volatile bathers frolick ing in the surf the mountains were very far away mlle giraud s eyes were shining with a joy that could not have existed under the chaperonage of the mountain tops there were other spirits calling to her nymphs of the orange groves pixies from the chattering surf imps born of the music the perfumes colours and the insinuating presence of humanity she laughed aloud musically at a sudden thought won t there be a sensation she called to armstrong don t i wish i had an engagement just now though what a picnic the press agent would have held a prisoner by a band of savage indians subdued by the spell of her wonderful voice wouldn t that make great stuff but i guess i quit the game winner anyhow there ought to be a couple of thousand dollars in that sack of gold dust i collected as encores don t you think he left her at the door of the little hotel de buen descansar where she had stopped before two hours later he returned to the hotel he glanced in at the open door of the little combined reception room and cafe half a dozen of macuto s representative social and official caballeros were distributed about the room sefior villablanca the wealthy rubber concessionist reposed his fat figure on two chairs with an emollient smile beaming upon his chocolate coloured face guil bert the french mining engineer leered through his polished nose glasses colonel mendez of the regular army in gold laced uniform and fatuous grin was busily extracting corks from champagne bottles other pat terns of macutian gallantry and fashion pranced and posed the air was hazy with cigarette smoke wine dripped upon the floor perched upon a table in the centre of the room in an attitude of easy preeminence was mlle giraud a chic costume of white lawn and cherry ribbons supplanted her travelling garb there was a suggestion of lace and a frill or two with a discreet small implication of hand embroidered pink hosiery upon her lap rested a guitar in her face was the light of resurrection the peace of elysium attained through fire and suffering she was singing to a lively accompaniment a little song when you see de big round moon comin up like a balloon dis nigger skips fur to kiss de lips ob his stylish black faced coon the singer caught sight of armstrong hi there johnny she called i ve been expecting you for an hour what kept you gee but these smoked guys are the slowest you ever saw they ain t on at all come along in and i ll make this coffee coloured old sport with the gold epaulettes open one for you right off the ice thank you said armstrong not just now i believe i ve several things to attend to he walked out and down the street and met rucker coming up from the consulate play you a game of billiards said armstrong i want something to take the taste of the sea level out of my mouth girl in gilt letters on the ground glass of the door of room no were the words robbins hartley brokers the clerks had gone it was past five and with the solid tramp of a drove of prize percherons scrub women were invading the cloud capped twenty story office building a puff of red hot air flavoured with lemon peelings soft coal smoke and train oil came in through the half open windows robbins fifty something of an overweight beau and addicted to first nights and hotel palm rooms pretended to be envious of his partner s commuter s joys going to be something doing in the humidity line to night he said you out of town chaps will be the people with your katydids and moonlight and long drinks and things out on the front porch hartley twenty nine serious thin good looking ner vous sighed and frowned a little yes said he we always have cool nights in floral hurst especially in the winter a man with an air of mystery came in the door and went up to hartley i ve found where she lives he announced in the portentous half whisper that makes the detective at work a marked being to his fellow men hartley scowled him into a state of dramatic silence and quietude but by that time robbins had got his cane and set his tie pin to his liking and with a debonair nod went out to his metropolitan amusements here is the address said the detective in a natural tone being deprived of an audience to foil hartley took the leaf torn out of the sleuth s dingy memorandum book on it were pencilled the words vivienne arlington no east th street care of mrs mccomus moved there a week ago said the detective now if you want any shadowing done mr hartley i can do you as fine a job in that line as anybody in the city it will be only a day and expenses can send in a daily typewritten report covering you needn t go on interrupted the broker it isn t a case of that kind i merely wanted the address how much shall i pay you one day s work said the sleuth a tenner will cover it hartley paid the man and dismissed him then he left the office and boarded a broadway car at the first large crosstown artery of travel he took an eastbound car that deposited him in a decaying avenue whose ancient structures once sheltered the pride and glory of the town walking a few squares he came to the building that he sought it was a new flathouse bearing carved upon its cheap stone portal its sonorous name the vallambrosa fire escapes zigzagged down its front these laden with household goods drying clothes and squalling children evicted by the midsummer heat here and there a pale rubber plant peeped from the miscellaneous mass as if wondering to what kingdom it belonged vegetable animal or artificial hartley pressed the mccomus button the door latch clicked spasmodically now hospitably now doubt fully as though in anxiety whether it might be admitting friends or duns hartley entered and began to climb the stairs after the manner of those who seek their friends in city flat houses which is the manner of a boy who climbs an apple tree stopping when he comes upon what he wants on the fourth floor he saw vivienne standing in an open door she invited him inside with a nod and a bright genuine smile she placed a chair for him near a window and poised herself gracefully upon the edge of one of those jekyll and hyde pieces of furniture that are masked and mysteriously hooded unguessable bulks by day and inquisitorial racks of torture by night hartley cast a quick critical appreciative glance at her before speaking and told himself that his taste in choosing had been flawless vivienne was about twenty one she was of the purest saxon type her hair was a ruddy golden each filament of the neatly gathered mass shining with its own lustre and delicate graduation of colour in perfect harmony were her ivory clear complexion and deep sea blue eyes that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness and yet with all her north ern clearness and frankness of line and colouring there seemed to be something of the tropics in her something of languor in the droop of her pose of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing something that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beauti ful milk white dove among its sober hued companions she was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt that discreet masquerade of goose girl and duchess vivienne said hartley looking at her pleadingly you did not answer my last letter it was only by nearly a week s search that i found where you had moved to why have you kept me in suspense when you knew how anxiously i was waiting to see you and hear from you the girl looked out the window dreamily mr hartley she said hesitatingly i hardly know what to say to you i realize all the advantages of your offer and sometimes i feel sure that i could be contented with you but again i am doubtful i was born a city girl and i am afraid to bind myself to a quiet sub urban life my dear girl said hartley ardently have i not told you that you shall have everything that your heart can desire that is in my power to give you you shall come to the city for the theatres for shopping and to visit your friends as often as you care to you can trust me can you not to the fullest she said turning her frank eyes upon him with a smile i know you are the kindest of men and that the girl you get will be a lucky one i learned all about you when i was at the montgomerys ah exclaimed hartley with a tender reminiscent light in his eye i remember well the evening i first saw you at the montgomerys mrs montgomery was sound ing your praises to me all the evening and she hardly did you justice i shall never forget that supper come vivienne promise me i want you you ll never regret coming with me no one else will ever give you as pleasant a home the girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands a sudden jealous suspicion seized hartley tell me vivienne he asked regarding her keenly is there another is there some one else a rosy flush crept slowly over her fair cheeks and neck you shouldn t ask that mr hartley she said in some confusion but i will tell you there is one other but he has no right i have promised him nothing his name demanded hartley sternly townsend rafford townsend exclaimed hartley with a grim tightening of his jaw how did that man come to know you after all i ve done for him his auto has just stopped below said vivienne bending over the window sill he s coming for his answer oh i don t know what to do the bell in the flat kitchen whirred vivienne hurried to press the latch button stay here said hartley i will meet him in the hall townsend looking like a spanish grandee in his light tweeds panama hat and curling black mustache came up the stairs three at a time he stopped at sight of hartley and looked foolish go back said hartley firmly pointing downstairs with his forefinger hullo said townsend feigning surprise what s up what are you doing here old man go back repeated hartley inflexibly the law of the jungle do you want the pack to tear you in pieces the kill is mine i came here to see a plumber about the bathroom connections said townsend bravely all right said hartley you shall have that lying plaster to stick upon your traitorous soul but go back townsend went downstairs leaving a bitter word to be wafted up the draught of the staircase hartley went back to his wooing vivienne said he masterfully i have got to have you i will take no more refusals or dilly dallying when do you want me she asked now as soon as you can get ready she stood calmly before him and looked him in the eye do you think for one moment she said that i would enter your home while h loise is there hartley cringed as if from an unexpected blow he folded his arms and paced the carpet once or twice she shall go he declared grimly drops stood upon his brow why should i let that woman make my life miserable never have i seen one day of freedom from trouble since i have known her you are right vivienne h loise must be sent away before i can take you home but she shall go i have decided i will turn her from my doors when will you do this asked the girl hartley clinched his teeth and bent his brows together to night he said resolutely i will send her away to night then said vivienne my answer is yes come for me when you will she looked into his eyes with a sweet sincere light in her own hartley could scarcely believe that her sur render was true it was so swift and complete promise me he said feelingly on your word and honour on my word and honour repeated vivienne softly at the door he turned and gazed at her happily but yet as one who scarcely trusts the foundations of his joy to morrow he said with a forefinger of reminder uplifted to morrow she repeated with a smile of truth and candour in an hour and forty minutes hartley stepped off the train at floralhurst a brisk walk of ten minutes brought him to the gate of a handsome two story cottage set upon a wide and well tended lawn halfway to the house he was met by a woman with jet black braided hair and flowing white summer gown who half strangled him without apparent cause when they stepped into the hall she said mamma s here the auto is coming for her in half an hour she came to dinner but there s no dinner i ve something to tell you said hartley i thought to break it to you gently but since your mother is here we may as well out with it he stooped and whispered something at her ear his wife screamed her mother came running into the hall the dark haired woman screamed again the joyful scream of a well beloved and petted woman oh mamma she cried ecstatically what do you think vivienne is coming to cook for us she is the one that stayed with the montgomerys a whole year and now billy dear she concluded you must go right down into the kitchen and discharge h loise she has been drunk again the whole day long sociology in serge and straw the season of irresponsibility is at hand come let us twine round our brows wreaths of poison ivy that is for idiocy and wander hand in hand with sociology in the summer fields likely as not the world is flat the wise men have tried to prove that it is round with indifferent success they pointed out to us a ship going to sea and bade us observe that at length the convexity of the earth hid from our view all but the vessel s topmast but we picked up a telescope and looked and saw the decks and hull again then the wise men said oh pshaw anyhow the variation of the intersection of the equator and the ecliptic proves it we could not see this through our telescope so we remained silent but it stands to reason that if the world were round the queues of china men would stand straight up from their heads instead of hanging down their backs as travellers assure us they do another hot weather corroboration of the flat theory is the fact that all of life as we know it moves in little unavailing circles more justly than to anything else it can be likened to the game of baseball crack we hit the ball and away we go if we earn a run in life we call it success we get back to the home plate and sit upon a bench if we are thrown out we walk back to the home plate and sit upon a bench the circumnavigators of the alleged globe may have sailed the rim of a watery circle back to the same port again the truly great return at the high tide of their attainments to the simplicity of a child the billionaire sits down at his mahogany to his bowl of bread and milk when you reach the end of your career just take down the sign goal and look at the other side of it you will find beginning point there it has been reversed while you were going around the track but this is humour and must be stopped let us get back to the serious questions that arise whenever sociology turns summer boarder you are invited to consider the scene of the story wild atlantic waves thundering against a wooded and rock bound shore in the greater city of new york the town of fishampton on the south shore of long island is noted for its clam fritters and the summer residence of the van plushvelts the van plushvelts have a hundred million dollars and their name is a household word with tradesmen and photographers on the fifteenth of june the van plushvelts boarded up the front door of their city house carefully deposited their cat on the sidewalk instructed the caretaker not to allow it to eat any of the ivy on the walls and whizzed away in a horse power to fishampton to stray alone the shade amaryllis not being in their class if a subscriber to the toadies magazine you have often you say you are not well you buy it at a news stand thinking that the newsdealer is not wise to you but he knows about it all he knows he knows i say that you have often seen in the toadies magazine pictures of the van plushvelts summer home so it will not be described here our business is with young haywood van plushvelt sixteen years old heir to the century of millions darling of the financial gods and great grandson of peter van plushvelt former owner of a particularly fine cabbage patch that has been ruined by an intrusive lot of downtown skyscrapers one afternoon young haywood van plushvelt strolled out between the granite gate posts of dolce far niente that s what they called the place and it was an improve ment on dolce far rockaway i can tell you haywood walked down into the village he was human after all and his prospective millions weighed upon him wealth had wreaked upon him its direfullest he was the product of private tutors even under his first hobby horse had tan bark been strewn he had been born with a gold spoon lobster fork and fish set in his mouth for which i hope later to submit justification i must ask your consideration of his haberdashery and tailoring young fortunatus was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge a neat white straw hat neat low cut tan shoes of the well known immaculate trade mark a neat narrow four in hand tie and carried a slender neat bamboo cane down persimmon street there s never tree north of hagerstown md came from the village smoky dodson fifteen and a half worst boy in fishampton smoky was dressed in a ragged red sweater wrecked and weather worn golf cap run over shoes and trousers of the serviceable brand dust clinging to the mois ture induced by free exercise darkened wide areas of his face smoky carried a baseball bat and a league ball that advertised itself in the rotundity of his trousers pocket haywood stopped and passed the time of day going to play ball he asked smoky s eyes and countenance confronted him with a frank blue and freckled scrutiny me he said with deadly mildness sure not can t you see i ve got a divin suit on i m goin up in a submarine balloon to catch butterflies with a two inch auger excuse me said haywood with the insulting polite ness of his caste for mistaking you for a gentleman i might have known better how might you have known better if you thought i was one said smoky unconsciously a logician by your appearances said haywood no gentle man is dirty ragged and a liar smoky hooted once like a ferry boat spat on his hand got a firm grip on his baseball bat and then dropped it against the fence say said he i knows you you re the pup that belongs in that swell private summer sanitarium for city guys over there i seen you come out of the gate you can t bluff nobody because you re rich and because you got on swell clothes arabella yah ragamuffin said hay wood smoky picked up a fence rail splinter and laid it on his shoulder dare you to knock it off he challenged i wouldn t soil my hands with you said the aristocrat fraid said smoky concisely youse city ducks ain t got the i sand i kin lick you with one hand i don t wish to have any trouble with you said haywood i asked you a civil question and you replied like a like a a cad wot s a cad asked smoky a cad is a disagreeable person answered haywood who lacks manners and doesn t know his place they sometimes play baseball i can tell you what a mollycoddle is said smoky it s a monkey dressed up by its mother and sent out too pick daisies on the lawn when you have the honour to refer to the members of my family said haywood with some dim ideas of a code in his mind you d better leave the ladies out of your remarks ho ladies mocked the rude one i say ladies i know what them rich women in the city does they drink cocktails and swear and give parties to gorillas the papers says so then haywood knew that it must be he took off his coat folded it neatly and laid it on the roadside grass placed his hat upon it and began to unknot his blue silk tie hadn t yer better ring fer yer maid arabella taunted smoky wot yer going to do go to bed i m going to give you a good trouncing said the hero he did not hesitate although the enemy was far beneath him socially he remembered that his father once thrashed a cabman and the papers gave it two col umns first page and the toadies magazine had a special article on upper cuts by the upper classes and ran new pictures of the van plushvelt country seat at fishampton wot s trouncing asked smoky suspiciously i don t want your old clothes i m no oh you mean to scrap my my i won t do a thing to mamma s pet criminy i d hate to be a hand laundered thing like you smoky waited with some awkwardness for his adversary to prepare for battle his own decks were always clear for action when he should spit upon the palm of his terrible right it was equivalent to you may fire now gridley the hated patrician advanced with his shirt sleeves neatly rolled up smoky waited in an attitude of ease expecting the affair to be conducted according to fishampton s rules of war these allowed combat to be prefaced by stigma recrimination epithet abuse and insult gradually increasing in emphasis and degree after a round of these you re anothers would come the chip knocked from the shoulder or the advance across the dare line drawn with a toe on the ground next light taps given and taken these also increasing in force until finally the blood was up and fists going at their best but haywood did not know fishampton s rules noblesse oblige kept a faint smile on his face as he walked slowly up to smoky and said going to play ball smoky quickly understood this to be a putting of the previous question giving him the chance to make practical apology by answering it with civility and relevance listen this time said he i m goin skatin on the river don t you see me automobile with chinese lanterns on it standin and waitin for me haywood knocked him down smoky felt wronged to thus deprive him of preliminary wrangle and objurgation was to send an armoured knight full tilt against a crashing lance without permitting him first to caracole around the list to the flourish of trumpets but he scrambled up and fell upon his foe head feet and fists the fight lasted one round of an hour and ten minutes it was lengthened until it was more like a war or a family feud than a fight haywood had learned some of the science of boxing and wrestling from his tutors but these he discarded for the more instinctive methods of battle handed down by the cave dwelling van plushvelts so when he found himself during the m l e seated upon the kicking and roaring smoky s chest he improved the opportunity by vigorously kneading hand fuls of sand and soil into his adversary s ears eyes and mouth and when smoky got the proper leg hold and turned him he fastened both hands in the plushvelt hair and pounded the plushvelt head against the lap of mother earth of course the strife was not incessantly active there were seasons when one sat upon the other holding him down while each blew like a grampus spat out the more inconveniently large sections of gravel and and strove to subdue the spirit of his opponent with a frightful and soul paralyzing glare at last it seemed that in the language of the ring their efforts lacked steam they broke away and each disappeared in a cloud as he brushed away the dust of the conflict as soon as his breath permitted haywood walked close to smoky and said going to play ball smoky looked pensively at the sky at his bat lying on the ground and at the leaguer rounding his pocket sure

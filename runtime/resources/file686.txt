is often either a scarcely habit able tiny room or a domicile filled to overflowing with kith and kin the street corner is her parlor the park is her drawing room the avenue is her garden walk yet for the most part she is as inviolate mis tress of herself in them as is my lady inside her tapestried chamber one evening at dusk two weeks after their first meeting carter and masie strolled arm in arm into a little dimly lit park they found a bench tree shadowed and secluded and sat there for the first time his arm stole gently around her her golden bronze head slid restfully against his shoulder

lightness was its safest armor she looked up at him with eyes that saw and a warm glow visited her cool cheeks tremblingly awfully her moth wings closed and she seemed about to settle upon the flower of love some faint glimmer of life and its possibilities on the other side of her glove counter dawned upon her carter felt the change and crowded the opportunity marry me masie be whispered softly

know her varying thistle down moods and that it was useless to combat them but he felt a certain happy triumph he had held for a moment though but by a silken thread the soul of his wild psyche and hope was stronger within him once she had folded her wings and her cool band bad closed about his own at the biggest store the next day masie s chum lulu waylaid her in an angle of the counter how are

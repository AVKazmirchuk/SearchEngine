give way to some other whim just as at a dinner party this week on madison avenue a green kid glove was laid by the plate of each guest to be put on and used while eating olives i see admitted the young man humbly these special diversions of the inner circle do not become familiar to the common public sometimes continued the girl acknowledging his confession of error by a slight bow i have thought that if i ever should love a man it would be one of lowly station one who is a worker and not a drone but doubtless the claims of caste and wealth will prove stronger than my inclination just now i am besieged by two one is a grand duke of a german principality i think he has or has bad a wife somewhere driven mad by his intemperance and cruelty the other is an english marquis so cold and mercenary that i even prefer the diabolism of the duke what is it that impels me to tell you these things mr packenstacker parkenstacker breathed the young man in deed you cannot know how much i appreciate your confidences the girl contemplated him with the calm imper sonal regard that befitted the difference in their sta tions what is your line of business mr parken stacker she asked a very humble one but i hope to rise in the world were you really in earnest when you said that you could love a man of lowly position indeed i was but i said might there is the grand duke and the marquis you know yes no calling could be too humble were the man what i would wish him to be i work declared mr parkenstacker in a res taurant the girl shrank slightly not as a waiter she said a little imploringly labor is noble but personal attendance you know valets and i am not a waiter i am cashier in on the street they faced that bounded the opposite side of the park was the brilliant electric sign restau rant i am cashier in that restaurant you am there the girl consulted a tiny watch set in a bracelet of rich design upon her left wrist and rose hurriedly she thrust her book into a glittering reticule sus pended from her waist for which however the book was too large why are you not at work she asked i am on the night turn said the young man it is yet an hour before my period begins may i not hope to see you again i do not know perhaps but the whim may not seize me again i must go quickly now there is a dinner and a box at the play and oh the same old round perhaps you noticed an automobile at the upper corner of the park as you came one with a white body and red running gear asked the young man knitting his brows reflectively yes i always come in that pierre waits for me there he supposes me to be shopping in the de partment store across the square conceive of the bondage of the life wherein we must deceive even our chauffeurs good night but it is dark now said mr parkenstacker and the park is full of rude men may i not walk if you have the slightest regard for my wishes said the girl firmly you will remain at this bench for ten minutes after i have left i do not mean to accuse you but you are probably aware that autos generally bear the monogram of their owner again good night swift and stately she moved away through the dusk the young man watched her graceful form as she reached the pavement at the park s edge and turned up along it toward the corner where stood the automobile then he treacherously and unhesitat ingly began to dodge and skim among the park trees and shrubbery in a course parallel to her route keep ing her well in sight when she reached the corner she turned her head to glance at the motor car and then passed it con tinuing on across the street sheltered behind a con venient standing cab the young man followed her movements closely with his eyes passing down the sidewalk of the street opposite the park she entered the restaurant with the blazing sign the place was one of those frankly glaring establishments all white paint and glass where one may dine cheaply and conspicuously the girl penetrated the restaurant to some retreat at its rear whence she quickly emerged without her bat and veil the cashier s desk was well to the front a red head girl an the stool climbed down glancing pointedly at the clock as she did so the girl in gray mounted in her place the young man thrust his hands into his pockets and walked slowly back along the sidewalk at the corner his foot struck a small paper covered volume lying there sending it sliding to the edge of the turf by its picturesque cover he recognized it as the book the girl had been reading he picked it up carelessly and saw that its title was new arabian nights the author being of the name of stevenson he dropped it again upon the grass and lounged irresolute for a minute then he stepped into the automobile reclined upon the cushions and said two words to the chauffeur club henri a comedy in rubber one may hope in spite of the metaphorists to avoid the breath of the deadly upas tree one may by great good fortune succeed in blacking the eye of the basilisk one might even dodge the attentions of cer berus and argus but no man alive or dead can es cape the gaze of the rubberer new york is the caoutchouc city there are many of course who go their ways making money without turning

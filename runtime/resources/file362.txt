we will take them up now if you please he had gone through the first national at almost record breaking speed but thoroughly as he did everything the running order of the bank was smooth and clean and that had facilitated his work there was but one other bank in the town he received from the government a fee of twenty five dollars for each bank that he examined he should be able to go over those loans and discounts in half an hour if so he could examine the other bank immediately afterward and catch the the only other train that day in the direction he was working otherwise he would have to spend the night and sunday in this uninteresting western town that was why mr nettlewick was rushing matters come with me sir said major kingman in his deep voice that united the southern drawl with the rhythmic twang of the west we will go over them together nobody in the bank knows those notes as i do some of em are a little wobbly on their legs and some are mavericks without extra many brands on their backs but they ll most all pay out at the round up the two sat down at the president s desk first the examiner went through the notes at lightning speed and added up their total finding it to agree with the amount of loans carried on the book of daily balances next he took up the larger loans inquiring scrupulously into the condition of their endorsers or securities the new examiner s mind seemed to course and turn and make unexpected dashes hither and thither like a bloodhound seeking a trail finally he pushed aside all the notes except a few which he arranged in a neat pile before him and began a dry formal little speech i find sir the condition of your bank to be very good considering the poor crops and the depression in the cattle interests of your state the clerical work seems to be done accurately and punctually your past due paper is moderate in amount and promises only a small loss i would recommend the calling in of your large loans and the making of only sixty and ninety day or call loans until general business revives and now there is one thing more and i will have finished with the bank here are six notes aggregating something like they are secured according to their faces by various stocks bonds shares etc to the value of those securities are missing from the notes to which they should be attached i suppose you have them in the safe or vault you will permit me to examine them major tom s light blue eyes turned unflinchingly toward the examiner no sir he said in a low but steady tone those securities are neither in the safe nor in the vault i have taken them you may hold me personally responsible for their absence nettlewick felt a slight thrill he had not expected this he had struck a momentous trail when the hunt was drawing to a close ah said the examiner he waited a moment and then continued may i ask you to explain more definitely the securities were taken by me repeated the major it was not for my own use but to save an old friend in trouble come in here sir and we ll talk it over he led the examiner into the bank s private office at the rear and closed the door there was a desk and a table and half a dozen leather covered chairs on the wall was the mounted head of a texas steer with horns five feet from tip to tip opposite hung the major s old cavalry saber that he had carried at shiloh and fort pillow placing a chair for nettlewick the major seated himself by the window from which he could see the post office and the carved limestone front of the stockmen s national he did not speak at once and nettlewick felt perhaps that the ice could be broken by something so near its own temperature as the voice of official warning your statement he began since you have failed to modify it amounts as you must know to a very serious thing you are aware also of what my duty must compel me to do i shall have to go before the united states commissioner and make i know i know said major tom with a wave of his hand you don t suppose i d run a bank without being posted on national banking laws and the revised statutes do your duty i m not asking any favours but i spoke of my friend i did want you to hear me tell you about bob nettlewick settled himself in his chair there would be no leaving san rosario for him that day he would have to telegraph to the comptroller of the currency he would have to swear out a warrant before the united states commissioner for the arrest of major kingman perhaps he would be ordered to close the bank on account of the loss of the securities it was not the first crime the examiner had unearthed once or twice the terrible upheaval of human emotions that his investigations had loosed had almost caused a ripple in his official calm he had seen bank men kneel and plead and cry like women for a chance an hour s time the overlooking of a single error one cashier had shot himself at his desk before him none of them had taken it with the dignity and coolness of this stern old westerner nettlewick felt that he owed it to him at least to listen if he wished to talk with his elbow on the arm of his chair and his square chin resting upon the fingers of his right hand the bank examiner waited to hear the

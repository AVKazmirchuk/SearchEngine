cyclone in the bay says high jack snakefeeder so we get the captain to send us ashore in a dory when the squall seemed to cease from squalling we will find ruins here or make em says high the government doesn t care which we do an appropriation is an appropriation boca de coacoyula was a dead town them biblical towns we read about tired and siphon after they was destroyed they must have looked like forty second street and broadway compared to this boca place it still claimed inhabitants as estimated and engraved on the stone court house by the census taker in the citizens were a mixture of indians and other indians but some of em was light colored which i was surprised to see the town was huddled up on the shore with woods so thick around it that a subpoena server couldn t have reached a monkey ten yards away with the papers we wondered what kept it from being annexed to kansas but we soon found out that it was major bing major bing was the ointment around the fly he had the cochineal sarsaparilla log wood annatto hemp and all other dye woods and pure food adulteration concessions cornered he had five sixths of the boca de thingama jiggers working for him on shares it was a beautiful graft we used to brag about morgan and e h and others of our wisest when i was in the provinces but now no more that peninsula has got our little country turned into a submarine without even the observation tower showing major bing s idea was this he had the population go forth into the forest and gather these products when they brought em in he gave em one fifth for their trouble sometimes they d strike and demand a sixth the major always gave in to em the major had a bungalow so close on the sea that the nine inch tide seeped through the cracks in the kitchen floor me and him and high jack snakefeeder sat on the porch and drank rum from noon till midnight he said he had piled up in new orleans banks and high and me could stay with him forever if we would but high jack happened to think of the united states and began to talk ethnology ruins says major bing the woods are full of em i don t know how far they date back but they was here before i came high jack asks what form of worship the citizens of that locality are addicted to why says the major rubbing his nose i can t hardly say i imagine it s infidel or aztec or nonconformist or something like that there s a church here a methodist or some other kind with a parson named skidder he claims to have converted the people to christianity he and me don t assimilate except on state occasions i imagine they worship some kind of gods or idols yet but skidder says he has em in the fold a few days later high jack and me prowling around strikes a plain path into the forest and follows it a good four miles then a branch turns to the left we go a mile maybe down that and run up against the finest ruin you ever saw solid stone with trees and vines and under brush all growing up against it and in it and through it all over it was chiselled carvings of funny beasts and people that would have been arrested if they d ever come out in vaudeville that way we approached it from the rear high jack had been drinking too much rum ever since we landed in boca you know how an indian is the palefaces fixed his clock when they introduced him to firewater he d brought a quart along with him hunky says he we ll explore the ancient temple it may be that the storin that landed us here was propitious the minority report bureau of ethnology says he may yet profit by the vagaries of wind and tide we went in the rear door of the bum edifice we struck a kind of alcove without bath there was a granite davenport and a stone wash stand without any soap or exit for the water and some hardwood pegs drove into holes in the wall and that was all to go out of that furnished apartment into a harlem hall bedroom would make you feel like getting back home from an amateur violoncello solo at an east side settlement house while high was examining some hieroglyphics on the wall that the stone masons must have made when their tools slipped i stepped into the front room that was at least thirty by fifty feet stone floor six little windows like square port holes that didn t let much light in i looked back over my shoulder and sees high jack s face three feet away high says i of all the and then i noticed he looked funny and i turned around he d taken off his clothes to the waist and he didn t seem to hear me i touched him and came near beating it high jack had turned to stone i had been drinking some rum myself ossified i says to him loudly i knew what would happen if you kept it up and then high jack comes in from the alcove when he hears me conversing with nobody and we have a look at mr snakefeeder no it s a stone idol or god or revised statute or something and it looks as much like high jack as one green pea looks like itself it s got exactly his face and size and color but it s steadier on its pins it stands on a kind of rostrum or pedestal and you can see it s been there ten million years he s a cousin

smiling a little at the successful feat when he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card indifferently surprised he turned it over and looked again with interest one side of the card was blank on the other was written in ink three words the green door and then rudolf saw three steps in front of him a man throw down the card the negro had given him as he passed rudolf picked it up it was printed with the dentist s name and address and the usual schedule of plate work and bridge work and specious promises of painless operations the adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered then he crossed the street walked down a block recrossed and joined the upward current of people again without seeming to notice the negro as he passed the second time he carelessly took the card that was handed him ten steps away he inspected it in the same handwriting that appeared on the first card the green door was inscribed upon it three or four cards were tossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following and leading him these fell blank side up rudolf turned them over every one bore the printed legend of the dental parlours rarely did the arch sprite adventure need to beckon twice to rudolf steiner his true follower but twice it had been done and the quest was on rudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of rattling teeth this time as he passed he received no card in spite of his gaudy and ridiculous garb the ethiopian displayed a natural barbaric dignity as he stood offering the cards suavely to some allowing others to pass unmolested every half minute he chanted a harsh unintelligible phrase akin to the jabber of car conductors and grand opera and not only did he withhold a card this time but it seemed to rudolf that he received from the shining and massive black countenance a look of cold almost contemptuous disdain the look stung the adventurer he read in it a silent accusation that he had been found wanting whatever the mysterious written words on the cards might mean the black had selected him twice from the throng for their recipient and now seemed to have condemned him as deficient in the wit and spirit to engage the enigma standing aside from the rush the young man made a rapid estimate of the building in which he conceived that his adventure must lie five stories high it rose a small restaurant occupied the basement the first floor now closed seemed to house millinery or furs the second floor by the winking electric letters was the dentist s above this a polyglot babel of signs struggled to indicate the abodes of palmists dressmakers musicians and doctors still higher up draped curtains and milk bottles white on the window sills proclaimed the regions of domesticity after concluding his survey rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of stone steps into the house up two flights of the carpeted stairway he continued and at its top paused the hallway there was dimly lighted by two pale jets of gas one far to his right the other nearer to his left he looked toward the nearer light and saw within its wan halo a green door for one moment he hesitated then he seemed to see the contumelious sneer of the african juggler of cards and then he walked straight to the green door and knocked against it moments like those that passed before his knock was answered measure the quick breath of true adventure what might not be behind those green panels gamesters at play cunning rogues baiting their traps with subtle skill beauty in love with courage and thus planning to be sought by it danger death love disappointment ridicule any of these might respond to that temerarious rap a faint rustle was heard inside and the door slowly opened a girl not yet twenty stood there white faced and tottering she loosed the knob and swayed weakly groping with one hand rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch that stood against the wall he closed the door and took a swift glance around the room by the light of a flickering gas jet neat but extreme poverty was the story that he read the girl lay still as if in a faint rudolf looked around the room excitedly for a barrel people must be rolled upon a barrel who no no that was for drowned persons he began to fan her with his hat that was successful for he struck her nose with the brim of his derby and she opened her eyes and then the young man saw that hers indeed was the one missing face from his heart s gallery of intimate portraits the frank grey eyes the little nose turning pertly outward the chestnut hair curling like the tendrils of a pea vine seemed the right end and reward of all his wonderful adventures but the face was wofully thin and pale the girl looked at him calmly and then smiled fainted didn t i she asked weakly well who wouldn t you try going without anything to eat for three days and see himmel exclaimed rudolf jumping up wait till i come back he dashed out the green door and down the stairs in twenty minutes he was back again kicking at the door with his toe for her to open it with both arms he hugged an array of wares from the grocery and the restaurant on the table he laid them bread and butter cold meats cakes pies pickles oysters a roasted chicken a bottle of milk and one of redhot tea this is ridiculous said rudolf blusteringly to go without eating you must quit making election bets of this kind supper is ready he helped her to a chair

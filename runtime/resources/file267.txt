now they heard the shuffling of his shoes as he came across the rug toward them from his seat in the corner young marster he said take yo watch and without hesitation he laid the ancient timepiece in the hand of its rightful owner supply and demand finch keeps a hats cleaned by electricity while you wait establishment nine feet by twelve in third avenue once a customer you are always his i do not know his secret process but every four days your hat needs to be cleaned again finch is a leathern sallow slowfooted man between twenty and forty you would say he had been brought up a bushelman in essex street when business is slack he likes to talk so i had my hat cleaned even oftener than it deserved hoping finch might let me into some of the secrets of the sweatshops one afternoon i dropped in and found finch alone he began to anoint my headpiece de panama with his mysterious fluid that attracted dust and dirt like a magnet they say the indians weave em under water said i for a leader don t you believe it said finch no indian or white man could stay under water that long say do you pay much attention to politics i see in the paper something about a law they ve passed called the law of supply and demand i explained to him as well as i could that the reference was to a politico economical law and not to a legal statute i didn t know said finch i heard a good deal about it a year or so ago but in a one sided way yes said i political orators use it a great deal in fact they never give it a rest i suppose you heard some of those cart tail fellows spouting on the subject over here on the east side i heard it from a king said finch the white king of a tribe of indians in south america i was interested but not surprised the big city is like a mother s knee to many who have strayed far and found the roads rough beneath their uncertain feet at dusk they come home and sit upon the door step i know a piano player in a cheap cafe who has shot lions in africa a bell boy who fought in the british army against the zulus an express driver whose left arm had been cracked like a lobster s claw for a stew pot of patagonian cannibals when the boat of his rescuers hove in sight so a hat cleaner who had been a friend of a king did not oppress me a new band asked finch with his dry barren smile yes said i and half an inch wider i had had a new band five days before i meets a man one night said finch beginning his story a man brown as snuff with money in every pocket eating schweinerknuckel in schlagel s that was two years ago when i was a hose cart driver for no his discourse runs to the subject of gold he says that certain mountains in a country down south that he calls gaudymala is full of it he says the indians wash it out of the streams in plural quantities oh geronimo says i indians there s no indians in the south i tell him except elks maccabees and the buyers for the fall dry goods trade the indians are all on the reservations says i i m telling you this with reservations says he they ain t buffalo bill indians they re squattier and more pedigreed they call em inkers and aspics and they was old inhabitants when mazuma was king of mexico they wash the gold out of the mountain streams says the brown man and fill quills with it and then they empty em into red jars till they are full and then they pack it in buckskin sacks of one arroba each an

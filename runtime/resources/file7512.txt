it is true he said that i am fleeing the country but receive the assurance that i care very little for that courts and camps everywhere are open to sabas placido vaya what is this molehill of a republic this pig s head of a country to a man like me i am a paisano of everywhere in rome in london in paris in vienna you will hear them say welcome back don sabas come tonto baboon of a boy admiral whatever you call yourself turn your boat put us on board the salvador and here is your pay five hundred pesos in money of the estados unidos more than your lying government will pay you in twenty years don sabas pressed a plump purse against the youth s hand the admiral gave no heed to the words or the movement braced against the helm he was holding the sloop dead on her shoreward course his dull face was lit almost to intelligence by some inward conceit that seemed to afford him joy and found utterance in another parrot like cackle that is why they do it he said so that you will not see the guns they fire boom and you fall dead with your face to the wall yes the admiral called a sudden order to his crew the lithe silent caribs made fast the sheets they held and slipped down the hatchway into the hold of the sloop when the last one had disappeared don sabas like a big brown leopard leaped forward closed and fastened the hatch and stood smiling no rifles if you please dear admiral he said it was a whimsey of mine once to compile a dictionary of the carib lengua so i understood your order perhaps now you will he cut short his words for he heard the dull swish of iron scraping along tin the admiral had drawn the cutlass of pedro lafitte and was darting upon him the blade descended and it was only by a display of surprising agility that the large man escaped with only a bruised shoulder the glancing weapon he was drawing his pistol as he sprang and the next instant he shot the admiral down don sabas stooped over him and rose again in the heart he said briefly senores the navy is abolished colonel rafael sprang to the helm and the other officer hastened to loose the mainsail sheets the boom swung round el nacional veered and began to tack industriously for the salvador strike that flag senor called colonel rafael our friends on the steamer will wonder why we are sailing under it well said cried don sabas advancing to the mast he lowered the flag to the deck where lay its too loyal supporter thus ended the minister of war s little piece of after dinner drollery and by the same hand that began it suddenly don sabas gave a great cry of joy and ran down the slanting deck to the side of colonel rafael across his arm he carried the flag of the extinguished navy mire mire senor ah dios already can i hear that great bear of an oestreicher shout du hast mein herz gebrochen mire of my friend herr grunitz of vienna you have heard me relate that man has travelled to ceylon for an orchid to patagonia for a headdress to benares for a slipper to mozambique for a spearhead to add to his famous collections thou knowest also amigo rafael that i have been a gatherer of curios my collection of battle flags of the world s navies was the most complete in existence until last year then herr grunitz secured two such rare specimens one of a barberry state and one of the makarooroos a tribe on the west coast of africa i have not those but they can be procured but this flag senor do you know what it is name of god do you know see that red cross upon the blue and white ground you never saw it before seguramente no it is the naval flag of your country mire this rotten tub we stand upon is its navy that dead cockatoo lying there was its commander that stroke of cutlass and single pistol shot a sea battle all a piece of absurd foolery i grant you but authentic there has never been another flag like this and there never will be another no it is unique in the whole world yes think of what that means to a collector of flags do you know coronel mio how many golden crowns herr grunitz would give for this flag ten thousand likely well a hundred thousand would not buy it beautiful flag only flag little devil of a most heaven born flag o he old grumbler beyond the ocean wait till don sabas comes again to the konigin strasse he will let you kneel and touch the folds of it with one finger o he old spectacled ransacker of the world forgotten was the impotent revolution the danger the loss the gall of defeat possessed solely by the inordinate and unparalleled passion of the collector he strode up and down the little deck clasping to his breast with one hand the paragon of a flag he snapped his fingers triumphantly toward the east he shouted the paean to his prize in trumpet tones as though he would make old grunitz hear in his musty den beyond the sea they were waiting on the salvador to welcome them the sloop came close alongside the steamer where her sides were sliced almost to the lower deck for the loading of fruit the sailors of the salvador grappled and held her there captain mcleod leaned over the side well senor the jig is up i m told the jig is up don sabas looked perplexed for a moment that revolution ah yes with a shrug of his shoulders he dismissed the matter the captain learned of the escape and the imprisoned crew caribs he said no harm in them he slipped down into the sloop and kicked loose the hasp of the hatch the black fellows came tumbling up sweating but grinning hey black boys said the captain in a dialect of his own you sabe catchy boat and vamos back same place quick they saw him point to themselves the sloop and coralio yas yas they cried with broader grins and many nods the four don sabas the two officers and the captain moved to quit the sloop don sabas lagged a little behind looking at the still form of the late admiral sprawled in his paltry trappings pobrecito loco he said softly he was a brilliant cosmopolite and a cognoscente of high rank but after all he was of the same race and blood and instinct as this people even as the simple paisanos of coralio had said it so said don sabas without a smile he looked and said the poor little crazed one stooping he raised the limp shoulders drew the priceless and induplicable flag under them and over the breast pinning it there with the diamond star of the order of san carlos that he took from the collar of his own coat he followed after the others and stood with them upon the deck of the salvador the sailors that steadied el nacional shoved her off the jabbering caribs hauled away at the rigging the sloop headed for the shore and herr grunitz s collection of naval flags was still the finest in the world x the shamrock and the palm one night when there was no breeze and coralio seemed closer than ever to the gratings of avernus five men were grouped about the door of the photograph establishment of keogh and clancy thus in all the scorched and exotic places of the earth caucasians meet when the day s work is done to preserve the fulness of their heritage by the aspersion of alien things johnny atwood lay stretched upon the grass in the undress uniform of a carib and prated feebly of cool water to be had in the cucumber wood pumps of dalesburg doctor gregg through the prestige of his whiskers and as a bribe against the relation of his imminent professional tales was conceded the hammock that was swung between the door jamb and a calabash tree keogh had moved out upon the grass a little table that held the instrument for burnishing completed photographs he was the only busy one of the group industriously from between the cylinders of the burnisher rolled the finished depictments of coralio s citizens blanchard the french mining engineer in his cool linen viewed the smoke of his cigarette through his calm glasses impervious to the heat clancy sat on the steps smoking his short pipe his mood was the gossip s the others were reduced by the humidity to the state of disability desirable in an audience clancy was an american with an irish diathesis and cosmopolitan proclivities many businesses had claimed him but not for long the roadster s blood was in his veins the voice of the tintype was but one of the many callings that had wooed him upon so many roads sometimes he could be persuaded to oral construction of his voyages into the informal and egregious tonight there were symptoms of divulgement in him tis elegant weather for filibustering he volunteered it reminds me of the time i struggled to liberate a nation from the poisonous breath of a tyrant s clutch twas hard work tis straining to the back and makes corns on the hands i didn t know you had ever lent your sword to an oppressed people murmured atwood from the grass i did said clancy and they turned it into a plowshare what country was so fortunate as to secure your aid airily inquired blanchard where s kamchatka asked clancy with seeming irrelevance why off siberia somewhere in the arctic regions somebody answered doubtfully i thought that was the cold one said clancy with a satisfied nod i m always gettin the two names mixed twas guatemala then the hot one i ve been filibusterin with ye ll find that country on the map tis in the district known as the tropics by the foresight of providence it lies on the coast so the geography men could run the names of the towns off into the water they re an inch long small type composed of spanish dialects and tis my opinion of the same system of syntax that blew up the maine yes twas that country i sailed against single handed and endeavored to liberate it from a tyrannical government with a single barrelled pickaxe unloaded at that ye don t understand of course tis a statement demandin elucidation and apologies twas in new orleans one morning about the first ofjune i was standing down on the wharf looking about at the ships in the river there was a little steamer moored right opposite me that seemed about ready to sail the funnels of it were throwing out smoke and a gang of roustabouts were carrying aboard a pile of boxes that was stacked up on the wharf the boxes were about two feet square and something like four feet long and they seemed to be pretty heavy i walked over careless to the stack of boxes i saw one of them had been broken in handlin twas curiosity made me pull up the loose top and look inside the box was packed full of winchester rifles so so says i to myself somebody s gettin a twist on the neutrality laws somebody s aidin with munitions of war i wonder where the popguns are goin i heard somebody cough and i turned around there stood a little round fat man with a brown face and white clothes a first class looking little man with a four karat diamond on his finger and his eye full of interrogations and respects i judged he was a kind of foreigner may be from russia or japan or the archipelagoes hist says the round man full of concealments and confidences will the senor respect the discoveryments he has made that the mans on the ship shall not be acquaint the senor will be a gentleman that shall not expose one thing that by accident occur monseer says i for i judged him to be a kind of frenchman receive my most exasperated assurances that your secret is safe with james clancy furthermore i will go so far as to remark veev la liberty veev it good and strong whenever you hear of a clancy obstructin the abolishment of existin governments you may notify me by return mail the senor is good says the dark fat man smilin under his black mustache wish you to come aboard my ship and drink of wine a glass bein a clancy in two minutes me and the foreigner man were seated at a table in the cabin of the steamer with a bottle between us i could hear the heavy boxes bein dumped into the hold i judged that cargo must consist of at least winchesters me and the brown man drank the bottle of stuff and he called the steward to bring another when you amalgamate a clancy with the contents of a bottle you practically instigate secession i had heard a good deal about these revolutions in them tropical localities and i begun to want a hand in it you goin to stir things up in your country ain t you monseer says i with a wink to let him know i was on yes yes said the little man pounding his fist on the table a change of the greatest will occur too long have the people been oppressed with the promises and the never to happen things to become the great work it shall be carry on yes our forces shall in the capital city strike of the soonest carrambos carrambos is the word says i beginning to invest myself with enthusiasm and more wine likewise veeva as i said before may the shamrock of old i mean the banana vine or the pie plant or whatever the imperial emblem may be of your down trodden country wave forever a thousand thank yous says the round man for your emission of amicable utterances what our cause needs of the very most is mans who will the work do to lift it along oh for one thousands strong good mans to aid the general de vega that he shall to his country bring those success and glory it is hard oh so hard to find good mans to help in the work monseer says i leanin over the table and graspin his hand i don t know where your country is but me heart bleeds for it the heart of a clancy was never deaf to the sight of an oppressed people the family is filibusterers by birth and foreigners by trade if you can use james clancy s arms and his blood in denuding your shores of the tyrant s yoke they re yours to command general de vega was overcome with joy to confiscate my condolence of his conspiracies and predicaments he tried to embrace me across the table but his fatness and the wine that had been in the bottles prevented thus was i welcomed into the ranks of filibustery then the general man told me his country had the name of guatemala and was the greatest nation laved by any ocean whatever anywhere he looked at me with tears in his eyes and from time to time he would emit the remark ah big strong brave mans that is what my country need general de vega as was the name by which he denounced himself brought out a document for me to sign which i did makin a fine flourish and curlycue with the tail of the y your passage money says the general business like shall from your pay be deduct twill not says i haughty i ll pay my own passage a hundred and eighty dollars i had in my inside pocket and twas no common filibuster i was goin to be filibusterin for me board and clothes the steamer was to sail in two hours and i went ashore to get some things together i d need when i came aboard i showed the general with pride the outfit twas a fine chinchilla overcoat arctic overshoes fur cap and earmuffs with elegant fleece lined gloves and woollen muffler carrambos says the little general what clothes are these that shall go to the tropic and then the little spalpeen laughs and he calls the captain and the captain calls the purser and they pipe up the chief engineer and the whole gang leans against the cabin and laughs at clancy s wardrobe for guatemala i reflects a bit serious and asks the general again to denominate the terms by which his country is called he tells me and i see then that twas the t other one kamchatka i had in mind since then i ve had difficulty in separatin the two nations in name climate and geographic disposition i paid my passage twenty four dollars first cabin and ate at table with the officer crowd down on the lower deck was a gang of second class passengers about forty of them seemin to be dagoes and the like i wondered what so many of them were goin along for well then in three days we sailed alongside that guatemala twas a blue country and not yellow as tis miscolored on the map we landed at a town on the coast where a train of cars was waitin for us on a dinky little railroad the boxes on the steamer were brought ashore and loaded on the cars the gang of dagoes got aboard too the general and me in the front car yes me and general de vega headed the revolution as it pulled out of the seaport town that train travelled about as fast as a policeman goin to a riot it penetrated the most conspicuous lot of fuzzy scenery ever seen outside a geography we run some forty miles in seven hours and the train stopped there was no more railroad twas a sort of camp in a damp gorge full of wildness and melancholies they was grading and choppin out the forests ahead to continue the road here says i to myself is the romantic haunt of the revolutionists here will clancy by the virtue that is in a superior race and the inculcation of fenian tactics strike a tremendous blow for liberty they unloaded the boxes from the train and begun to knock the tops off from the first one that was open i saw general de vega take the winchester rifles and pass them around to a squad of morbid soldiery the other boxes was opened next and believe me or not divil another gun was to be seen every other box in the load was full of pickaxes and spades and then sorrow be upon them tropics the proud clancy and the dishonored dagoes each one of them had to shoulder a pick or a spade and march away to work on that dirty little railroad yes twas that the dagoes shipped for and twas that the filibusterin clancy signed for though unbeknownst to himself at the time in after days i found out about it it seems twas hard to get hands to work on that road the intelligent natives of the country was too lazy to work indeed the saints know twas unnecessary by stretchin out one hand they could seize the most delicate and costly fruits of the earth and by stretchin out the other they could sleep for days at a time without hearin a seven o clock whistle or the footsteps of the rent man upon the stairs so regular the steamers travelled to the united states to seduce labor usually the imported spade slingers died in two or three months from eatin the over ripe water and breathing the violent tropical scenery wherefore they made them sign contracts for a year when they hired them and put an armed guard over the poor devils to keep them from runnin away twas thus i was double crossed by the tropics through a family failing of goin out of the way to hunt disturbances they gave me a pick and i took it meditating an insurrection on the spot but there was the guards handling the winchesters careless and i come to the conclusion that discretion was the best part of filibusterin there was about a hundred of us in the gang starting out to work and the word was given to move i steps out of the ranks and goes up to that general de vega man who was smokin a cigar and gazin upon the scene with satisfactions and glory he smiles at me polite and devilish plenty work says he for big strong mans in guatemala yes thirty dollars in the month good pay ah yes you strong brave man bimeby we push those railroad in the capital very quick they want you go work now adios strong mans monseer says i lingerin will you tell a poor little irishman this when i set foot on your cockroachy steamer and breathed liberal and revolutionary sentiments into your sour wine did you think i was conspirin to sling a pick on your contemptuous little railroad and when you answered me with patriotic recitations humping up the star spangled cause of liberty did you have meditations of reducin me to the ranks of the stump grubbin dagoes in the chain gangs of your vile and grovelin country the general man expanded his rotundity and laughed considerable yes he laughed very long and loud and i clancy stood and waited comical mans he shouts at last so you will kill me from the laughing yes it is hard to find the brave strong mans to aid my country revolutions did i speak of r r revolutions not one word i say big strong man is need in guatemala so the mistake is of you you have looked in those one box containing those gun for the guard you think all boxes is contain gun no there is not war in guatemala but work yes good thirty dollar in the month you shall shoulder one pickaxe senor and dig for the liberty and prosperity of guatemala off to your work the guard waits for you little fat poodle dog of a brown man says i quiet but full of indignations and discomforts things shall happen to you maybe not right away but as soon as j clancy can formulate somethin in the way of repartee the boss of the gang orders us to work i tramps off with the dagoes and i hears the distinguished patriot and kidnapper laughin hearty as we go tis a sorrowful fact for eight weeks i built railroads for that misbehavin country i filibustered twelve hours a day with a heavy pick and a spade choppin away the luxurious landscape that grew upon the right of way we worked in swamps that smelled like there was a leak in the gas mains trampin down a fine assortment of the most expensive hothouse plants and vegetables the scene was tropical beyond the wildest imagination of the geography man the trees was all sky scrapers the underbrush was full of needles and pins there was monkeys jumpin around and crocodiles and pink tailed mockin birds and ye stood knee deep in the rotten water and grabbled roots for the liberation of guatemala of nights we would build smudges in camp to discourage the mosquitoes and sit in the smoke with the guards pacin all around us there was two hundred men working on the road mostly dagoes nigger men spanish men and swedes three or four were irish one old man named halloran a man of hibernian entitlements and discretions explained it to me he had been working on the road a year most of them died in less than six months he was dried up to gristle and bone and shook with chills every third night when you first come says he ye think ye ll leave right away but they hold out your first month s pay for your passage over and by that time the tropics has its grip on ye ye re surrounded by a ragin forest full of disreputable beasts lions and baboons and anacondas waiting to devour ye the sun strikes ye hard and melts the marrow in your bones ye get similar to the lettuce eaters the poetry books speaks about ye forget the elevated sintiments of life such as patriotism revenge disturbances of the peace and the dacint love of a clane shirt ye do your work and ye swallow the kerosene ile and rubber pipestems dished up to ye by the dago cook for food ye light your pipeful and say to yourself nixt week i ll break away and ye go to sleep and call yersilf a liar for ye know yell never do it who is this general man asks i that calls himself de vega tis the man says halloran who is tryin to complete the finishin of the railroad twas the project of a private corporation but it busted and then the government took it up de vegy is a big politician and wants to be president the people want the railroad completed as they re taxed mighty on account of it the de vegy man is pushing it along as a campaign move tis not my way says i to make threats against any man but there s an account to be settled between the railroad man and james o dowd clancy twas that way i thought mesilf at first halloran says with a big sigh until i got to be a lettuce eater the fault s wid these tropics they rejuices a man s system tis a land as the poet says where it always seems to be after dinner i does me work and smokes me pipe and sleeps there s little else in life anyway ye ll get that way yersilf mighty soon don t be harborin any sentiments at all clancy i can t help it says i i m full of em i enlisted in the revolutionary army of this dark country in good faith to fight for its liberty honors and silver candlesticks instead of which i am set to amputatin its scenery and grubbin its roots tis the general man will have to pay for it two months i worked on that railroad before i found a chance to get away one day a gang of us was sent back to the end of the completed line to fetch some picks that had been sent down to port barrios to be sharpened they were brought on a hand car and i noticed when i started away that the car was left there on the track that night about twelve i woke up halloran and told him my scheme run away says halloran good lord clancy do ye mean it why i ain t got the nerve it s too chilly and i ain t slept enough run away i told you clancy i ve eat the lettuce i ve lost my grip tis the tropics that s done it tis like the poet says forgotten are our friends that we have left behind in the hollow lettuce land we will live and lay reclined you better go on clancy i ll stay i guess it s too early and cold and i m sleepy so i had to leave halloran i dressed quiet and slipped out of the tent we were in when the guard came along i knocked him over like a ninepin with a green coconut i had and made for the railroad i got on that hand car and made it fly twas yet a while before daybreak when i saw the lights of port barrios about a mile away i stopped the hand car there and walked to the town i stepped inside the corporations of that town with care and hesitations i was not afraid of the army of guatemala but me soul quaked at the prospect of a hand to hand struggle with its employment bureau tis a country that hires its help easy and keeps em long sure i can fancy missis america and missis guatemala passin a bit of gossip some fine still night across the mountains oh dear says missis america and it s a lot of trouble i m havin ag in with the help senora ma am laws now says missis guatemala you don t say so ma am now mine never think ofleavin me te he ma am snickers missis guatemala i was wonderin how i was goin to move away from them tropics without bein hired again dark as it was i could see a steamer ridin in the harbor with smoke emergin from her stacks i turned down a little grass street that run down to the water on the beach i found a little brown nigger man just about to shove off in a skiff hold on sambo says i savve english heap plenty yes says he with a pleasant grin what steamer is that i asks him and where is it going and what s the news and the good word and the time of day that steamer the conchita said the brown man affable and easy rollin a cigarette him come from new orleans for load banana him got load last night i think him sail in one two hour verree nice day we shall be goin have you hear some talkee bout big battle maybe so you think catchee general de vega senor yes no how s that sambo says i big battle what battle who wants catchee general de vega i ve been up at my old gold mines in the interior for a couple of months and haven t heard any news oh says the nigger man proud to speak the english verree great revolution in guatemala one week ago general de vega him try be president him raise armee one five ten thousand mans for fight at the government those one government send five forty hundred thousand soldier to suppress revolution they fight big battle yesterday at lomagrande that about nineteen or fifty mile in the mountain that government soldier wheep general de vega oh most bad five hundred nine hundred two thousand of his mans is kill that revolution is

vega verree much they want catchee him for shoot you think they catchee that general senor saints grant it says i twould be the judgment of providence for settin the warlike talent of a clancy to gradin the tropics with a pick and shovel but tis not so much a question of insurrections now me little man as tis of the hired man problem tis anxious i am to resign a situation of responsibility and trust with the white wings department of your great and degraded country row me in your little boat out to that steamer and i ll give ye five dollars sinker pacers sinker pacers says i reducing the offer to the language and denomination of the tropic dialects cinco pesos repeats the little man five dollee you give twas not such a bad little man he had hesitations at first sayin that passengers leavin the country had to have papers and passports but at last he took me out alongside the steamer day was just breakin as we struck her and there wasn t a soul to be seen on board the water was very still and the nigger man gave me a lift from the boat and i climbed onto the steamer where her side was sliced to the deck for loadin fruit the hatches was open and i looked down and saw the cargo of bananas that filled the hold to within six feet of the top i thinks to myself clancy you better go as a stowaway it s safer the steamer men might hand you back to the employment bureau the tropic ll get you clancy if you don t watch out so i jumps down easy among the bananas and digs out a hole to hide in among the bunches in an hour or so i could hear the engines goin and feel the steamer rockin and i knew we were off to sea they left the hatches open for ventilation and pretty soon it was light enough in the hold to see fairly well i got to feelin a bit hungry and thought i d have a light fruit lunch by way of refreshment i creeped out of the hole i d made and stood up straight just then i saw another man crawl up about ten feet away and reach out and skin a banana and stuff it into his mouth twas a dirty man black faced and ragged and disgraceful of aspect yes the man was a ringer for the pictures of the fat weary willie in the funny papers i looked again and saw it was my general man de vega the great revolutionist mule rider and pickaxe importer when he saw me the general hesitated with his mouth filled with banana and his eyes the size of coconuts hist i says not a word or they ll put us off and make us walk veev la liberty i adds copperin the sentiment by shovin a banana into the source of it i was certain the general wouldn t recognize me the nefarious work of the tropics had left me lookin different there was half an inch of roan whiskers coverin me face and me costume was a pair of blue overalls and a red shirt how you come in the ship senor asked the general as soon as he could speak by the back door whist says i twas a glorious blow for liberty we struck i continues but we was overpowered by numbers let us accept our defeat like brave men and eat another banana were you in the cause of liberty fightin senor says the general sheddin tears on the cargo to the last says i twas i led the last desperate charge against the minions of the tyrant but it made them mad and we was forced to retreat twas i general procured the mule upon which you escaped could you give that ripe bunch a little boost this way general it s a bit out of my reach thanks say you so brave patriot said the general again weepin ah dios and i have not the means to reward your devotion barely did i my life bring away carrambos what a devil s animal was that mule senor like ships in one storm was i dashed about the skin on myself was ripped away with the thorns and vines upon the bark of a hundred trees did that beast of the infernal bump and cause outrage to the legs of mine in the night to port barrios i came i dispossess myself of that mountain of mule and hasten along the water shore i find a little boat to be tied i launch myself and row to the steamer i cannot see any mans on board so i climbed one rope which hang at the side i then myself hide in the bananas surely i say if the ship captains view me they shall throw me again to those guatemala those things are not good guatemala will shoot general de vega therefore i am hide and remain silent life itself is glorious liberty it is pretty good but so good as life i do not think three days as i said was the trip to new orleans the general man and me got to be cronies of the deepest dye bananas we ate until they were distasteful to the sight and an eyesore to the palate but to bananas alone was the bill of fare reduced at night i crawls out careful on the lower deck and gets a bucketful of fresh water that general de vega was a man inhabited by an engorgement of words and sentences he added to the monotony of the voyage by divestin himself of conversation he believed i was a revolutionist of his own party there bein as he told me a good many americans and other foreigners in its ranks twas a braggart and a conceited little gabbler it was though he considered himself a hero twas on himself he wasted all his regrets at the failing of his plot not a word did the little balloon have to say about the other misbehaving idiots that had been shot or run themselves to death in his revolution the second day out he was feelin pretty braggy and uppish for a stowed away conspirator that owed his existence to a mule and stolen bananas he was tellin me about the great railroad he had been buildin and he relates what he calls a comic incident about a fool irishman he inveigled from new orleans to sling a pick on his little morgue of a narrow gauge line twas sorrowful to hear the little dirty general tell the opprobrious story of how he put salt upon the tail of that reckless and silly bird clancy laugh he did hearty and long he shook with laughin the black faced rebel and outcast standing neck deep in bananas without friends or country ah senor he snickers to death you would have laughed at that drollest irish i say to him strong big mans is need very much in guatemala i will blows strike for your down pressed country he say that shall you do i tell him ah it was an irish so comic he sees one box break upon the wharf that contain for the guard a few gun he think there is gun in all the box but that is all pickaxe yes ah senor could you the face of that irish have seen when they set him to the work twas thus the ex boss of the employment bureau contributed to the tedium of the trip with merry jests and anecdote but now and then he would weep upon the bananas and make oration about the lost cause of liberty and the mule twas a pleasant sound when the steamer bumped against the pier in new orleans pretty soon we heard the pat a pat of hundreds of bare feet and the dago gang that unloads the fruit jumped on the deck and down into the hold me and the general worked a while at passing up the bunches and they thought we were part of the gang after about an hour we managed to slip off the steamer onto the wharf twas a great honor on the hands of an obscure clancy havin the entertainment of the representative of a great foreign filibustering power i first bought for the general and myself many long drinks and things to eat that were not bananas the general man trotted along at my side leaving all the arrangements to me i led him up to lafayette square and set him on a bench in the little park cigarettes i had bought for him and he humped himself down on the seat like a little fat contented hobo i look him over as he sets there and what i see pleases me brown by nature and instinct he is now brindled with dirt and dust praise to the mule his clothes is mostly strings and flaps yes the looks of the general man is agreeable to clancy i asks him delicate if by any chance he brought away anybody s money with him from guatemala he sighs and humps his shoulders against the bench not a cent all right maybe he tells me some of his friends in the tropic outfit will send him funds later the general was as clear a case of no visible means as i ever saw i told him not to move from the bench and then i went up to the corner of poydras and carondelet along there is o hara s beat in five minutes along comes o hara a big fine man red faced with shinin buttons swinging his club twould be a fine thing for guatemala to move into o hara s precinct twould be a fine bit of recreation for danny to suppress revolutions and uprisins once or twice a week with his club is workin yet danny says i walking up to him overtime says o hara looking over me suspicious want some of it fifty forty six is the celebrated city ordinance authorizing arrest conviction and imprisonment of persons that succeed in concealing their crimes from the police don t ye know jimmy clancy says i ye pink gilled monster so when o hara recognized me beneath the scandalous exterior bestowed upon me by the tropics i backed him into a doorway and told him what i wanted and why i wanted it all right jimmy says o hara go back and hold the bench i ll be along in ten minutes in that time o hara strolled through lafayette square and spied two weary willies disgracin one of the benches in ten minutes more j clancy and general de vega late candidate for the presidency of guatemala was in the station house the general is badly frightened and calls upon me to proclaim his distinguishments and rank the man says i to the police used to be a railroad man he s on the bum now tis a little bughouse he is on account of losin his job carrambos says the general fizzin like a little soda fountain you fought senor with my forces in my native country why do you say the lies you shall say i am the general de vega one soldier one caballero

sounded like the crack of the surf on the sands tell em ye divil he chuckled how you got even with the tropical general in the way of agricultural maneuverings having no money concluded clancy with

erin go bragh xi the remnants of the code breakfast in coralio was at eleven therefore the people did not go to market early the little wooden market house stood on a patch of short trimmed grass under the vivid green foliage of a bread fruit tree thither one morning the venders leisurely convened bringing their wares with them a porch or platform six feet wide encircled the building shaded from the mid morning sun by the projecting grass thatched roof upon this platform the venders were wont to display their goods newly killed beef fish crabs fruit of the country cassava eggs dulces and high tottering stacks of native tortillas as large around as the sombrero of a spanish grandee but on this morning they whose stations lay on the seaward side of the market house instead of spreading their merchandise formed themselves into a softly jabbering and gesticulating group for there upon their space of the platform was sprawled asleep the unbeautiful figure of beelzebub blythe he lay upon a ragged strip of cocoa matting more than ever a fallen angel in appearance his suit of coarse flax soiled bursting at the seams crumpled into a thousand diversified wrinkles and creases inclosed him absurdly like the garb of some effigy that had been stuffed in sport and thrown there after indignity had been wrought upon it but firmly upon the high bridge of his nose reposed his gold rimmed glasses the surviving badge of his ancient glory the sun s rays reflecting quiveringly from the rippling sea upon his face and the voices of the market men woke beelzebub blythe he sat up blinking and leaned his back against the wall of the market drawing a blighted silk handkerchief from his pocket he assiduously rubbed and burnished his glasses and while doing this he became aware that his bedroom had been invaded and that polite brown and yellow men were beseeching him to vacate in favor of their market stuff if the senor would have the goodness a thousand pardons for bringing to him molestation but soon would come the compradores for the day s provisions surely they had ten thousand regrets at disturbing him in this manner they expanded to him the intimation that he must clear out and cease to clog the wheels of trade blythe stepped from the platform with the air of a prince leaving his canopied couch he never quite lost that air even at the lowest point of his fall it is clear that the college of good breeding does not necessarily maintain a chair of morals within its walls blythe shook out his wry clothing and moved slowly up the calle grande through the hot sand he moved without a destination in his mind the little town was languidly stirring to its daily life golden skinned babies tumbled over one another in the grass the sea breeze brought him appetite but nothing to satisfy it throughout coralio were its morning odors those from the heavily fragrant tropical flowers and from the bread baking in the outdoor ovens of clay and the pervading smoke of their fires where the smoke cleared the crystal air with some of the efficacy of faith seemed to remove the mountains almost to the sea bringing them so near that one might count the scarred glades on their wooded sides the light footed caribs were swiftly gliding to their tasks at the waterside already along the bosky trails from the banana groves files of horses were slowly moving concealed except for their nodding heads and plodding legs by the bunches of green golden fruit heaped upon their backs on doorsills sat women combing their long black hair and calling one to another across the narrow thoroughfares peace reigned in coralio arid and bald peace but still peace on that bright morning when nature seemed to be offering the lotus on the dawn s golden platter beelzebub blythe had reached rock bottom further descent seemed impossible that last night s slumber in a public place had done for him as long as he had had a roof to cover him there had remained unbridged the space that separates a gentleman from the beasts of the jungle and the fowls of the air but now he was little more than a whimpering oyster led to be devoured on the sands of a southern sea by the artful walrus circumstance and the implacable carpenter fate to blythe money was now but a memory he had drained his friends of all that their good fellowship had to offer then he had squeezed them to the last drop of their generosity and at last aaron like he had smitten the rock of their hardening bosoms for the scattering ignoble drops of charity itself he had exhausted his credit to the last real with the minute keenness of the shameless sponger he was aware of every source in coralio from which a glass of rum a meal or a piece of silver could be wheedled marshalling each such source in his mind he considered it with all the thoroughness and penetration that hunger and thirst lent him for the task all his optimism failed to thresh a grain of hope from the chaff of his postulations he had played out the game that one night in the open had shaken his nerves until then there had been left to him at least a few grounds upon which he could base his unblushing demands upon his neighbors stores now he must beg instead of borrowing the most brazen sophistry could not dignify by the name of loan the coin contemptuously flung to a beachcomber who slept on the bare boards of the public market but on this morning no beggar would have more thankfully received a charitable coin for the demon thirst had him by the throat the drunkard s matutinal thirst that requires to be slaked at each morning station on the road to tophet blythe walked slowly up the street keeping a watchful eye for any miracle that might drop manna upon him in his wilderness as he passed the popular eating house of madama vasquez madama s boarders were just sitting down to freshly baked bread aguacates pines and delicious coffee that sent forth odorous guarantee of its quality upon the breeze madama was serving she turned her shy stolid melancholy gaze for a moment out the window she saw blythe and her expression turned more shy and embarrassed beelzebub owed her twenty pesos he bowed as he had once bowed to less embarrassed dames to whom he owed nothing and passed on merchants and their clerks were throwing open the solid wooden doors of their shops polite but cool were the glances they cast upon blythe as he lounged tentatively by with the remains of his old jaunty air for they were his creditors almost without exception at the little fountain in the plaza he made an apology for a toilet with his wetted handkerchief across the open square filed the dolorous line of friends to the prisoners in the calaboza bearing the morning meal of the immured the food in their hands roused small longing in blythe it was drink that his soul craved or money to buy it in the streets he met many with whom he had been friends and equals and whose patience and liberality he had gradually exhausted willard geddie and paula cantered past him with the coolest of nods returning from their daily horseback ride along the old indian road keogh passed him at another corner whistling cheerfully and bearing a prize of newly laid eggs for the breakfast of himself and clancy the jovial scout of fortune was one of blythe s victims who had plunged his hand oftenest into his pocket to aid him but now it seemed that keogh too had fortified himself against further invasions his curt greeting and the ominous light in his full gray eye quickened the steps of beelzebub whom desperation had almost incited to attempt an additional loan three drinking shops the forlorn one next visited in succession in all of these his money his credit and his welcome had long since been spent but blythe felt that he would have fawned in the dust at the feet of an enemy that morning for one draught of aguardiente in two of the pulperias his courageous petition for drink was met with a refusal so polite that it stung worse than abuse the third establishment had acquired something of american methods and here he was seized bodily and cast out upon his hands and knees this physical indignity caused a singular change in the man as he picked himself up and walked away an expression of absolute relief came upon his features the specious and conciliatory smile that had been graven there was succeeded by a look of calm and sinister resolve beelzebub had been floundering in the sea of improbability holding by a slender life line to the respectable world that had cast him overboard he must have felt that with this ultimate shock the line had snapped and have experienced the welcome ease of the drowning swimmer who has ceased to struggle blythe walked to the next corner and stood there while he brushed the sand from his garments and repolished his glasses i ve got to do it oh i ve got to do it he told himself aloud if i had a quart of rum i believe i could stave it off yet for a little while but there s no more rum for beelzebub as they call me by the flames of tartarus if i m to sit at the right hand of satan somebody has got to pay the court expenses you ll have to pony up mr frank goodwin you re a good fellow but a gentleman must draw the line at being kicked into the gutter blackmail isn t a pretty word but it s the next station on the road i m travelling with purpose in his steps blythe now moved rapidly through the town by way of its landward environs he passed through the squalid quarters of the improvident negroes and on beyond the picturesque shacks of the poorer mestizos from many points along his course he could see through the umbrageous glades the house of frank goodwin on its wooded hill and as he crossed the little bridge over the lagoon he saw the old indian galvez scrubbing at the wooden slab that bore the name of miraflores beyond the lagoon the lands of goodwin began to slope gently upward a grassy road shaded by a munificent and diverse array of tropical flora wound from the edge of an outlying banana grove to the dwelling blythe took this road with long and purposeful strides goodwin was seated on his coolest gallery dictating letters to his secretary a sallow and capable native youth the household adhered to the american plan of breakfast and that meal had been a thing of the past for the better part of an hour the castaway walked to the steps and flourished a hand good morning blythe said goodwin looking up come in and have a chair anything i can do for you i want to speak to you in private goodwin nodded at his secretary who strolled out under a mango tree and lit a cigarette blythe took the chair that he had left vacant i want some money he began doggedly i m sorry said goodwin with equal directness but you can t have any you re drinking yourself to death blythe your friends have done all they could to help you to brace up you won t help yourself there s no use furnishing you with money to ruin yourself with any longer dear man said blythe tilting back his chair it isn t a question of social economy now it s past that i like you goodwin and i ve come to stick a knife between your ribs i was kicked out of espada s saloon this morning and society owes me reparation for my wounded feelings i didn t kick you out no but in a general way you represent society and in a particular way you represent my last chance i ve had to come down to it old man i tried to do it a month ago when losada s man was here turning things over but i couldn t do it then now it s different i want a thousand dollars goodwin and you ll have to give it to me only last week said goodwin with a smile a silver dollar was all you were asking for an evidence said blythe flippantly that i was still virtuous though under heavy pressure the wages of sin should be something higher than a peso worth forty eight cents let s talk business i am the villain in the third act and i must have my merited if only temporary triumph i saw you collar the late president s valiseful of boodle oh i know it s blackmail but i m liberal about the price i know i m a cheap villain one of the regular sawmill drama kind but you re one of my particular friends and i don t want to stick you hard suppose you go into the details suggested goodwin calmly arranging his letters on the table all right said beelzebub i like the way you take it i despise histrionics so you will please prepare yourself for the facts without any red fire calcium or grace notes on the saxophone on the night that his fly by night excellency arrived in town i was very drunk you will excuse the pride with which i state that fact but it was quite a feat for me to attain that desirable state somebody had left a cot out under the orange trees in the yard of madama ortiz s hotel i stepped over the wall laid down upon it and fell asleep i was awakened by an orange that dropped from the tree upon my nose and i laid there for a while cursing sir isaac newton or whoever it was that invented gravitation for not confining his theory to apples and then along came mr miraflores and his true love with the treasury in a valise and went into the hotel next you hove in sight and held a pow wow with the tonsorial artist who insisted upon talking shop after hours i tried to slumber again but once more my rest was disturbed this time by the noise of the popgun that went off upstairs then that valise came crashing down into an orange tree just above my head and i arose from my couch not knowing when it might begin to rain saratoga trunks when the army and the constabulary began to arrive with their medals and decorations hastily pinned to their pajamas and their snickersnees drawn i crawled into the welcome shadow of a banana plant i remained there for an hour by which time the excitement and the people had cleared away and then my dear goodwin excuse me i saw you sneak back and pluck that ripe and juicy valise from the orange tree i followed you and saw you take it to your own house a hundred thousand dollar crop from one orange tree in a season

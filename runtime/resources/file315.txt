that she occupied the stairway but the shoe the naughty shoe alas it would not remain tied ah if monsieur would be so gracious the poet s fingers trembled as he tied the contrary ribbons then he would have fled from the danger of her presence but the eyes grew long and cozening like a gypsy s and held him he leaned against the balustrade clutching his bottle of sour wine you have been so good she said smiling does monsieur perhaps live in the house yes madame i i think so madame perhaps in the third story then no madame higher up the lady fluttered her fingers with the least possible gesture of impatience pardon certainly i am not discreet in asking monsieur will forgive me it is surely not becoming that i should inquire where he lodges madame do not say so i live in the no no no do not tell me now i see that i erred but i cannot lose the interest i feel in this house and all that is in it once it was my home often i come here but to dream of those happy days again will you let that be my excuse let me tell you then for you need no excuse stammered the poet i live in the top floor the small room where the stairs turn in the front room asked the lady turning her head sidewise the rear madame the lady sighed as if with relief i will detain you no longer then monsieur she said employing the round and artless eye take good care of my house alas only the memories of it are mine now adieu and accept my thanks for your courtesy she was gone leaving but a smile and a trace of sweet perfume david climbed the stairs as one in slumber but he awoke from it and the smile and the perfume lingered with him and never afterward did either seem quite to leave him this lady of whom he knew nothing drove him to lyrics of eyes chansons of swiftly conceived love odes to curling hair and sonnets to slippers on slender feet poet he must have been for yvonne was forgotten this fine new loveliness held him with its freshness and grace the subtle perfume about her filled him with strange emotions on a certain night three persons were gathered about a table in a room on the third floor of the same house three chairs and the table and a lighted candle upon it was all the furniture one of the persons was a huge man dressed in black his expression was one of sneering pride the ends of his upturned moustache reached nearly to his mocking eyes another was a lady young and beautiful with eyes that could be round and artless as a child s or long and cozening like a gypsy s but were now keen and ambitious like any other conspirator s the third was a man of action a combatant a bold and impatient executive breathing fire and steel he was addressed by the others as captain desrolles this man struck the table with his fist and said with controlled violence to night to night as he goes to midnight mass i am tired of the plotting that gets nowhere i am sick of signals and ciphers and secret meetings and such baragouin let us be honest traitors if france is to be rid of him let us kill in the open and not hunt with snares and traps to night i say i back my words my hand will do the deed to night as he goes to mass the lady turned upon him a cordial look woman however wedded to plots must ever thus bow to rash courage the big man stroked his upturned moustache dear captain he said in a great voice softened by habit this time i agree with you nothing is to be gained by waiting enough of the palace guards belong to us to make the endeavour a safe one to night repeated captain desrolles again striking the table you have heard me marquis my hand will do the deed but now said the huge man softly comes a question word must be sent to our partisans in the palace and a signal agreed upon our stanchest men must accompany the royal carriage at this hour what messenger can penetrate so far as the south doorway ribouet is stationed there once a message is placed in his hands all will go well i will send the message said the lady you countess said the marquis raising his eyebrows your devotion is great we know but listen exclaimed the lady rising and resting her hands upon the table in a garret of this house lives a youth from the provinces as guileless and tender as the lambs he tended there i have met him twice or thrice upon the stairs i questioned him fearing that he might dwell too near the room in which we are accustomed to meet he is mine if i will he writes poems in his garret and i think he dreams of me he will do what i say he shall take the message to the palace the marquis rose from his chair and bowed you did not permit me to finish my sentence countess he said i would have said your devotion is great but your wit and charm are infinitely greater while the conspirators were thus engaged david was polishing some lines addressed to his amorette d escalier he heard a timorous knock at his door and opened it with a great throb to behold her there panting as one in straits with eyes wide open and artless like a child s monsieur she breathed i come to you in distress i believe you to be good and true and i know of no other help how i flew through the streets

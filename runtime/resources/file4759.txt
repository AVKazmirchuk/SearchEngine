not such mans of so beegness so good talk so compliments so strongness of sense and such ah that senor galloway yes says i old denver is the boy you want he s managed every kind of business here except filibustering and he might as well complete the list before the three days was up i decided to join denver in his campaign denver got three months vacation from his hotel owners for a week we lived in a room with the general and got all the pointers about his country that we could interpret from the noises he made when we got ready to start denver had a pocket full of memorandums and letters from the general to his friends and a list of names and addresses of loyal politicians who would help along the boom of the exiled popular idol besides these liabilities we carried assets to the amount of in assorted united states currency general rompiro looked like a burnt effigy but he was br er fox himself when it came to the real science of politics here is moneys says the general of a small amount there is more with me moocho more plentee moneys shall you be supplied senor galloway more i shall send you at all times that you need i shall desire to pay feefty one hundred thousand pesos if necessario to be elect how no sacramento if that i am president and do not make one meelion dolla in the one year you shall keek me on that side valgame dios denver got a cuban cigar maker to fix up a little cipher code with english and spanish words and gave the general a copy so we could cable him bulletins about the election or for more money and then we were ready to start general rompiro escorted us to the steamer on the pier he hugged denver around the waist and sobbed noble mans says he general rompiro propels you into his confidence and trust go in the hands of the saints to do the work for your friend viva la libertad sure says denver and viva la liberality an la soaperino and hoch der land of the lotus and the vote us don t worry general we ll have you elected as sure as bananas grow upside down make pictures on me pleads the general make pictures on me for money as it is needful does he want to be tattooed would you think asks denver wrinkling up his eyes stupid says i he wants you to draw on him for election expenses it ll be worse than tattooing more like an autopsy me and denver steamed down to panama and then hiked across the isthmus and then by steamer again down to the town of espiritu on the coast of the general s country that was a town to send j howard payne to the growler i ll tell you how you could make one like it take a lot of filipino huts and a couple of hundred brick kilns and arrange em in squares in a cemetery cart down all the conservatory plants in the astor and vanderbilt greenhouses and stick em about wherever there s room turn all the bellevue patients and the barbers convention and the tuskegee school loose in the streets and run the thermometer up to in the shade set a fringe of the rocky mountains around the rear let it rain and set the whole business on rockaway beach in the middle of january and you d have a good imitation of espiritu it took me and denver about a week to get acclimated denver sent out the letters the general had given him and notified the rest of the gang that there was something doing at the captain s office we set up headquarters in an old dobe house on a side street where the grass was waist high the election was only four weeks off but there wasn t any excitement the home candidate for president was named roadrickeys this town of esperitu wasn t the capital any more than cleveland ohio is the capital of the united states but it was the political centre where they cooked up revolutions and made up the slates at the end of the week denver says the machine is started running sully says he we ve got a walkover just because general rompiro ain t don juan on the spot the other crowd ain t at work they re as full of apathy as a territorial delegate during the chaplain s prayer now we want to introduce a little hot stuff in the way of campaigning and we ll surprise em at the polls how are you going to go about it i asks why the usual way says denver surprised we ll get the orators on our side out every night to make speeches in the native lingo and have torch light parades under the shade of the palms and free drinks and buy up all the brass bands of course and well i ll turn the baby kissing over to you sully i ve seen a lot of em what else says i why you know says denver we get the heelers out with the crackly two spots and coal tickets and orders for groceries and have a couple of picnics out under the banyan trees and dances in the firemen s hall and the usual things but first of all sully i m going to have the biggest clam bake down on the beach that was ever seen south of the tropic of capricorn i figured that out from the start we ll stuff the whole town and the jungle folk for miles around with clams that s the first thing on the programme suppose you go out now and make the arrangements for that i want to look over the estimates the general made of the vote in the coast districts i had learned some spanish in mexico so i goes out as denver says and in fifteen minutes i come back to headquarters if there ever was a clam in this country nobody ever saw it i says great sky rockets says denver with his mouth and eyes open no clams how in the who ever saw a country without clams what kind of a how s an election to be pulled off without a clam bake i d like to know are you sure there s no clams sully not even a can says i then for god s sake go out and try to find what the people here do eat we ve got to fill em up with grub of some kind i went out again denver was manager in half an hour i gets back they eat says i tortillas cassava carne de chivo arroz con pollo aquacates zapates yucca and huevos fritos a man that would eat them things says denver getting a little mad ought to have his vote challenged in a few more days the campaign managers from the other towns came sliding into esperitu our headquarters was a busy place we had an interpreter and ice water and drinks and cigars and denver flashed the general s roll so often that it got so small you couldn t have bought a republican vote in ohio with it and then denver cabled to general rompiro for ten thousand dollars more and got it there were a number of americans in esperitu but they were all in business or grafts of some kind and wouldn t take any hand in politics which was sensible enough but they showed me and denver a fine time and fixed us up so we could get decent things to eat and drink there was one american named hicks used to come and loaf at the headquarters hicks had had fourteen years of esperitu he was six feet four and weighed in at cocoa was his line and coast fever and the climate had taken all the life out of him they said he hadn t smiled in eight years his face was three feet long and it never moved except when he opened it to take quinine he used to sit in our headquarters and kill fleas and talk sarcastic i don t take much interest in politics says hicks one day but i d like you to tell me what you re trying to do down here galloway we re boosting general rompiro of course says denver we re going to put him in the presidential chair i m his manager well says hicks if i was you i d be a little slower about it you ve got a long time ahead of you you know not any longer than i need says denver denver went ahead and worked things smooth he dealt out money on the quiet to his lieutenants and they were always coming after it there was free drinks for everybody in town and bands playing every night and fireworks and there was a lot of heelers going around buying up votes day and night for the new style of politics in espiritu and everybody liked it the day set for the election was november th on the night before denver and me were smoking our pipes in headquarters and in comes hicks and unjoints himself and sits in a chair mournful denver is cheerful and confident rompiro will win in a romp says he we ll carry the country by it s all over but the vivas to morrow will tell the tale what s going to happen to morrow asks hicks why the presidential election of course says denver say says hicks looking kind of funny didn t anybody tell you fellows that the election was held a week before you came congress changed the date to july th roadrickeys was elected by i thought you was booming old rompiro for next term two years from now wondered if you was going to keep up such a hot lick that long i dropped my pipe on the floor denver bit the stem off of his neither of us said anything and then i heard a sound like somebody ripping a clap board off of a barn roof twas hicks laughing for the first time in eight years sully magoon paused while the waiter poured us a black coffee your friend was indeed something of a manager i said wait a minute said sully i haven t given you any idea of what he could do yet that s all to come when we got back to new york there was general rompiro waiting for us on the pier he was dancing like a cinnamon bear all impatient for the news for denver had just cabled him when we would arrive and nothing more am i elect he shouts am i elect friend of mine is that mine country have demanded general rompiro for the president the last dollar of mine have i sent you that last time it is necessario that i am elect i have not more money am i elect senor galloway denver turns to me leave me with old rompey sully he says i ve got to break it to him gently twould be indecent for other eyes to witness the operation this is the time sully says he when old denver has got to make good as a jollier and a silver tongued sorcerer or else give up all the medals he s earned a couple of days later i went around to the hotel there was denver in his old place looking like the hero of two historical novels and telling em what a fine time he d had down on his orange plantation in florida did you fix things up with the general i asks him did i says denver come and see he takes me by the arm and walks me to the dining room door there was a little chocolate brown fat man in a dress suit with his face shining with joy as he swelled himself and skipped about the floor danged if denver hadn t made general rompiro head waiter of the hotel brunswick is mr galloway still in the managing business i asked as mr magoon ceased sully shook his head denver married an auburn haired widow that owns a big hotel in harlem he just helps around the place whistling dick s christmas stocking it was with much caution that whistling dick slid back the door of the box car for article city ordinances authorized perhaps unconstitutionally arrest on suspicion and he was familiar of old with this ordinance so before climbing out he surveyed the field with all the care of a good general he saw no change since his last visit to this big alms giving long suffering city of the south the cold weather paradise of the tramps the levee where his freight car stood was pimpled with dark bulks of merchandise the breeze reeked with the well remembered sickening smell of the old tarpaulins that covered bales and barrels the dun river slipped along among the shipping with an oily gurgle far down toward chalmette he could see the great bend in the stream outlined by the row of electric lights across the river algiers lay a long irregular blot made darker by the dawn which lightened the sky beyond an industrious tug or two coming for some early sailing ship gave a few appalling toots that seemed to be the signal for breaking day the italian luggers were creeping nearer their landing laden with early vegetables and shellfish a vague roar subterranean in quality from dray wheels and street cars began to make itself heard and felt and the ferryboats the mary anns of water craft stirred sullenly to their menial morning tasks whistling dick s red head popped suddenly back into the car a sight too imposing and magnificent for his gaze had been added to the scene a vast incomparable policeman rounded a pile of rice sacks and stood within twenty yards of the car the daily miracle of the dawn now being performed above algiers received the flattering attention of this specimen of municipal official splendour he gazed with unbiased dignity at the faintly glowing colours until at last he turned to them his broad back as if convinced that legal interference was not needed and the sunrise might proceed unchecked so he turned his face to the rice bags and drawing a flat flask from an inside pocket he placed it to his lips and regarded the firmament whistling dick professional tramp possessed a half friendly acquaintance with this officer they had met several times before on the levee at night for the officer himself a lover of music had been attracted by the exquisite whistling of the shiftless vagabond still he did not care under the present circumstances to renew the acquaintance there is a difference between meeting a policeman on a lonely wharf and whistling a few operatic airs with him and being caught by him crawling out of a freight car so dick waited as even a new orleans policeman must move on some time perhaps it is a retributive law of nature and before long big fritz majestically disappeared between the trains of cars whistling dick waited as long as his judgment advised and then slid swiftly to the ground assuming as far as possible the air of an honest labourer who seeks his daily toil he moved across the network of railway lines with the intention of making his way by quiet girod street to a certain bench in lafayette square where according to appointment he hoped to rejoin a pal known as slick this adventurous pilgrim having preceded him by one day in a cattle car into which a loose slat had enticed him as whistling dick picked his way where night still lingered among the big reeking musty warehouses he gave way to the habit that had won for him his title subdued yet clear with each note as true and liquid as a bobolink s his whistle tinkled about the dim cold mountains of brick like drops of rain falling into a hidden pool he followed an air but it swam mistily into a swirling current of improvisation you could cull out the trill of mountain brooks the staccato of green rushes shivering above chilly lagoons the pipe of sleepy birds rounding a corner the whistler collided with a mountain of blue and brass so observed the mountain calmly you are already pack und dere vill not pe frost before two veeks yet und you haf forgotten how to vistle dere was a valse note in dot last bar watcher know about it said whistling dick with tentative familiarity you wit yer little gherman band nixcumrous chunes watcher know about music pick yer ears and listen agin here s de way i whistled it see he puckered his lips but the big policeman held up his hand shtop he said und learn der right way und learn also dot a rolling shtone can t vistle for a cent big fritz s heavy moustache rounded into a circle and from its depths came a sound deep and mellow as that from a flute he repeated a few bars of the air the tramp had been whistling the rendition was cold but correct and he emphasized the note he had taken exception to dot p is p natural und not p vlat py der vay you petter pe glad i meet you von hour later und i vould half to put you in a gage to vistle mit der chail pirds der orders are to bull all der pums after sunrise to which to

not so bad as der rest und pecause you gan visl der freisechutz bezzer dan i myself gan don t run against any more bolicemans aroundt der corners but go away from town a few tays good pye so madame orleans had at last grown weary of the strange and ruffled brood that came yearly to nestle beneath her charitable pinions after the big policeman had departed whistling dick stood for an irresolute minute feeling all the outraged indignation of a delinquent tenant who is ordered to vacate his premises he had pictured to himself a day of dreamful ease when he should have joined his pal a day of lounging on the wharf munching the bananas and cocoanuts scattered in unloading the fruit steamers and then a feast along the free lunch counters from which the easy going owners were too good natured or too generous to drive him away and afterward a pipe in one of the little flowery parks and a snooze in some shady corner of the wharf but here was a stern order to exile and one that he knew must be obeyed so with a wary eye open from the gleam of brass buttons he began his retreat toward a rural refuge a few days in the country need not necessarily prove disastrous beyond the possibility of a slight nip of frost there was no formidable evil to be looked for however it was with a depressed spirit that whistling dick passed the old french market on his chosen route down the river for safety s sake he still presented to the world his portrayal of the part of the worthy artisan on his way to labour a stall keeper in the market undeceived hailed him by the generic name of his ilk and jack halted taken by surprise the vender melted by this proof of his own acuteness bestowed a foot of frankfurter and half a loaf and thus the problem of breakfast was solved when the streets from topographical reasons began to shun the river bank the exile mounted to the top of the levee and on its well trodden path pursued his way the suburban eye regarded him with cold suspicion individuals reflected the stern spirit of the city s heartless edict he missed the seclusion of the crowded town and the safety he could always find in the multitude at chalmette six miles upon his desultory way there suddenly menaced him a vast and bewildering industry a new port was being established the dock was being built compresses were going up picks and shovels and barrows struck at him like serpents from every side an arrogant foreman bore down upon him estimating his muscles with the eye of a recruiting sergeant brown men and black men all about him were toiling away he fled in terror by noon he had reached the country of the plantations the great sad silent levels bordering the mighty river he overlooked fields of sugar cane so vast that their farthest limits melted into the sky the sugar making season was well advanced and the cutters were at work the waggons creaked drearily after them the negro teamsters inspired the mules to greater speed with mellow and sonorous imprecations dark green groves blurred by the blue of distance showed where the plantation houses stood the tall chimneys of the sugar mills caught the eye miles distant like lighthouses at sea at a certain point whistling dick s unerring nose caught the scent of frying fish like a pointer to a quail he made his way down the levee side straight to the camp of a credulous and ancient fisherman whom he charmed with song and story so that he dined like an admiral and then like a philosopher annihilated the worst three hours of the day by a nap under the trees when he awoke and again continued his hegira a frosty sparkle in the air had succeeded the drowsy warmth of the day and as this portent of a chilly night translated itself to the brain of sir peregrine he lengthened his stride and bethought him of shelter he travelled a road that faithfully followed the convolutions of the levee running along its base but whither he knew not bushes and rank grass crowded it to the wheel ruts and out of this ambuscade the pests of the lowlands swarmed after him humming a keen vicious soprano and as the night grew nearer although colder the whine of the mosquitoes became a greedy petulant snarl that shut out all other sounds to his right against the heavens he saw a green light moving and accompanying it the masts and funnels of a big incoming steamer moving as upon a screen at a magic lantern show and there were mysterious marshes at his left out of which came queer gurgling cries and a choked croaking the whistling vagrant struck up a merry warble to offset these melancholy influences and it is likely that never before since pan himself jigged it on his reeds had such sounds been heard in those depressing solitudes a distant clatter in the rear quickly developed into the swift beat of horses hoofs and whistling dick stepped aside into the dew wet grass to clear the track turning his head he saw approaching a fine team of stylish grays drawing a double surrey a stout man with a white moustache occupied the front seat giving all his attention to the rigid lines in his hands behind him sat a placid middle aged lady and a brilliant looking girl hardly arrived at young ladyhood the lap robe had slipped partly from the knees of the gentleman driving and whistling dick saw two stout canvas bags between his feet bags such as while loafing in cities he had seen warily transferred between express waggons and bank doors the remaining space in the vehicle was filled with parcels of various sizes and shapes as the surrey swept even with the sidetracked tramp the bright eyed girl seized by some merry madcap impulse leaned out toward him with a sweet dazzling smile and cried mer ry christ mas in a shrill plaintive treble such a thing had not often happened to whistling dick and he felt handicapped in devising the correct response but lacking time for reflection he let his instinct decide and snatching off his battered derby he rapidly extended it at arm s length and drew it back with a continuous motion and shouted a loud but ceremonious ah there after the flying surrey the sudden movement of the girl had caused one of the parcels to become unwrapped and something limp and black fell from it into the road the tramp picked it up and found it to be a new black silk stocking long and fine and slender it crunched crisply and yet with a luxurious softness between his fingers ther bloomin little skeezicks said whistling dick with a broad grin bisecting his freckled face w t d yer think of dat now mer ry chris mus sounded like a cuckoo clock da ts what she did dem guys is swells too bet yer life an der old un stacks dem sacks of dough down under his trotters like dey was common as dried apples been shoppin for chrismus and de kid s lost one of her new socks w ot she was goin to hold up santy wid de bloomin little skeezicks wit her mer ry chris mus w ot d yer t ink same as to say hello jack how goes it and as swell as fift av noo and as easy as a blowout in cincinnat whistling dick folded the stocking carefully and stuffed it into his pocket it was nearly two hours later when he came upon signs of habitation the buildings of an extensive plantation were brought into view by a turn in the road he easily selected the planter s residence in a large square building with two wings with numerous good sized well lighted windows and broad verandas running around its full extent it was set upon a smooth lawn which was faintly lit by the far reaching rays of the lamps within a noble grove surrounded it and old fashioned shrubbery grew thickly about the walks and fences the quarters of the hands and the mill buildings were situated at a distance in the rear the road was now enclosed on each side by a fence and presently as whistling dick drew nearer the house he suddenly stopped and sniffed the air if dere ain t a hobo stew cookin somewhere in dis immediate precint he said to himself me nose as quit tellin de trut without hesitation he climbed the fence to windward he found himself in an apparently disused lot where piles of old bricks were stacked and rejected decaying lumber in a corner he saw the faint glow of a fire that had become little more than a bed of living coals and he thought he could see some dim human forms sitting or lying about it he drew nearer and by the light of a little blaze that suddenly flared up he saw plainly the fat figure of a ragged man in an old brown sweater and cap dat man said whistling dick to himself softly is a dead ringer for boston harry i ll try him wit de high sign he whistled one or two bars of a rag time melody and the air was immediately taken up and then quickly ended with a peculiar run the first whistler walked confidently up to the fire the fat man looked up and spake in a loud asthmatic wheeze gents the unexpected but welcome addition to our circle is mr whistling dick an old friend of mine for whom i fully vouches the waiter will lay another cover at once mr w d will join us at supper during which function he will enlighten us in regard to the circumstances that gave us the pleasure of his company chewin de stuffin out n de dictionary as usual boston said whistling dick but t anks all de same for de invitashun i guess i finds meself here about de same way as yous guys a cop gimme de tip dis mornin yous workin on dis farm a guest said boston sternly shouldn t never insult his entertainers until he s filled up wid grub tain t good business sense workin but i will restrain myself we five me deaf pete blinky goggles and indiana tom got put on to this scheme of noo orleans to work visiting gentlemen upon her dirty streets and we hit the road last evening just as the tender hues of twilight had flopped down upon the daisies and things blinky pass the empty oyster can at your left to the empty gentleman at your right for the next ten minutes the gang of roadsters paid their undivided attention to the supper in an old five gallon kerosene can they had cooked a stew of potatoes meat and onions which they partook of from smaller cans they had found scattered about the vacant lot whistling dick had known boston harry of old and knew him to be one of the shrewdest and most successful of his brotherhood he looked like a prosperous stock drover or solid merchant from some country village he was stout and hale with a ruddy always smoothly shaven face his clothes were strong and neat and he gave special attention to his decent appearing shoes during the past ten years he had acquired a reputation for working a larger number of successfully managed confidence games than any of his acquaintances and he had not a day s work to be counted against him it was rumoured among his associates that he had saved a considerable amount of money the four other men were fair specimens of the slinking ill clad noisome genus who carried their labels of suspicious in plain view after the bottom of the large can had been scraped and pipes lit at the coals two of the men called boston aside and spake with him lowly and mysteriously he nodded decisively and then said aloud to whistling dick listen sonny to some plain talky talk we five are on a lay i ve guaranteed you to be square and you re to come in on the profits equal with the boys and you ve got to help two hundred hands on this plantation are expecting to be paid a week s wages to morrow morning to morrow s christmas and they want to lay off says the boss work from five to nine in the morning to get a train load of sugar off and i ll pay every man cash down for the week and a day extra they say hooray for the boss it goes he drives to noo orleans to day and fetches back the cold dollars two thousand and seventy four fifty is the amount i got the figures from a man who talks too much who got em from the bookkeeper the boss of this plantation thinks he s going to pay this wealth to the hands he s got it down wrong he s going to pay it to us it s going to stay in the leisure class where it belongs now half of this haul goes to me and the other half the rest of you may divide why the difference i represent the brains it s my scheme here s the way we re going to get it there s some company at supper in the house but they ll leave about nine they ve just happened in for an hour or so if they don t go pretty soon we ll work the scheme anyhow we want all night to get away good with the dollars they re heavy about nine o clock deaf pete and blinky ll go down the road about a quarter beyond the house and set fire to a big cane field there that the cutters haven t touched yet the wind s just right to have it roaring in two minutes the alarm ll be given and every man jack about the place will be down there in ten minutes fighting fire that ll leave the money sacks and the women alone in the house for us to handle you ve heard cane burn well there s mighty few women can screech loud enough to be heard above its crackling the thing s dead safe the only danger is in being caught before we can get far enough away with the money now if you boston interrupted whistling dick rising to his feet t anks for the grub yous fellers has given me but i ll be movin on now what do you mean asked boston also rising w y you can count me outer dis deal you oughter know that i m on de bum all right enough but dat other t ing don t go wit me burglary is no good i ll say good night and many t anks fer whistling dick had moved away a few steps as he spoke but he stopped very suddenly boston had covered him with a short revolver of roomy calibre take your seat said the tramp leader i d feel mighty proud of myself if i let you go and spoil the game you ll stick right in this camp until we finish the job the end of that brick pile is your limit you go two inches beyond that and i ll have to shoot better take it easy now it s my way of doin said whistling dick easy goes you can depress de muzzle of dat twelve incher and run er back on de trucks i remains as de newspapers says in yer midst all right said boston lowering his piece as the other returned and took his seat again on a projecting plank in a pile of timber don t try to leave that s all i wouldn t miss this chance even if i had to shoot an old acquaintance to make it go i don t want to hurt anybody specially but this thousand dollars i m going to get will fix me for fair i m going to drop the road and start a saloon in a little town i know about i m tired of being kicked around boston harry took from his pocket a cheap silver watch and held it near the fire it s a quarter to nine he said pete you and blinky start go down the road past the house and fire the cane in a dozen places then strike for the levee and come back on it instead of the road so you won t meet anybody by the time you get back the men will all be striking out for the fire and we ll break for the house and collar the dollars everybody cough up what matches he s got the two surly tramps made a collection of all the matches in the party whistling dick contributing his quota with propitiatory alacrity and then they departed in the dim starlight in the direction of the road of the three remaining vagrants two goggles and indiana tom reclined lazily upon convenient lumber and regarded whistling dick with undisguised disfavour boston observing that the dissenting recruit was disposed to remain peaceably relaxed a little of his vigilance whistling dick arose presently and strolled leisurely up and down keeping carefully within the territory assigned him dis planter chap he said pausing before boston harry w ot makes yer t ink he s got de tin in de house wit im i m advised of the facts in the case said boston he drove to noo orleans and got it i say to day want to change your mind now and come in naw i was just askin wot kind o team did de boss drive pair of grays double surrey yep women folks along wife and kid say what morning paper are you trying to pump news for i was just conversin to pass de time away i guess dat team passed me in de road dis evenin dat s all as whistling dick put his hands in his pockets and continued his curtailed beat up and down by the fire he felt the silk stocking he had picked up in the road ther bloomin little skeezicks he muttered with a grin as he walked up and down he could see through a sort of natural opening or lane among the trees the planter s residence some seventy five yards distant the side of the house toward him exhibited spacious well lighted windows through which a soft radiance streamed illuminating the broad veranda and some extent of the lawn beneath what s that you said asked boston sharply oh nuttin t all said whistling dick lounging carelessly and kicking meditatively at a little stone on the ground just as easy continued the warbling vagrant softly to himself an sociable an swell an sassy wit her mer ry chris mus wot d yer t ink now dinner two hours late was being served in the bellemeade plantation dining room the dining room and all its appurtenances spoke of an old regime that was here continued rather than suggested to the memory the plate was rich to the extent that its age and quaintness alone saved it from being showy there were interesting names signed in the corners of the pictures on the walls the viands were of the kind that bring a shine into the eyes of gourmets the service was swift silent lavish as in the days when the waiters were assets like the plate the names by which the planter s family and their visitors addressed one another were historic in the annals of two nations their manners and conversation had that most difficult kind of ease the kind that still preserves punctilio the planter himself seemed to be the dynamo that generated the larger portion of the gaiety and wit the younger ones at the board found it more than difficult to turn back on him his guns of raillery and banter it is true the young men attempted to storm his works repeatedly incited by the hope of gaining the approbation of their fair companions but even when they sped a well aimed shaft the planter forced them to feel defeat by the tremendous discomfiting thunder of the laughter with which he accompanied his retorts at the head of the table serene matronly benevolent reigned the mistress of the house placing here and there the right smile the right word the encouraging glance the talk of the party was too desultory too evanescent to follow but at last they came to the subject of the tramp nuisance one that had of late vexed the plantations for many miles around the planter seized the occasion to direct his good natured fire of raillery at the mistress accusing her of encouraging the plague they swarm up and down the river every winter he said they overrun new orleans and we catch the surplus which is generally the worst part and a day or two ago madame new orleans suddenly discovering that she can t go shopping without brushing her skirts against great rows of the vagabonds sunning themselves on the banquettes says to the police catch em all and the police catch a dozen or two and the remaining three or four thousand overflow up and down the levee and madame there pointing tragically with the carving knife at her feeds them they won t work they defy my overseers and they make friends with my dogs and you madame feed them before my eyes and intimidate me when i would interfere tell us please how many to day did you thus incite to future laziness and depredation six i think said madame with a reflective smile but you know two of them offered to work for you heard them yourself the planter s disconcerting laugh rang out again yes at their own trades and one was an artificial flower maker and the other a glass blower oh they were looking for work not a hand would they consent to lift to labour of any other kind and another one continued the soft hearted mistress used quite good language it was really extraordinary for one of his class and he carried a watch and had lived in boston i don t believe they are all bad they have always seemed to me to rather lack development i always look upon them as children with whom wisdom has remained at a standstill while whiskers have continued to grow we passed one this evening as we were driving home who had a face as good as it was incompetent he was whistling the intermezzo from cavalleria and blowing the spirit of mascagni himself into it a bright eyed young girl who sat at the left of the mistress leaned over and said in a confidential undertone i wonder mamma if that tramp we passed on the road found my stocking and do you think he will hang it up to night now i can hang up but one do you know why i wanted a new pair of silk stockings when i have plenty well old aunt judy says if you hang up two that have never been worn santa claus will fill one with good things and monsieur pambe will place in the other payment for all the words you have spoken good or bad on the day before christmas that s why i ve been unusually nice and polite to everyone to day monsieur pambe you know is a witch gentleman he the words of the young girl were interrupted by a startling thing like the wraith of some burned out shooting star a black streak came crashing through the window pane and upon the table where it shivered into fragments a dozen pieces of crystal and china ware and then glanced between the heads of the guests to the wall imprinting therein a deep round indentation at which to day the visitor to bellemeade marvels as he gazes upon it and listens to this tale as it is told the women screamed in many keys and the men sprang to their feet and would have laid their hands upon their swords had not the verities of chronology forbidden the planter was the first to act he sprang to the intruding missile and held it up to view by jupiter he cried a meteoric shower of hosiery has communication at last been established with mars i should say ahem venus ventured a young gentleman visitor looking hopefully for approbation toward the unresponsive young lady visitors the planter held at arm s length the unceremonious visitor a long dangling black stocking it s loaded he announced as he spoke he reversed the stocking holding it by the toe and down from it dropped a roundish stone wrapped about by a piece of yellowish paper now for the first interstellar message of the century he cried and nodding to the company who had crowded about him he adjusted his glasses with provoking deliberation and examined it closely when he finished he had changed from the jolly host to the practical decisive man of business he immediately struck a bell and said to the silent footed mulatto man who responded go and tell mr wesley to get reeves and maurice and about ten stout hands they can rely upon and come to the hall door at once tell him to have the men arm themselves and bring plenty of ropes and plough lines tell him to hurry and then he read aloud from the paper these words to the gent of de hous dere is five tuff hoboes xcept meself in the vaken lot near de road war de old brick piles is

and den sen a relefe core to get me out of soke youres truly whistlen dick there was some quiet but rapid mavoeuvring at bellemeade during the ensuring half hour which ended in five disgusted and sullen tramps being captured and locked securely in an outhouse pending the coming of the morning and retribution for another result the visiting young gentlemen had secured the unqualified worship of the visiting young ladies by their distinguished and heroic conduct for still another behold whistling dick the hero seated at the planter s table feasting upon viands his experience had never before included and waited upon by admiring femininity in shapes of such beauty and swellness that even his ever full mouth could scarcely prevent him from whistling he was made to disclose in detail his adventure with the evil gang of boston harry and how he cunningly wrote the note and wrapped it around the stone and placed it at the toe of the stocking and watching his chance sent it silently with a wonderful centrifugal momentum like a comet at one of the big lighted windows of the dining room the planter vowed that the wanderer should wander no more that his was a goodness and an honesty that should be rewarded and that a debt of gratitude had been made that must be paid for had he not saved them from a doubtless imminent loss and maybe a greater calamity he assured whistling dick that he might consider himself a charge upon the honour of bellemeade that a position suited to his powers would be found for him at once and hinted that the way would be heartily smoothed for him to rise to as high places of emolument and trust as the plantation afforded but now they said he must be weary and the immediate thing to consider was rest and sleep so the mistress spoke to a servant and whistling dick was conducted to a room in the wing of the house occupied by the servants to this room in a few minutes was brought a portable tin bathtub filled with water which was placed on a piece of oiled cloth upon the floor there the vagrant was left to pass the night by the light of a candle he examined the room a bed with the covers neatly turned back revealed snowy pillows and sheets a worn but clean red carpet covered the floor there was a dresser with a beveled mirror a washstand with a flowered bowl and pitcher the two or three chairs were softly upholstered a little table held books papers and a day old cluster of roses in a jar there were towels on a rack and soap in a white dish whistling dick set his candle on a chair and placed his hat carefully under the table after satisfying what we must suppose to have been his curiosity by a sober scrutiny he removed his coat folded it and laid it upon the floor near the wall as far as possible from the unused bathtub taking his coat for a pillow he stretched himself luxuriously upon the carpet when on christmas morning the first streaks of dawn broke above the marshes whistling dick awoke and reached instinctively for his hat then he remembered that the skirts of fortune had swept him into their folds on the night previous and he went to the window and raised it to let the fresh breath of the morning cool his brow and fix the yet dream like memory of his good luck within his brain as he stood there certain dread and ominous sounds pierced the fearful hollow of his ear the force of plantation workers eager to complete the shortened task allotted to them were all astir the mighty din of the ogre labour shook the earth and the poor tattered and forever disguised prince in search of his fortune held tight to the window sill even in the enchanted castle and trembled already from the bosom of the mill came the thunder of rolling barrels of sugar and prison like sounds there was a great rattling of chains as the mules were harried with stimulant imprecations to their places by the waggon tongues a little vicious dummy engine with a train of flat cars in tow stewed and fumed on the plantation tap of the narrow gauge railroad and a toiling hurrying hallooing stream of workers were dimly seen in the half darkness loading the train with the weekly output of sugar here was a poem an epic nay a tragedy with work the curse of the world for its theme the december air was frosty but the sweat broke out upon whistling dick s face he thrust his head out of the window and looked down fifteen feet below him against the wall of the house he could make out that a border of flowers grew and by that token he overhung a bed of soft earth softly as a burglar goes he clambered out upon the sill lowered himself until he hung by his hands alone and then dropped safely no one seemed to be about upon this side of the house he dodged low and skimmed swiftly across the yard to the low fence it was an easy matter to vault this for a terror urged him such as lifts the gazelle over the thorn bush when the lion pursues a crash through the dew drenched weeds on the roadside a clutching slippery rush up the grassy side of the levee to the footpath at the summit and he was free the east was blushing and brightening the wind himself a vagrant rover saluted his brother upon the cheek some wild geese high above gave cry a rabbit skipped along the path before him free to turn to the right or to the left as his mood should send him the river slid past and certainly no one could tell the ultimate abiding place of its waters a small ruffled brown breasted bird sitting upon a dog wood sapling began a soft throaty tender little piping in praise of the dew which entices foolish worms from their holes but suddenly he stopped and sat with his head turned sidewise listening from the path along the levee there burst forth a jubilant stirring buoyant thrilling whistle loud and keen and clear as the cleanest notes of the piccolo the soaring sound rippled and trilled and arpeggioed as the songs of wild birds do not but it had a wild free grace that in a way reminded the small brown bird of something familiar but exactly what he could not tell there was in it the bird call or reveille that all birds know but a great waste of lavish unmeaning things that art had added and arranged besides and that were quite puzzling and strange and the little brown bird sat with his head on one side until the sound died away in the distance the little bird did not know that the part of that strange warbling that he understood was just what kept the warbler without his breakfast but he knew very well that the part he did not understand did not concern him so he gave a little flutter of his wings and swooped down like a brown bullet upon a big fat worm that was wriggling along the levee path the halberdier of the little rheinschloss i go sometimes into the bierhalle and restaurant called old munich not long ago it was a resort of interesting bohemians but now only artists and musicians and literary folk frequent it but the pilsner is yet good and i take some diversion from the conversation of waiter no for many years the customers of old munich have accepted the place as a faithful copy from the ancient german town the big hall with its smoky rafters rows of imported steins portrait of goethe and verses painted on the walls translated into german from the original of the cincinnati poets seems atmospherically correct when viewed through the bottom of a glass but not long ago the proprietors added the room above called it the little rheinschloss and built in a stairway up there was an imitation stone parapet ivy covered and the walls were painted to represent depth and distance with the rhine winding at the base of the vineyarded slopes and the castle of ehrenbreitstein looming directly opposite the entrance of course there were tables and chairs and you could have beer and food brought you as you naturally would on the top of a castle on the rhine i went into old munich one afternoon when there were few customers and sat at my usual table near the stairway i was shocked and almost displeased to perceive that the glass cigar case by the orchestra stand had been smashed to smithereens i did not like things to happen in old munich nothing had ever happened there before waiter no came and breathed on my neck i was his by right of discovery eighteen s brain was built like a corral it was full of ideas which when he opened the gate came huddling out like a flock of sheep that might get together afterward or might not i did not shine as a shepherd as a type eighteen fitted nowhere i did not find out if he had a nationality family creed grievance hobby soul preference home or vote he only came always to my table and as long as his leisure would permit let words flutter from him like swallows leaving a barn at daylight how did the cigar case come to be broken eighteen i asked with a certain feeling of personal grievance i can tell you about that sir said he resting his foot on the chair next to mine did you ever have anybody hand you a double handful of good luck while both your hands were full of bad luck and stop to notice how your fingers behaved no riddles eighteen said i leave out palmistry and manicuring you remember said eighteen the guy in the hammered brass prince albert and the oroide gold pants and the amalgamated copper hat that carried the combination meat axe ice pick and liberty pole and used to stand on the first landing as you go up to the little rindslosh why yes said i the halberdier i never noticed him particularly i remember he thought he was only a suit of armour he had a perfect poise he had more than that said eighteen he was me friend he was an advertisement the boss hired him to stand on the stairs for a kind of scenery to show there was something doing in the has been line upstairs what did you call him a what kind of beer a halberdier said i that was an ancient man at arms of many hundred years ago some mistake said eighteen this one wasn t that old he wasn t over twenty three or four it was the boss s idea rigging a man up in an ante bellum suit of tinware and standing him on the landing of the slosh he bought the goods at a fourth avenue antique store and hung a sign out able bodied hal halberdier wanted costume furnished the same morning a young man with wrecked good clothes and a hungry look comes in bringing the sign with him i was filling the mustard pots at my station i m it says he whatever it is but i never halberdiered in a restaurant put me on is it a masquerade i hear talk in the kitchen of a fishball says i bully for you eighteen says he you and i ll get on show me the boss s desk well the boss tries the harveyized pajamas on him and they fitted him like the scales on a baked redsnapper and he gets the job you ve seen what it is he stood straight up in the corner of the first landing with his halberd to his shoulder looking right ahead and guarding the portugals of the castle the boss is nutty about having the true old world flavour to his joint halberdiers goes with rindsloshes says he just as rats goes with rathskellers and white cotton stockings with tyrolean villages the boss is a kind of a antiologist and is all posted up on data and such information from p m to two in the morning was the halberdier s hours he got two meals with us help and a dollar an night i eat with him at the table he liked me he never told his name he was travelling impromptu like kings i guess the first time at supper i says to him have some more of the spuds mr frelinghuysen oh don t be so formal and offish eighteen says he call me hal that s short for halberdier oh don t think i wanted to pry for names says i i know all about the dizzy fall from wealth and greatness we ve got a count washing dishes in the kitchen and the third bartender used to be a pullman conductor and they work sir percival says i sarcastic eighteen says he as a friendly devil in a cabbage scented hell would you mind cutting up this piece of steak for me i don t say that it s got more muscle than i have but and then he shows me the insides of his hands they was blistered and cut and corned and swelled up till they looked like a couple of flank steaks criss crossed with a knife the kind the butchers hide and take home knowing what is the best shoveling coal says he and piling bricks and loading drays but they gave out and i had to resign i was born for a halberdier and i ve been educated for twenty four years to fill the position now quit knocking my profession and pass along a lot more of that ham i m holding the closing exercises says he of a forty eight hour fast the second night he was on the job he walks down from his corner to the cigar case and calls for cigarettes the customers at the tables all snicker out loud to show their acquaintance with history the boss is on an let s see oh yes an anachronism says the boss cigarettes was not made at the time when halberdiers was invented the ones you sell was says sir percival caporal wins from chronology by the length of a cork tip so he gets em and lights one and puts the box in his brass helmet and goes back to patroling the rindslosh he made a big hit specially with the ladies some of em would poke him

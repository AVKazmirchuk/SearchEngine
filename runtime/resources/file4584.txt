ve been away too i saw a package of peppermint pepsin in your place the other day i was going to tell you all about it said miss bates if you hadn t interrupted me of course you know about maggie brown who stops here well she s worth she lives in jersey in a ten dollar flat she s always got more cash on hand than half a dozen business candidates for vice president i don t know whether she carries it in her stocking or not but i know she s mighty popular down in the part of town where they worship the golden calf well about two weeks ago mrs brown stops at the door and rubbers at me for ten minutes i m sitting with my side to her striking off some manifold copies of a copper mine proposition for a nice old man from tonopah but i always see everything all around me when i m hard at work i can see things through my side combs and i can leave one button unbuttoned in the back of my shirtwaist and see who s behind me i didn t look around because i make from eighteen to twenty dollars a week and i didn t have to that evening at knocking off time she sends for me to come up to her apartment i expected to have to typewrite about two thousand words of notes of hand liens and contracts with a ten cent tip in sight but i went well man i was certainly surprised old maggie brown had turned human child says she you re the most beautiful creature i ever saw in my life i want you to quit your work and come and live with me i ve no kith or kin says she except a husband and a son or two and i hold no communication with any of em they re extravagant burdens on a hard working woman i want you to be a daughter to me they say i m stingy and mean and the papers print lies about my doing my own cooking and washing it s a lie she goes on i put my washing out except the handkerchiefs and stockings and petticoats and collars and light stuff like that i ve got forty million dollars in cash and stocks and bonds that are as negotiable as standard oil preferred at a church fair i m a lonely old woman and i need companionship you re the most beautiful human being i ever saw says she will you come and live with me i ll show em whether i can spend money or not she says well man what would you have done of course i fell to it and to tell you the truth i began to like old maggie it wasn t all on account of the forty millions and what she could do for me i was kind of lonesome in the world too everybody s got to have somebody they can explain to about the pain in their left shoulder and how fast patent leather shoes wear out when they begin to crack and you can t talk about such things to men you meet in hotels they re looking for just such openings so i gave up my job in the hotel and went with mrs brown i certainly seemed to have a mash on her she d look at me for half an hour at a time when i was sitting reading or looking at the magazines one time i says to her do i remind you of some deceased relative or friend of your childhood mrs brown i ve noticed you give me a pretty good optical inspection from time to time you have a face she says exactly like a dear friend of mine the best friend i ever had but i like you for yourself child too she says and say man what do you suppose she did loosened up like a marcel wave in the surf at coney she took me to a swell dressmaker and gave her a la carte to fit me out money no object they were rush orders and madame locked the front door and put the whole force to work then we moved to where do you think no guess again that s right the hotel bonton we had a six room apartment and it cost a day i saw the bill i began to love that old lady and then man when my dresses began to come in oh i won t tell you about em you couldn t understand and i began to call her aunt maggie you ve read about cinderella of course well what cinderella said when the prince fitted that a on her foot was a hard luck story compared to the things i told myself then aunt maggie says she is going to give me a coming out banquet in the bonton that ll make moving vans of all the old dutch families on fifth avenue i ve been out before aunt maggie says i but i ll come out again but you know says i that this is one of the swellest hotels in the city and you know pardon me that it s hard to get a bunch of notables together unless you ve trained for it don t fret about that child says aunt maggie i don t send out invitations i issue orders i ll have fifty guests here that couldn t be brought together again at any reception unless it were given by king edward or william travers jerome they are men of course and all of em either owe me money or intend to some of their wives won t come but a good many will well i wish you could have been at that banquet the dinner service was all gold and cut glass there were about forty men and eight ladies present besides aunt maggie and i you d never have known the third richest woman in the world she had on a new black silk dress with so much passementerie on it that it sounded exactly like a hailstorm i heard once when i was staying all night with a girl that lived in a top floor studio and my dress say man i can t waste the words on you it was all hand made lace where there was any of it at all and it cost i saw the bill the men were all bald headed or white whiskered and they kept up a running fire of light repartee about per cents and bryan and the cotton crop on the left of me was something that talked like a banker and on my right was a young fellow who said he was a newspaper artist he was the only well i was going to tell you after the dinner was over mrs brown and i went up to the apartment we had to squeeze our way through a mob of reporters all the way through the halls that s one of the things money does for you say do you happen to know a newspaper artist named lathrop a tall man with nice eyes and an easy way of talking no i don t remember what paper he works on well all right when we got upstairs mrs brown telephones for the bill right away it came and it was i saw the bill aunt maggie fainted i got her on a lounge and opened the bead work child says she when she got back to the world what was it a raise of rent or an income tax just a little dinner says i nothing to worry about hardly a drop in the bucket shop sit up and take notice a dispossess notice if there s no other kind but say man do you know what aunt maggie did she got cold feet she hustled me out of that hotel bonton at nine the next morning we went to a rooming house on the lower west side she rented one room that had water on the floor below and light on the floor above after we got moved all you could see in the room was about worth of new swell dresses and a one burner gas stove aunt maggie had had a sudden attack of the hedges i guess everybody has got to go on a spree once in their life a man spends his on highballs and a woman gets woozy on clothes but with forty million dollars say i d like to have a picture of but speaking of pictures did you ever run across a newspaper artist named lathrop a tall oh i asked you that before didn t i he was mighty nice to me at the dinner his voice just suited me i guess he must have thought i was to inherit some of aunt maggie s money well mr man three days of that light housekeeping was plenty for me aunt maggie was affectionate as ever she d hardly let me get out of her sight but let me tell you she was a hedger from hedgersville hedger county seventy five cents a day was the limit she set we cooked our own meals in the room there i was with a thousand dollars worth of the latest things in clothes doing stunts over a one burner gas stove as i say on the third day i flew the coop i couldn t stand for throwing together a fifteen cent kidney stew while wearing at the same time a house dress with valenciennes lace insertion so i goes into the closet and puts on the cheapest dress mrs brown had bought for me it s the one i ve got on now not so bad for is it i d left all my own clothes in my sister s flat in brooklyn mrs brown formerly aunt maggie says i to her i m going to extend my feet alternately one after the other in such a manner and direction that this tenement will recede from me in the quickest possible time i am no worshipper of money says i but there are some things i can t stand i can stand the fabulous monster that i ve read about that blows hot birds and cold bottles with the same breath but i can t stand a quitter says i they say you ve got forty million dollars well you ll never have any less and i was beginning to like you too says i well the late aunt maggie kicks till the tears flow she offers to move into a swell room with a two burner stove and running water i ve spent an awful lot of money child says she we ll have to economize for a while you re the most beautiful creature i ever laid eyes on she says and i don t want you to leave me well you see me don t you i walked straight to the acropolis and asked for my job back and i got it how did you say your writings were getting along i know you ve lost out some by not having me to type em do you ever have em illustrated and by the way did you ever happen to know a newspaper artist oh shut up i know i asked you before i wonder what paper he works on it s funny but i couldn t help thinking that he wasn t thinking about the money he might have been thinking i was thinking i d get from old maggie brown if i only knew some of the newspaper editors i d the sound of an easy footstep came from the doorway ida bates saw who it was with her back hair comb i saw her turn pink perfect statue that she was a miracle that i share with pygmalion only am i excusable she said to me adorable petitioner that she became it s it s mr lathrop i wonder if it really wasn t the money i wonder if after all he of course i was invited to the wedding after the ceremony i dragged lathrop aside you are an artist said i and haven t figured out why maggie brown conceived such a strong liking for miss bates that was let me show you the bride wore a simple white dress as beautifully draped as the costumes of the ancient greeks i took some leaves from one of the decorative wreaths in the little parlour and made a chaplet of them and placed them on nee bates shining chestnut hair and made her turn her profile to her husband by jingo said he isn t ida a dead ringer for the lady s head on the silver dollar next to reading matter he compelled my interest as he stepped from the ferry at desbrosses street he had the air of being familiar with hemispheres and worlds and of entering new york as the lord of a demesne who revisited it in after years of absence but i thought that with all his air he had never before set foot on the slippery cobblestones of the city of too many caliphs he wore loose clothes of a strange bluish drab colour and a conservative round panama hat without the cock a loop indentations and cants with which northern fanciers disfigure the tropic head gear moreover he was the homeliest man i have ever seen his ugliness was less repellent than startling arising from a sort of lincolnian ruggedness and irregularity of feature that spellbound you with wonder and dismay so may have looked afrites or the shapes metamorphosed from the vapour of the fisherman s vase as he afterward told me his name was judson tate and he may as well be called so at once he wore his green silk tie through a topaz ring and he carried a cane made of the vertebrae of a shark judson tate accosted me with some large and casual inquiries about the city s streets and hotels in the manner of one who had but for the moment forgotten the trifling details i could think of no reason for disparaging my own quiet hotel in the downtown district so the mid morning of the night found us already victualed and drinked at my expense and ready to be chaired and tobaccoed in a quiet corner of the lobby there was something on judson tate s mind and such as it was he tried to convey it to me already he had accepted me as his friend and when i looked at his great snuff brown first mate s hand with which he brought emphasis to his periods within six inches of my nose i wondered if by any chance he was as sudden in conceiving enmity against strangers when this man began to talk i perceived in him a certain power his voice was a persuasive instrument upon which he played with a somewhat specious but effective art he did not try to make you forget his ugliness he flaunted it in your face and made it part of the charm of his speech shutting your eyes you would have trailed after this rat catcher s pipes at least to the walls of hamelin beyond that you would have had to be more childish to follow but let him play his own tune to the words set down so that if all is too dull the art of music may bear the blame women said judson tate are mysterious creatures my spirits sank i was not there to listen to such a world old hypothesis to such a time worn long ago refuted bald feeble illogical vicious patent sophistry to an ancient baseless wearisome ragged unfounded insidious falsehood originated by women themselves and by them insinuated foisted thrust spread and ingeniously promulgated into the ears of mankind by underhanded secret and deceptive methods for the purpose of augmenting furthering and reinforcing their own charms and designs oh i don t know said i vernacularly have you ever heard of oratama he asked possibly i answered i seem to recall a toe dancer or a suburban addition or was it a perfume of some such name it is a town said judson tate on the coast of a foreign country of which you know nothing and could understand less it is a country governed by a dictator and controlled by revolutions and insubordination it was there that a great life drama was played with judson tate the homeliest man in america and fergus mcmahan the handsomest adventurer in history or fiction and senorita anabela zamora the beautiful daughter of the alcalde of oratama as chief actors and another thing nowhere else on the globe except in the department of trienta y tres in uruguay does the chuchula plant grow the products of the country i speak of are valuable woods dyestuffs gold rubber ivory and cocoa i was not aware said i that south america produced any ivory there you are twice mistaken said judson tate distributing the words over at least an octave of his wonderful voice i did not say that the country i spoke of was in south america i must be careful my dear man i have been in politics there you know but even so i have played chess against its president with a set carved from the nasal bones of the tapir one of our native specimens of the order of perissodactyle ungulates inhabiting the cordilleras which was as pretty ivory as you would care to see but is was of romance and adventure and the ways of women that was i going to tell you and not of zoological animals for fifteen years i was the ruling power behind old sancho benavides the royal high thumbscrew of the republic you ve seen his picture in the papers a mushy black man with whiskers like the notes on a swiss music box cylinder and a scroll in his right hand like the ones they write births on in the family bible well that chocolate potentate used to be the biggest item of interest anywhere between the colour line and the parallels of latitude it was three throws horses whether he was to wind up in the hall of fame or the bureau of combustibles he d have been sure called the roosevelt of the southern continent if it hadn t been that grover cleveland was president at the time he d hold office a couple of terms then he d sit out for a hand always after appointing his own successor for the interims but it was not benavides the liberator who was making all this fame for himself not him it was judson tate benavides was only the chip over the bug i gave him the tip when to declare war and increase import duties and wear his state trousers but that wasn t what i wanted to tell you how did i get to be it i ll tell you because i m the most gifted talker that ever made vocal sounds since adam first opened his eyes pushed aside the smelling salts and asked where am i as you observe i am about the ugliest man you ever saw outside the gallery of photographs of the new england early christian scientists so at an early age i perceived that what i lacked in looks i must make up in eloquence that i ve done i get what i go after as the back stop and still small voice of old benavides i made all the great historical powers behind the throne such as talleyrand mrs de pompadour and loeb look as small as the minority report of a duma i could talk nations into or out of debt harangue armies to sleep on the battlefield reduce insurrections inflammations taxes appropriations or surpluses with a few words and call up the dogs of war or the dove of peace with the same bird like whistle beauty and epaulettes and curly moustaches and grecian profiles in other men were never in my way when people first look at me they shudder unless they are in the last stages of angina pectoris they are mine in ten minutes after i begin to talk women and men i win em as they come now you wouldn t think women would fancy a man with a face like mine would you oh yes mr tate said i history is bright and fiction dull with homely men who have charmed women there seems pardon me interrupted judson tate but you don t quite understand you have yet to hear my story fergus mcmahan was a friend of mine in the capital for a handsome man i ll admit he was the duty free merchandise he had blond curls and laughing blue eyes and was featured regular they said he was a ringer for the statue they call herr mees the god of speech and eloquence resting in some museum at rome some german anarchist i suppose they are always resting and talking but fergus was no talker he was brought up with the idea that to be beautiful was to make good his conversation was about as edifying as listening to a leak dropping in a tin dish pan at the head of the bed when you want to go to sleep but he and me got to be friends maybe because we was so opposite don t you think looking at the hallowe en mask that i call my face when i m shaving seemed to give fergus pleasure and i m sure that whenever i heard the feeble output of throat noises that he called conversation i felt contented to be a gargoyle with a silver tongue one time i found it necessary to go down to this coast town of oratama to straighten out a lot of political unrest and chop off a few heads in the customs and military departments fergus who owned the ice and sulphur match concessions of the republic says he ll keep me company so in a jangle of mule train bells we gallops into oratama and the town belonged to us as much as long island sound doesn t belong to japan when t r is at oyster bay i say us but i mean me everybody for four nations two oceans one bay and isthmus and five archipelagoes around had heard of judson tate gentleman adventurer they called me i had been written up in five columns of the yellow journals words with marginal decorations in a monthly magazine and a stickful on the twelfth page of the new york times if the beauty of fergus mcmahan gained any part of our reception in oratama i ll eat the price tag in my panama it was me that they hung out paper flowers and palm branches for i am not a jealous man i am stating facts the people were nebuchadnezzars they bit the grass before me there was no dust in the town for them to bite they bowed down to judson tate they knew that i was the power behind sancho benavides a word from me was more to them than a whole deckle edged library from east aurora in sectional bookcases was from anybody else and yet there are people who spend hours fixing their faces rubbing in cold cream and massaging the muscles always toward the eyes and taking in the slack with tincture of benzoin and electrolyzing moles to what end looking handsome oh what a mistake it s the larynx that the beauty doctors ought to work on it s words more than warts talk more than talcum palaver more than powder blarney more than bloom that counts the phonograph instead of the photograph but i was going to tell you the local astors put me and fergus up at the centipede club a frame building built on posts sunk in the surf the tide s only nine inches the little big high low jack in the game of the town came around and kowtowed oh it wasn t to herr mees they had heard about judson tate one afternoon me and fergus mcmahan was sitting on the seaward gallery of the centipede drinking iced rum and talking judson says fergus there s an angel in oratama so long says i as it ain t gabriel why talk as if you had heard a trump blow it s the senorita anabela zamora says fergus she s she s she s as lovely as as hell bravo says i laughing heartily you have a true lover s eloquence to paint the beauties of your inamorata you remind me says i of faust s wooing of marguerite that is if he wooed her after he went down the trap door of the stage judson says fergus you know you are as beautiless as a rhinoceros you can t have any interest in women i m awfully gone in miss anabela and that s why i m telling you oh seguramente says i i know i have a front elevation like an aztec god that guards a buried treasure that never did exist in jefferson county yucatan but there are compensations for instance i am it in this country as far as the eye can reach and then a few perches and poles and again says i when i engage people in a set to of oral vocal and laryngeal utterances i do not usually confine my side of the argument to what may be likened to a cheap phonographic reproduction of the ravings of a jellyfish oh i know says fergus amiable that i m not handy at small talk or large either that s why i m telling you i want you to help me how can i do it i asked i have subsidized says fergus the services of senorita anabela s duenna whose name is francesca you have a reputation in this country judson says fergus of being a great man and a hero i have says i and i deserve it and i says fergus am the best looking man between the arctic circle and antarctic ice pack with limitations says i as to physiognomy and geography i freely concede you to be between the two of us says fergus we ought to land the senorita anabela zamora the lady as you know is of an old spanish family and further than looking at her driving in the family carruaje of afternoons around the plaza or catching a glimpse of her through a barred window of evenings she is as unapproachable as a star land her for which one of us says i for me of course says fergus you ve never seen her now i ve had francesca point me out to her as being you on several occasions when she sees me on the plaza she thinks she s looking at don judson tate the greatest hero statesman and romantic figure in the country with your reputation and my looks combined in one man how can she resist him she s heard all about your thrilling history of course and she s seen me can any woman want more asks fergus mcmahan can she do with less i ask how can we separate our mutual attractions and how shall we apportion the proceeds then fergus tells me his scheme the house of the alcalde don luis zamora he says has a patio of course a kind of inner courtyard opening from the street in an angle of it is his daughter s window as dark a place as you could find and what do you think he wants me to do why knowing my freedom charm and skilfulness of tongue he proposes that i go into the patio at midnight when the hobgoblin face of me cannot be seen and make love to her for him for the pretty man that she has seen on the plaza thinking him to be don judson tate why shouldn t i do it for him for my friend fergus mcmahan for him to ask me was a compliment an acknowledgment of his own shortcomings you little lily white fine haired highly polished piece of dumb sculpture says i i ll help you make your arrangements and get me in the dark outside her window and my stream of conversation opened up with the moonlight tremolo stop turned on and she s yours keep your face hid jud says fergus for heaven s sake keep your face hid i m a friend of yours in all kinds of sentiment but this is a business deal if i could talk i wouldn t ask you but seeing me and listening to you i don t see why she can t be landed by you says i by me says fergus well fergus and the duenna francesca attended to the details and one night they fetched me a long black cloak with a high collar and led me to the house at midnight i stood by the window in the patio until i heard a voice as soft and sweet as an angel s whisper on the other side of the bars i could see only a faint white clad shape inside and true to fergus i pulled the collar of my cloak high up for it was july in the wet seasons and the nights were chilly and smothering a laugh as i thought of the tongue tied fergus i began to talk well sir i talked an hour at the senorita anabela i say at because it was not with now and then she would say oh senor or now ain t you foolin or i know you don t mean that and such things as women will when they are being rightly courted both of us knew english and spanish so in two languages i tried to win the heart of the lady for my friend fergus but for the bars to the window i could have done it in one at the end of the hour she dismissed me and gave me a big red rose i handed it over to fergus when i got home for three weeks every third or fourth night i impersonated my friend in the patio at the window of senorita anabela at last she admitted that her heart was mine and spoke of having seen me every afternoon when she drove in the plaza it was fergus she had seen of course but it was my talk that won her suppose fergus had gone there and tried to make a hit in the dark with his beauty all invisible and not a word to say for himself on the last night she promised to be mine that is fergus s and she put her hand between the bars for me to kiss i bestowed the kiss and took the news to fergus you might have left that for me to do says he that ll be your job hereafter says i keep on doing that and don t try to talk maybe after she thinks she s in love she won t notice the difference between real conversation and the inarticulate sort of droning that you give forth now i had never seen senorita anabela so the next day fergus asks me to walk with him through the plaza and view the daily promenade and exhibition of oratama society a sight that had no interest for me but i went and children and dogs took to the banana groves and mangrove swamps as soon as they had a look at my face here she comes said fergus twirling his moustache the one in white in the open carriage with the black horse i looked and felt the ground rock under my feet for senorita anabela zamora was the most beautiful woman in the world and the only one from that moment on so far as judson tate was concerned i saw at a glance that i must be hers and she mine forever i thought of my face and nearly fainted and then i thought of my other talents and stood upright again and i had been wooing her for three weeks for another man as senorita anabela s carriage rolled slowly past she gave fergus a long soft glance from the corners of her night black eyes a glance that would have sent judson tate up into heaven in a rubber tired chariot but she never looked at me and that handsome man only ruffles his curls and smirks and prances like a lady killer at my side what do you think of her judson asks fergus with an air this much says i she is to me mrs judson tate i am no man to play tricks on a friend so take your warning i thought fergus would die laughing well well well said he you old doughface struck too are you that s great but you re too late francesca tells me that anabela talks of nothing but me day and night of course i m awfully obliged to you for making that chin music to her of evenings but do you know i ve an idea that i could have done it as well myself mrs judson tate says i don t forget the name you ve had the use of my tongue to go with your good looks my boy you can t lend me your looks but hereafter my tongue is my own keep your mind on the name that s to be on the visiting cards two inches by three and a half mrs judson tate that s all all right says fergus laughing again i ve talked with her father the alcalde and he s willing he s to give a baile to morrow evening in his new warehouse if you were a dancing man jud i d expect you around to meet the future mrs mcmahan but on the next evening when the music was playing loudest at the alcade zamora s baile into the room steps judson tate in a new white linen clothes as if he were the biggest man in the whole nation which he was some of the musicians jumped off the key when they saw my face and one or two of the timidest senoritas let out a screech or two but up prances the alcalde and almost wipes the dust off my shoes with his forehead no mere good looks could have won me that sensational entrance i hear much senor zamora says i of the charm of your daughter it would give me great pleasure to be presented to her there were about six dozen willow rocking chairs with pink tidies tied on to them arranged against the walls in one of them sat senorita anabela in white swiss and red slippers with pearls and fireflies in her hair fergus was at the other end of the room trying to break away from two maroons and a claybank girl the alcalde leads me up to anabela and presents me when she took the first look at my face she dropped her fan and nearly turned her chair over from the shock but i m used to that i sat down by her and began to talk when she heard me speak she jumped and her eyes got as big as alligator pears she couldn t strike a balance between the tones of my voice and face i carried but i kept on talking in the key of c which is the ladies key and presently she sat still in her chair and a dreamy look came into her eyes she was coming my way she knew of judson tate and what a big man he was and the big things he had done and that was in my favour but of course it was some shock to her to find out that i was not the pretty man that had been pointed out to her as the great judson and then i took the spanish language which is better than english for certain purposes and played on it like a harp of a thousand strings i ranged from the second g below the staff up to f sharp above it i set my voice to poetry art romance flowers and moonlight i repeated some of the verses that i had murmured to her in the dark at her window and i knew from a sudden soft sparkle in her eye that she recognized in my voice the tones of her midnight mysterious wooer anyhow i had fergus mcmahan going oh the vocal is the true art no doubt about that handsome is as handsome palavers that s the renovated proverb i took senorita anabela for a walk in the lemon grove while fergus disfiguring himself with an ugly frown was waltzing with the claybank girl before we returned i had permission to come to her window in the patio the next evening at midnight and talk some more oh it was easy enough in two weeks anabela was engaged to me and fergus was out he took it calm for a handsome man and told me he wasn t going to give in talk may be all right in its place judson he says to me although i ve never thought it worth cultivating but says he to expect mere words to back up successfully a face like yours in a lady s good graces is like expecting a man to make a square meal on the ringing of a dinner bell but i haven t begun on the story i was going to tell you yet one day i took a long ride in the hot sunshine and then took a bath in the cold waters of a lagoon on the edge of the town before i d cooled off that evening after dark i called at the alcalde s to see anabela i was calling regular every evening then and we were to be married in a month she was looking like a bulbul a gazelle and a tea rose and her eyes were as soft and bright as two quarts of cream skimmed off from the milky way she looked at my rugged features without any expression of fear or repugnance indeed i fancied that i saw a look of deep admiration and affection such as she had cast at fergus on the plaza i sat down and opened my mouth to tell anabela what she loved to hear that she was a trust monopolizing all the loveliness of earth i opened my mouth and instead of the usual vibrating words of love and compliment there came forth a faint wheeze such as a baby with croup might emit not a word not a syllable not an intelligible sound i had caught cold in my laryngeal regions when i took my injudicious bath for two hours i sat trying to entertain anabela she talked a certain amount but it was perfunctory and diluted the nearest approach i made to speech was to formulate a sound like a clam trying to sing a life on the ocean wave at low tide it seemed that anabela s eyes did not rest upon me as often as usual i had nothing with which to charm her ears we looked at pictures and she played the guitar occasionally very badly when i left her parting manner seemed cool or at least thoughtful this happened for five evenings consecutively on the sixth day she ran away with fergus mcmahan it was known that they fled in a sailing yacht bound for belize i was only eight hours behind them in a small steam launch belonging to the revenue department before i sailed i rushed into the botica of old manuel iquito a half breed indian druggist i could not speak but i pointed to my throat and made a sound like escaping steam he began to yawn in an hour according to the customs of the country i would have been waited on i reached across the counter seized him by the throat and pointed again to my own he yawned once more and thrust into my hand a small bottle containing a black liquid take one small spoonful every two hours says he i threw him a dollar and skinned for the steamer i steamed into the harbour at belize thirteen seconds behind the yacht that anabela and fergus were on they started for the shore in a dory just as my skiff was lowered over the side i tried to order my sailormen to row faster but the sounds died in my larynx before they came to the light then i thought of old iquito s medicine and i got out his bottle and took a swallow of it the two boats landed at the same moment i walked straight up to anabela and fergus her eyes rested upon me for an instant then she turned them full of feeling and confidence upon fergus i knew i could not speak but i was desperate in speech lay my only hope i could not stand beside fergus and challenge comparison in the way of beauty purely involuntarily my larynx and epiglottis attempted to reproduce the sounds that my mind was calling upon my vocal organs to send forth to my intense surprise and delight the words rolled forth beautifully clear resonant exquisitely modulated full of power expression and long repressed emotion senorita anabela says i may i speak with you aside for a moment you don t want details about that do you thanks the old eloquence had come back all right i led her under a cocoanut palm and put my old verbal spell on her again judson says she when you are talking to me i can hear nothing else i can see nothing else there is nothing and nobody else in the world for me well that s about all of the story anabela went back to oratama in the steamer with me i never heard what became of fergus i never saw him any more anabela is now mrs judson tate has my story bored you much no said i i am always interested in psychological studies a human heart and especially a woman s is a wonderful thing to contemplate it is said judson tate and so are the trachea and bronchial tubes of man and the larynx too did you ever make a study of the windpipe never said i but i have taken much pleasure in your story may i ask after mrs tate and inquire of her present health and whereabouts oh sure said judson tate we are living in bergen avenue jersey city the climate down in oratama didn t suit mrs t i don t suppose you ever dissected the arytenoid cartilages of the epiglottis did you why no said i i am no surgeon pardon me said judson tate but every man should know enough of anatomy and therapeutics to safeguard his own health a sudden cold may set up capillary bronchitis or inflammation of the pulmonary vesicles which may result in a serious affection of the vocal organs perhaps so said i with some impatience but that is neither here nor there speaking of the strange manifestations of the affection of women i yes yes interrupted judson tate they have peculiar ways but as i was going to tell you when i went back to oratama i found out from manuel iquito what was in that mixture he gave me for my lost voice i told you how quick it cured me he made that stuff from the chuchula plant now look here judson tate drew an oblong white pasteboard box from his pocket for any cough he said or cold or hoarseness or bronchial affection whatsoever i have here the greatest remedy in the world you see the formula printed on the box each tablet contains licorice grains balsam tolu grain oil of anise minim oil of tar minim oleo resin of cubebs minim fluid extract of chuchula minim i am in new york went on judson tate for the purpose of organizing a company to market the greatest remedy for throat affections ever discovered at present i am introducing the lozenges in a small way i have here a box containing four dozen which i am selling for the small sum of fifty cents if you are suffering i got up and went away without a word i walked slowly up to the little park near my hotel leaving judson tate alone with his conscience my feelings were lacerated he had poured gently upon me a story that i might have used there was a little of the breath of life in it and some of the synthetic atmosphere that passes when cunningly tinkered in the marts and at the last it had proven to be a commercial pill deftly coated with the sugar of fiction the worst of it was that i could not offer it for sale advertising departments and counting rooms look down upon me and it would never do for the literary therefore i sat upon a bench with other disappointed ones until my eyelids drooped i went to my room and as my custom is read for an hour stories in my favourite magazines this was to get my mind back to art again and as i read each story i threw the magazines sadly and hopelessly one by one upon the floor each author without one exception to bring balm to my heart wrote liltingly and sprightly a story of some particular make of motor car that seemed to control the sparking plug of his genius and when the last one was hurled from me i took heart if readers can swallow so many proprietary automobiles i said to myself they ought not to strain at one of tate s compound magic chuchula bronchial lozenges and so if you see this story in print you will understand that business is business and that if art gets very far ahead of commerce she will have to get up and hustle i may as well add to make a clean job of it that you can t buy the chuchula plant in the drug stores art and the bronco out of the wilderness had come a painter genius whose coronations alone are democratic had woven a chaplet of chaparral for the brow of lonny briscoe art whose divine expression flows impartially from the fingertips of a cowboy or a dilettante emperor had chosen for a medium the boy artist of the san saba the outcome seven feet by twelve of besmeared canvas stood gilt framed in the lobby of the capitol the legislature was in session the capital city of that great western state was enjoying the season of activity and profit that the congregation of the solons bestowed the boarding houses were corralling the easy dollars of the gamesome law makers the greatest state in the west an empire in area and resources had arisen and repudiated the old libel or barbarism lawbreaking and bloodshed order reigned within her borders life and property were as safe there sir as anywhere among the corrupt cities of the effete east pillow shams churches strawberry feasts and habeas corpus flourished with impunity might the tenderfoot ventilate his stovepipe or his theories of culture the arts and sciences received nurture and subsidy and therefore it behooved the legislature of this great state to make appropriation for the purchase of lonny briscoe s immortal painting rarely has the san saba country contributed to the spread of the fine arts its sons have excelled in the solider graces in the throw of the lariat the manipulation of the esteemed the intrepidity of the one card draw and the nocturnal stimulation of towns from undue lethargy but hitherto it had not been famed as a stronghold of aesthetics lonny briscoe s brush had removed that disability here among the limestone rocks the succulent cactus and the drought parched grass of that arid valley had been born the boy artist why he came to woo art is beyond postulation beyond doubt some spore of the afflatus must have sprung up within him in spite of the desert soil of san saba the tricksy spirit of creation must have incited him to attempted expression and then have sat hilarious among the white hot sands of the valley watching its mischievous work for lonny s picture viewed as a thing of art was something to have driven away dull care from the bosoms of the critics the painting one might almost say panorama was designed to portray a typical western scene interest culminating in a central animal figure that of a stampeding steer life size wild eyed fiery breaking away in a mad rush from the herd that close ridden by a typical cowpuncher occupied a position somewhat in the right background of the picture the landscape presented fitting and faithful accessories chaparral mesquit and pear were distributed in just proportions a spanish dagger plant with its waxen blossoms in a creamy aggregation as large as a water bucket contributed floral beauty and variety the distance was undulating prairie bisected by stretches of the intermittent streams peculiar to the region lined with the rich green of live oak and water elm a richly mottled rattlesnake lay coiled beneath a pale green clump of prickly pear in the foreground a third of the canvas was ultramarine and lake white the typical western sky and the flying clouds rainless and feathery between two plastered pillars in the commodious hallway near the door of the chamber of representatives stood the painting citizens and lawmakers passed there by twos and groups and sometimes crowds to gaze upon it many perhaps a majority of them had lived the prairie life and recalled easily the familiar scene old cattlemen stood reminiscent and candidly pleased chatting with brothers of former camps and trails of the days it brought back to mind art critics were few in the town and there was heard none of that jargon of colour perspective and feeling such as the east loves to use as a curb and a rod to the pretensions of the artist twas a great picture most of them agreed admiring the gilt frame larger than any they had ever seen senator kinney was the picture s champion and sponsor it was he who so often stepped forward and asserted with the voice of a bronco buster that it would be a lasting blot sir upon the name of this great state if it should decline to recognize in a proper manner the genius that had so brilliantly transferred to imperishable canvas a scene so typical of the great sources of our state s wealth and prosperity land and er live stock senator kinney represented a section of the state in the extreme west miles from the san saba country but the true lover of art is not limited by metes and bounds nor was senator mullens representing the san saba country lukewarm in his belief that the state should purchase the painting of his constituent he was advised that the san saba country was unanimous in its admiration of the great painting by one of its own denizens hundreds of connoisseurs had straddled their broncos and ridden miles to view it before its removal to the capital senator mullens desired reelection and he knew the importance of the san saba vote he also knew that with the help of senator kinney who was a power in the legislature the thing could be put through now senator kinney had an irrigation bill that he wanted passed for the benefit of his own section and he knew senator mullens could render him valuable aid and information the san saba country already enjoying the benefits of similar legislation with these interests happily dovetailed wonder at the sudden interest in art at the state capital must necessarily be small few artists have uncovered their first picture to the world under happier auspices than did lonny briscoe senators kinney and mullens came to an understanding in the matter of irrigation and art while partaking of long drinks in the cafe of the empire hotel h m said senator kinney i don t know i m no art critic but it seems to me the thing won t work it looks like the worst kind of a chromo to me i don t want to cast any reflections upon the artistic talent of your constituent senator but i myself wouldn t give six bits for the picture without the frame how are you going to cram a thing like that down the throat of a legislature that kicks about a little item in the expense bill of six hundred and eighty one dollars for rubber erasers for only one term it s wasting time i d like to help you mullens but they d laugh us out of the senate chamber if we were to try it but you don t get the point said senator mullens in his deliberate tones tapping kinney s glass with his long forefinger i have my own doubts as to what the picture is intended to represent a bullfight or a japanese allegory but i want this legislature to make an appropriation to purchase of course the subject of the picture should have been in the state historical line but it s too late to have the paint scraped off and changed the state won t miss the money and the picture can be stowed away in a lumber room where it won t annoy any one now here s the point to work on leaving art to look after itself the chap that painted the picture is the grandson of lucien briscoe say it again said kinney leaning his head thoughtfully of the old original lucien briscoe of him the man who you know the man who carved the state out of the wilderness the man who settled the indians the man who cleaned out the horse thieves the man who refused the crown the state s favourite son do you see the point now wrap up the picture said kinney it s as good as sold why didn t you say that at first instead of philandering along about art i ll resign my seat in the senate and go back to chain carrying for the county surveyor the day i can t make this state buy a picture calcimined by a grandson of lucien briscoe did you ever hear of a special appropriation for the purchase of a home for the daughter of one eyed smothers well that went through like a motion to adjourn and old one eyed never killed half as many indians as briscoe did about what figure had you and the calciminer agreed upon to sandbag the treasury for i thought said mullens that maybe five hundred five hundred interrupted kinney as he hammered on his glass for a lead pencil and looked around for a waiter only five hundred for a red steer on the hoof delivered by a grandson of lucien briscoe where s your state pride man two thousand is what it ll be you ll introduce the bill and i ll get up on the floor of the senate and wave the scalp of every indian old lucien ever murdered let s see there was something else proud and foolish he did wasn t there oh yes he declined all emoluments and benefits he was entitled to refused his head right and veteran donation certificates could have been governor but wouldn t declined a pension now s the state s chance to pay up it ll have to take the picture but then it deserves some punishment for keeping the briscoe family waiting so long we ll bring this thing up about the middle of the month after the tax bill is settled now mullens you send over as soon as you can and get me the figures on the cost of those irrigation ditches and the statistics about the increased production per acre i m going to need you when that bill of mine comes up i reckon we ll be able to pull along pretty well together this session and maybe others to come eh senator thus did fortune elect to smile upon the boy artist of the san saba fate had already done her share when she arranged his atoms in the cosmogony of creation as the grandson of lucien briscoe the original briscoe had been a pioneer both as to territorial occupation and in certain acts prompted by a great and simple heart he had been one of the first settlers and crusaders against the wild forces of nature the savage and the shallow politician his name and memory were revered equally with any upon the list comprising houston boone crockett clark and green he had lived simply independently and unvexed by ambition even a less shrewd man than senator kinney could have prophesied that his state would hasten to honour and reward his grandson come out of the chaparral at even so late a day and so before the great picture by the door of the chamber of representatives at frequent times for many days could be found the breezy robust form of senator kinney and be heard his clarion voice reciting the past deeds of lucien briscoe in connection with the handiwork of his grandson senator mullens s work was more subdued in sight and sound but directed along identical lines then as the day for the introduction of the bill for appropriation draws nigh up from the san saba country rides lonny briscoe and a loyal lobby of cowpunchers bronco back to boost the cause of art and glorify the name of friendship for lonny is one of them a knight of stirrup and chaparreras as handy with the lariat and as he is with brush and palette on a march afternoon the lobby dashed with a whoop into town the cowpunchers had adjusted their garb suitably from that prescribed for the range to the more conventional requirements of town they had conceded their leather chaparreras and transferred their six shooters and belts from their persons to the horns of their saddles among them rode lonny a youth of twenty three brown solemn faced ingenuous bowlegged reticent bestriding hot tamales the most sagacious cow pony west of the mississippi senator mullens had informed him of the bright prospects of the situation had even mentioned so great was his confidence in the capable kinney the price that the state would in all likelihood pay it seemed to lonny that fame and fortune were in his hands certainly a spark of the divine fire was in the little brown centaur s breast for he was counting the two thousand dollars as but a means to future development of his talent some day he would paint a picture even greater than this one say twelve feet by twenty full of scope and atmosphere and action during the three days that yet intervened before the coming of

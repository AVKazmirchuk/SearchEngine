salve nor sting in em any more what i want to know is why come now out with the good points first the story said westbrook deliberately after a suppressed sigh is written around an almost original plot characterization the best you have done construction almost as good except for a few weak joints which might be strengthened by a few changes and touches it was a good story except i can write english can t i interrupted dawe i have always told you said the editor that you had a style then the trouble is same old thing said editor westbrook you work up to your climax like an artist and then you turn yourself into a photographer i don t know what form of obstinate madness possesses you but that is what you do with everything that you write no i will retract the comparison with the photographer now and then photography in spite of its impossible perspective manages to record a fleeting glimpse of truth but you spoil every d enouement by those flat drab obliterating strokes of your brush that i have so often complained of if you would rise to the literary pinnacle of your dramatic senses and paint them in the high colors that art requires the postman would leave fewer bulky self addressed envelopes at your door oh fiddles and footlights cried dawe derisively you ve got that old sawmill drama kink in your brain yet when the man with the black mustache kidnaps golden haired bessie you are bound to have the mother kneel and raise her hands in the spotlight and say may high heaven witness that i will rest neither night nor day till the heartless villain that has stolen me child feels the weight of another s vengeance editor westbrook conceded a smile of impervious complacency i think said he that in real life the woman would express herself in those words or in very similar ones not in a six hundred nights run anywhere but on the stage said dawe hotly i ll tell you what she d say in real life she d say what bessie led away by a strange man good lord it s one trouble after another get my other hat i must hurry around to the police station why wasn t somebody looking after her i d like to know for god s sake get out of my way or i ll never get ready not that hat the brown one with the velvet bows bessie must have been crazy she s usually shy of strangers is that too much powder lordy how i m upset that s the way she d talk continued dawe people in real life don t fly into heroics and blank verse at emotional crises they simply can t do it if they talk at all on such occasions they draw from the same vocabulary that they use every day and muddle up their words and ideas a little more that s all shack said editor westbrook impressively did you ever pick up the mangled and lifeless form of a child from under the fender of a street car and carry it in your arms and lay it down before the distracted mother did you ever do that and listen to the words of grief and despair as they flowed spontaneously from her lips i never did said dawe did you well no said editor westbrook with a slight frown but i can well imagine what she would say so can i said dawe and now the fitting time had come for editor westbrook to play the oracle and silence his opinionated contributor it was not for an unarrived fictionist to dictate words to be uttered by the heroes and heroines of the minerva magazine contrary to the theories of the editor thereof my dear shack said he if i know anything of life i know that every sudden deep and tragic emotion in the human heart calls forth an apposite concordant conformable and proportionate expression of feeling how much of this inevitable accord between expression and feeling should be attributed to nature and how much to the influence of art it would be difficult to say the sublimely terrible roar of the lioness that has been deprived of her cubs is dramatically as far above her customary whine and purr as the kingly and transcendent utterances of lear are above the level of his senile vaporings but it is also true that all men and women have what may be called a sub conscious dramatic sense that is awakened by a sufficiently deep and powerful emotion a sense unconsciously acquired from literature and the stage that prompts them to express those emotions in language befitting their importance and histrionic value and in the name of the seven sacred saddle blankets of sagittarius where did the stage and literature get the stunt asked dawe from life answered the editor triumphantly the story writer rose from the bench and gesticulated eloquently but dumbly he was beggared for words with which to formulate adequately his dissent on a bench nearby a frowzy loafer opened his red eyes and perceived that his moral support was due a downtrodden brother punch him one jack he called hoarsely to dawe w at s he come makin a noise like a penny arcade for amongst gen lemen that comes in the square to set and think editor westbrook looked at his watch with an affected show of leisure tell me asked dawe with truculent anxiety what especial faults in the alarum of the soul caused you to throw it down when gabriel murray said westbrook goes to his telephone and is told that his fianc ee has been shot by a burglar he says i do not recall the exact words but i do said dawe he says damn central she always cuts me off and then to his friend say tommy does a

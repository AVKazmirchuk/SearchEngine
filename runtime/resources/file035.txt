the cast off specimens of half a dozen fashions and eras two factories had combined their efforts in providing shoes for his feet as you gazed at him there passed through your mind vague impressions of mummies wax figures russian exiles and men lost on desert islands his face was covered almost to his eyes with a curly brown beard that he kept trimmed short with a pocket knife and that had furnished him with his nom de route light blue eyes full of sullenness fear cunning impudence and fawning witnessed the stress that had been laid upon his soul the saloon was small and in its atmosphere the odours of meat and drink struggled for the ascendancy the pig and the cabbage wrestled with hydrogen and oxygen behind the bar schwegel laboured with an assistant whose epidermal pores showed no signs of being obstructed hot weinerwurst and sauerkraut were being served to purchasers of beer curly shuffled to the end of the bar coughed hollowly and told schwegel that he was a detroit cabinet maker out of a job it followed as the night the day that he got his schooner and lunch was you acquainted maybe with heinrich strauss in detroit asked schwegel did i know heinrich strauss repeated curly affectionately why say bo i wish i had a dollar for every game of pinochle me and heine has played on sunday afternoons more beer and a second plate of steaming food was set before the diplomat and then curly knowing to a fluid drachm how far a con game would go shuffled out into the unpromising street and now he began to perceive the inconveniences of this stony southern town there was none of the outdoor gaiety and brilliancy and music that provided distraction even to the poorest in the cities of the north here even so early the gloomy rock walled houses were closed and barred against the murky dampness of the night the streets were mere fissures through which flowed grey wreaths of river mist as he walked he heard laughter and the chink of coin and chips behind darkened windows and music coming from every chink of wood and stone but the diversions were selfish the day of popular pastimes had not yet come to san antonio but at length curly as he strayed turned the sharp angle of another lost street and came upon a rollicking band of stockmen from the outlying ranches celebrating in the open in front of an ancient wooden hotel one great roisterer from the sheep country who had just instigated a movement toward the bar swept curly in like a stray goat with the rest of his flock the princes of kine and wool hailed him as a new zoological discovery and uproariously strove to preserve him in the diluted alcohol of their compliments and regards an hour afterward curly staggered from the hotel barroom dismissed by his fickle friends whose interest in him had subsided as quickly as it had risen full stoked with alcoholic fuel and cargoed with food the only question remaining to disturb him was that of shelter and bed a drizzling cold texas rain had begun to fall an endless lazy unintermittent downfall that lowered the spirits of men and raised a reluctant steam from the warm stones of the streets and houses thus comes the norther dousing gentle spring and amiable autumn with the chilling salutes and adieux of coming and departing winter curly followed his nose down the first tortuous street into which his irresponsible feet conducted him at the lower end of it on the bank of the serpentine stream he perceived an open gate in a cemented rock wall inside he saw camp fires and a row of low wooden sheds built against three sides of the enclosing wall he entered the enclosure under the sheds many horses were champing at their oats and corn many wagons and buckboards stood about with their teams harness thrown carelessly upon the shafts and doubletrees curly recognised the place as a wagon yard such as is provided by merchants for their out of town friends and customers no one was in sight no doubt the drivers of those wagons were scattered about the town seeing the elephant and hearing the owl in their haste to become patrons of the town s dispensaries of mirth and good cheer the last ones to depart must have left the great wooden gate swinging open curly had satisfied the hunger of an anaconda and the thirst of a camel so he was neither in the mood nor the condition of an explorer he zigzagged his way to the first wagon that his eyesight distinguished in the semi darkness under the shed it was a two horse wagon with a top of white canvas the wagon was half filled with loose piles of wool sacks two or three great bundles of grey blankets and a number of bales bundles and boxes a reasoning eye would have estimated the load at once as ranch supplies bound on the morrow for some outlying hacienda but to the drowsy intelligence of curly they represented only warmth and softness and protection against the cold humidity of the night after several unlucky efforts at last he conquered gravity so far as to climb over a wheel and pitch forward upon the best and warmest bed he had fallen upon in many a day then he became instinctively a burrowing animal and dug his way like a prairie dog down among the sacks and blankets hiding himself from the cold air as snug and safe as a bear in his den for three nights sleep had visited curly only in broken and shivering doses so now when morpheus condescended to pay him a call curly got such a strangle hold on the mythological old gentleman that it was a wonder that anyone else in the whole world got a wink of sleep that

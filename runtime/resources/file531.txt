one ear mike relied upon a pair of brass knucks an heirloom in the family why fetch and carry said black riley when some one will do it for ye let him bring it out to us hey what we can chuck him in the river said pigeon mccarthy with a stone tied to his feet youse guys make me tired said one ear mike sadly ain t progress ever appealed to none of yez sprinkle a little gasoline on im and drop im on the drive well fuzzy entered the millionaire s gate and zigzagged toward the softly glowing entrance of the mansion the three goblins came up to the gate and lingered one on each side of it one beyond the roadway they fingered their cold metal and leather confident fuzzy rang the door bell smiling foolishly and dreamily an atavistic instrinct prompted him to reach for the button of his right glove but he wore no gloves so his left hand dropped embarrassed the particular menial whose duty it was to open doors to silks and laces shied at first sight of fuzzy but a second glance took in his passport his card of admission his surety of welcome the lost rag doll of the daughter of the house dangling under his arm fuzzy was admitted into a great hall dim with the glow from unseen lights the hireling went away and returned with a maid and the child the doll was restored to the mourning one she clasped her lost darling to her breast and then with the inordinate selfishness and candor of childhood stamped her foot and whined hatred and fear of the odious being who had rescued her from the depths of sorrow and despair fuzzy wriggled himself into an ingratiatory attitude and essayed the idiotic smile and blattering small talk that is supposed to charm the budding intellect of the young the child bawled and was dragged away hugging her betsy close there came the secretary pale poised polished gliding in pumps and worshipping pomp and ceremony he counted out into fuzzy s hand ten ten dollar bills then dropped his eye upon the door transferred it to james its custodian indicated the obnoxious earner of the reward with the other and allowed his pumps to waft him away to secretarial regions james gathered fuzzy with his own commanding optic and swept him as far as the front door when the money touched fuzzy s dingy palm his first instinct was to take to his heels but a second thought restrained him from that blunder of etiquette it was his it had been given him it and oh what

mud honey that he craved the fairy doll had waved a wand with her rag stuffed hand and now wherever he might go the enchanted palaces with shining foot rests and magic red fluids in gleaming glassware would be open to him he followed james to the door he paused there as the flunky drew open the great mahogany portal for him to pass into the vestibule beyond the wrought iron gates in the dark highway black riley and his two pals casually strolled fingering under their coats the inevitably fatal weapons that were to make the reward of the rag doll theirs fuzzy stopped at the millionaire s door and bethought himself like little sprigs of mistletoe on a dead tree certain living green thoughts and memories began to decorate his confused mind he was quite drunk mind you and the present was beginning to fade those wreaths aand festoons of holly with their scarlet berries making the great hall gay where had he seen such things before somewhere he had known polished floors and odors of fresh flowers in winter and and some one was singing a song in the house that he thought he had heard before some one singing and playing a harp of course it was christmas fuzzy though he must have

ghost the spirit of nobless oblige upon a gentleman certain things devolve james opened the outer door a stream of light went down the graveled walk to the iron gate black riley mccarthy and one ear mike saw and carelessly drew their sinister cordon closer about the gate with a more imperious gesture than james s master had ever used or could ever use fuzzy compelled the menial to close the door upon a gentleman certain things devolve especially at the christmas season it is cust customary he said to james the flustered when a gentleman calls on christmas eve to pass the compliments of the season with the lady of the house you und stand i shall not move shtep till i pass compl ments season with lady the house und stand there was an argument james lost fuzzy raised his voice and sent it through the house unpleasantly i did not say he was a gentleman he was simply a tramp being visited by a ghost a sterling silver bell rang james went back to answer it leaving fuzzy in the hall james explained somewhere to some one then he came and conducted fuzzy into the library the lady entered a moment later she was more beautiful and holy than any picture that fuzzy had seen she smiled and

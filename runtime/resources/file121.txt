smoke of their fires where the smoke cleared the crystal air with some of the efficacy of faith seemed to remove the mountains almost to the sea bringing them so near that one might count the scarred glades on their wooded sides the light footed caribs were swiftly gliding to their tasks at the waterside already along the bosky trails from the banana groves files of horses were slowly moving

the last drop of their generosity and at last aaron like he had smitten the rock of their hardening bosoms for the scattering ignoble drops of charity itself he had exhausted his credit to the last

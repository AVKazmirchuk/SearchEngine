the road and back through them toward the house again we stopped within twenty yards of the house concealed by the dark shadows i wondered at this maneuver and then i heard in the distance coming down the road beyond the house the regular hoofbeats of a team of horses bell held his watch in a ray of moonlight on time within a minute he said that s george s way the team slowed up as it drew near the house and stopped in a patch of black shadows we saw the figure of a woman carrying a heavy valise move swiftly from the other side of the house and hurry to the waiting vehicle then it rolled away briskly in the direction from which it had come i looked at bell inquiringly i suppose i certainly asked him no question she s running away with george said bell simply he s kept me posted about the progress of the scheme all along she ll get a divorce in six months and then george will marry her he never helps anybody halfway it s all arranged between them i began to wonder what friendship was after all when we went into the house bell began to talk easily on other subjects and i took his cue by and by the big chance to buy out the business in mountain city came back to my mind and i began to urge it upon him now that he was free it would be easier for him to make the move and he was sure of a splendid bargain bell was silent for some minutes but when i looked at him i fancied that he was thinking of something else that he was not considering the project why no mr ames he said after a while i can t make that deal i m awful thankful to you though for telling me about it but i ve got to stay here i can t go to mountain city why i asked missis bell he replied won t live in mountain city she hates the place and wouldn t go there i ve got to keep right on here in saltillo mrs bell i exclaimed too puzzled to conjecture what he meant i ought to explain said bell i know george and i know mrs bell he s impatient in his ways he can t stand things that fret him long like i can six months i give them six months of married life and there ll be another disunion mrs bell will come back to me there s no other place for her to go i ve got to stay here and wait at the end of six months i ll have to grab a satchel and catch the first train for george will be sending out the call a dinner at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the story referred to in this skit appears in the trimmed lamp under the same title the badge of policeman o roon the adventures of an author with his own hero all that day in fact from the moment of his creation van sweller had conducted himself fairly well in my eyes of course i had had to make many concessions but in return he had been no less considerate once or twice we had had sharp brief contentions over certain points of behavior but prevailingly give and take had been our rule his morning toilet provoked our first tilt van sweller went about it confidently the usual thing i suppose old chap he said with a smile and a yawn i ring for a b and s and then i have my tub i splash a good deal in the water of course you are aware that there are two ways in which i can receive tommy carmichael when he looks in to have a chat about polo i can talk to him through the bathroom door or i can be picking at a grilled bone which my man has brought in which would you prefer i smiled with diabolic satisfaction at his coming discomfiture neither i said you will make your appearance on the scene when a gentleman should after you are fully dressed which indubitably private function shall take place behind closed doors and i will feel indebted to you if after you do appear your deportment and manners are such that it will not be necessary to inform the public in order to appease its apprehension that you have taken a bath van sweller slightly elevated his brows oh very well he said a trifle piqued i rather imagine it concerns you more than it does me cut the tub by all means if you think best but it has been the usual thing you know this was my victory but after van sweller emerged from his apartments in the beaujolie i was vanquished in a dozen small but well contested skirmishes i allowed him a cigar but routed him on the question of naming its brand but he worsted me when i objected to giving him a coat unmistakably english in its cut i allowed him to stroll down broadway and even permitted passers by god knows there s nowhere to pass but by to turn their heads and gaze with evident admiration at his erect figure i demeaned myself and as a barber gave him a smooth dark face with its keen frank eye and firm jaw later on he looked in at the club and saw freddy vavasour polo team captain dawdling over grilled bone no dear old boy began van sweller but in an instant i had seized him by the collar and dragged him aside with the scantiest courtesy for heaven s sake talk like a man i said sternly do you think it is manly to use those mushy and inane forms of address that man is neither dear

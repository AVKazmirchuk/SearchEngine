will do ye good made from pipsissewa and gentian bark at the druggist s back up said mr mcquirk impatiently there s no spring in sight there s snow yet on the shed in donovan s backyard and yesterday they puts open cars on the sixth avenue lines and the janitors have quit ordering coal and that means six weeks more of winter by all the signs that be after breakfast mr mcquirk spent fifteen minutes before the corrugated mirror subjugating his hair and arranging his green and purple ascot with its amethyst tombstone pin eloquent of his chosen calling since the strike had been called it was this par ticular striker s habit to hie himself each morning to the corner saloon of flaherty brothers and there establish himself upon the sidewalk with one foot resting on the bootblack s stand observing the panorama of the street until the pace of time brought twelve o clock and the dinner hour and mr tiger mcquirk with his athletic seventy inches well trained in sport and battle his smooth pale solid amiable face blue where the razor had trav elled his carefully considered clothes and air of capa bility was himself a spectacle not displeasing to the eye but on this morning mr mcquirk did not hasten immediately to his post of leisure and observation something unusual that he could not quite grasp was in the air something disturbed his thoughts ruffled his senses made him at once languid irritable elated dissastisfied and sportive he was no diagnostician and he did not know that lent was breaking up physiologically in his system mrs mcquirk had spoken of spring sceptically tiger looked about him for signs few they were the organ grinders were at work but they were always precocious harbingers it was near enough spring for them to go penny hunting when the skating ball dropped at the park in the milliners windows easter hats grave gay and jubilant blos somed there were green patches among the side walk debris of the grocers on a third story window sill the first elbow cushion of the season old gold stripes on a crimson ground supported the kimo noed arms of a pensive brunette the wind blew cold from the east river but the sparrows were fly ing to the eaves with straws a second hand store combining foresight with faith had set out an ice chest and baseball goods and then tiger s eye discrediting these signs fell upon one that bore a bud of promise from a bright new lithograph the head of capricornus con fronted him betokening the forward and heady brew mr mcquirk entered the saloon and called for his glass of bock he threw his nickel on the bar raised the glass set it down without tasting it and strolled toward the door wot s the matter lord bolinbroke inquired the sarcastic bartender want a chiny vase or a gold lined epergne to drink it out of hey say said mr mcquirk wheeling and shooting out a horizontal hand and a forty five degree chin you know your place only when it comes for givin titles i ve changed me mind about drinkin see you got your money ain t you wait till you get stung before you get the droop to your lip will you thus mr quirk added mutability of desires to the strange humors that had taken possession of him leaving the saloon he walked away twenty steps and leaned in the open doorway of lutz the barber he and lutz were friends masking their sentiments behind abuse and bludgeons of repartee irish loafer roared lutz how do you do so not yet haf der bolicemans or der catcher of dogs done deir duty hello dutch said mr mcquirk can t get your mind off of frankfurters can you bah exclaimed the german coming and lean ing in the door i haf a soul above frankfurters to day dere is springtime in der air i can feel it coming in ofer der mud of der streets and das ice in der river soon will dere be bienics in der islands mit kegs of beer under der trees say said mr mcquirk setting his bat on one side is everybody kiddin me about gentle spring there ain t any more spring in the air than there is in a horsehair sofa in a second avenue furnished room for me the winter underwear yet and the buckwheat cakes you haf no boetry said lutz true it is yedt cold und in der city we haf not many of der signs but dere are dree kinds of beoble dot should always feel der approach of spring first dey are boets lovers and poor vidows mr mcquirk went on his way still possessed by the strange perturbation that he did not understand something was lacking to his comfort and it made him half angry because be did not know what it was two blocks away he came upon a foe one conover whom he was bound in honor to engage in combat mr mcquirk made the attack with the charac teristic suddenness and fierceness that had gained for him the endearing sobriquet of tiger the de fence of mr conover was so prompt and admirable that the conflict was protracted until the onlookers un selfishly gave the warning cry of cheese it the cop the principals escaped easily by running through the nearest open doors into the communi cating backyards at the rear of the houses mr mcquirk emerged into another street he stood by a lamp post for a few minutes engaged in thought and then he turned and plunged into a small notion and news shop a red haired young woman eating gum drops came and looked freezingly at him across the ice bound steppes of the counter say lady he said have you got a song book with this in it let s see bow it leads off when the springtime comes well wander in the dale love and whisper of those days of yore i m having a friend explained mr mcquirk laid up with a broken leg and he sent me after it he s a devil for songs and poetry when he can t get out to drink we have not replied the young woman with un concealed contempt but there is a new song out that begins this way let us sit together in the old armchair and while the firelight flickers we ll be comfortable there there will be no profit in following mr tiger mcquirk through his further vagaries of that day until he comes to stand knocking at the door of annie maria doyle the goddess eastre it seems had guided his footsteps aright at last is that you now jimmy mcquirk she cried smiling through the opened door annie maria had never accepted the tiger well whatever come out in the ball said mr mcquirk i want to ask yer opinion of the weather on the level are you crazy sure said annie maria i am said the tiger they ve been telling me all day there was spring in the air were they liars or am i dear me said annie maria haven t you no ticed it i can almost smell the violets and the green grass of course there ain t any yet it s

fourteenth street but the katzenjammer i ve got don t spell violets it spells yer own name annie maria and it s you i want i go to work next monday and i make four dollars a day spiel up old girl do we make a team jimmy sighed annie maria suddenly disap pearing in his overcoat don t you see that spring is all over the world right this minute but you yourself remember how that day ended beginning with so fine a promise of vernal things late in the afternoon the air chilled and an inch of snow fell even so late in march on fifth ave nue the ladies drew their winter furs close about them only in the florists windows could be per ceived any signs of the morning smile of the coming goddess eastre at six o clock herr lutz began to close his shop he beard a well known shout hello dutch tiger mcquirk in his shirt sleeves with his hat on the back of his bead stood outside in the whirling snow puffing at a black cigar donnerwetter shouted lutz der vinter he has gome back again yet yer a liar dutch called back mr mcquirk with friendly geniality it s springtime by the watch the fool killer down south whenever any one perpetrates some particularly monumental piece of foolishness every body says send for jesse holmes jesse holmes is the fool killer of course he is a myth like santa claus and jack frost and general prosperity and all those concrete conceptions that are supposed to represent an idea that nature has failed to embody the wisest of the southrons can not tell you whence comes the fool killer s name but few and happy are the households from the ro anoke to the rio grande in which the name of jesse holmes has not been pronounced or invoked always with a smile and often with a tear is he summoned to his official duty a busy man is jesse holmes i remember the clear picture of him that hung on the walls of my fancy during my barefoot days when i was dodging his oft threatened devoirs to me be was a terrible old man in gray clothes with a long ragged gray beard and reddish fierce eyes i looked to see him come stumping up the road in a cloud of dust with a white oak staff in his hand and his shoes tied with leather thongs i may yet but this is a story not a sequel i have taken notice with regret that few stories worth reading have been written that did not con tain drink of some sort down go the fluids from arizona dick s three fingers of red pizen to the in efficacious oolong that nerves lionel montressor to repartee in the dotty dialogues so in such good company i may introduce an absinthe drip one absinthe drip dripped through a silver dripper orderly opalescent cool green eyed deceptive kerner was a fool besides that he was an artist and my good friend now if there is one thing on earth utterly despicable to another it is an artist in the eyes of an author whose story he has illus trated just try it once write a story about a mining camp in idiho sell it spend the money and then six months later borrow a quarter or a dime and buy the magazine containing it you find a full page wash drawing of your hero black bill the cowboy somewhere in your story you em ployed the word horse aha the artist has grasped the idea black bill has on the regulation trousers of the m f h of the westchester county hunt he carries a parlor rifle and wears a mon ocle in the distance is a section of forty second street during a search for a lost gas pipe and the taj mahal the famous mausoleum in india enough i hated kerner and one day i met him and we became friends he was young and glori ously melancholy because his spirits were so high and life bad so much in store for him yes he was almost riotously sad that was his youth when a man begins to be hilarious in a sorrowful way you can bet a million that he is dyeing his hair ker ner s hair was plentiful and carefully matted as an artist s thatch should be he was a cigaretteur and be audited his dinners with red wine but most of all be was a fool and wisely i envied him and listened patiently while he knocked velasquez and tintoretto once he told me that he liked a story of mine that he bad come across in an anthology he described it to me and i was sorry that mr fitz james o brien was dead and could not learn of the eulogy of his work but mostly kerner made few breaks and was a consistent fool i d better explain what i mean by that there was a girl now a girl as far as i am concerned is a thing that belongs in a seminary or an album but i conceded the existence of the animal in order to retain kerner s friendship he showed me her picture in a locket she was a blonde or a brunette i have forgotten which she worked in a factory for eight dollars a week lest factories quote this wage by way of vindication i will add that the girl bad worked for five years to reach that supreme ele vation of remuneration beginning at per week kerner s father was worth a couple of millions he was willing to stand for art but he drew the line at the factory girl so kerner disinherited his father and walked out to a cheap studio and lived on sausages for breakfast and on farroni for dinner farroni had the artistic soul and a line of credit for painters and poets nicely adjusted sometimes ker rier sold a picture and bought some new tapestry a ring and a dozen silk cravats and paid farroni two dollars on account one evening kerner had me to dinner with himself and the factory girl they were to be married as soon as kerner could slosh paint profitably as for the ex father s two millions pouf she was a wonder small and half way pretty and as much at her ease in that cheap cafe as though she were only in the palmer house chicago with a souvenir spoon already safely hidden in her shirt waist she was natural two things i noticed about her especially her belt buckle was exactly in the middle of her back and she didn t tell us that a large man with a ruby stick pin had followed her up all the way from fourteenth street was kerner such a fool i wondered and then i thought of the quantity of striped cuffs and blue glass beads that can buy for the heathen and i said to myself that he was and then elise certainly that was her name told us merrily that the brown spot on her waist was caused by her landlady knocking at the door while she the girl confound the english language was heating an iron over the gas jet and she hid the iron under the bedclothes until the coast was clear and there was the piece of chewing gum stuck to it when she began to iron the waist and well i wondered bow in the world the chewing gum came to be there don t they ever stop chewing it a while after that don t be impatient the ab sinthe drip is coming now kerner and i were dining at farroni s a mandolin and a guitar were being attacked the room was full of smoke in nice long crinkly layers just like the artists draw the steam from a plum pudding on christmas posters and a lady in a blue silk and gasolined gauntlets was be ginning to bum an air from the catskills kerner said i you are a fool of course said kerner i wouldn t let her go on working not my wife what s the use to wait she s willing i sold that water color of the pali sades yesterday we could cook on a two burner gas stove you know the ragouts i can throw together yes i think we will marry next week kerner said i you are a fool have an absinthe drip said kerner grandly to night you are the guest of art in paying quan tities i think we will get a flat with a bath i never tried one i mean an absinthe drip said i the waiter brought it and poured the water slowly over the ice in the dripper it looks exactly like the mississippi river water in the big bend below natchez said i fascinated gazing at the be muddled drip there are such flats for eight dollars a week said kerner you are a fool said i and began to sip the filtration what you need i continued is the official attention of one jesse holmes kerner not being a southerner did not compre hend so he sat sentimental figuring on his flat in his sordid artistic way while i gazed into the green eyes of the sophisticated spirit of wormwood presently i noticed casually that a procession of bacchantes limned on the wall immediately below the ceiling bad begun to move traversing the room from right to left in a gay and spectacular pilgrimage i did not confide my discovery to kerner the artistic temperament is too high strung to view such devia tions from the natural laws of the art of kalsomining i sipped my absinthe drip and sawed wormwood one absinthe drip is not much but i said again to kerner kindly you are a fool and then in the vernacular jesse holmes for yours and then i looked around and saw the fool killer as he had always appeared to my imagination sitting at a nearby table and regarding us with his reddish fatal relentless eyes he was jesse holmes from top to toe he had the long gray ragged beard the gray clothes of ancient cut the executioner s look and the dusty shoes of one who bad been called from afar his eyes were turned fixedly upon kerner i shuddered to think that i bad invoked him from his assiduous southern duties i thought of flying and then i kept my seat reflecting that many men bad es caped his ministrations when it seemed that nothing short of an appointment as ambassador to spain could save them from him i had called my brother kerner a fool and was in danger of hell fire that was nothing but i would try to save him from jesse holmes the fool killer got up from his table and came over to ours he rested his hands upon it and turned his burning vindictive eyes upon kerner ig noring me you are a hopeless fool be said to the artist haven t you had enough of starvation yet i of fer you one more opportunity give up this girl and come back to your home refuse and you must take the consequences the fool killer s threatening face was within a foot of his victim s but to my horror kerner made not the slightest sign of being aware of his presence we will be married next week be muttered ab sent mindedly with my studio furniture and some second hand stuff we can make out you have decided your own fate said the fool killer in a low but terrible voice you may con sider yourself as one dead you have had your last chance in the moonlight went on kerner softly we will sit under the skylight with our guitar and sing away the false delights of pride and money on your own head be it hissed the fool killer and my scalp prickled when i perceived that neither kerner s eyes nor his ears took the slightest cog nizance of jesse holmes and then i knew that for some reason the veil had been lifted for me alone and that i bad been elected to save my friend from de struction at the fool killer s bands something of the fear and wonder of it must have showed itself in my face excuse me said kerner with his wan amiable smile was i talking to myself i think it is getting to be a habit with me the fool killer turned and walked out of far ronils wait here for me said i rising i must speak to that man had you no answer for him because you are a fool must you die like a mouse under his foot could you not utter one squeak in your own defence you are drunk said kerner heartlessly no one addressed me the destroyer of your mind said i stood above you just now and marked you for his victim you are not blind or deaf i recognized no such person said kerner i have seen no one but you at this table sit down hereafter you shall have no more absinthe drips wait here said i furious if you don t care for your own life i will save it for you i hurried out and overtook the man in gray half way down the block he looked as i bad seen him in my fancy a thousand times truculent gray and awful he walked with the white oak staff and but for the street sprinkler the dust would have been fly ing under his tread i caught him by the sleeve and steered him to a dark angle of a building i knew he was a myth and i did not want a cop to see me conversing with va cancy for i might land in bellevue minus my silver matchbox and diamond ring jesse holmes said i facing him with apparent bravery i know you i have heard of you all my life i know now what a scourge you have been to your country instead of killing fools you have been murdering the youth and genius that are necessary to make a people live and grow great you are a fool yourself holmes you began killing off the brightest and best of our countrymen three generations ago when the old and obsolete standards of society and honor and orthodoxy were narrow and bigoted you proved that when you put your murderous mark upon my friend kerner the wisest chap i ever knew in my life the fool killer looked at me grimly and closely you ve a queer jag said he curiously oh yes i see who you are now you were sitting with him at the table well if i m not mistaken i heard you call him a fool too i did said i i delight in doing so it is from envy by all the standards that you know he is the most egregious and grandiloquent and gorgeous fool in all the world that s why you want to kill him would you mind telling me who or what you think i am asked the old man i laughed boisterously and then stopped suddenly for i remembered that it would not do to be seen so hilarious in the company of nothing but a brick wall you are jesse holmes the fool killer i said solemnly and you are going to kill my friend ker ner i don t know who rang you up but if you do kill him i ll see that you get pinched for it that is i added despairingly if i can get a cop to see you they have a poor eye for mortals and i think it would take the whole force to round up a myth mur derer well said the fool killer briskly i must be going you had better go home and sleep it off good night at this i was moved by a sudden fear for kerner to a softer and more pleading mood i leaned against the gray man s sleeve and besought him good mr fool killer please don t kill little ker ner why can t you go back south and kill con gressmen and clay caters and let us alone why don t you go up on fifth avenue and kill millionaires that keep their money locked up and won t let young fools marry because one of em lives on the wrong street come and have a drink jesse will you never get on to your job do you know this girl that your friend has made himself a fool about asked the fool killer i have the honor said i and that s why i called kerner a fool he is a fool because he has waited so long before marrying her he is a fool because be has been waiting in the hopes of getting the consent of some absurd two million dollar fool parent or something of the sort maybe said the fool killer maybe i i might have looked at it differently would you mind going back to the restaurant and bringing your friend kerner here oh what s the use jesse i yawned he can t see you he didn t know you were talking to him at the table you are a fictitious character you know maybe he can this time will you go fetch him all right said i but i ve a suspicion that you re not strictly sober jesse you seem to be wa vering and losing your outlines don t vanish before i get back i went back to kerner and said there s a man with an invisible homicidal mania waiting to see you outside i believe he wants to murder you come along you won t see him so there s nothing to be frightened about kerner looked anxious why said be i had no idea one absinthe would do that you d better stick to wurzburger i ll walk home with you i led him to jesse holmes s rudolf said the fool killer i ll give in bring her up to the house give me your hand boy good for you dad said kerner shaking hands with the old man you ll never regret it after you know her so you did see him when he was talking to you at the table i asked kerner we hadn t spoken to each other in a year said kerner it s all right now i walked away where are you going called kerner i am going to look for jesse holmes i an swered with dignity and reserve transients in arcadia there is a hotel on broadway that has escaped discovery by the summer resort promoters it is deep and wide and cool its rooms are finished in dark oak of a low temperature home made breezes and deep green shrubbery give it the delights without the inconveniences of the adirondacks one can mount its broad staircases or glide dreamily upward in its aerial elevators attended by guides in brass but tons with a serene joy that alpine climbers have never attained there is a chef in its kitchen who will prepare for you brook trout better than the white mountains ever served sea food that would turn old point comfort by gad sah green with envy and maine venison that would melt the official heart of a game warden a few have found out this oasis in the july desert of manhattan during that month you will see the hotel s reduced array of guests scattered luxuriously about in the cool twilight of its lofty dining room gazing at one another across the snowy waste of un occupied tables silently congratulatory superfluous watchful pneumatically moving wait ers hover near supplying every want before it is ex pressed the temperature is perpetual april the ceiling is painted in water colors to counterfeit a sum mer sky across which delicate clouds drift and do not vanish as those of nature do to our regret the pleasing distant roar of broadway is trans formed in the imagination of the happy guests to the noise of a waterfall filling the woods with its restful sound at every strange footstep the guests turn an anxious ear fearful lest their retreat be discovered and invaded by the restless pleasure seekers who are forever hounding nature to her deepest lairs thus in the depopulated caravansary the little band of connoisseurs jealously bide themselves during the heated season enjoying to the uttermost the de lights of mountain and seashore that art and skill have gathered and served to them in this july came to the hotel one whose card that she sent to the clerk for her name to be registered read mme he oise d arcy beaumont madame beaumont was a guest such as the hotel lotus loved she possessed the fine air of the e ite tempered and sweetened by a cordial graciousness that made the hotel employees her slaves bell boys fought for the honor of answering her ring the clerks but for the question of ownership would have deeded to her the hotel and its contents the other guests regarded her as the final touch of feminine exclusiveness and beauty that rendered the entourage perfect this super excellent guest rarely left the hotel her habits were consonant with the customs of the dis criminating patrons of the hotel lotus to enjoy that delectable hostelry one must forego the city as though it were leagues away by night a brief ex cursion to the nearby roofs is in order but during the torrid day one remains in the umbrageous fast nesses of the lotus as a trout hangs poised in the pel lucid sanctuaries of his favorite pool though alone in the hotel lotus madame beau mont preserved the state of a queen whose loneliness was of position only she breakfasted at ten a cool sweet leisurely delicate being who glowed softly in the dimness like a jasmine flower in the dusk but at dinner was madame s glory at its height she wore a gown as beautiful and immaterial as the mist from an unseen cataract in a mountain gorge the nomenclature of this gown is beyond the guess of the scribe always pale red roses reposed against its lace garnished front it was a gown that the bead waiter viewed with respect and met at the door you thought of paris when you saw it and maybe of mysterious countesses and certainly of versailles and rapiers and mrs fiske and rouge et noir there was an untraceable rumor in the hotel lotus that madame was a cosmopolite and that she was pulling with her slender white bands certain strings between the nations in the favor of russia being a citi zeness of the world s smoothest roads it was small wonder that she was quick to recognize in the refined purlieus of the hotel lotus the most desirable spot in america for a restful sojourn during the heat of mid summer on the third day of madame beaumont s residence in the hotel a young man entered and registered him self as a guest his clothing to speak of his points in approved order was quietly in the mode his features good and regular his expression that of a poised and sophisticated man of the world he in formed the clerk that he would remain three or four days inquired concerning the sailing of european steamships and sank into the blissful inanition of the nonpareil hotel with the contented air of a traveller in his favorite inn the young man not to question the veracity of the register was harold farrington he drifted into the exclusive and calm current of life in the lotus so tactfully and silently that not a ripple alarmed his fellow seekers after rest he ate in the lotus and of its patronym and was lulled into blissful peace with the other fortunate mariners in one day he acquired his table and his waiter and the fear lest the panting chasers after repose that kept broadway warm should pounce upon and destroy this contiguous but covert haven after dinner on the next day after the arrival of harold farrington madame beaumont dropped her handkerchief in passing out mr farrington recov ered and returned it without the effusiveness of a seeker after acquaintance perhaps there was a mystic freemasonry between the discriminating guests of the lotus perhaps they were drawn one to another by the fact of their common good fortune in discovering the acme of sum mer resorts in a broadway hotel words delicate in courtesy and tentative in departure from formality passed between the two and as if in the expedient atmosphere of a real summer resort an acquaintance grew flowered and fructified on the spot as does the mystic plant of the conjuror for a few moments they stood on a balcony upon which the corridor ended and tossed the feathery ball of conversation one tires of the old resorts said madame beau mont with a faint but sweet smile what is the use to fly to the mountains or the seashore to escape noise and dust when the very people that make both follow us there even on the ocean remarked farrington sadly the philistines be upon you the most exclusive steamers are getting to be scarcely more than ferry boats heaven help us when the summer resorter dis covers that the lotus is further away from broadway than thousand islands or mackinac i hope our secret will be safe for a week any how said madame with a sigh and a smile i do not know where i would go if they should descend upon the dear lotus i know of but one place so de lightful in summer and that is the castle of count polinski in the ural mountains i hear that baden baden and cannes are almost deserted this season said farrington year by year the old resorts fall in disrepute perhaps many others like ourselves are seeking out the quiet nooks that are overlooked by the majority i promise myself three days more of this delicious rest said madame beaumont on monday the cedric sails harold farrington s eyes proclaimed his regret i too must leave on monday he said but i do not go abroad madame beaumont shrugged one round shoulder in a foreign gesture one cannot bide here forever charming though it may be the chateau has been in preparation for me longer than a month those house parties that one must give what a nuisance but i shall never for get my week in the hotel lotus nor shall i said farrington in a low voice and i shall never forgive the cedric on sunday evening three days afterward the two sat at a little table on the same balcony a discreet waiter brought ices and small glasses of claret cup madame beaumont wore the same beautiful even ing gown that she had worn each day at dinner she seemed thoughtful near her hand on the table lay a small chatelaine purse after she had eaten her ice she opened the purse and took out a one dollar bill mr farrington she said with the smile that had won the hotel lotus i want to tell you some thing i m going to leave before breakfast in the morning because i ve got to go back to my work i m behind the hosiery counter at casey s mammoth store and my vacation s up at eight o clock to morrow that paper dollar is the last cent i ll see till i draw my eight dollars salary next saturday night you re a real gentleman and you ve been good to me and i wanted to tell you before i went i ve been saving up out of my wages for a year just for this vacation i wanted to spend one week like a lady if i never do another one i wanted to get up when i please instead of having to crawl out at seven every morning and i wanted to live on the best and be waited on and ring bells for things just like rich folks do now i ve done it and i ve had the happiest time i ever expect to have in my life i m going back to my work and my little hall bedroom satisfied for another year i wanted to tell you about it mr farrington because i i thought you kind of liked me and i i liked you but oh i couldn t help deceiving you up till now for it was all just like a fairy tale to me so i talked about europe and the things i ve read about in other countries and made you think i was a great lady this dress i ve got on it s the only one i have that s fit to wear i bought from o dowd levin sky on the instalment plan seventy five dollars is the price and it was made to measure i paid down and they re to collect a week till it s paid for that ll be about all i have to say mr farrington except that my name is mamie siviter instead of madame beaumont and i thank you for your attentions this dollar will pay the instalment due on the dress to morrow i guess i ll go up to my room now harold farrington listened to the recital of the lotus s loveliest guest with an impassive countenance when she had concluded he drew a small book like a checkbook from his coat pocket he wrote upon a blank form in this with a stub of pencil tore out the leaf tossed it over to his companion and took up the paper dollar i ve got to go to work too in the morning he said and i might as well begin now there s a receipt for the dollar instalment i ve been a col lector for o dowd levinsky for three years funny ain t it that you and me both had the same idea about spending our vacation i ve always wanted to put up at a swell hotel and i saved up out of my twenty per and did it say mame how about a trip to coney saturday night on the boat what the face of the pseudo madame heloise d arcy beaumont beamed oh you bet i ll go mr farrington the store closes at twelve on saturdays i guess coney ll be all right even if we did spend a week with the swells below the balcony the sweltering city growled and buzzed in the july night inside the hotel lotus the tempered cool shadows reigned and the solicitous waiter single footed near the low windows ready at a nod to serve madame and her escort at the door of the elevator farrington took his leave and madame beaumont made her last ascent but before they reached the noiseless cage be said just forget that harold farrington will you mcmanus is the name james mcmanus some call me jimmy good night jimmy said madame the rathskeller and the rose miss posie carrington had earned her suc cess she began life handicapped by the family name of boggs in the small town known as cranberry corners at the age of eighteen she had acquired the name of carrington and a position in the chorus of a metropolitan burlesque company thence upward she had ascended by the legitimate and delectable steps of broiler member of the famous dickey bird octette in the successful musical comedy fudge and fellows leader of the potato bug dance in fol de rol and at length to the part of the maid toinette in the king s bath robe which captured the critics and gave her her chance and when we come to consider miss carrington she is in the heydey of flattery fame and fizz and that astute manager herr timothy goldstein has her signature to iron clad papers that she will star the coming season in dyde rich s new play paresis by gaslight promptly there came to herr timothy a capable twentieth century young character actor by the name of highsmith who besought engagement as sol haytosser the comic and chief male character part in paresis by gaslight my boy said goldstein take the part if you can get it miss carrington won t listen to any of my suggestions she has turned down half a dozen of the best imitators of the rural dub in the city she declares she won t set a foot on the stage un less haytosser is the best that can be raked up she was raised in a village you know and when a broadway orchid sticks a straw in his hair and tries to call himself a clover blossom she s on all right i asked her in a sarcastic vein if she thought den man thompson would make any kind of a show in the part oh no says she i don t want him or john drew or jim corbett or any of these swell actors that don t know a turnip from a turnstile i want the real article so my boy if you want to play i sol haytosser you will have to convince miss carrington luck be with you highsmith took the train the next day for cran berry corners he remained in that forsaken and inanimate village three days he found the boggs family and corkscrewed their history unto the third and fourth generation he amassed the facts and the local color of cranberry corners the village had not grown as rapidly as had miss carrington the actor estimated that it had suffered as few actual changes since the departure of its solitary follower of thespis as had a stage upon which four years is supposed to have elapsed he absorbed cran berry corners and returned to the city of chameleon changes it was in the rathskeller that highsmith made the hit of his histrionic career there is no need to name the place there is but one rathskeller where you could hope to find miss posie carrington after a performance of the king s bath robe there was a jolly small party at one of the tables that drew many eyes miss carrington petite mar vellous bubbling electric fame drunken shall be named first herr goldstein follows sonorous curly haired heavy a trifle anxious as some bear that had caught somehow a butterfly in his claws next a man condemned to a newspaper sad courted armed analyzing for press agent s dross every sen tence that was poured over him eating his a la new burg in the silence of greatness to conclude a youth with parted hair a name that is ochre to red journals and gold on the

bizarre and merry because it was nine feet below the level of the sidewalk at a being entered the rathskeller the first violin perceptibly flatted a c that should have been natural the clarionet blew a bubble instead of a grace note miss carrington giggled and the youth with parted hair swallowed an olive seed exquisitely and irreproachably rural was the new entry a lank disconcerted hesitating young man it was flaxen haired gaping of mouth awkward stricken to misery by the lights and company his clothing was butternut with bright blue tie showing four inches of bony wrist and white socked ankle he upset a chair sat in another one curled a foot around a table leg and cringed at the approach of a waiter you may fetch me a glass of lager beer he said in response to the discreet questioning of the servitor the eyes of the rathskeller were upon him he was as fresh as a collard and as ingenuous as a hay rake he let his eye rove about the place as one who re gards big eyed hogs in the potato patch his gaze rested at length upon miss carrington he rose and went to her table with a lateral shining smile and a blush of pleased trepidation how re ye miss posie he said in accents not to be doubted don t ye remember me bill sum mers the summerses that lived back of the black smith shop i reckon i ve growed up some since ye left cranberry corners liza perry lowed i might see ye

beck oned to the waiter the newspaper man brightened a little and mentioned absinthe the youth with parted hair was plunged into melancholy the guests of the rathskeller laughed clinked glasses and enjoyed the comedy that posie carrington was treat ing them to after her regular performance a few cynical ones whispered press agent and smiled wisely posie carrington laid her dimpled and desirable chin upon her hands and forgot her audience a faculty that had won her laurels for her i don t seem to recollect any bill summers she said thoughtfully gazing straight into the innocent blue eyes of the rustic young man but i know the summerses all right i guess there ain t many changes in the old town you see any of my folks lately and then highsmith played his trump the part of sol haytosser called for pathos as well as comedy miss carrington should see that he could do that as well miss posie said bill summers i was up to your folkeses house jist two or three days ago no there ain t many changes to speak of the lilac bush by the kitchen window is over a foot higher and the elm in the front yard died and had to be cut down and yet it don t seem the same place that it used to be how s

shoe tracks in the dust and somethin tells me she ll come back that way ag in when she s weary of the world and begins to think about her old mother when i was comin away concluded bill i pulled this off n the bush by the front steps i thought maybe i might see you in the city and i knowed you d like somethin from the old home he took from his coat pocket a rose a drooping yellow velvet odorous rose that hung its bead in the foul atmosphere of that tainted rathskeller like a virgin bowing before the hot breath of the lions in a roman arena miss carrington s penetrating but musical laugh rose above the orcbestra s rendering of bluebells oh say she cried with glee ain t those poky places the limit i just know that two hours at cranberry corners would give me the horrors now well i m awful glad to have seen you mr summers guess i ll bustle around to the hotel now and get my beauty sleep she thrust the yellow rose into the bosom of her wonderful dainty silken garments stood up and nodded imperiously at herr goldstein her three companions and bill summers at tended her to her cab when her flounces and streamers were all safely tucked inside she dazzled them with au revoirs from her shining eyes and teeth come around to the hotel and see me bill before you leave the city she called as the glittering cab rolled away highsmith still in his make up went with herr goldstein to a cafe booth bright idea eh asked the smiling actor ought to land sol haytosser for me don t you think the little lady never once tumbled i didn t bear your conversation said goldstein but your make up and acting was k here s to your success you d better call on miss carrington early to morrow and strike her for the part i don t see how she can keep from being satisfied with your exhibition of ability at a m on the next day highsmith hand some dressed in the latest mode confident with a fuchsia in his button bole sent up his card to miss carrington in her select apartment hotel he was shown up and received by the actress s french maid i am sorree said mlle hortense but i am to say this to all it is with great regret mees car rington have cancelled all engagements on the stage and have returned to live in that how you call that town cranberry cornaire the clarion call half of this story can be found in the records of the police department the other half belong behind the business counter of a newspaper office one afternoon two weeks after millionaire nor cross was found in his apartment murdered by a bur glar the murderer while strolling serenely down broadway ran plump against detective barney woods is that you johnny kernan asked woods who had been near sighted in public for five years no less cried kernan heartily if it isn t barney woods late and early of old saint jo you ll have to show me what are you doing east do the green goods circulars get out that far said woods i ve been in new york some years i m on the city detective force well well said kernan breathing smiling joy and patting the detective s arm come into muller s said woods and let s hunt a quiet table i d like to talk to you awhile it lacked a few minutes to the hour of four the tides of trade were not yet loosed and they found a quiet corner of the cafe kernan well dressed slightly swaggering self confident seated himself op posite the little detective with his pale sandy mus tache squinting eyes and ready made cheviot suit what business are you in now asked woods you know you left saint jo a year before i did i m selling shares in a copper mine said ker nan i may establish an office here well well and so old barney is a new york detective you always had a turn that way you were on the po lice in saint jo after i left there weren t you six months said woods and now there s one more question johnny i ve followed your record pretty close ever since you did that hotel job in sara toga and i never knew you to use your gun before why did you kill norcross kernan stared for a few moments with concen trated attention at the slice of lemon in his high ball and then be looked at the detective with a sudden crooked brilliant smile how did you guess it barney he asked ad miringly i swear i thought the job was as clean and as smooth as a peeled onion did i leave a string hanging out anywhere woods laid upon the table a small gold pencil in tended for a watch charm it s the one i gave you the last christmas we were in saint jo i ve got your shaving mug yet i found this under a corner of the rug in norcross s room i warn you to be careful what you say i ve got it put on to you johnny we were old friends once but i must do my duty you ll have to go to the chair for norcross kernan laughed my luck stays with me said be who d have thought old barney was on my trail he slipped one hand inside his coat in an instant woods had a revolver against his side put it away said kernan wrinkling his nose i m only investigating aha it takes nine tailors to make a man but one can do a man up there s a hole in that vest pocket i took that pencil off my chain and slipped it in there in case of a scrap put up your gun barney and i ll tell you why i had to shoot norcross the old fool started down the hall after me popping at the buttons on the back of my coat with a peevish little and i had to stop him the old lady was a darling she just lay in bed and saw her diamond necklace go with out a chirp while she begged like a panhandler to have back a little thin gold ring with a garnet worth about guess she married old norcross for his money all right don t they hang on to the little trinkets from the man who lost out though there were six rings two brooches and a chatelaine watch fifteen thousand would cover the lot i warned you not to talk said woods oh that s all right said kernan the stuff is in my suit case at the hotel and now i ll tell you why i m talking because it s safe i m talking to a man i know you owe me a thousand dollars bar ney woods and even if you wanted to arrest me your hand wouldn t make the move i haven t forgotten said woods you counted out twenty fifties without a word i ll pay it back some day that thousand saved me and well they were piling my furniture out on the sidewalk when i got back to the house and so continued kernan you being barney woods born as true as steel and bound to play a white man s game can t lift a finger to arrest the man you re indebted to oh i have to study men as well as yale locks and window fastenings in my business now keep quiet while i ring for the waiter i ve had a thirst for a year or two that wor ries me a little if i m ever caught the lucky sleuth will have to divide honors with old boy booze but i never drink during business hours after a job i can crook elbows with my old friend barney with a clear conscience what are you taking the waiter came with the little decanters and the siphon and left them alone again you ve called the turn said woods as he rolled the little gold pencil about with a thoughtful fore finger i ve got to pass you up i can t lay a hand on you if i d a paid that money back but i didn t and that settles it it s a bad break i m making johnny but i can t dodge it you helped me once and it calls for the same i knew it said kernan raising his glass with a flushed smile of self appreciation i can judge men here s to barney for he s a jolly good fellow i don t believe went on woods quietly as if be were thinking aloud that if accounts had been square between you and me all the money in all the banks in new york could have bought you out of my hands to night i know it couldn t said kernan that s why i knew i was safe with you most people continued the detective look side ways at my business they don t class it among the fine arts and the professions but i ve always taken a kind of fool pride in it and here is where i go busted i guess i m a man first and a detective afterward i ve got to let you go and then i ve got to resign from the force i guess i can drive an ex press wagon your thousand dollars is further off than ever johnny oh you re welcome to it said kernan with a lordly air i d be willing to call the debt off but i know you wouldn t have it it was a lucky day for me when you borrowed it and now let s drop the subject i m off to the west on a morning train i know a place out there where i can negotiate the norcross sparks drink up barney and forget your troubles we ll have a jolly time while the police are knocking their heads together over the case i ve got one of my sahara thirsts on to night but i m in the bands the unofficial bands of my old friend barney and i won t even dream of a cop and then as kernan s ready finger kept the but ton and the waiter working his weak point a tre mendous vanity and arrogant egotism began to show itself he recounted story after story of his suc cessful plunderings ingenious plots and infamous transgressions until woods with all his familiarity with evil doers felt growing within him a cold ab horrence toward the utterly vicious man who had once been his benefactor i m disposed of of course said woods at length but i advise you to keep under

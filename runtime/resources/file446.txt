nor old nor a boy to my surprise van sweller turned upon me a look of frank pleasure i am glad to hear you say that he said heartily i used those words because i have been forced to say them so often they really are contemptible thanks for correcting me dear old boy still i must admit that van sweller s conduct in the park that morning was almost without flaw the courage the dash the modesty the skill and fidelity that he displayed atoned for everything this is the way the story runs van sweller has been a gentleman member of the rugged riders the company that made a war with a foreign country famous among his comrades was lawrence o roon a man whom van sweller liked a strange thing and a hazardous one in fiction was that van sweller and o roon resembled each other mightily in face form and general appearance after the war van sweller pulled wires and o roon was made a mounted policeman now one night in new york there are commemorations and libations by old comrades and in the morning mounted policeman o roon unused to potent liquids another premise hazardous in fiction finds the earth bucking and bounding like a bronco with no stirrup into which he may insert foot and save his honor and his badge noblesse oblige surely so out along the driveways and bridle paths trots hudson van sweller in the uniform of his incapacitated comrade as like unto him as one french pea is unto a petit pois it is of course jolly larks for van sweller who has wealth and social position enough for him to masquerade safely even as a police commissioner doing his duty if he wished to do so but society not given to scanning the countenances of mounted policemen sees nothing unusual in the officer on the beat and then comes the runaway that is a fine scene the swaying victoria the impetuous daft horses plunging through the line of scattering vehicles the driver stupidly holding his broken reins and the ivory white face of amy ffolliott as she clings desperately with each slender hand fear has come and gone it has left her expression pensive and just a little pleading for life is not so bitter and then the clatter and swoop of mounted policeman van sweller oh it was but the story has not yet been printed when it is you shall learn bow he sent his bay like a bullet after the imperilled victoria a crichton a croesus and a centaur in one he hurls the invincible combination into the chase when the story is printed you will admire the breathless scene where van sweller checks the headlong team and then he looks into amy ffolliott s eyes and sees two things the possibilities of a happiness he has long sought and a nascent promise of it he is unknown to her but he stands in her sight illuminated by the hero s potent glory she his and he hers by all the golden fond unreasonable laws of love and light literature ay that is a rich moment and it will stir you to find van sweller in that fruitful nick of time thinking of his comrade o roon who is cursing his gyrating bed and incapable legs in an unsteady room in a west side hotel while van sweller holds his badge and his honor van sweller hears miss ffolliott s voice thrillingly asking the name of her preserver if hudson van sweller in policeman s uniform has saved the life of palpitating beauty in the park where is mounted policeman o roon in whose territory the deed is done how quickly by a word can the hero reveal himself thus discarding his masquerade of ineligibility and doubling the romance but there is his friend van sweller touches his cap it s nothing miss he says sturdily that s what we are paid for to do our duty and away he rides but the story does not end there as i have said van sweller carried off the park scene to my decided satisfaction even to me he was a hero when he foreswore for the sake of his friend the romantic promise of his adventure it was later in the day amongst the more exacting conventions that encompass the society hero when we had our liveliest disagreement at noon he went to o roon s room and found him far enough recovered to return to his post which he at once did at about six o clock in the afternoon van sweller fingered his watch and flashed at me a brief look full of such shrewd cunning that i suspected him at once time to dress for dinner old man he said with exaggerated carelessness very well i answered without giving him a clew to my suspicions i will go with you to your rooms and see that you do the thing properly i suppose that every author must be a valet to his own hero he affected cheerful acceptance of my somewhat officious proposal to accompany him i could see that he was annoyed by it and that fact fastened deeper in my mind the conviction that he was meditating some act of treachery when he had reached his apartments he said to me with a too patronizing air there are as you perhaps know quite a number of little distinguishing touches to be had out of the dressing process some writers rely almost wholly upon them i suppose that i am to ring for my man and that he is to enter noiselessly with an expressionless countenance he may enter i said with decision and only enter valets do not usually enter a room shouting college songs or with st vitus s dance in their faces so the contrary may be assumed without fatuous or gratuitous asseveration i must ask you to pardon me

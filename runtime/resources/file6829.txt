did if this should meet the eye of the imam of muskat may it quicken his whim to visit the land of the free otherwise i fear that i shall be longer than a short time separated from my dollars three hygeia at the solito if you are knowing in the chronicles of the ring you will recall to mind an event in the early nineties when for a minute and sundry odd seconds a champion and a would be faced each other on the alien side of an international river so brief a conflict had rarely imposed upon the fair promise of true sport the reporters made what they could of it but divested of padding the action was sadly fugacious the champion merely smote his victim turned his back upon him remarking i know what i done to dat stiff and extended an arm like a ship s mast for his glove to be removed which accounts for a trainload of extremely disgusted gentlemen in an uproar of fancy vests and neck wear being spilled from their pullmans in san antonio in the early morning following the fight which also partly accounts for the unhappy predicament in which cricket mcguire found himself as he tumbled from his car and sat upon the depot platform torn by a spasm of that hollow racking cough so familiar to san antonian ears at that time in the uncertain light of dawn that way passed curtis raidler the nueces county cattleman may his shadow never measure under six foot two the cattleman out this early to catch the south bound for his ranch station stopped at the side of the distressed patron of sport and spoke in the kindly drawl of his ilk and region got it pretty bad bud cricket mcguire ex feather weight prizefighter tout jockey follower of the ponies all round sport and manipulator of the gum balls and walnut shells looked up pugnaciously at the imputation cast by bud g wan he rasped telegraph pole i didn t ring for yer another paroxysm wrung him and he leaned limply against a convenient baggage truck raidler waited patiently glancing around at the white hats short overcoats and big cigars thronging the platform you re from the no th ain t you bud he asked when the other was partially recovered come down to see the fight fight snapped mcguire puss in the corner twas a hypodermic injection handed him just one like a squirt of dope and he s asleep and no tanbark needed in front of his residence fight he rattled a bit coughed and went on hardly addressing the cattleman but rather for the relief of voicing his troubles no more dead sure t ings for me but rus sage himself would have snatched at it five to one dat de boy from cork wouldn t stay t ree rounds is what i invested in put my last cent on and could already smell the sawdust in dat all night joint of jimmy delaney s on t irty seventh street i was goin to buy and den say telegraph pole what a gazaboo a guy is to put his whole roll on one turn of the gaboozlum you re plenty right said the big cattleman more specially when you lose son you get up and light out for a hotel you got a mighty bad cough had it long lungs said mcguire comprehensively i got it the croaker says i ll come to time for six months longer maybe a year if i hold my gait i wanted to settle down and take care of myself dat s why i speculated on dat five to one perhaps i had a t ousand iron dollars saved up if i winned i was goin to buy delaney s cafe who d a t ought dat stiff would take a nap in de foist round say it s a hard deal commented raidler looking down at the diminutive form of mcguire crumpled against the truck but you go to a hotel and rest there s the menger and the maverick and and the fi th av noo and the waldorf astoria mimicked mcguire told you i went broke i m on de bum proper i ve got one dime left maybe a trip to europe or a sail in me private yacht would fix me up pa per he flung his dime at a newsboy got his express propped his back against the truck and was at once rapt in the account of his waterloo as expanded by the ingenious press curtis raidler interrogated an enormous gold watch and laid his hand on mcguire s shoulder come on bud he said we got three minutes to catch the train sarcasm seemed to be mcguire s vein you ain t seen me cash in any chips or call a turn since i told you i was broke a minute ago have you friend chase yourself away you re going down to my ranch said the cattleman and stay till you get well six months ll fix you good as new he lifted mcguire with one hand and half dragged him in the direction of the train what about the money said mcguire struggling weakly to escape money for what asked raidler puzzled they eyed each other not understanding for they touched only as at the gear of bevelled cog wheels at right angles and moving upon different axes passengers on the south bound saw them seated together and wondered at the conflux of two such antipodes mcguire was five feet one with a countenance belonging to either yokohama or dublin bright beady of eye bony of cheek and jaw scarred toughened broken and reknit indestructible grisly gladiatorial as a hornet he was a type neither new nor unfamiliar raidler was the product of a different soil six feet two in height miles broad and no deeper than a crystal brook he represented the union of the west and south few accurate pictures of his kind have been made for art galleries are so small and the mutoscope is as yet unknown in texas after all the only possible medium of portrayal of raidler s kind would be the fresco something high and simple and cool and unframed they were rolling southward on the international the timber was huddling into little dense green motts at rare distances before the inundation of the downright vert prairies this was the land of the ranches the domain of the kings of the kine mcguire sat collapsed into his corner of the seat receiving with acid suspicion the conversation of the cattleman what was the game of this big geezer who was carrying him off altruism would have been mcguire s last guess he ain t no farmer thought the captive and he ain t no con man for sure w at s his lay you trail in cricket and see how many cards he draws you re up against it anyhow you got a nickel and gallopin consumption and you better lay low lay low and see w at s his game at rincon a hundred miles from san antonio they left the train for a buckboard which was waiting there for raidler in this they travelled the thirty miles between the station and their destination if anything could this drive should have stirred the acrimonious mcguire to a sense of his ransom they sped upon velvety wheels across an exhilarant savanna the pair of spanish ponies struck a nimble tireless trot which gait they occasionally relieved by a wild untrammelled gallop the air was wine and seltzer perfumed as they absorbed it with the delicate redolence of prairie flowers the road perished and the buckboard swam the uncharted billows of the grass itself steered by the practised hand of raidler to whom each tiny distant mott of trees was a signboard each convolution of the low hills a voucher of course and distance but mcguire reclined upon his spine seeing nothing but a desert and receiving the cattleman s advances with sullen distrust w at s he up to was the burden of his thoughts w at kind of a gold brick has the big guy got to sell mcguire was only applying the measure of the streets he had walked to a range bounded by the horizon and the fourth dimension a week before while riding the prairies raidler had come upon a sick and weakling calf deserted and bawling without dismounting he had reached and slung the distressed bossy across his saddle and dropped it at the ranch for the boys to attend to it was impossible for mcguire to know or comprehend that in the eyes of the cattleman his case and that of the calf were identical in interest and demand upon his assistance a creature was ill and helpless he had the power to render aid these were the only postulates required for the cattleman to act they formed his system of logic and the most of his creed mcguire was the seventh invalid whom raidler had picked up thus casually in san antonio where so many thousand go for the ozone that is said to linger about its contracted streets five of them had been guests of solito ranch until they had been able to leave cured or better and exhausting the vocabulary of tearful gratitude one came too late but rested very comfortably at last under a ratama tree in the garden so then it was no surprise to the ranchhold when the buckboard spun to the door and raidler took up his debile protege like a handful of rags and set him down upon the gallery mcguire looked upon things strange to him the ranch house was the best in the country it was built of brick hauled one hundred miles by wagon but it was of but one story and its four rooms were completely encircled by a mud floor gallery the miscellaneous setting of horses dogs saddles wagons guns and cow punchers paraphernalia oppressed the metropolitan eyes of the wrecked sportsman well here we are at home said raidler cheeringly it s a h l of a looking place said mcguire promptly as he rolled upon the gallery floor in a fit of coughing we ll try to make it comfortable for you buddy said the cattleman gently it ain t fine inside but it s the outdoors anyway that ll do you the most good this ll be your room in here anything we got you ask for it he led mcguire into the east room the floor was bare and clean white curtains waved in the gulf breeze through the open windows a big willow rocker two straight chairs a long table covered with newspapers pipes tobacco spurs and cartridges stood in the centre some well mounted heads of deer and one of an enormous black javeli projected from the walls a wide cool cot bed stood in a corner nueces county people regarded this guest chamber as fit for a prince mcguire showed his eyeteeth at it he took out his nickel and spun it up to the ceiling t ought i was lyin about the money did ye well you can frisk me if you wanter dat s the last simoleon in the treasury who s goin to pay the cattleman s clear grey eyes looked steadily from under his grizzly brows into the huckleberry optics of his guest after a little he said simply and not ungraciously i ll be much obliged to you son if you won t mention money any more once was quite a plenty folks i ask to my ranch don t have to pay anything and they very scarcely ever offers it supper ll be ready in half an hour there s water in the pitcher and some cooler to drink in that red jar hanging on the gallery where s the bell asked mcguire looking about bell for what bell to ring for things i can t see here he exploded in a sudden weak fury i never asked you to bring me here i never held you up for a cent i never gave you a hard luck story till you asked me here i am fifty miles from a bellboy or a cocktail i m sick i can t hustle gee but i m up against it mcguire fell upon the cot and sobbed shiveringly raidler went to the door and called a slender bright complexioned mexican youth about twenty came quickly raidler spoke to him in spanish ylario it is in my mind that i promised you the position of vaquero on the san carlos range at the fall rodeo si senor such was your goodness listen this senorito is my friend he is very sick place yourself at his side attend to his wants at all times have much patience and care with him and when he is well or and when he is well instead of vaquero i will make you mayordomo of the rancho de las piedras esta bueno si si mil gracias senor ylario tried to kneel upon the floor in his gratitude but the cattleman kicked at him benevolently growling none of your opery house antics now ten minutes later ylario came from mcguire s room and stood before raidler the little senor he announced presents his compliments raidler credited ylario with the preliminary and desires some pounded ice one hot bath one gin feez z that the windows be all closed toast one shave one newyorkheral cigarettes and to send one telegram raidler took a quart bottle of whisky from his medicine cabinet here take him this he said thus was instituted the reign of terror at the solito ranch for a few weeks mcguire blustered and boasted and swaggered before the cow punchers who rode in for miles around to see this latest importation of raidler s he was an absolutely new experience to them he explained to them all the intricate points of sparring and the tricks of training and defence he opened to their minds view all the indecorous life of a tagger after professional sports his jargon of slang was a continuous joy and surprise to them his gestures his strange poses his frank ribaldry of tongue and principle fascinated them he was like a being from a new world strange to say this new world he had entered did not exist to him he was an utter egoist of bricks and mortar he had dropped out he felt into open space for a time and all it contained was an audience for his reminiscences neither the limitless freedom of the prairie days nor the grand hush of the close drawn spangled nights touched him all the hues of aurora could not win him from the pink pages of a sporting journal get something for nothing was his mission in life thirty seventh street was his goal nearly two months after his arrival he began to complain that he felt worse it was then that he became the ranch s incubus its harpy its old man of the sea he shut himself in his room like some venomous kobold or flibbertigibbet whining complaining cursing accusing the keynote of his plaint was that he had been inveigled into a gehenna against his will that he was dying of neglect and lack of comforts with all his dire protestations of increasing illness to the eye of others he remained unchanged his currant like eyes were as bright and diabolic as ever his voice was as rasping his callous face with the skin drawn tense as a drum head had no flesh to lose a flush on his prominent cheek bones each afternoon hinted that a clinical thermometer might have revealed a symptom and percussion might have established the fact that mcguire was breathing with only one lung but his appearance remained the same in constant attendance upon him was ylario whom the coming reward of the mayordomoship must have greatly stimulated for mcguire chained him to a bitter existence the air the man s only chance for life he commanded to be kept out by closed windows and drawn curtains the room was always blue and foul with cigarette smoke whosoever entered it must sit suffocating and listen to the imp s interminable gasconade concerning his scandalous career the oddest thing of all was the relation existing between mcguire and his benefactor the attitude of the invalid toward the cattleman was something like that of a peevish perverse child toward an indulgent parent when raidler would leave the ranch mcguire would fall into a fit of malevolent silent sullenness when he returned he would be met by a string of violent and stinging reproaches raidler s attitude toward his charge was quite inexplicable in its way the cattleman seemed actually to assume and feel the character assigned to him by mcguire s intemperate accusations the character of tyrant and guilty oppressor he seemed to have adopted the responsibility of the fellow s condition and he always met his tirades with a pacific patient and even remorseful kindness that never altered one day raidler said to him try more air son you can have the buckboard and a driver every day if you ll go try a week or two in one of the cow camps i ll fix you up plumb comfortable the ground and the air next to it them s the things to cure you i knowed a man from philadelphy sicker than you are got lost on the guadalupe and slept on the bare grass in sheep camps for two weeks well sir it started him getting well which he done close to the ground that s where the medicine in the air stays try a little hossback riding now there s a gentle pony what ve i done to yer screamed mcguire did i ever doublecross yer did i ask you to bring me here drive me out to your camps if you wanter or stick a knife in me and save trouble ride i can t lift my feet i couldn t sidestep a jab from a five year old kid that s what your d d ranch has done for me there s nothing to eat nothing to see and nobody to talk to but a lot of reubens who don t know a punching bag from a lobster salad it s a lonesome place for certain apologised raidler abashedly we got plenty but it s rough enough anything you think of you want the boys ll ride up and fetch it down for you it was chad murchison a cow puncher from the circle bar outfit who first suggested that mcguire s illness was fraudulent chad had brought a basket of grapes for him thirty miles and four out of his way tied to his saddle horn after remaining in the smoke tainted room for a while he emerged and bluntly confided his suspicions to raidler his arm said chad is harder n a diamond he interduced me to what he called a shore perplexus punch and twas like being kicked twice by a mustang he s playin it low down on you curt he ain t no sicker n i am i hate to say it but the runt s workin you for range and shelter the cattleman s ingenuous mind refused to entertain chad s view of the case and when later he came to apply the test doubt entered not into his motives one day about noon two men drove up to the ranch alighted hitched and came in to dinner standing and general invitations being the custom of the country one of them was a great san antonio doctor whose costly services had been engaged by a wealthy cowman who had been laid low by an accidental bullet he was now being driven back to the station to take the train back to town after dinner raidler took him aside pushed a twenty dollar bill against his hand and said doc there s a young chap in that room i guess has got a bad case of consumption i d like for you to look him over and see just how bad he is and if we can do anything for him how much was that dinner i just ate mr raidler said the doctor bluffly looking over his spectacles raidler returned the money to his pocket the doctor immediately entered mcguire s room and the cattleman seated himself upon a heap of saddles on the gallery ready to reproach himself in the event the verdict should be unfavourable in ten minutes the doctor came briskly out your man he said promptly is as sound as a new dollar his lungs are better than mine respiration temperature and pulse normal chest expansion four inches not a sign of weakness anywhere of course i didn t examine for the bacillus but it isn t there you can put my name to the diagnosis even cigarettes and a vilely close room haven t hurt him coughs does he well you tell him it isn t necessary you asked if there is anything we could do for him well i advise you to set him digging post holes or breaking mustangs there s our team ready good day sir and like a puff of wholesome blustery wind the doctor was off raidler reached out and plucked a leaf from a mesquite bush by the railing and began chewing it thoughtfully the branding season was at hand and the next morning ross hargis foreman of the outfit was mustering his force of some twenty five men at the ranch ready to start for the san carlos range where the work was to begin by six o clock the horses were all saddled the grub wagon ready and the cow punchers were swinging themselves upon their mounts when raidler bade them wait a boy was bringing up an extra pony bridled and saddled to the gate raidler walked to mcguire s room and threw open the door mcguire was lying on his cot not yet dressed smoking get up said the cattleman and his voice was clear and brassy like a bugle how s that asked mcguire a little startled get up and dress i can stand a rattlesnake but i hate a liar do i have to tell you again he caught mcguire by the neck and stood him on the floor say friend cried mcguire wildly are you bug house i m sick see i ll croak if i got to hustle what ve i done to yer he began his chronic whine i never asked yer to put on your clothes called raidler in a rising tone swearing stumbling shivering keeping his amazed shining eyes upon the now menacing form of the aroused cattleman mcguire managed to tumble into his clothes then raidler took him by the collar and shoved him out and across the yard to the extra pony hitched at the gate the cow punchers lolled in their saddles open mouthed take this man said raidler to ross hargis and put him to work make him work hard sleep hard and eat hard you boys know i done what i could for him and he was welcome yesterday the best doctor in san antone examined him and says he s got the lungs of a burro and the constitution of a steer you know what to do with him ross ross hargis only smiled grimly aw said mcguire looking intently at raidler with a peculiar expression upon his face the croaker said i was all right did he said i was fakin did he you put him onto me you t ought i wasn t sick you said i was a liar say friend i talked rough i know but i didn t mean most of it if you felt like i did aw i forgot i ain t sick the croaker says well friend now i ll go work for yer here s where you play even he sprang into the saddle easily as a bird got the quirt from the horn and gave his pony a slash with it cricket who once brought in good boy by a neck at hawthorne and a to shot had his foot in the stirrups again mcguire led the cavalcade as they dashed away for san carlos and the cow punchers gave a yell of applause as they closed in behind his dust but in less than a mile he had lagged to the rear and was last man when they struck the patch of high chaparral below the horse pens behind a clump of this he drew rein and held a handkerchief to his mouth he took it away drenched with bright arterial blood and threw it carefully into a clump of prickly pear then he slashed with his quirt again gasped g wan to his astonished pony and galloped after the gang that night raidler received a message from his old home in alabama there had been a death in the family an estate was to divide and they called for him to come daylight found him in the buckboard skimming the prairies for the station it was two months before he returned when he arrived at the ranch house he found it well nigh deserted save for ylario who acted as a kind of steward during his absence little by little the youth made him acquainted with the work done while he was away the branding camp he was informed was still doing business on account of many severe storms the cattle had been badly scattered and the branding had been accomplished but slowly the camp was now in the valley of the guadalupe twenty miles away by the way said raidler suddenly remembering that fellow i sent along with them mcguire is he working yet i do not know said ylario mans from the camp come verree few times to the ranch so plentee work with the leetle calves they no say oh i think that fellow mcguire he dead much time ago dead said raidler what you talking about verree sick fellow mcguire replied ylario with a shrug of his shoulder i theenk he no live one two month when he go away shucks said raidler he humbugged you too did he the doctor examined him and said he was sound as a mesquite knot that doctor said ylario smiling he tell you so that doctor no see mcguire talk up ordered raidler what the devil do you mean mcguire continued the boy tranquilly he getting drink water outside when that doctor come in room that doctor take me and pound me all over here with his fingers putting his hand to his chest i not know for what he put his ear here and here and here and listen i not know for what he put little glass stick in my mouth he feel my arm here he make me count like whisper so twenty treinta cuarenta who knows concluded ylario with a deprecating spread of his hands for what that doctor do those verree droll and such like things what horses are up asked raidler shortly paisano is grazing out behind the little corral senor saddle him for me at once within a very few minutes the cattleman was mounted and away paisano well named after that ungainly but swift running bird struck into his long lope that ate up the ground like a strip of macaroni in two hours and a quarter raidler from a gentle swell saw the branding camp by a water hole in the guadalupe sick with expectancy of the news he feared he rode up dismounted and dropped paisano s reins so gentle was his heart that at that moment he would have pleaded guilty to the murder of mcguire the only being in the camp was the cook who was just arranging the hunks of barbecued beef and distributing the tin coffee cups for supper raidler evaded a direct question concerning the one subject in his mind everything all right in camp pete he managed to inquire so so said pete conservatively grub give out twice wind scattered the cattle and we ve had to rake the brush for forty mile i need a new coffee pot and the mosquitos is some more hellish than common the boys all well pete was no optimist besides inquiries concerning the health of cow punchers were not only superfluous but bordered on flaccidity it was not like the boss to make them what s left of em don t miss no calls to grub the cook conceded what s left of em repeated raidler in a husky voice mechanically he began to look around for mcguire s grave he had in his mind a white slab such as he had seen in the alabama church yard but immediately he knew that was foolish sure said pete what s left cow camps change in two months some s gone raidler nerved himself that chap i sent along mcguire did he say interrupted pete rising with a chunk of corn bread in each hand that was a dirty shame sending that poor sick kid to a cow camp a doctor that couldn t tell he was graveyard meat ought to be skinned with a cinch buckle game as he was too it s a scandal among snakes lemme tell you what he done first night in camp the boys started to initiate him in the leather breeches degree ross hargis busted him one swipe with his chaparreras and what do you reckon the poor child did got up the little skeeter and licked ross licked ross hargis licked him good hit him plenty and everywhere and hard ross d just get up and pick out a fresh place to lay down on agin then that mcguire goes off there and lays down with his head in the grass and bleeds a hem ridge they calls it he lays there eighteen hours by the watch and they can t budge him then ross hargis who loves any man who can lick him goes to work and damns the doctors from greenland to poland chiny and him and green branch johnson they gets mcguire into a tent and spells each other feedin him chopped raw meat and whisky but it looks like the kid ain t got no appetite to git well for they misses him from the tent in the night and finds him rootin in the grass and likewise a drizzle fallin g wan he says lemme go and die like i wanter he said i was a liar and a fake and i was playin sick lemme alone two weeks went on the cook he laid around not noticin nobody and then a sudden thunder filled the air and a score of galloping centaurs crashed through the brush into camp illustrious rattlesnakes exclaimed pete springing all ways at once here s the boys come and i m an assassinated man if supper ain t ready in three minutes but raidler saw only one thing a little brown faced grinning chap springing from his saddle in the full light of the fire mcguire was not like that and yet in another instant the cattleman was holding him by the hand and shoulder son son how goes it was all he found to say close to the ground says you shouted mcguire crunching raidler s fingers in a grip of steel and dat s where i found it healt and strengt and tumbled to what a cheap skate i been actin t anks fer kickin me out old man and say de joke s on dat croaker ain t it i looked t rough the window and see him playin tag on dat dago kid s solar plexus you son of a tinker growled the cattleman whyn t you talk up and say the doctor never examined you ah g wan said mcguire with a flash of his old asperity nobody can t bluff me you never ast me you made your spiel and you t rowed me out and i let it go at dat and say friend dis chasin cows is outer sight dis is de whitest bunch of sports i ever travelled with you ll let me stay won t yer old man raidler looked wonderingly toward ross hargis that cussed little runt remarked ross tenderly is the jo dartin est hustler and the hardest hitter in anybody s cow camp an afternoon miracle at the united states end of an international river bridge four armed rangers sweltered in a little dobe hut keeping a fairly faithful espionage upon the lagging trail of passengers from the mexican side bud dawson proprietor of the top notch saloon had on the evening previous violently ejected from his premises one leandro garcia for alleged violation of the top notch code of behaviour garcia had mentioned twenty four hours as a limit by which time he would call and collect a painful indemnity for personal satisfaction this mexican although a tremendous braggart was thoroughly courageous and each side of the river respected him for one of these attributes he and a following of similar bravoes were addicted to the pastime of retrieving towns from stagnation the day designated by garcia for retribution was to be further signalised on the american side by a cattlemen s convention a bull fight and an old settlers barbecue and picnic knowing the avenger to be a man of his word and believing it prudent to court peace while three such gently social relaxations were in progress captain mcnulty of the ranger company stationed there detailed his lieutenant and three men for duty at the end of the bridge their instructions were to prevent the invasion of garcia either alone or attended by his gang travel was slight that sultry afternoon and the rangers swore gently and mopped their brows in their convenient but close quarters for an hour no one had crossed save an old woman enveloped in a brown wrapper and a black mantilla driving before her a burro loaded with kindling wood tied in small bundles for peddling then three shots were fired down the street the sound coming clear and snappy through the still air the four rangers quickened from sprawling symbolic figures of indolence to alert life but only one rose to his feet three turned their eyes beseechingly but hopelessly upon the fourth who had gotten nimbly up and was buckling his cartridge belt around him the three knew that lieutenant bob buckley in command would allow no man of them the privilege of investigating a row when he himself might go the agile broad chested lieutenant without a change of expression in his smooth yellow brown melancholy face shot the belt strap through the guard of the buckle hefted his sixes in their holsters as a belle gives the finishing touches to her toilette caught up his winchester and dived for the door there he paused long enough to caution his comrades to maintain their watch upon the bridge and then plunged into the broiling highway the three relapsed into resigned inertia and plaintive comment i ve heard of fellows grumbled broncho leathers what was wedded to danger but if bob buckley ain t committed bigamy with trouble i m a son of a gun peculiarness of bob is inserted the nueces kid he ain t had proper trainin he never learned how to git skeered now a man ought to be skeered enough when he tackles a fuss to hanker after readin his name on the list of survivors anyway buckley commented ranger no who was a misguided eastern man burdened with an education scraps in such a solemn manner that i have been led to doubt its spontaneity i m not quite onto his system but he fights like tybalt by the book of arithmetic i never heard mentioned broncho about any of dibble s ways of mixin scrappin and cipherin triggernometry suggested the nueces infant that s rather better than i hoped from you nodded the easterner approvingly the other meaning is that buckley never goes into a fight without giving away weight he seems to dread taking the slightest advantage that s quite close to foolhardiness when you are dealing with horse thieves and fence cutters who would ambush you any night and shoot you in the back if they could buckley s too full of sand he ll play horatius and hold the bridge once too often some day i m on there drawled the kid i mind that bridge gang in the reader me i go instructed for the other chap spurious somebody the one that fought and pulled his freight to fight em on some other day anyway summed up broncho bob s about the gamest man i ever see along the rio bravo great sam houston if she gets any hotter she ll sizzle broncho whacked at a scorpion with his four pound stetson felt and the three watchers relapsed into comfortless silence how well bob buckley had kept his secret since these men for two years his side comrades in countless border raids and dangers thus spake of him not knowing that he was the most arrant physical coward in all that rio bravo country neither his friends nor his enemies had suspected him of aught else than the finest courage it was purely a physical cowardice and only by an extreme grim effort of will had he forced his craven body to do the bravest deeds scourging himself always as a monk whips his besetting sin buckley threw himself with apparent recklessness into every danger with the hope of some day ridding himself of the despised affliction but each successive test brought no relief and the ranger s face by nature adapted to cheerfulness and good humour became set to the guise of gloomy melancholy thus while the frontier admired his deeds and his prowess was celebrated in print and by word of mouth in many camp fires in the valley of the bravo his heart was sick within him only himself knew of the horrible tightening of the chest the dry mouth the weakening of the spine the agony of the strung nerves the never failing symptoms of his shameful malady one mere boy in his company was wont to enter a fray with a leg perched flippantly about the horn of his saddle a cigarette hanging from his lips which emitted smoke and original slogans of clever invention buckley would have given a year s pay to attain that devil may care method once the debonair youth said to him buck you go into a scrap like it was a funeral not he added with a complimentary wave of his tin cup but what it generally is buckley s conscience was of the new england order with western adjustments and he continued to get his rebellious body into as many difficulties as possible wherefore on that sultry afternoon he chose to drive his own protesting limbs to investigation of that sudden alarm that had startled the peace and dignity of the state two squares down the street stood the top notch saloon here buckley came upon signs of recent upheaval a few curious spectators pressed about its front entrance grinding beneath their heels the fragments of a plate glass window inside buckley found bud dawson utterly ignoring a bullet wound in his shoulder while he feelingly wept at having to explain why he failed to drop the blamed masquerooter who shot him at the entrance of the ranger bud turned appealingly to him for confirmation of the devastation he might have dealt you know buck i d a plum got him first rattle if i d thought a minute come in a masque rootin playin female till he got the drop and turned loose i never reached for a gun thinkin it was sure chihuahua betty or mrs atwater or anyhow one of the mayfield girls comin a gunnin which they might liable as not i never thought of that blamed garcia until garcia snapped buckley how did he get over here bud s bartender took the ranger by the arm and led him to the side door there stood a patient grey burro cropping the grass along the gutter with a load of kindling wood tied across its back on the ground lay a black shawl and a voluminous brown dress masquerootin in them things called bud still resisting attempted ministrations to his wounds thought he was a lady till he gave a yell and winged me he went down this side street said the bartender he was alone and he ll hide out till night when his gang comes over you ought to find him in that mexican lay out below the depot he s got a girl down there pancha sales how was he armed asked buckley two pearl handled sixes and a knife keep this for me billy said the ranger handing over his winchester quixotic perhaps but it was bob buckley s way another man and a braver one might have raised a posse to accompany him it was buckley s rule to discard all preliminary advantage the mexican had left behind him a wake of closed doors and an empty street but now people were beginning to emerge from their places of refuge with assumed unconsciousness of anything having happened many citizens who knew the ranger pointed out to him with alacrity the course of garcia s retreat as buckley swung along upon the trail he felt the beginning of the suffocating constriction about his throat the cold sweat under the brim of his hat the old shameful dreaded sinking of his heart as it went down down down in his bosom the morning train of the mexican central had that day been three hours late thus failing to connect with the i g n on the other side of the river passengers for los estados unidos grumblingly sought entertainment in the little swaggering mongrel town of two nations for until the morrow no other train would come to rescue them grumblingly because two days later would begin the great fair and races in san antone consider that at that time san antone was the hub of the wheel of fortune and the names of its spokes were cattle wool faro running horses and ozone in those times cattlemen played at crack loo on the sidewalks with double eagles and gentlemen backed their conception of the fortuitous card with stacks limited in height only by the interference of gravity wherefore thither journeyed the sowers and the reapers they who stampeded the dollars and they who rounded them up especially did the caterers to the amusement of the people haste to san antone two greatest shows on earth were already there and dozens of smallest ones were on the way on a side track near the mean little dobe depot stood a private car left there by the mexican train that morning and doomed by an ineffectual schedule to ignobly await amid squalid surroundings connection with the next day s regular the car had been once a common day coach but those who had sat in it and gringed to the conductor s hat band slips would never have recognised it in its transformation paint and gilding and certain domestic touches had liberated it from any suspicion of public servitude the whitest of lace curtains judiciously screened its windows from its fore end drooped in the torrid air the flag of mexico from its rear projected the stars and stripes and a busy stovepipe the latter reinforcing in its suggestion of culinary comforts the general suggestion of privacy and ease the beholder s eye regarding its gorgeous sides found interest to culminate in a single name in gold and blue letters extending almost its entire length a single name the audacious privilege of royalty and genius doubly then was this arrogant nomenclature here justified for the name was that of alvarita queen of the serpent tribe this her car was back from a triumphant tour of the principal mexican cities and now headed for san antonio where according to promissory advertisement she would exhibit her marvellous dominion and fearless control over deadly and venomous serpents handling them with ease as they coil and hiss to the terror of thousands of tongue tied tremblers one hundred in the shade kept the vicinity somewhat depeopled this quarter of the town was a ragged edge its denizens the bubbling froth of five nations its architecture tent jacal and dobe its distractions the hurdy gurdy and the informal contribution to the sudden stranger s store of experience beyond this dishonourable fringe upon the old town s jowl rose a dense mass of trees surmounting and filling a little hollow through this bickered a small stream that perished down the sheer and disconcerting side of the great canon of the rio bravo del norte in this sordid spot was condemned to remain for certain hours the impotent transport of the queen of the serpent tribe the front door of the car was open its forward end was curtained off into a small reception room here the admiring and propitiatory reporters were wont to sit and transpose the music of senorita alvarita s talk into the more florid key of the press a picture of abraham lincoln hung against a wall one of a cluster of school girls grouped upon stone steps was in another place a third was easter lilies in a blood red frame a neat carpet was under foot a pitcher sweating cold drops and a glass stood on a fragile stand in a willow rocker reading a newspaper sat alvarita spanish you would say andalusian or better still basque that compound like the diamond of darkness and fire hair the shade of purple grapes viewed at midnight eyes long dusky and disquieting with their untroubled directness of gaze face haughty and bold touched with a pretty insolence that gave it life to hasten conviction of her charm but glance at the stacks of handbills in the corner green and yellow and white upon them you see an incompetent presentment of the senorita in her professional garb and pose irresistible in black lace and yellow ribbons she faces you a blue racer is spiralled upon each bare arm coiled twice about her waist and once about her neck his horrid head close to hers you perceive kuku the great eleven foot asian python a hand drew aside the curtain that partitioned the car and a middle aged faded woman holding a knife and a half peeled potato looked in and said alviry are you right busy i m reading the home paper ma what

paper this is the third time he s got away george never will fasten down the lid to his box properly i do believe he s afraid of kuku now i ve got to go hunt him better hurry somebody might hurt him the queen s teeth showed in a gleaming contemptuous smile no danger when they see kuku outside they simply scoot away and buy bromides there s a crick over between here and the river that old scamp d swap his skin any time for a drink of running water i guess i ll find him there all right a few minutes later alvarita stopped upon the forward platform ready for her quest her handsome black skirt was shaped to the most recent proclamation of fashion her spotless shirt waist gladdened the eye in that desert of sunshine a swelling oasis cool and fresh a man s split straw hat sat firmly on her coiled abundant hair beneath her serene round impudent chin a man s four in hand tie was jauntily knotted about a man s high stiff collar a parasol she carried of white silk and its fringe was lace yellowly genuine i will grant gallipolis as to her costume but firmly to seville or valladolid i am held by her eyes castanets balconies mantillas serenades ambuscades escapades all these their dark depths guaranteed ain t you afraid to go out alone alviry queried the queen mother anxiously there s so many rough people about mebbe you d better i never saw anything i was afraid of yet ma specially people and men in particular don t you fret i ll trot along back as soon as i find that runaway scamp the dust lay thick upon the bare ground near the tracks alvarita s eye soon discovered the serrated trail of the escaped python it led across the depot grounds and away down a smaller street in the direction of the little canon as predicted by her a stillness and lack of excitement in the neighbourhood encouraged the hope that as yet the inhabitants were unaware that so formidable a guest traversed their highways the heat had driven them indoors whence outdrifted occasional shrill laughs or the depressing whine of a maltreated concertina in the shade a few mexican children like vivified stolid idols in clay stared from their play vision struck and silent as alvarita came and went here and there a woman peeped from a door and stood dumb reduced to silence by the aspect of the white silk parasol a hundred yards and the limits of the town were passed scattered chaparral succeeding and then a noble grove overflowing the bijou canon through this a small bright stream meandered park like it was with a kind of cockney ruralness further endorsed by the waste papers and rifled tins of picnickers up this stream and down it among its pseudo sylvan glades and depressions wandered the bright and unruffled alvarita once she saw evidence of the recreant reptile s progress in his distinctive trail across a spread of fine sand in the arroyo the living water was bound to lure him he could not be far away so sure was she of his immediate proximity that she perched herself to idle for a time in the curve of a great creeper that looped down from a giant water elm to reach this she climbed from the pathway a little distance up the side of a steep and rugged incline around her chaparral grew thick and high a late blooming ratama tree dispensed from its yellow petals a sweet and persistent odour adown the ravine rustled a seductive wind melancholy with the taste of sodden fallen leaves alvarita removed her hat and undoing the oppressive convolutions of her hair began to slowly arrange it in two long dusky plaits from the obscure depths of a thick clump of evergreen shrubs five feet away two small jewel bright eyes were steadfastly regarding her coiled there lay kuku the great python kuku the magnificent he of the plated muzzle the grooved lips the eleven foot stretch of elegantly and brilliantly mottled skin the great python was viewing his mistress without a sound or motion to disclose his presence perhaps the splendid truant forefelt his capture but screened by the foliage thought to prolong the delight of his escapade what pleasure it was after the hot and dusty car to lie thus smelling the running water and feeling the agreeable roughness of the earth and stones against his body soon very soon the queen would find him and he powerless as a worm in her audacious hands would be returned to the dark chest in the narrow house that ran on wheels alvarita heard a sudden crunching of the gravel below her turning her head she saw a big swarthy mexican with a daring and evil expression contemplating her with an ominous dull eye what do you want she asked as sharply as five hairpins between her lips would permit continuing to plait her hair and looking him over with placid contempt the mexican continued to gaze at her and showed his teeth in a white jagged smile i no hurt y you senorita he said you bet you won t answered the queen shaking back one finished massive plait but don t you think you d better move on not hurt y you no but maybeso take one beso one li l kees you call him the man smiled again and set his foot to ascend the slope alvarita leaned swiftly and picked up a stone the size of a cocoanut vamoose quick she ordered peremptorily you coon the red of insult burned through the mexican s dark skin hidalgo yo he shot between his fangs i am not neg r ro diabla bonita for that you shall pay me he made two quick upward steps this time but the stone hurled by no weak arm struck him square in the chest he staggered back to the footway swerved half around and met another sight that drove all thoughts of the girl from his head she turned her eyes to see what had diverted his interest a man with red brown curling hair and a melancholy sunburned smooth shaven face was coming up the path twenty yards away around the mexican s waist was buckled a pistol belt with two empty holsters he had laid aside his sixes possibly in the jacal of the fair pancha and had forgotten them when the passing of the fairer alvarita had enticed him to her trail his hands now flew instinctively to the holsters but finding the weapons gone he spread his fingers outward with the eloquent abjuring deprecating latin gesture and stood like a rock seeing his plight the newcomer unbuckled his own belt containing two revolvers threw it upon the ground and continued to advance splendid murmured alvarita with flashing eyes as bob buckley according to the mad code of bravery that his sensitive conscience imposed upon his cowardly nerves abandoned his guns and closed in upon his enemy the old inevitable nausea of abject fear wrung him his breath whistled through his constricted air passages his feet seemed like lumps of lead his mouth was dry as dust his heart congested with blood hurt his ribs as it thumped against them the hot june day turned to moist november and still he advanced spurred by a mandatory pride that strained its uttermost against his weakling flesh the distance between the two men slowly lessened the mexican stood immovable waiting when scarce five yards separated them a little shower of loosened gravel rattled down from above to the ranger s feet he glanced upward with instinctive caution a pair of dark eyes brilliantly soft and fierily tender encountered and held his own the most fearful heart and the boldest one in all the rio bravo country exchanged a silent and inscrutable communication alvarita still seated within her vine leaned forward above the breast high chaparral one hand was laid across her bosom one great dark braid curved forward over her shoulder her lips were parted her face was lit with what seemed but wonder great and absolute wonder her eyes lingered upon buckley s let no one ask or presume to tell through what subtle medium the miracle was performed as by a lightning flash two clouds will accomplish counterpoise and compensation of electric surcharge so on that eyeglance the man received his complement of manhood and the maid conceded what enriched her womanly grace by its loss the mexican suddenly stirring ventilated his attitude of apathetic waiting by conjuring swiftly from his bootleg a long knife buckley cast aside his hat and laughed once aloud like a happy school boy at a frolic then empty handed he sprang nimbly and garcia met him without default so soon was the engagement ended that disappointment imposed upon the ranger s warlike ecstasy instead of dealing the traditional downward stroke the mexican lunged straight with his knife buckley took the precarious chance and caught his wrist fair and firm then he delivered the good saxon knock out blow always so pathetically disastrous to the fistless latin races and garcia was down and out with his head under a clump of prickly pears the ranger looked up again to the queen of the serpents alvarita scrambled down to the path i m mighty glad i happened along when i did said the ranger he he frightened me so cooed alvarita they did not hear the long low hiss of the python under the shrubs wiliest of the beasts no doubt he was expressing the humiliation he felt at having so long dwelt in subjection to this trembling and colouring mistress of his whom he had deemed so strong and potent and fearsome then came galloping to the spot the civic authorities and to them the ranger awarded the prostrate disturber of the peace whom they bore away limply across the saddle of one of their mounts but buckley and alvarita lingered slowly slowly they walked the ranger regained his belt of weapons with a fine timidity she begged the indulgence of fingering the great s with little ohs and ahs of new born delicious shyness the canoncito was growing dusky beyond its terminus in the river bluff they could see the outer world yet suffused with the waning glory of sunset a scream a piercing scream of fright from alvarita back she cowered and the ready protecting arm of buckley formed her refuge what terror so dire as to thus beset the close of the reign of the never before daunted queen across the path there crawled a caterpillar a horrid fuzzy two inch caterpillar truly kuku thou went avenged thus abdicated the queen of the serpent tribe viva la reina the higher abdication curly the tramp sidled toward the free lunch counter he caught a fleeting glance from the bartender s eye and stood still trying to look like a business man who had just dined at the menger and was waiting for a friend who had promised to pick him up in his motor car curly s histrionic powers were equal to the impersonation but his make up was wanting the bartender rounded the bar in a casual way looking up at the ceiling as though he was pondering some intricate problem of kalsomining and then fell upon curly so suddenly that the roadster had no excuses ready irresistibly but so composedly that it seemed almost absendmindedness on his part the dispenser of drinks pushed curly to the swinging doors and kicked him out with a nonchalance that almost amounted to sadness that was the way of the southwest curly arose from the gutter leisurely he felt no anger or resentment toward

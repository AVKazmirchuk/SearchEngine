bringing it to you with all the pride and importance of a king s messenger i gave him money for the round trip and for a two weeks stay in the city i wish you would see to it that he gets comfortable quarters jake won t need much looking after he s able to take care of himself but i have read in the papers that african bishops and colored potentates generally have much trouble in obtaining food and lodging in the yankee metropolis that may be all right but i don t see why the best hotel there shouldn t take jake in still i suppose it s a rule i gave him full directions about finding you and packed his valise myself you won t have to bother with him but i do hope you ll see that he is made comfortable take the watch that he brings you it s almost a decoration it has been worn by true carterets and there isn t a stain upon it nor a false movement of the wheels bringing it to you is the crowning joy of old jake s life i wanted him to have that little outing and that happiness before it is too late you have often heard us talk about how jake pretty badly wounded himself crawled through the reddened grass at chancellorsville to where your father lay with the bullet in his dear heart and took the watch from his pocket to keep it from the yanks so my son when the old man comes consider him as a frail but worthy messenger from the old time life and home you have been so long away from home and so long among the people that we have always regarded as aliens that i m not sure that jake will know you when he sees you but jake has a keen perception and i rather believe that he will know a virginia carteret at sight i can t conceive that even ten years in yankee land could change a boy of mine anyhow i m sure you will know jake i put eighteen collars in his valise if he should have to buy others he wears a number please see that he gets the right ones he will be no trouble to you at all if you are not too busy i d like for you to find him a place to board where they have white meal corn bread and try to keep him from taking his shoes off in your office or on the street his right foot swells a little and he likes to be comfortable if you can spare the time count his handkerchiefs when they come back from the wash i bought him a dozen new ones before he left he should be there about the time this letter reaches you i told him to go straight to your office when he arrives as soon as blandford had finished the reading of this something happened as there should happen in stories and must happen on the stage percival the office boy with his air of despising the world s output of mill supplies and leather belting came in to announce that a colored gentleman was outside to see mr blandford carteret bring him in said blandford rising john carteret swung around in his chair and said to percival ask him to wait a few minutes outside we ll let you know when to bring him in then he turned to his cousin with one of those broad slow smiles that was an inheritance of all the carterets and said bland i ve always had a consuming curiosity to understand the differences that you haughty southerners believe to exist between you all and the people of the north of course i know that you consider yourselves made out of finer clay and look upon adam as only a collateral branch of your ancestry but i don t know why i never could understand the differences between us well john said blandford laughing what you don t understand about it is just the difference of course i suppose it was the feudal way in which we lived that gave us our lordly baronial airs and feeling of superiority but you are not feudal now went on john since we licked you and stole your cotton and mules you ve had to go to work just as we damyankees as you call us have always been doing and you re just as proud and exclusive and upper classy as you were before the war so it wasn t your money that caused it maybe it was the climate said blandford lightly or maybe our negroes spoiled us i ll call old jake in now i ll be glad to see the old villain again wait just a moment said john i ve got a little theory i want to test you and i are pretty much alike in our general appearance old jake hasn t seen you since you were fifteen let s have him in and play fair and see which of us gets the watch the old darky surrey ought to be able to pick out his young marster without any trouble the alleged aristocratic superiority of a reb ought to be visible to him at once he couldn t make the mistake of handing over the timepiece to a yankee of course the loser buys the dinner this evening and two dozen collars for jake is it a go blandford agreed heartily percival was summoned and told to usher the colored gentleman in uncle jake stepped inside the private office cautiously he was a little old man as black as soot wrinkled and bald except for a fringe of white wool cut decorously short that ran over his ears and around his head there was nothing of the stage uncle about him his black suit nearly fitted him his shoes shone and his straw hat was banded with a gaudy ribbon in his right hand he carried something carefully concealed by his closed fingers uncle jake stopped a few steps from the door two young men sat in their revolving desk chairs ten feet apart and looked at him in friendly silence his gaze slowly shifted many times from one to the other he felt sure that he was in the presence of one at least of the revered family among whose fortunes his life had begun and was to end one had the pleasing but haughty carteret air the other had the unmistakable straight long family nose both had the keen black eyes horizontal brows and thin smiling lips that had distinguished both the carteret of the mayflower and him of the brigantine old jake had thought that he could have picked out his young master instantly from a thousand northerners but he found himself in difficulties the best he could do was to use strategy howdy marse blandford howdy suh he said looking midway between the two young men howdy uncle jake they both answered pleasantly and in unison sit down have you brought the watch uncle jake chose a hard bottom chair at a respectful distance sat on the edge of it and laid his hat carefully on the floor the watch in its buckskin case he gripped tightly he had not risked his life on the battle field to rescue that watch from his old marster s foes to hand it over again to the enemy without a struggle yes suh i got it in my hand suh i m gwine give it to you right away in jus a minute old missus told me to put it in young marse blandford s hand and tell him to wear it for the family pride and honor it was a mighty longsome trip for an old nigger man to make ten thousand miles it must be back to old vi ginia suh you ve growed mightily young marster i wouldn t have reconnized you but for yo powerful resemblance to old marster with admirable diplomacy the old man kept his eyes roaming in the space between the two men his words might have been addressed to either though neither wicked nor perverse he was seeking for a sign blandford and john exchanged winks i reckon you done got you ma s letter went on uncle jake she said she was gwine to write to you bout my comin along up this er way yes yes uncle jake said john briskly my cousin and i have just been notified to expect you we are both carterets you know although one of us said blandford was born and raised in the north so if you will hand over the watch said john my cousin and i said blandford will then see to it said john that comfortable quarters are found for you said blandford with creditable ingenuity old jake set up a cackling high pitched protracted laugh he beat his knee picked up his hat and bent the brim in an apparent paroxysm of humorous appreciation the seizure afforded him a mask behind which he could roll his eyes impartially between above and beyond his two tormentors i sees what he chuckled after a while you gen lemen is tryin to have fun with the po old nigger but you can t fool old jake i knowed you marse blandford the minute i sot eyes on you you was a po skimpy little boy no mo than about fo teen when you lef home to come no th but i knowed you the minute i sot eyes on you you is the mawtal image of old marster the other gen leman resembles you mightily suh but you can t fool old jake on a member of the old vi ginia family no suh at exactly the same time both carterets smiled and extended a hand for the watch uncle jake s wrinkled black face lost the expression of amusement to which he had vainly twisted it he knew that he was being teased and that it made little real difference as far as its safety went into which of those outstretched hands he placed the family treasure but it seemed to him that not only his own pride and loyalty but much of the virginia carterets was at stake he had heard down south during the war about that other branch of the family that lived in the north and fought on the yuther side and it had always grieved him he had followed his old marster s fortunes from stately luxury through war to almost poverty and now with the last relic and reminder of him blessed by old missus and intrusted implicitly to his care he had come ten thousand miles as it seemed to deliver it into the hands of the one who was to wear it and wind it and cherish it and listen to it tick off the unsullied hours that marked the lives of the carterets of virginia his experience and conception of the yankees had been an impression of tyrants low down common trash in blue laying waste with fire and sword he had seen the smoke of many burning homesteads almost as grand as carteret hall ascending to the drowsy southern skies and now he was face to face with one of them and he could not distinguish him from his young marster whom he had come to find and bestow upon him the emblem of his kingship even as the arm clothed in white samite mystic wonderful laid excalibur in the right hand of arthur he saw before him two young men easy kind courteous welcoming either of whom might have been the one he sought troubled bewildered sorely grieved at his weakness of judgment old jake abandoned his loyal subterfuges his right hand sweated against the buckskin cover of the watch he was deeply humiliated and chastened seriously now his prominent yellow white eyes closely scanned the two young men at the end of his scrutiny he was conscious of but one difference between them one wore a narrow black tie with a white pearl stickpin the other s four in hand was a narrow blue one pinned with a black pearl and then to old jake s relief there came a sudden distraction drama knocked at the door with imperious knuckles and forced comedy to the wings and drama peeped with a smiling but set face over the footlights percival the hater of mill supplies brought in a card which he handed with the manner of one bearing a cartel to blue tie olivia de ormond read blue tie from the card he looked inquiringly at his cousin why not have her in said black tie and bring matters to a conclusion uncle jake said one of the young men would you mind taking that chair over there in the corner for a while a lady is coming in on some business we ll take up your case afterward the lady whom percival ushered in was young and petulantly decidedly freshly consciously and intentionally pretty she was dressed with such expensive plainness that she made you consider lace and ruffles as mere tatters and rags but one great ostrich plume that she wore would have marked her anywhere in the army of beauty as the wearer of the merry helmet of navarre miss de ormond accepted the swivel chair at blue tie s desk then the gentlemen drew leather upholstered seats conveniently near and spoke of the weather yes said she i noticed it was warmer but i mustn t take up too much of your time during business hours that is she continued unless we talk business she addressed her words to blue tie with a charming smile very well said he you don t mind my cousin being present do you we are generally rather confidential with each other especially in business matters oh no caroled miss de ormond i d rather he did hear he knows all about it anyhow in fact he s quite a material witness because he was present when you when it happened i thought you might want to talk things over before well before any action is taken as i believe the lawyers say have you anything in the way of a proposition to make asked black tie miss de ormond looked reflectively at the neat toe of one of her dull kid pumps i had a proposal made to me she said if the proposal sticks it cuts out the proposition let s have that settled first well as far as began blue tie excuse me cousin interrupted black tie if you don t mind my cutting in and then he turned with a good natured air toward the lady now let s recapitulate a bit he said cheerfully all three of us besides other mutual acquaintances have been out on a good many larks together i m afraid i ll have to call the birds by another name said miss de ormond all right responded black tie with unimpaired cheerfulness suppose we say squabs when we talk about the proposal and larks when we discuss the proposition you have a quick mind miss de ormond two months ago some half dozen of us went in a motor car for day s run into the country we stopped at a road house for dinner my cousin proposed marriage to you then and there he was influenced to do so of course by the beauty and charm which no one can deny that you possess i wish i had you for a press agent mr carteret said the beauty with a dazzling smile you are on the stage miss de ormond went on black tie you have had doubtless many admirers and perhaps other proposals you must remember too that we were a party of merrymakers on that occasion there were a good many corks pulled that the proposal of marriage was made to you by my cousin we cannot deny but hasn t it been your experience that by common consent such things lose their seriousness when viewed in the next day s sunlight isn t there something of a code among good sports i use the word in its best sense that wipes out each day the follies of the evening previous oh yes said miss de ormond i know that very well and i ve always played up to it but as you seem to be conducting the case with the silent consent of the defendant i ll tell you something more i ve got letters from him repeating the proposal and they re signed too i understand said black tie gravely what s your price for the letters i m not a cheap one said miss de ormond but i had decided to make you a rate you both belong to a swell family well if i am on the stage nobody can say a word against me truthfully and the money is only a secondary consideration it isn t the money i was after i i believed him and and i liked him she cast a soft entrancing glance at blue tie from under her long eyelashes and the price went on black tie inexorably ten thousand dollars said the lady sweetly or or the fulfillment of the engagement to marry i think it is time interrupted blue tie for me to be allowed to say a word or two you and i cousin belong to a family that has held its head pretty high you have been brought up in a section of the country very different from the one where our branch of the family lived yet both of us are carterets even if some of our ways and theories differ you remember it is a tradition of the family that no carteret ever failed in chivalry to a lady or failed to keep his word when it was given then blue tie with frank decision showing on his countenance turned to miss de ormond olivia said he on what date will you marry me before she could answer black tie again interposed it is a long journey said he from plymouth rock to norfolk bay between the two points we find the changes that nearly three centuries have brought in that time the old order has changed we no longer burn witches or torture slaves and to day we neither spread our cloaks on the mud for ladies to walk over nor treat them to the ducking stool it is the age of common sense adjustment and proportion all of us ladies gentlemen women men northerners southerners lords caitiffs actors hardware drummers senators hodcarriers and politicians are coming to a better understanding chivalry is one of our words that changes its meaning every day family pride is a thing of many constructions it may show itself by maintaining a moth eaten arrogance in cobwebbed colonial mansion or by the prompt paying of one s debts now i suppose you ve had enough of my monologue i ve learned something of business and a little of life and i somehow believe cousin that our great great grandfathers the original carterets would indorse my view of this matter black tie wheeled around to his desk wrote in a check book and tore out the check the sharp rasp of the perforated leaf making the only sound in the room he laid the check within easy reach of miss de ormond s hand business is business said he we live in a business age there is my personal check for what do you say miss de ormond will it he orange blossoms or cash miss de ormond picked up the cheek carelessly folded it indifferently and stuffed it into her glove oh this do she said calmly i just thought i d call and put it up to you i guess you people are all right but a girl has feelings you know i ve heard one of you was a southerner i wonder which one of you it is she arose smiled sweetly and walked to the door there with a flash of white teeth and a dip of the heavy plume she disappeared both of the cousins had forgotten uncle jake for the time but now they heard the shuffling of his shoes as he came across the rug toward them from his seat in the corner young marster he said take yo watch and without hesitation he laid the ancient timepiece in the hand of its rightful owner supply and demand finch keeps a hats cleaned by electricity while you wait establishment nine feet by twelve in third avenue once a customer you are always his i do not know his secret process but every four days your hat needs to be cleaned again finch is a leathern sallow slowfooted man between twenty and forty you would say he had been brought up a bushelman in essex street when business is slack he likes to talk so i had my hat cleaned even oftener than it deserved hoping finch might let me into some of the secrets of the sweatshops one afternoon i dropped in and found finch alone he began to anoint my headpiece de panama with his mysterious fluid that attracted dust and dirt like a magnet they say the indians weave em under water said i for a leader don t you believe it said finch no indian or white man could stay under water that long say do you pay much attention to politics i see in the paper something about a law they ve passed called the law of supply and demand i explained to him as well as i could that the reference was to a politico economical law and not to a legal statute i didn t know said finch i heard a good deal about it a year or so ago but in a one sided way yes said i political orators use it a great deal in fact they never give it a rest i suppose you heard some of those cart tail fellows spouting on the subject over here on the east side i heard it from a king said finch the white king of a tribe of indians in south america i was interested but not surprised the big city is like a mother s knee to many who have strayed far and found the roads rough beneath their uncertain feet at dusk they come home and sit upon the door step i know a piano player in a cheap cafe who has shot lions in africa a bell boy who fought in the british army against the zulus an express driver whose left arm had been cracked like a lobster s claw for a stew pot of patagonian cannibals when the boat of his rescuers hove in sight so a hat cleaner who had been a friend of a king did not oppress me a new band asked finch with his dry barren smile yes said i and half an inch wider i had had a new band five days before i meets a man one night said finch beginning his story a man brown as snuff with money in every pocket eating schweinerknuckel in schlagel s that was two years ago when i was a hose cart driver for no his discourse runs to the subject of gold he says that certain mountains in a country down south that he calls gaudymala is full of it he says the indians wash it out of the streams in plural quantities oh geronimo says i indians there s no indians in the south i tell him except elks maccabees and the buyers for the fall dry goods trade the indians are all on the reservations says i i m telling you this with reservations says he they ain t buffalo bill indians they re squattier and more pedigreed they call em inkers and aspics and they was old inhabitants when mazuma was king of mexico they wash the gold out of the mountain streams says the brown man and fill quills with it and then they empty em into red jars till they are full and then they pack it in buckskin sacks of one arroba each an arroba is twenty five pounds and store it in a stone house with an engraving of a idol with marcelled hair playing a flute over the door how do they work off this unearth increment i asks they don t says the man it s a case of ill fares the land with the great deal of velocity where wealth accumulates and there ain t any reciprocity after this man and me got through our conversation which left him dry of information i shook hands with him and told him i was sorry i couldn t believe him and a month afterward i landed on the coast of this gaudymala with that i had been saving up for five years i thought i knew what indians liked and i fixed myself accordingly i loaded down four pack mules with red woollen blankets wrought iron pails jewelled side combs for the ladies glass necklaces and safety razors i hired a black mozo who was supposed to be a mule driver and an interpreter too it turned out that he could interpret mules all right but he drove the english language much too hard his name sounded like a yale key when you push it in wrong side up but i called him mcclintock which was close to the noise well this gold village was forty miles up in the mountains and it took us nine days to find it but one afternoon mcclintock led the other mules and myself over a rawhide bridge stretched across a precipice five thousand feet deep it seemed to me the hoofs of the beasts drummed on it just like before george m cohan makes his first entrance on the stage this village was built of mud and stone and had no streets some few yellow and brown persons popped their heads out of doors looking about like welsh rabbits with worcester sauce on em out of the biggest house that had a kind of a porch around it steps a big white man red as a beet in color dressed in fine tanned deerskin clothes with a gold chain around his neck smoking a cigar i ve seen united states senators of his style of features and build also head waiters and cops he walks up and takes a look at us while mcclintock disembarks and begins to interpret to the lead mule while he smokes a cigarette hello buttinsky says the fine man to me how did you get in the game i didn t see you buy any chips who gave you the keys of the city i m a poor traveller says i especially mule back you ll excuse me do you run a hack line or only a bluff segregate yourself from your pseudo equine quadruped says he and come inside he raises a finger and a villager runs up this man will take care of your outfit says he and i ll take care of you he leads me into the biggest house and sets out the chairs and a kind of a drink the color of milk it was the finest room i ever saw the stone walls was hung all over with silk shawls and there was red and yellow rugs on the floor and jars of red pottery and angora goat skins and enough bamboo furniture to misfurnish half a dozen seaside cottages in the first place says the man you want to know who i am i m sole lessee and proprietor of this tribe of indians they call me the grand yacuma which is to say king or main finger of the bunch i ve got more power here than a charge d affaires a charge of dynamite and a charge account at tiffany s combined in fact i m the big stick with as many extra knots on it as there is on the record run of the lusitania oh i read the papers now and then says he now let s hear your entitlements he goes on and the meeting will be open well says i i am known as one w d finch occupation capitalist address east thirty second new york chips in the noble grand i know says he grinning it ain t the first time you ve seen it go down on the blotter i can tell by the way you hand it out well explain capitalist i tells this boss plain what i come for and how i come to came gold dust says he looking as puzzled as a baby that s got a feather stuck on its molasses finger that s funny this ain t a gold mining country and you invested all your capital on a stranger s story well well these indians of mine they are the last of the tribe of peehes are simple as children they know nothing of the purchasing power of gold i m afraid you ve been imposed on says he maybe so says i but it sounded pretty straight to me w d says the king all of a sudden i ll give you a square deal it ain t often i get to talk to a white man and i ll give you a show for your money it may be these constituents of mine have a few grains of gold dust hid away in their clothes to morrow you may get out these goods you ve brought up and see if you can make any sales now i m going to introduce myself unofficially my name is shane patrick shane i own this tribe of peche indians by right of conquest single handed and unafraid i drifted up here four years ago and won em by my size and complexion and nerve i learned their language in six weeks it s easy you simply emit a string of consonants as long as your breath holds out and then point at what you re asking for i conquered em spectacularly goes on king shane and then i went at em with economical politics law sleight of hand and a kind of new england ethics and parsimony every sunday or as near as i can guess at it i preach to em in the council house i m the council on the law of supply and demand i praise supply and knock demand i use the same text every time you wouldn t think w d says shane that i had poetry in me would you well says i i wouldn t know whether to call it poetry or not tennyson says shane furnishes the poetic gospel i preach i always considered him the boss poet here s the way the text goes for not to admire if a man could learn it were more than to walk all day like a sultan of old in a garden of spice you see i teach em to cut out demand that supply is the main thing i teach em not to desire anything beyond their simplest needs a little mutton a little cocoa and a little fruit brought up from the coast that s all they want to make cm happy i ve got em well trained they make their own clothes and hats out of a vegetable fibre and straw and they re a contented lot it s a great thing winds up shane to have made a people happy by the incultivation of such simple institutions well the next day with the king s permission i has the mcclintock open up a couple of sacks of my goods in the little plaza of the village the indians swarmed around by the hundred and looked the bargain counter over i shook red blankets at em flashed finger rings and ear bobs tried pearl necklaces and sidecombs on the women and a line of red hosiery on the men twas no use they looked on like hungry graven images but i never made a sale i asked mcclintock what was the trouble mac yawned three or four times rolled a cigarette made one or two confidential side remarks to a mule and then condescended to inform me that the people had no money just then up strolls king patrick big and red and royal as usual with the gold chain over his chest and his cigar in front of him how s business w d he asks fine says i it s a bargain day rush i ve got one more line of goods to offer before i shut up shop i ll try em with safety razors i ve got two gross that i bought at a fire sale shane laughs till some kind of mameluke or private secretary he carries with him has to hold him up my sainted aunt jerusha says he ain t you one of the babes in the goods w d don t you know that no indians ever shave they pull out their whiskers instead well says i that s just what these razors would do for em they wouldn t have any kick coming if they used em once shane went away and i could hear him laughing a block if there had been any block tell em says i to mcclintock it ain t money i want tell em i ll take gold dust tell em i ll allow em sixteen dollars an ounce for it in trade that s what i m out for the dust mac interprets and you d have thought a squadron of cops had charged the crowd to disperse it every uncle s nephew and aunt s niece of em faded away inside of two minutes at the royal palace that night me and the king talked it over they ve got the dust hid out somewhere says i or they wouldn t have been so sensitive about it they haven t says shane what s this gag you ve got about gold you been reading edward allen poe they ain t got any gold they put it in quills says i and then they empty it in jars and then into sacks of twenty five pounds each i got it straight w d says shane laughing and chewing his cigar i don t often see a white man and i feel like putting you on i don t think you ll get away from here alive anyhow so i m going to tell you come over here he draws aside a silk fibre curtain in a corner of the room and shows me a pile of buckskin sacks forty of em says shane one arroba in each one in round numbers worth of gold dust you see there it s all mine it belongs to the grand yacuma they bring it all to me two hundred and twenty thousand dollars think of that you glass bead peddler says shane and all mine little good it does you says i contemptuously and hatefully and so you are the government depository of this gang of money less money makers don t you pay enough interest on it to enable one of your depositors to buy an augusta maine pullman carbon diamond worth for listen says patrick shane with the sweat coming out on his brow i m confidant with you as you have somehow enlisted my regards did you ever he says feel the avoirdupois power of gold not the troy weight of it but the sixteen ounces to the pound force of it never says i i never take in any bad money shane drops down on the floor and throws his arms over the sacks of gold dust i love it says he i want to feel the touch of it day and night it s my pleasure in life i come in this room and i m a king and a rich man i ll be a millionaire in another year the pile s getting bigger every month i ve got the whole tribe washing out the sands in the creeks i m the happiest man in the world w d i just want to be near this gold and know it s mine and it s increasing every day now you know says he why my indians wouldn t buy your goods they can t they bring all the dust to me i m their king i ve taught em not to desire or admire you might as well shut up shop i ll tell you what you are says i you re a plain contemptible miser you preach supply and you forget demand now supply i goes on is never anything but supply on the contrary says i demand is a much broader syllogism and assertion demand includes the rights of our women and children and charity and friendship and even a little begging on the street corners they ve both got to harmonize equally and i ve got a few things up my commercial sleeve yet says i that may jostle your preconceived ideas of politics and economy the next morning i had mcclintock bring tip another mule load of goods to the plaza and open it up the people gathered around the same as before i got out the finest line of necklaces bracelets hair combs and earrings that i carried and had the women put em on and then i played trumps out of my last pack i opened up a half gross of hand mirrors with solid tinfoil backs and passed em around among the ladies that was the first introduction of looking glasses among the peche indians shane walks by with his big laugh business looking up any he asks it s looking at itself right now says i by and by a kind of a murmur goes through the crowd the women had looked into the magic crystal and seen that they were beautiful and was confiding the secret to the men the men seemed to be urging the lack of money and the hard times just before the election but their excuses didn t go then was my time i called mcclintock away from an animated conversation with his mules and told him to do some interpreting tell em says i that gold dust will buy for them these befitting ornaments for kings and queens of the earth tell em the yellow sand they wash out of the waters for the high sanctified yacomay and chop suey of the tribe will buy the precious jewels and charms that will make them beautiful and preserve and pickle them from evil spirits tell em the pittsburg banks are paying four per cent interest on deposits by mail while this get rich frequently custodian of the public funds ain t even paying attention keep telling em mac says i to let the gold dust family do their work talk to em like a born anti bryanite says i remind em that tom watson s gone back to georgia says i mcclintock waves his hand affectionately at one of his mules and then hurls a few stickfuls of minion type at the mob of shoppers a gutta percha indian man with a lady hanging on his arm with three strings of my fish scale jewelry and imitation marble beads around her neck stands up on a block of stone and makes a talk that sounds like a man shaking dice in a box to fill aces and sixes he says says mcclintock that the people not know that gold dust will buy their things the women very mad the grand yacuma tell them it no good but for keep to make bad spirits keep away you can t keep bad spirits away from money says i they say goes on mcclintock the yacuma fool them they raise plenty row going going says i gold dust or cash takes the entire stock the dust weighed before you and taken at sixteen dollars the ounce the highest price on the gaudymala coast then the crowd disperses all of a sudden and i don t know what s up mac and me packs away the hand mirrors and jewelry they had handed back to us and we had the mules back to the corral they had set apart for our garage while we was there we hear great noises of shouting and down across the plaza runs patrick shane hotfoot with his clothes ripped half off and scratches on his face like a cat had fought him hard for every one of its lives they re looting the treasury w d he sings out they re going to kill me and you too unlimber a couple of mules at once we ll have to make a get away in a couple of minutes they ve found out says i the truth about the law of supply and demand it s the women mostly says the king and they used to admire me so they hadn t seen looking glasses then says i they ve got knives and hatchets says shane hurry take that roan mule says i you and your law of supply i ll ride the dun for he s two knots per hour the faster the roan has a stiff knee but he may make it says i if you d included reciprocity in your political platform i might have given you the dun says i shane and mcclintock and me mounted our mules and rode across the rawhide bridge just as the peches reached the other side and began firing stones and long knives at us we cut the thongs that held up our end of the bridge and headed for the coast a tall bulky policeman came into finch s shop at that moment and leaned an elbow on the showcase finch nodded at him friendly i heard down at casey s said the cop in rumbling husky tones that there was going to be a picnic of the hat cleaners union over at bergen beach sunday is that right sure said finch there ll be a dandy time gimme five tickets said the cop throwing a five dollar bill on the showcase why said finch ain t you going it a little too go to h said the cop you got em to sell ain t you somebody s got to buy em wish i could go along i was glad to see finch so well thought of in his neighborhood and then in came a wee girl of seven with dirty face and pure blue eyes and a smutched and insufficient dress mamma says she recited shrilly that you must give me eighty cents for the grocer and nineteen for the milkman and five cents for me to buy hokey pokey with but she didn t say that the elf concluded with a hopeful but honest grin finch shelled out the money counting it twice but i noticed that the total sum that the small girl received was one dollar and four cents that s the right kind of a law remarked finch as he carefully broke some of the stitches of my hatband so that it would assuredly come off within a few days the law of supply and demand but they ve both got to work together i ll bet he went on with his dry smile she ll get jelly beans with that nickel she likes em what s supply if there s no demand for it what ever became of the king i asked curiously oh i might have told you said finch that was shane came in and bought the tickets he came back with me and he s on the force now buried treasure there are many kinds of fools now will everybody please sit still until they are called upon specifically to rise i had been every kind of fool except one i had expended my patrimony pretended my matrimony played poker lawn tennis and bucket shops parted soon with my money in many ways but there remained one rule of the wearer of cap and bells that i had not played that was the seeker after buried treasure to few does the delectable furor come but of all the would be followers in the hoof prints of king midas none has found a pursuit so rich in pleasurable promise but going back from my theme a while as lame pens must do i was a fool of the sentimental soft i saw may martha mangum and was hers she was eighteen the color of the white ivory keys of a new piano beautiful and possessed by the exquisite solemnity and pathetic witchery of an unsophisticated angel doomed to live in a small dull texas prairie town she had a spirit and charm that could have enabled her to pluck rubies like raspberries from the crown of belgium or any other sporty kingdom but she did not know it and i did not paint the picture for her you see i wanted may martha mangum for to have and to hold i wanted her to abide with me and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings may martha s father was a man hidden behind whiskers and spectacles he lived for bugs and butterflies and all insects that fly or crawl or buzz or get down your back or in the butter he was an etymologist or words to that effect he spent his life seining the air for flying fish of the june bug order and then sticking pins through em and calling em names he and may martha were the whole family he prized her highly as a fine specimen of the racibus humanus because she saw that he had food at times and put his clothes on right side before and kept his alcohol bottles filled scientists they say are apt to be absent minded there was another besides myself who thought may martha mangum one to be desired that was goodloe banks a young man just home from college he had all the attainments to be found in books latin greek philosophy and especially the higher branches of mathematics and logic if it hadn t been for his habit of pouring out this information and learning on every one that he addressed i d have liked him pretty well but even as it was he and i were you would have thought great pals we got together every time we could because each of us wanted to pump the other for whatever straws we could to find which way the wind blew from the heart of may martha mangum rather a mixed metaphor goodloe banks would never have been guilty of that that is the way of rivals you might say that goodloe ran to books manners culture rowing intellect and clothes i would have put you in mind more of baseball and friday night debating societies by way of culture and maybe of a good horseback rider but in our talks together and in our visits and conversation with may martha neither goodloe banks nor i could find out which one of us she preferred may martha was a natural born non committal and knew in her cradle how to keep people guessing as i said old man mangum was absentminded after a long time he found out one day a little butterfly must have told him that two young men were trying to throw a net over the head of the young person a daughter or some such technical appendage who looked after his comforts i never knew scientists could rise to such occasions old mangum orally labelled and classified goodloe and myself easily among the lowest orders of the vertebrates and in english too without going any further into latin than the simple references to orgetorix rex helvetii which is as far as i ever went myself and he told us that if he ever caught us around his house again he would add us to his collection goodloe banks and i remained away five days expecting the storm to subside when we dared to call at the house again may martha mangum and her father were gone gone the house they had rented was closed their little store of goods and chattels was gone also and not a word of farewell to either of us from may martha not a white fluttering note pinned to the hawthorn bush not a chalk mark on the gate post nor a post card in the post office to give us a clew for two months goodloe banks and i separately tried every scheme we could think of to track the runaways we used our friendship and influence with the ticket agent with livery stable men railroad conductors and our one lone lorn constable but without results then we became better friends and worse enemies than ever we forgathered in the back room of snyder s saloon every afternoon after work and played dominoes and laid conversational traps to find out from each other if anything had been discovered that is the way of rivals now goodloe banks had a sarcastic way of displaying his own learning and putting me in the class that was reading poor jane ray her bird is dead she cannot play well i rather liked goodloe and i had a contempt for his college learning and i was always regarded as good natured so i kept my temper and i was trying to find out if he knew anything about may martha so i endured his society in talking things over one afternoon he said to me suppose you do find her ed whereby would you profit miss mangum has a mind perhaps it is yet uncultured but she is destined for higher things than you could give her i have talked with no one who seemed to appreciate more the enchantment of the ancient poets and writers and the modern cults that have assimilated and expended their philosophy of life don t you think you are wasting your time looking for her my idea said i of a happy home is an eight room house in a grove of live oaks by the side of a charco on a texas prairie a piano i went on with an automatic player in the sitting room three thousand head of cattle under fence for a starter a buckboard and ponies always hitched at a post for the missus and may martha mangum to spend the profits of the ranch as she pleases and to abide with me and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings that said i is what is to be and a fig a dried smyrna dago stand fig for your curriculums cults and philosophy she is meant for higher things repeated goodloe banks whatever she is meant for i answered just now she is out of pocket and i shall find her as soon as i can without aid of the colleges the game is blocked said goodloe putting down a domino and we had the beer shortly after that a young farmer whom i knew came into town and brought me a folded blue paper he said his grandfather had just died i concealed a tear and he went on to say that the old man had jealously guarded this paper for twenty years he left it to his family as part of his estate the rest of which consisted of two mules and a hypotenuse of non arable land the sheet of paper was of the old blue kind used during the rebellion of the abolitionists against the secessionists it was dated june and it described the hiding place of ten burro loads of gold and silver coin valued at three hundred thousand dollars old rundle grandfather of his grandson sam was given the information by a spanish priest who was in on the treasure burying and who died many years before no afterward in old rundle s house old rundle wrote it down from dictation why didn t your father look this up i asked young rundle he went blind before he could do so he replied why didn t you hunt for it yourself i asked well said he i ve only known about the paper for ten years first there was the spring ploughin to do and then choppin the weeds out of the corn and then come takin fodder and mighty soon winter was on us it seemed to run along that way year after year that sounded perfectly reasonable to me so i took it up with young lee rundle at once the directions on the paper were simple the whole burro cavalcade laden with the treasure started from an old spanish mission in dolores county they travelled due south by the compass until they reached the alamito river they forded this and buried the treasure on the top of a little mountain shaped like a pack saddle standing in a row between two higher ones a heap of stones marked the place of the buried treasure all the party except the spanish priest were killed by indians a few days later the secret was a monopoly it looked good to me lee rundle suggested that we rig out a camping outfit hire a surveyor to run out the line from the spanish mission and then spend the three hundred thousand dollars seeing the sights in fort worth but without being highly educated i knew a way to save time and expense we went to the state land office and had a practical what they call a working sketch made of all the surveys of land from the old mission to the alamito river on this map i drew a line due southward to the river the length of lines of each survey and section of land was accurately given on the sketch by these we found the point on the river and had a connection made with it and an important well identified corner of the los animos five league survey a grant made by king philip of spain by doing this we did not need to have the line run out by a surveyor it was a great saving of expense and time so lee rundle and i fitted out a two horse wagon team with all the accessories and drove a hundred and forty nine miles to chico the nearest town to the point we wished to reach there we picked up a deputy county surveyor he found the corner of the los animos survey for us ran out the five thousand seven hundred and twenty varas west that our sketch called for laid a stone on the spot had coffee and bacon and caught the mail stage back to chico i was pretty sure we would get that three hundred thousand dollars lee rundle s was to be only one third because i was paying all the expenses with that two hundred thousand dollars i knew i could find may martha mangum if she was on earth and with it i could flutter the butterflies in old man mangum s dove cot too if i could find that treasure but lee and i established camp across the river were a dozen little mountains densely covered by cedar brakes but not one shaped like a pack saddle that did not deter us appearances are deceptive a pack saddle like beauty may exist only in the eye of the beholder i and the grandson of the treasure examined those cedar covered hills with the care of a lady hunting for the wicked flea we explored every side top circumference mean elevation angle slope and concavity of every one for two miles up and down the river we spent four days doing so then we hitched up the roan and the dun and hauled the remains of the coffee and bacon the one hundred and forty nine miles back to concho city lee rundle chewed much tobacco on the return trip i was busy driving because i was in a hurry as shortly as could be after our empty return goodloe banks and i forgathered in the back room of snyder s saloon to play dominoes and fish for information i told goodloe about my expedition after the buried treasure if i could have found that three hundred thousand dollars i said to him i could have scoured and sifted the surface of the earth to find may martha mangum she is meant for higher things said goodloe i shall find her myself but tell me how you went about discovering the spot where this unearthed increment was imprudently buried i told him in the smallest detail i showed him the draughtsman s sketch with the distances marked plainly upon it after glancing over it in a masterly way he leaned back in his chair and bestowed upon me an explosion of sardonic superior collegiate laughter well you are a fool jim he said when he could speak it s your play said i patiently fingering my double six twenty said goodloe making two crosses on the table with his chalk why am i a fool i asked buried treasure has been found before in many places because said he in calculating the point on the river where your line would strike you neglected to allow for the variation the variation there would be nine degrees west let me have your pencil goodloe banks figured rapidly on the back of an envelope the distance from north to south of the line run from the spanish mission said he is exactly twenty two miles it was run by a pocket compass according to your story allowing for the variation the point on the alamito river where you should have searched for your treasure is exactly six miles and nine hundred and forty five varas farther west than the place you hit upon oh what a fool you are jim what is this variation that you speak of i asked i thought figures never lied the variation of the magnetic compass said goodloe from the true meridian he smiled in his superior way and then i saw come out in his face the singular eager consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried treasure sometimes he said with the air of the oracle these old traditions of hidden money are not without foundation suppose you let me look over that paper describing the location perhaps together we might the result was that goodloe banks and i rivals in love became companions in adventure we went to chico by stage from huntersburg the nearest railroad town in chico we hired a team drawing a covered spring wagon and camping paraphernalia we had the same surveyor run out our distance as revised by goodloe and his variations and then dismissed him and sent him on his homeward road it was night when we arrived i fed the horses and made a fire near the bank of the river and cooked supper goodloe would have helped but his

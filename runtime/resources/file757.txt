s no doubt a charming girl now here s that little curtain raiser you promised to listen to ever been tried on the stage asked hollis not exactly i answered i read half of it the other day to a fellow whose brother knows robert edeson but he had to catch a train before i finished go on said hollis sliding back in his chair like a good fellow i m no stage carpenter but i ll tell you what i think of it from a first row balcony standpoint i m a theatre bug during the season and i can size up a fake play almost as quick as the gallery can flag the waiter once more and then go ahead as hard as you like with it i ll be the dog i read my little play lovingly and i fear not without some elocution there was one scene in it that i believed in greatly the comedy swiftly rises into thrilling and unexpectedly developed drama capt marchmont suddenly becomes cognizant that his wife is an unscrupulous adventuress who has deceived him from the day of their first meeting the rapid and mortal duel between them from that moment she with her magnificent lies and siren charm winding about him like a serpent trying to recover her lost ground he with his man s agony and scorn and lost faith trying to tear her from his heart that scene i always thought was a crackerjack when capt marchmont discovers her duplicity by reading on a blotter in a mirror the impression of a note that she has written to the count he raises his hand to heaven and exclaims o god who created woman while adam slept and gave her to him for a companion take back thy gift and return instead the sleep though it last forever rot said hollis rudely when i had given those lines with proper emphasis i beg your pardon i said as sweetly as i could come now went on hollis don t be an idiot you know very well that nobody spouts any stuff like that these days that sketch went along all right until you rang in the skyrockets cut out that right arm exercise and the adam and eve stunt and make your captain talk as you or i or bill jones would i ll admit said i earnestly for my theory was being touched upon that on all ordinary occasions all of us use commonplace language to convey our thoughts you will rememberthat up to the moment when the captain makes his terrible discovery all the characters on the stage talk pretty much as they would in real life but i believe that i am right in allowing him lines suitable to the strong and tragic situation into which he falls tragic my eye said my friend irreverently in shakespeare s day he might have sputtered out some high cockalorum nonsense of that sort because in those days they ordered ham and eggs in blank verse and discharged the cook with an epic but not for b way in the summer of it is my opinion said i that great human emotions shake up our vocabulary and leave the words best suited to express them on top a sudden violent grief or loss or disappointment will bring expressions out of an ordinary man as strong and solemn and dramatic as those used in fiction or on the stage to portray those emotions that s where you fellows are wrong said hollis plain every day talk is what goes your captain would very likely have kicked the cat lit a cigar stirred up a highball and telephoned for a lawyer instead of getting off those robert mantell pyrotechnics possibly a little later i continued but just at the time just as the blow is delivered if something scriptural or theatrical and deep tongued isn t wrung from a man in spite of his modern and practical way of speaking then i m wrong of course said hollis kindly you ve got to whoop her up some degrees for the stage the audience expects it when the villain kidnaps little effie you have to make her mother claw some chunks out of the atmosphere and scream me chee ild me chee ild what she would actually do would be to call up the police by phone ring for some strong tea and get the little darling s photo out ready for the reporters when you get your villain in a corner a stage corner it s all right for him to clap his hand to his forehead and hiss all is lost off the stage he would remark this is a conspiracy against me i refer you to my lawyers i get no consolation said i gloomily from your concession of an accentuated stage treatment in my play i fondly hoped that i was following life if people in real life meet great crises in a commonplace way they should do the same on the stage and then we drifted like two trout out of our cool pool in the great hotel and began to nibble languidly at the gay flies in the swift current of broadway and our question of dramatic art was unsettled we nibbled at the flies and avoided the hooks as wise trout do but soon the weariness of manhattan in summer overcame us nine stories up facing the south was hollis s apartment and we soon stepped into an elevator bound for that cooler haven i was familiar in those quarters and quickly my play was forgotten and i stood at a sideboard mixing things with cracked ice and glasses all about me a breeze from the bay came in the windows not altogether blighted by the asphalt furnace over which it had passed hollis whistling softly turned over a late arrived letter or two on his table and drew around the coolest wicker armchairs

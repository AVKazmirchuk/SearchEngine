a little agitation of the piano keys just to christen the machine not to night rush says marilla in a way that she had when she wanted to settle things but it seems that uncle cal was plenty sick after all he got so bad that ben saddled up and rode over to birdstail for doc simpson i stayed around to see if i d be needed for anything when uncle cal s pain let up on him a little he called marilla and says to her did you look at your instrument honey and do you like it it s lovely dad says she leaning down by his pillow i never saw one so pretty how dear and good it was of you to buy it for me i haven t heard you play on it any yet says uncle cal and i ve been listening my side don t hurt quite so bad now won t you play a piece marilla but no she puts uncle cal off and soothes him down like you ve seen women do with a kid it seems she s made up her mind not to touch that piano at present when doc simpson comes over he tells us that uncle cal has pneumonia the worst kind and as the old man was past sixty and nearly on the lift anyhow the odds was against his walking on grass any more on the fourth day of his sickness he calls for marilla again and wants to talk piano doc simpson was there and so was ben and mrs ben trying to do all they could i d have made a wonderful success in anything connected with music says uncle cal i got the finest instrument for the money in san antone ain t that piano all right in every respect marilla it s just perfect dad says she it s got the finest tone i ever heard but don t you think you could sleep a little while now dad no i don t says uncle cal i want to hear that piano i don t believe you ve even tried it yet i went all the way to san antone and picked it out for you myself it took a third of the fall clip to buy it but i don t mind that if it makes my good girl happier won t you play a little bit for dad marilla doc simpson beckoned marilla to one side and recommended her to do what uncle cal wanted so it would get him quieted and her uncle ben and his wife asked her too why not hit out a tune or two with the soft pedal on i asks marilla uncle cal has begged you so often it would please him a good deal to hear you touch up the piano he s bought for you don t you think you might but marilla stands there with big tears rolling down from her eyes and says nothing and then she runs over and slips her arm under uncle cal s neck and hugs him tight why last night dad we heard her say i played it ever so much honest i have been playing it and it s such a splendid instrument you don t know how i love it last night i played bonnie dundee and the anvil polka and the blue danube and lots of pieces you must surely have heard me playing a little didn t you dad i didn t like to play loud when you was so sick well well says uncle cal maybe i did maybe i did and forgot about it my head is a little cranky at times i heard the man in the store play it fine i m mighty glad you like it marilla yes i believe i could go to sleep a while if you ll stay right beside me till i do there was where marilla had me guessing much as she thought of that old man she wouldn t strike a note on that piano that he d bought her i couldn t imagine why she told him she d been playing it for the wagon sheet hadn t ever been off of it since she put it back on the same day it come i knew she could play a little anyhow for i d once heard her snatch some pretty fair dance music out of an old piano at the charco largo ranch well in about a week the pneumonia got the best of uncle cal they had the funeral over at birdstail and all of us went over i brought marilla back home in my buckboard her uncle ben and his wife were going to stay there a few days with her that night marilla takes me in the room where the piano was while the others were out on the gallery come here rush says she i want you to see this now she unties the rope and drags off the wagon sheet if you ever rode a saddle without a horse or fired off a gun that wasn t loaded or took a drink out of an empty bottle why then you might have been able to scare an opera or two out of the instrument uncle cal had bought instead of a piano it was one of the machines they ve invented to play the piano with by itself it was about as musical as the holes of a flute without the flute and that was the piano that uncle cal had selected and standing by it was the good fine all wool girl that never let him know it and what you heard playing a while ago concluded mr kinney was that same deputy piano machine only just at present it s shoved up against a six hundred dollar piano that i bought for marilla as soon as we was married a call

here will you oblige by perusing again the quotation with which this story begins the mcramseys poured out money like domestic champagne to polish their adopted one milliners dancing masters and private tutors got it miss er mcramsey was grateful loving and tried to forget hinkle s to give ample credit to the adaptability of the american girl hinkle s did fade from her memory and speech most of the time not every one will remember when the earl of hitesbury came to east seventy street america he was only a fair to medium earl without debts and he created little excitement but you will surely remember the evening when the daughters of benevolence haled their bazaar in the w f a a hotel for you were there and you wrote a note to fannie on the hotel paper and mailed it just to show her that you did not very well that was the evening the baby was sick of course at the bazaar the mcramseys were prominent miss mer er mcramsey was exquisitely beautiful the earl of hitesbury had been very attentive to her since he dropped in to have a look at america at the charity bazaar the affair was supposed to be going to be pulled off to a finish an earl is as good as a duke better his standing may be lower but his outstanding accounts are also lower our ex young lady cashier was assigned to a booth she was expected to sell worthless articles to nobs and snobs at exorbitant prices the proceeds of the bazaar were to be used for giving the poor children of the slums a christmas din say did you ever wonder where they get the other miss mcramsey beautiful palpitating excited

lordy patrons of the bazaar became aware of a commotion and pressed around a certain booth the earl of hitesbury stood near by pulling a pale blond and puzzled whisker miss mcramsey has fainted some one explained proof of the pudding spring winked a vitreous optic at editor westbrook of the minerva magazine and deflected him from his course he had lunched in his favorite corner of a broadway hotel and was returning to his office when his feet became entangled in the lure of the vernal coquette which is by way of saying that he turned eastward in twenty sixth street safely forded the spring freshet of vehicles in fifth avenue and meandered along the walks of budding madison square the lenient air and the settings of the little park almost formed a pastoral the color motif was green the presiding shade at the creation of man and vegetation the callow grass between the walks was the color of verdigris a poisonous green reminiscent of the horde of derelict humans that had breathed upon the soil during the summer and autumn the bursting tree buds looked strangely familiar to those who had botanized among the garnishings of the fish course of a forty cent dinner the sky above was of that pale aquamarine tint that ballroom poets rhyme with true and sue and coo the one natural and frank color visible was the ostensible green of the newly painted benches a shade between the color of a pickled cucumber and that of a last year s fast black cravenette raincoat but to the city bred eye of editor westbrook the landscape appeared a masterpiece and now whether you are of those who rush in or of the gentle concourse that fears to tread you must follow in a brief invasion of the editor s mind editor westbrook s spirit was contented and serene the april number of the minerva had sold its entire edition before the tenth day of the month a newsdealer in keokuk had written that he could have sold fifty copies more if he had em the owners of the magazine had raised his the editor s salary he had just installed in his home a jewel of a recently imported cook who was afraid of policemen and the morning papers had published in full a speech he had made at a publishers banquet also there were echoing in his mind the jubilant notes of a splendid song that his charming young wife had sung to him before he left his up town apartment that morning she was taking enthusiastic interest in her music of late practising early and diligently when he had complimented her on the improvement in her voice she had fairly hugged him for joy at his praise he felt too the benign tonic medicament of the trained nurse spring tripping softly adown the wards of the convalescent city while editor westbrook was sauntering between the rows of park benches already filling with vagrants and the guardians of lawless childhood he felt his sleeve grasped and held suspecting that he was about to be panhandled he turned a cold and unprofitable face and saw that his captor was dawe shackleford dawe dingy almost ragged the genteel scracely visible in him through the deeper lines of the shabby while the editor is pulling himself out of his surprise a flashlight biography of dawe is offered he was a fiction writer and one of westbrook s old acquaintances at one time they might have called each other old friends dawe had some money in those days and lived in a decent apartment house near westbrook s the two families often went to theatres and dinners together mrs dawe and mrs westbrook became dearest friends then one day a little tentacle of the octopus just to amuse itself ingurgitated dawe s capital and he moved to the gramercy park neighborhood where one for a few groats per week may sit upon one s trunk under eight branched chandeliers and opposite carrara marble mantels and watch the mice play upon the floor dawe thought to live by writing fiction now and then he sold a story he submitted many to westbrook the minerva printed one or two of them the rest were returned westbrook sent a careful and conscientious personal letter with each rejected manuscript pointing out in detail his reasons for considering it unavailable editor westbrook had his own clear conception of what constituted good fiction so had dawe mrs dawe was mainly concerned about the constituents of the scanty dishes of food that she managed to scrape together one day dawe had been spouting to her about the excellencies of certain french writers at dinner they sat down to a dish that a hungry schoolboy could have encompassed at a gulp dawe commented it s maupassant hash said mrs dawe it may not be art but i do wish you would do a five course marion crawford serial with an ella wheeler wilcox sonnet for dessert i m hungry as far as this from success was shackleford dawe when he plucked editor westbrook s sleeve in madison square that was the first time the editor had seen dawe in several months why shack is this you said westbrook somewhat awkwardly for the form of his phrase seemed to touch upon the other s changed appearance sit down for a minute said dawe tugging at his sleeve this is my office i can t come to yours looking as i do oh sit down you won t be disgraced those half plucked birds on the other benches will take you for a swell porch climber they won t know you are only an editor smoke shack said editor westbrook sinking cautiously upon the virulent green bench he always yielded gracefully when he did yield dawe snapped at the cigar as a kingfisher darts at a sunperch or a girl pecks at a chocolate cream i have just began the editor oh i know don t finish said dawe give me a match you have just ten minutes to spare how did you manage to get past my office boy and invade my sanctum there he goes now throwing his club at a dog that couldn t read the keep off the grass signs how goes the writing asked the editor look at me said dawe for your answer now don t put on that embarrassed friendly but honest look and ask me why i don t get a job as a wine agent or a cab driver i m in the fight to a finish i know i can write good fiction and i ll force you fellows to admit it yet i ll make you change the spelling of regrets to c h e q u e before i m done with you editor westbrook gazed through his nose glasses with a sweetly sorrowful omniscient sympathetic skeptical expression the copyrighted expression of the editor beleagured by the unavailable contributor have you read the last story i sent you the alarum of the soul asked dawe carefully i hesitated over that story shack really i did it had some good points i was writing you a letter to send with it when it goes back to you i regret never mind the regrets said dawe grimly there s neither salve nor sting in em any more what i want to know is why come now out with the good points first the story said westbrook deliberately after a suppressed sigh is written around an almost original plot characterization the best you have done construction almost as good except for a few weak joints which might be strengthened by a few changes and touches it was a good story except i can write english can t i interrupted dawe i have always told you said the editor that you had a style then the trouble is same old thing said editor westbrook you work up to your climax like an artist and then you turn yourself into a photographer i don t know what form of obstinate madness possesses you but that is what you do with everything that you write no i will retract the comparison with the photographer now and then photography in spite of its impossible perspective manages to record a fleeting glimpse of truth but you spoil every d enouement by those flat drab obliterating strokes of your brush that i have so often complained of if you would rise to the literary pinnacle of your dramatic senses and paint them in the high colors that art requires the postman would leave fewer bulky self addressed envelopes at your door oh fiddles and footlights cried dawe derisively you ve got that old sawmill drama kink in your brain yet when the man with the black mustache kidnaps golden haired bessie you are bound to have the mother kneel and raise her hands in the spotlight and say may high heaven witness that i will rest neither night nor day till the heartless villain that has stolen me child feels the weight of another s vengeance editor westbrook conceded a smile of impervious complacency i think said he that in real life the woman would express herself in those words or in very similar ones not in a six hundred nights run anywhere but on the stage said dawe hotly i ll tell you what she d say in real life she d say what bessie led away by a strange man good lord it s one trouble after another get my other hat i must hurry around to the police station why wasn t somebody looking after her i d like to know for god s sake get out of my way or i ll never get ready not that hat the brown one with the velvet bows bessie must have been crazy she s usually shy of strangers is that too much powder lordy how i m upset that s the way she d talk continued dawe people in real life don t fly into heroics and blank verse at emotional crises they simply can t do it if they talk at all on such occasions they draw from the same vocabulary that they use every day and muddle up their words and ideas a little more that s all shack said editor westbrook impressively did you ever pick up the mangled and lifeless form of a child from under the fender of a street car and carry it in your arms and lay it down before the distracted mother did you ever do that and listen to the words of grief and despair as they flowed spontaneously from her lips i never did said dawe did you well no said editor westbrook with a slight frown but i can well imagine what she would say so can i said dawe and now the fitting time had come for editor westbrook to play the oracle and silence his opinionated contributor it was not for an unarrived fictionist to dictate words to be uttered by the heroes and heroines of the minerva magazine contrary to the theories of the editor thereof my dear shack said he if i know anything of life i know that every sudden deep and tragic emotion in the human heart calls forth an apposite concordant conformable and proportionate expression of feeling how much of this inevitable accord between expression and feeling should be attributed to nature and how much to the influence of art it would be difficult to say the sublimely terrible roar of the lioness that has been deprived of her cubs is dramatically as far above her customary whine and purr as the kingly and transcendent utterances of lear are above the level of his senile vaporings but it is also true that all men and women have what may be called a sub conscious dramatic sense that is awakened by a sufficiently deep and powerful emotion a sense unconsciously acquired from literature and the stage that prompts them to express those emotions in language befitting their importance and histrionic value and in the name of the seven sacred saddle blankets of sagittarius where did the stage and literature get the stunt asked dawe from life answered the editor triumphantly the story writer rose from the bench and gesticulated eloquently but dumbly he was beggared for words with which to formulate adequately his dissent on a bench nearby a frowzy loafer opened his red eyes and perceived that his moral support was due a downtrodden brother punch him one jack he called hoarsely to dawe w at s he come makin a noise like a penny arcade for amongst gen lemen that comes in the square to set and think editor westbrook looked at his watch with an affected show of leisure tell me asked dawe with truculent anxiety what especial faults in the alarum of the soul caused you to throw it down when gabriel murray said westbrook goes to his telephone and is told that his fianc ee has been shot by a burglar he says i do not recall the exact words but i do said dawe he says damn central she always cuts me off and then to his friend say tommy does a thirty two bullet make a big hole it s kind of hard luck ain t it could you get me a drink from the sideboard tommy no straight nothing on the side and again continued the editor without pausing for argument when berenice opens the letter from her husband informing her that he has fled with the manicure girl her words are let me see she says interposed the author well what do you think of that absurdly inappropriate words said westbrook presenting an anti climax plunging the story into hopeless bathos worse yet they mirror life falsely no human being ever uttered banal colloquialisms when confronted by sudden tragedy wrong said dawe closing his unshaven jaws doggedly i say no man or woman ever spouts high falutin talk when they go up against a real climax they talk naturally and a little worse the editor rose from the bench with his air of indulgence and inside information say westbrook said dawe pinning him by the lapel would you have accepted the alarum of the soul if you had believed that the actions and words of the characters were true to life in the parts of the story that we discussed it is very likely that i would if i believed that way said the editor but i have explained to you that i do not if i could prove to you that i am right i m sorry shack but i m afraid i haven t time to argue any further just now i don t want to argue said dave i want to demonstrate to you from life itself that my view is the correct one how could you do that asked westbrook in a surprised tone listen said the writer seriously i have thought of a way it is important to me that my theory of true to life fiction be recognized as correct by the magazines i ve fought for it for three years and i m down to my last dollar with two months rent due i have applied the opposite of your theory said the editor in selecting the fiction for the minerva magazine the circulation has gone up from ninety thousand to four hundred thousand said dawe whereas it should have been boosted to a million you said something to me just now about demonstrating your pet theory i will if you ll give me about half an hour of your time i ll prove to you that i am right i ll prove it by louise your wife exclaimed westbrook how well not exactly by her but with her said dawe now you know how devoted and loving louse has always been she thinks i m the only genuine preparation on the market that bears the old doctor s signature she s been fonder and more faithful than ever since i ve been cast for the neglected genius part indeed she is a charming and admirable life companion agreed the editor i remember what inseparable friends she and mrs westbrook once were we are both lucky chaps shack to have such wives you must bring mrs dawe up some evening soon and we ll have one of those informal chafing dish suppers that we used to enjoy so much later said dawe when i get another shirt and now i ll tell you my scheme when i was about to leave home after breakfast if you can call tea and oatmeal breakfast louise told me she was going to visit her aunt in eighty ninth street she said she would return at three o clock she is always on time to a minute it is now dawe glanced toward the editor s watch pocket twenty seven minutes to three said westbrook scanning his time piece we have just enough time said dawe we will go to my flat at once i will write a note address it to her and leave it on the table where she will see it as she enters the door you and i will be in the dining room concealed by the porti eres in that note i ll say that i have fled from her forever with an affinity who understands the need of my artistic soul as she never did when she reads it we will observe her actions and hear her words then we will know which theory is the correct one yours or mine oh never exclaimed the editor shaking his head that would be inexcusably cruel i could not consent to have mrs dawe s feelings played upon in such a manner brace up said the writer i guess i think as much of her as you do it s for her benefit as well as mine i ve got to get a market for my stories in some way it won t hurt louise she s healthy and sound her heart goes as strong as a ninety eight cent watch it ll last for only a minute and then i ll step out and explain to her you really owe it to me to give me the chance westbrook editor westbrook at length yielded though but half willingly and in the half of him that consented lurked the vivisectionist that is in all of us let him who has not used the scalpel rise and stand in his place pity tis that there are not enough rabbits and guinea pigs to go around the two experimenters in art left the square and hurried eastward and then to that south until they arrived in the gramercy neighborhood within its high iron railings the little park had put on its smart coat of vernal green and was admiring itself in its fountain mirror outside the railings the hollow square of crumbling houses shells of a bygone gentry leaned as if in ghostly gossip over the forgotten doings of the vanished quality sic transit gloria urbis a block or two north of the park dawe steered the editor again eastward then after covering a short distance into a lofty but narrow flathouse burdened with a floridly over decorated fa cade to the fifth story they toiled and dawe panting pushed his latch key into the door of one of the front flats when the door opened editor westbrook saw with feelings of pity how meanly and meagerly the rooms were furnished get a chair if you can find one said dawe while i hunt up pen and ink hello what s this here s a note from louise she must have left it there when she went out this morning he picked up an envelope that lay on the centre table and tore it open he began to read the letter that he drew out of it and once having begun it aloud he so read it through to the end these are the words that editor westbrook heard dear shackleford by the time you get this i will be about a hundred miles away and still a going i ve got a place in the chorus of the occidental opera co and we start on the road to day at twelve o clock i didn t want to starve to death and so i decided to make my own living i m not coming back mrs westbrook is going with me she said she was tired of living with a combination phonograph iceberg and dictionary and she s not coming back either we ve been practising the songs and dances for two months on the quiet i hope you will be successful and get along all right good bye louise dawe dropped the letter covered his face with his trembling hands and cried out in a deep vibrating voice my god why hast thou given me this cup to drink since she is false then let thy heaven s fairest gifts faith and love become the jesting by words of traitors and fiends editor westbrook s glasses fell to the floor the fingers of one hand fumbled with a button on his coat as he blurted between his pale lips say shack ain t that a hell of a note wouldn t that knock you off your perch shack ain t it hell now shack ain t it past one at rooney s only on the lower east side of new york do the houses of capulet and montagu survive there they do not fight by the book of arithmetic if you but bite your thumb at an upholder of your opposing house you have work cut out for your steel on broadway you may drag your man along a dozen blocks by his nose and he will only bawl for the watch but in the domain of the east side tybalts and mercutios you must observe the niceties of deportment to the wink of any eyelash and to an inch of elbow room at the bar when its patrons include foes of your house and kin so when eddie mcmanus known to the capulets as cork mcmanus drifted into dutch mike s for a stein of beer and came upon a bunch of montagus making merry with the suds he began to observe the strictest parliamentary rules courtesy forbade his leaving the saloon with his thirst unslaked caution steered him to a place at the bar where the mirror supplied the cognizance of the enemy s movements that his indifferent gaze seemed to disdain experience whispered to him that the finger of trouble would be busy among the chattering steins at dutch mike s that night close by his side drew brick cleary his mercutio companion of his perambulations thus they stood four of the mulberry hill gang and two fo the dry dock gang minding their p s and q s so solicitously that dutch mike kept one eye on his customers and the other on an open space beneath his bar in which it was his custom to seek safety whenever the ominous politeness of the rival associations congealed into the shapes of bullets and cold steel but we have not to do with the wars of the mulberry hills and the dry docks we must to rooney s where on the most blighted dead branch of the tree of life a little pale orchid shall bloom overstrained etiquette at last gave way it is not known who first overstepped the bounds of punctilio but the consequences were immediate buck malone of the mulberry hills with a dewey like swiftness got an eight inch gun swung round from his hurricane deck but mcmanus s simile must be the torpedo he glided in under the guns and slipped a scant three inches of knife blade between the ribs of the mulberry hill cruiser meanwhile brick cleary a devotee to strategy had skimmed across the lunch counter and thrown the switch of the electrics leaving the combat to be waged by the light of gunfire alone dutch mike crawled from his haven and ran into the street crying for the watch instead of for a shakespeare to immortalize the cimmerian shindy the cop came and found a prostrate bleeding montagu supported by three distrait and reticent followers of the house faithful to the ethics of the gangs no one knew whence the hurt came there was no capulet to be seen raus mit der interrogatories said buck malone to the officer sure i know who done it i always manages to get a bird s eye view of any guy that comes up an makes a show case for a hardware store out of me no i m not telling you his name i ll settle with um meself wow ouch easy boys yes i ll attend to his case meself i m not making any complaint at midnight mcmanus strolled around a pile of lumber near an east side dock and lingered in the vicinity of a certain water plug brick cleary drifted casually to the trysting place ten minutes later he ll maybe not croak said brick and he won t tell of course but dutch mike did he told the police he was tired of having his place shot up it s unhandy just now because tim corrigan s in europe for a week s end with kings he ll be back on the kaiser williams next friday you ll have to duck out of sight till then tim ll fix it up all right for us when he comes back this goes to explain why cork mcmanus went into rooney s one night and there looked upon the bright stranger face of romance for the first time in his precarious career until tim corrigan should return from his jaunt among kings and princes and hold up his big white finger in private offices it was unsafe for cork in any of the old haunts of his gang so he lay perdu in the high rear room of a capulet reading pink sporting sheets and cursing the slow paddle wheels of the kaiser wilhelm it was on thursday evening that cork s seclusion became intolerable to him never a hart panted for water fountain as he did for the cool touch of a drifting stein for the firm security of a foot rail in the hollow of his shoe and the quiet hearty challenges of friendship and repartee along and across the shining bars but he must avoid the district where he was known the cops were looking for him everywhere for news was scarce and the newspapers were harping again on the failure of the police to suppress the gangs if they got him before corrigan came back the big white finger could not be uplifted it would be too late then but corrigan would be home the next day so he felt sure there would be small danger in a little excursion that night among the crass pleasures that represented life to him at half past twelve mcmanus stood in a darkish cross town street looking up at the name rooney s picked out by incandescent lights against a signboard over a second story window he had heard of the place as a tough hang out with its frequenters and its locality he was unfamiliar guided by certain unerring indications common to all such resorts he ascended the stairs and entered the large room over the caf e here were some twenty or thirty tables at this time about half filled with rooney s guests waiters served drinks at one end a human pianola with drugged eyes hammered the keys with automatic and furious unprecision at merciful intervals a waiter would roar or squeak a song songs full of mr jonsons and babes and coons historical word guaranties of the genuineness of african melodies composed by red waistcoated young gentlemen natives of the cotton fields and rice swamps of west twenty eighth street for one brief moment you must admire rooney with me as he receives seats manipulates and chaffs his guests he is twenty nine he has wellington s nose dante s chin the cheek bones of an iroquois the smile of talleyrand corbett s foot work and the pose of an eleven year old east side central park queen of the may he is assisted by a lieutenant known as frank a pudgy easy chap swell dressed who goes among the tables seeing that dull care does not intrude now what is there about rooney s to inspire all this pother it is more respectable by daylight stout ladies with children and mittens and bundles and unpedigreed dogs drop up of afternoons for a stein and a chat even by gaslight the diversions are melancholy i the mouth drink and rag time and an occasional surprise when the waiter swabs the suds from under your sticky glass there is an answer transmigration the soul of sir walter raleigh has traveled from beneath his slashed doublet to a kindred home under rooney s visible plaid waistcoat rooney s is twenty years ahead of the times rooney has removed the embargo rooney has spread his cloak upon the soggy crossing of public opinion and any elizabeth who treads upon it is as much a queen as another attend to the revelation of the secret in rooney s ladies may smoke mcmanus sat down at a vacant table he paid for the glass of beer that he ordered tilted his narrow brimmed derby to the back of his brick dust head twined his feet among the rungs of his chair and heaved a sigh of contentment from the breathing spaces of his innermost soul for this mud honey was clarified sweetness to his taste the sham gaiety the hectic glow of counterfeit hospitality the self conscious joyless laughter the wine born warmth the loud music retrieving the hour from frequent whiles of awful and corroding silence the presence of well clothed and frank eyed beneficiaries of rooney s removal of the restrictions laid upon the weed the familiar blended odors of soaked lemon peel flat beer and peau d espagne all these were manna to cork mcmanus hungry for his week in the desert of the capulet s high rear room a girl alone entered rooney s glanced around with leisurely swiftness and sat opposite mcmanus at his table her eyes rested upon him for two seconds in the look with which woman reconnoitres all men whom she for the first time confronts in that space of time she will decide upon one of two things either to scream for the police or that she may marry him later on her brief inspection concluded the girl laid on the table a worn red morocco shopping bag with the inevitable top gallant sail of frayed lace handkerchief flying from a corner of it after she had ordered a small beer from the immediate waiter she took from her bag a box of cigarettes and lighted one with slightly exaggerated ease of manner then she looked again in the eyes of cork mcmanus and smiled instantly the doom of each was sealed the unqualified desire of a man to buy clothes and build fires for a woman for a whole lifetime at first sight of her is not uncommon among that humble portion of humanity that does not care for bradstreet or coats of arms or shaw s plays love at first sight has occurred a time or two in high life but as a rule the extempore mania is to be found among unsophisticated cratures such as the dove the blue tailed dingbat and the ten dollar a week clerk poets subscribers to all fiction magazines and schatchens take notice with the exchange of the mysterious magnetic current came to each of them the instant desire to lie pretend dazzle and deceive which is the worst thing about the hypocritical disorder known as love have another beer suggested cork in his circle the phrase was considered to be a card accompanied by a letter of introduction and references no thanks said the girl raising her eyebrows and choosing her conventional words carefully i merely dropped in for a slight refreshment the cigarette between her fingers seemed to require explanation my aunt is a russian lady she concluded and we often have a post perannual cigarette after dinner at home cheese it said cork whom society airs oppressed your fingers are as yellow as mine say said the girl blazing upon him with low voiced indignation what do you think i am say who do you think you are talking to what she was pretty to look at her eyes were big brown intrepid and bright uner her flat sailor hat planted jauntily on one side her crinkly tawny hair parted and was drawn back low and massy in a thick pendant knot behind the roundness of girlhood still lingered in her chin and neck but her cheeks and fingers were thinning slightly she looked upon the world with defiance suspicion and sullen wonder her smart short tan coat was soiled and expensive two inches below her black dress dropped the lowest flounce of a heliotrope silk underskirt beg your pardon said cork looking at her admiringly i didn t mean anything sure it s no harm to smoke maudy rooney s said the girl softened at once by his amends is the only place i know where a lady can smoke maybe it ain t a nice habit but aunty lets us at home and my name ain t maudy if you please it s ruby delamere that s a swell handle said cork approvingly mine s mcmanus cor er eddie mcmanus oh you can t help that laughed ruby don t apologize cork looked seriously at the big clock on rooney s wall the girl s ubiquitous eyes took in the movement i know it s late she said reaching for her bag but you know how you want a smoke when you want one ain t rooney s all right i never saw anything wrong here this is twice i ve been in i work in a bookbindery on third avenue a lot of us girls have been working overtime three nights a week they won t let you smoke there of course i just dropped in here on my way home for a puff ain t it all right in here if it ain t i won t come any more it s a little bit late for you to be out alone anywhere said cork i m not wise to this particular joint but anyhow you don t want to have your picture taken in it for a present to your sunday school teacher have one more beer and then say i take you home but i don t know you said the girl with fine scrupulosity i don t accept the company of gentlemen i ain t acquainted with my aunt never would allow that why said cork mcmanus pulling his ear i m the latest thing in suitings with side vents and bell skirt when it comes to escortin a lady you bet you ll find me all right ruby and i ll give you a tip as to who i am my governor is one of the hottest cross buns of the wall street push morgan s cab horse casts a shoe every time the old man sticks his head out the window me well i m in trainin down the street the old man s goin to put a seat on the stock exchange in my stockin my next birthday but it all sounds like a lemon to me what i like is golf and yachtin and er well say a corkin fast ten round bout between welter weights with walkin gloves i guess you can walk to the door with me said the girl hesitatingly but with a certain pleased flutter still i never heard anything extra good about wall street brokers or sport who go to prize fights either ain t you got any other recommendations i think you re the swellest looker i ve had my lamps on in little old new york said cork impressively that ll be about enough of that now ain t you the kidder she modified her chiding words by a deep long beaming smile embellished look at her cavalier we ll drink our beer before we go ha a waiter sang the tobacco smoke grew denser drifting and rising in spirals waves tilted layers cumulus clouds cataracts and suspended fogs like some fifth element created from the ribs of the ancient four laughter and chat grew louder stimulated by rooney s liquids and rooney s gallant hospitality to lady nicotine one o clock struck down stairs there was a sound of closing and locking doors frank pulled down the green shades of the front windows carefully rooney went below in the dark hall and stood at the front door his cigarette cached in the hollow of his hand thenceforth whoever might seek admittance must present a countenance familiar to rooney s hawk s eye the countenance of a true sport cork mcmanus and the bookbindery girl conversed absorbedly with their elbows on the table their glasses of beer were pushed to one side scarcely touched with the foam on them sunken to a thin white scum since the stroke of one the stale pleasures of rooney s had become renovated and spiced not by any addition to the list of distractions but because from that moment the sweets became stolen ones the flattest glass of beer acquired the tang of illegality the mildest claret punch struck a knockout blow at law and order the harmless and genial company became outlaws defying authority and rule for after the stroke of one in such places as rooney s where neither bed nor board is to be had drink may not be set before the thirsty of the city of the four million it is the law say said cork mcmanus almost covering the table with his eloquent chest and elbows was that dead straight about you workin in the bookbindery and livin at home and just happenin in here and and all that spiel you gave me sure it was answered the girl with spirit why what do you think do you suppose i d lie to you go down to the shop and ask em i handed it to you on the level on the dead level said cork that s the way i want it because because what i throw up my hands said cork you ve got me goin you re the girl i ve been lookin for will you keep company with me ruby would you like me to eddie surest thing but i wanted a straight story about about yourself you know when a fellow had a girl a steady girl she s got to be all right you know she s got to be straight goods you ll find i ll be straight goods eddie of course you will i believe what you told me but you can t blame me for wantin to find out you don t see many girls smokin cigarettes in places like rooney s after midnight that are like you the girl flushed a little and lowered her eyes i see that now she said meekly i didn t know how bad it looked but i won t do it any more and i ll go straight home every night and stay there and i ll give up cigarettes if you say so eddie i ll cut em out from this minute on cork s air became judicial proprietary condemnatory yet sympathetic a lady can smoke he decided slowly at times and places why because it s bein a lady that helps her pull it off i m going to quit there s nothing to it said the girl she flicked the stub of her cigarette to the floor at times and places repeated cork when i call round for you of evenin s we ll hunt out a dark bench in stuyvesant square and have a puff or two but no more rooney s at one o clock see eddie do you really like me the girl searchd his hard but frank features eagerly with anxious eyes on the dead level

m suited on the dead level i do against the front door down stairs repeated heavy blows were delivered the loud crashes resounded in the room above only a trip hammer or a policeman s foot could have been the author of those sounds rooney jumped like a bullfrog to a corner of the room turned off the electric lights and hurried swiftly below the room was left utterly dark except for the winking red glow of cigars and cigarettes a second volley of crashes came up from the assaulted door a little rustling murmuring panic moved among the besieged guests frank cool smooth reassuring could be seen in the rosy glow of the burning tobacco going from table to table all keep still was his caution don t talk or make any noise everything will be all right now don t feel the slightest alarm we ll take care of you all ruby felt across the table until cork s firm hand closed upon hers are you afraid eddie she whispered are you afraid you ll get a free ride nothin doin in the teeth chatterin line said cork i guess rooney s been slow with his envelope don t you worry girly i ll look out for you all right yet mr mcmanus s ease was only skin and muscle deep with the police looking everywhere for buck malone s assailant and with corrigan still on the ocean wave he felt that to be caught in a police raid would mean an ended career for him he wished he had remained in the high rear room of the true capulet reading the pink extras rooney seemed to have opened the front door below and engaged the police in conference in the dark hall the wordless low growl of their voices came up the stairway frank made a wireless news station of himself at the upper door suddenly he closed the door hurried to the extreme rear of the room and lighted a dim gas jet this way everybody he called sharply in a hurry but no noise please the guests crowded in confusion to the rear rooney s lieutenant swung open a panel in the wall overlooking the back yard revealing a ladder already placed for the escape down and out everybody he commanded ladies first less talking please don t crowd there s no danger among the last cork and ruby waited their turn at the open panel suddenly she swept him aside and clung to his arm fiercely before we go out she whispered in his ear before anything happens tell me again eddie do you l do you really like me on the dead level said cork holding her close with one arm when it comes to you i m all in when they turned they found they were lost and in darkness the last of the fleeing customers had descended half way across the yard they bore the ladder stumbling giggling hurrying to place it against adjoining low building over the roof of which their only route to safety we may as well sit down said cork grimly maybe rooney will stand the cops off anyhow they sat at a table and their hands came together again a number of men then entered the dark room feeling their way about one of them rooney himself found the switch and turned on the electric light the other man was a cop of the old regime a big cop a thick cop a fuming abrupt cop not a pretty cop he went up to the pair at the table and sneered familiarly at the girl what are youse doin in here he asked dropped in for a smoke said cork mildly had any drinks not later than one o clock get out quick ordered the cop then sit down he countermanded he took off cork s hat roughly and scrutinized him shrewdly your name s mcmanus bad guess said cork it s peterson cork mcmanus or something like that said the cop you put a knife into a man in dutch mike s saloon a week ago aw forget it said cork who perceived a shade of doubt in the officer s tones you ve got my mug mixed with somebody else s have i well you ll come to the station with me anyhow and be looked over the description fits you all right the cop twisted his fingers under cork s collar come on he ordered roughly cork glanced at ruby she was pale and her thin nostrils quivered her quick eye danced from one man s face to the other as they spoke or moved what hard luck cork was thinking corrigan on the briny and ruby met and lost almost within an hour somebody at the police station would recognize him without a doubt hard luck but suddenly the girl sprang up and hurled herself with both arms extended against the cop his hold on cork s collar was loosened and he stumbled back two or three paces don t go so fast maguire she cried in shrill fury keep your hands off my man you know me and you know i m givin you good advice don t you touch him again he s not the guy you are lookin for i ll stand for that see here fanny said the cop red and angry i ll take you too if you don t look out how do you know this ain t the man i want what are you doing in here with him how do i know said the girl flaming red and white by turns because i ve known him a year he s mine oughtn t i to know and what am i doin here with him that s easy she stooped low and reached down somewhere into a swirl of flirted draperies heliotrope and black an elastic snapped she threw on the table toward cork a folded wad of bills the money slowly straightened itself with little leisurely jerks take that jimmy and let s go said the girl i m declarin the usual dividends maguire she said to the officer you had your usual five dollar graft at the usual corner at ten a lie said the cop turning purple you go on my beat again and i ll arrest you every time i see you no you won t said the girl and i ll tell you why witnesses saw me give you the money to night and last week too i ve been getting fixed for you cork put the wad of money carefuly into his pocket and said come on fanny let s have some chop suey before we go home clear out quick both of you or i ll the cop s bluster trailed away into inconsequentiality at the corner of the street the two halted cork handed back the money without a word the girl took it and slipped it slowly into her hand bag her expression was the same she had worn when she entered rooney s that night she looked upon the world with defiance suspicion and sullen wonder i guess i might as well say good bye here she said dully you won t want to see me again of course will you shake hands mr mcmanus i mightn t have got wise if you hadn t give the snap away said cork why did you do it you d have been pinched if i hadn t that s why ain t that reason enough then she began to cry honest eddie i was goin to be the best girl in the world i hated to be what i am i hated men i was ready almost to die when i saw you and you seemed different from everybody else and when i found you liked me too why i thought i d make you believe i was good and i was goin to be good when you asked to come to my house and see me why i d have died rather than do anything wrong after that but what s the use of talking about it i ll say good by if you will mr mcmanus cork was pulling at his ear i knifed malone said he i was the one the cop wanted oh that s all right said the girl listlessly it didn t make any difference about that that was all hot air about wall street i don t do nothin but hang out with a tough gang on the east side that was all right too repeated the girl it didn t make any difference cork straightened himself and pulled his hat down low i could get a job at o brien s he said aloud but to himself good by said the girl come on said cork taking her arm i know a place two blocks away he turned with her up the steps of a red brick house facing a little park what house is this she asked drawing back why are you going in there a street lamp shone brightly in front there was a brass nameplate at one side of the closed front doors cork drew her firmly up the steps read that said he she looked at the name on the plate and gave a cry between a moan and a scream no no no eddie oh my god no i won t let you do that not now let me go you shan t do that you can t you mus n t not after you know no no come away quick oh my god please eddie come half fainting she reeled and was caught in the bend of his arm cork s right hand felt for the electric button and pressed it long another cop how quickly they scent trouble when trouble is on the wing came along saw them and ran up the steps here what are you doing with that girl he called gruffly she ll be all right in a minute said cork it s a straight deal reverend jeremiah jones read the cop from the door plate with true detective cunning correct said cork on the dead level we re goin to get married the venturers let the story wreck itself on the spreading rails of the non sequitur limited if it will first you must take your seat in the observation car raison d tre for one moment it is for no longer than to consider a brief essay on the subject let us call it what s around the corner omne mundus in duas partes divisum est men who wear rubbers and pay poll taxes and men who discover new continents there are no more continents to discover but by the time overshoes are out of date and the poll has developed into an income tax the other half will be paralleling the canals of mars with radium railways fortune chance and adventure are given as synonymous in the dictionaries to the knowing each has a different meaning fortune is a prize to be won adventure is the road to it chance is what may lurk in the shadows at the roadside the face of fortune is radiant and alluring that of adventure is flushed and heroic the face of chance is the beautiful countenance perfect because vague and dream born that we see in our tea cups at breakfast while we growl over our chops and toast the venturer is one who keeps his eye on the hedgerows and wayside groves and meadows while he travels the road to fortune that is the difference between him and the adventurer eating the forbidden fruit was the best record ever made by a venturer trying to prove that it happened is the highest work of the adventuresome to be either is disturbing to the cosmogony of creation so as bracket sawed and city directoried citizens let us light our pipes chide the children and the cat arrange ourselves in the willow rocker under the flickering gas jet at the coolest window and scan this little tale of two modern followers of chance did you ever hear that story about the man from the west asked billinger in the little dark oak room to your left as you penetrate the interior of the powhatan club doubtless said john reginald forster rising and leaving the room forster got his straw hat straws will be in and maybe out again long before this is printed from the checkroom boy and walked out of the air as hamlet says billinger was used to having his stories insulted and would not mind forster was in his favorite mood and wanted to go away from anywhere a man in order to get on good terms with himself must have his opinions corroborated and his moods matched by some one else i had written that somebody but an a d t boy who once took a telegram for me pointed out that i could save money by using the compound word this is a vice versa case forster s favorite mood was that of greatly desiring to be a follower of chance he was a venturer by nature but convention birth tradition and the narrowing influences of the tribe of manhattan had denied him full privilege he had trodden all the main traveled thoroughfares and many of the side roads that are supposed to relieve the tedium of life but none had sufficed the reason was that he knew what was to be found at the end of every street he knew from experience and logic almost precisely to what end each digression from routine must lead he found a depressing monotony in all the variations that the music of his sphere had grafted upon the tune of life he had not learned that although the world was made round the circle has been squared and that it s true interest is to be in what s around the corner forster walked abroad aimlessly from the powhatan trying not to tax either his judgment or his desire as to what streets he traveled he would have been glad to lose his way if it were possible but he had no hope of that adventure and fortune move at your beck and call in the greater city but chance is oriental she is a veiled lady in a sedan chair protected by a special traffic squad of dragonians crosstown uptown and downtown you may move without seeing her at the end of an hour s stroll forster stood on a corner of a broad smooth avenue looking disconsolately across it at a picturesque old hotel softly but brilliantly lit disconsolately because he knew that he must dine and dining in that hotel was no venture it was one of his favorite caravansaries and so silent and swift would be the service and so delicately choice the food that he regretted the hunger that must be appeased by the dead perfection of the place s cuisine even the music there seemed to be always playing da capo fancy came to him that he would dine at some cheap even dubious restaurant lower down in the

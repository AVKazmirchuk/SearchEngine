and winked at myself in a mirror i heard him moving and i turned again quickly i didn t want a hundred and ninety eight pounds falling on me from the rear but tom had only turned partly over and laid one arm across his face he spoke a few words rather more distinctly than before i couldn t have talked this way to you billy even if i d heard people lyin bout you but jus soon s i can s stand up i ll break your neck don f get it i did feel a little ashamed then but it was to save tom in the morning when i explained it we would have a good laugh over it together in about twenty minutes tom dropped into a sound easy slumber i felt his pulse listened to his respiration and let him sleep everything was normal and tom was safe i went into the other room and tumbled into bed i found tom up and dressed when i awoke the next morning he was entirely himself again with the exception of shaky nerves and a tongue like a white oak chip what an idiot i was he said thoughtfully i remember thinking that quinine bottle looked queer while i was taking the dose have much trouble in bringing me round i told him no his memory seemed bad about the entire affair i concluded that he had no recollection of my efforts to keep him awake and decided not to enlighten him some other time i thought when he was feeling better we would have some fun over it when tom was ready to go he stopped with the door open and shook my hand much obliged old fellow he said quietly for taking so much trouble with me and for what you said i m going down now to telegraph to the little girl a ghost of a chance actually a hod repeated mrs kinsolving pathetically mrs bellamy bellmore arched a sympathetic eyebrow thus she expressed condolence and a generous amount of apparent surprise fancy her telling everywhere recapitulated mrs kinsolving that she saw a ghost in the apartment she occupied here our choicest guest room a ghost carrying a hod on its shoulder the ghost of an old man in overalls smoking a pipe and carrying a hod the very absurdity of the thing shows her malicious intent there never was a kinsolving that carried a hod every one knows that mr kinsolving s father accumulated his money by large building contracts but he never worked a day with his own hands he had this house built from his own plans but oh a hod why need she have been so cruel and malicious it is really too bad murmured mrs bellmore with an approving glance of her fine eyes about the vast chamber done in lilac and old gold and it was in this room she saw it oh no i m not afraid of ghosts don t have the least fear on my account i m glad you put me in here i think family ghosts so interesting but really the story does sound a little inconsistent i should have expected something better from mrs fischer suympkins don t they carry bricks in hods why should a ghost bring bricks into a villa built of marble and stone i m so sorry but it makes me think that age is beginning to tell upon mrs fischer suympkins this house continued mrs kinsolving was built upon the site of an old one used by the family during the revolution there wouldn t be anything strange in its having a ghost and there was a captain kinsolving who fought in general greene s army though we ve never been able to secure any papers to vouch for it if there is to be a family ghost why couldn t it have been his instead of a bricklayer s the ghost of a revolutionary ancestor wouldn t be a bad idea agreed mrs bellmore but you know how arbitrary and inconsiderate ghosts can be maybe like love they are engendered in the eye one advantage of those who see ghosts is that their stories can t be disproved by a spiteful eye a revolutionary knapsack might easily be construed to be a hod dear mrs kinsolving think no more of it i am sure it was a knapsack but she told everybody mourned mrs kinsolving inconsolable she insisted upon the details there is the pipe and how are you going to get out of the overalls shan t get into them said mrs bellmore with a prettily suppressed yawn too stiff and wrinkly is that you felice prepare my bath please do you dine at seven at clifftop mrs kinsolving so kind of you to run in for a chat before dinner i love those little touches of informality with a guest they give such a home flavour to a visit so sorry i must be dressing i am so indolent i always postpone it until the last moment mrs fischer suympkins had been the first large plum that the kinsolvings had drawn from the social pie for a long time the pie itself had been out of reach on a top shelf but the purse and the pursuit had at last lowered it mrs fischer suympkins was the heliograph of the smart society parading corps the glitter of her wit and actions passed along the line transmitting whatever was latest and most daring in the game of peep show formerly her fame and leadership had been secure enough not to need the support of such artifices as handing around live frogs for favours at a cotillon but now these things were necessary to the holding of her throne beside middle age had come to preside incongruous at her capers the sensational papers had cut her space from a page to two columns her wit developed a

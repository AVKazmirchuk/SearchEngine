beyond the compass of his experience they were not to be had in the pension murphy but their equivalent was at hand triumphantly he sent the granite ware wash basin at the head of his matrimonial adversary mrs mccaskey dodged in time she reached for a flatiron with which as a sort of cordial she hoped to bring the gastronomical duel to a close but a loud wailing scream downstairs caused both her and mr mccaskey to pause in a sort of involuntary armistice on the sidewalk at the corner of the house policeman cleary was standing with one ear upturned listening to the crash of household utensils tis jawn mccaskey and his missis at it again meditated the policeman i wonder shall i go up and stop the row i will not married folks they are and few pleasures they have twill not last long

hastily in the other direction the boarders on the steps were fluttered mr toomey an insurance solicitor by birth and an investigator by profession went inside to analyse the scream he returned with the news that mrs murphy s little boy mike was lost following the messenger out bounced mrs murphy two hundred pounds in tears and hysterics clutching the air and howling to the sky for the loss of thirty pounds of freckles and mischief bathos truly but mr toomey sat down at the side of miss purdy millinery and their hands came together in sympathy the two old maids misses walsh who complained

some side bacon mr mills the ranch owner and my old friend rode away to the ranch with his force of mexican trabajadores while the bacon was frizzling nicely there was the sound of horses hoofs behind us bud s six shooter lay in its scabbard ten feet away from his hand he paid not the slightest heed to the approaching horseman this attitude of a texas ranchman was so different from the old time custom that i marvelled instinctively i turned to inspect the possible foe that menaced us in the rear i saw a horseman dressed in black who might have been a lawyer or a parson or an undertaker trotting peaceably along the road by the arroyo bud noticed my precautionary movement and smiled sarcastically and sorrowfully you ve been away too long said he you don t need to look around any more when anybody gallops up behind you in this state unless something hits you in the back and even then it s liable to be only a bunch of tracts or a petition to sign against the trusts i never looked at that hombre that rode by but i ll bet a quart of sheep dip that he s some double dyed son of a popgun out rounding up prohibition votes times have changed bud said i oracularly law and order is the rule now in the south and the southwest i caught a cold gleam from bud s pale blue eyes not that i i began hastily of course you don t said bud warmly you know better you ve lived here before law and order you say twenty years ago we had em here we only had two or three laws such as against murder before witnesses and being caught stealing horses and voting the republican ticket but how is it now all we get is orders and the laws go out of the state them legislators set up there at austin and don t do nothing but make laws against kerosene oil and schoolbooks being brought into the state i re ckon they was afraid some man would go home some evening after work and light up and get an education and go to work and make laws to repeal aforesaid laws me i m for the old days when law and order meant what they said a law was a law and a order was a order but i began i was going on continued bud while this coffee is boiling to describe to you a case of genuine law and order that i knew of once in the times when cases was decided in the chambers of a six shooter instead of a supreme court you ve heard of old ben kirkman the cattle king his ranch run from the nueces to the rio grande in them days as you know there was cattle barons and cattle kings the difference was this when a cattleman went to san antone and bought beer for the newspaper reporters and only give them the number of cattle he actually owned they wrote him up for a baron when he bought em champagne wine and added in the amount of cattle he had stole they called him a king luke summers was one of his range bosses and down to the king s ranch comes one day a bunch of these oriental people from new york or kansas city or thereabouts luke was detailed with a squad to ride about with em and see that the rattlesnakes got fair warning when they was coming and drive the deer out of their way among the bunch was a black eyed girl that wore a number two shoe that s all i noticed about her but luke must have seen more for he married her one day before the caballard started back and went over on canada verde and set up a ranch of his own i m skipping over the sentimental stuff on purpose because i never saw or wanted to see any of it and luke takes me along with him because we was old friends and i handled cattle to suit him i m skipping over much what followed because i never saw or wanted to see any of it but three years afterward there was a boy kid stumbling and blubbering around the galleries and floors of luke s ranch i never had no use for kids but it seems they did and i m skipping over much what followed until one day out to the ranch drives in hacks and buckboards a lot of mrs summers s friends from the east a sister or so and two or three men one looked like an uncle to somebody and one looked like nothing and the other one had on corkscrew pants and spoke in a tone of voice i never liked a man who spoke in a tone of voice i m skipping over much what followed but one afternoon when i rides up to the ranch house to get some orders about a drove of beeves that was to be shipped i hears something like a popgun go off i waits at the hitching rack not wishing to intrude on private affairs in a little while luke comes out and gives some orders to some of his mexican hands and they go and hitch up sundry and divers vehicles and mighty soon out comes one of the sisters or so and some of the two or three men but two of the two or thee men carries between em the corkscrew man who spoke in a tone of voice and lays him flat down in one of the wagons and they all might have been seen wending their way away bud says luke to me i want you to fix up a little and go up to san antone with me let me get on my mexican spurs says i

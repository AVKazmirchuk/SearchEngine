got off the train since i mushed out of seattle and i m hungry the stuff the niggers feed you on pullmans don t count you gentlemen order what you want and then milly loomed up with a thousand dishes on her bare arm loomed up big and white and pink and awful as mount saint elias with a smile like day breaking in a gulch and the kiondiker threw down his pelts and nuggets as dross and let his jaw fall half way and stared at her you could almost see the diamond tiaras on milly s brow and the hand embroidered silk paris gowns that he meant to buy for her at last the bollworm had attacked the cotton the poison ivy was reaching out its tendrils to entwine the summer boarder the millionaire lumberman thinly disguised as the alaskan miner was about to engulf our milly and upset nature s adjustment kraft was the first to act he leaped up and pounded the klondiker s back come out and drink he shouted drink first and eat afterward judkins seized one arm and i the other gaily roaringly irresistibly in jolly good fellow style we dragged him from the restaurant to a cafe stuffing his pockets with his embalmed birds and indigestible nuggets there he rumbled a roughly good humoured protest that s the girl for my money he declared she can eat out of my skillet the rest of her life why i never see such a fine girl i m going back there and ask her to marry me i guess she won t want to sling hash any more when she sees the pile of dust i ve got you ll take another whiskey and milk now kraft persuaded with satan s smile i thought you up country fellows were better sports kraft spent his puny store of coin at the bar and then gave judkins and me such an appealing look that we went down to the last dime we had in toasting our guest then when our ammunition was gone and the klondiker still somewhat sober began to babble again of milly kraft whispered into his ear such a polite barbed insult relating to people who were miserly with their funds that the miner crashed down handful after handful of silver and notes calling for all the fluids in the world to drown the imputation thus the work was accomplished with his own guns we drove him from the field and then we had him carted to a distant small hotel and put to bed with his nuggets and baby seal skins stuffed around him he will never find cypher s again said kraft he will propose to the first white apron he sees in a dairy restaurant to morrow and milly i mean the natural adjustment is saved and back to cypher s went we three and finding customers scarce we joined hands and did an indian dance with milly in the centre this i say happened three years ago and about that time a little luck descended upon us three and we were enabled to buy costlier and less wholesome food than cypher s our paths separated and i saw kraft no more and judkins seldom but as i said i saw a painting the other day that was sold for the title was boadicea and the figure seemed to fill all out of doors but of all the picture s admirers who stood before it i believe i was the only one who longed for boadicea to stalk from her frame bringing me corned beef hash with poached egg i hurried away to see kraft his satanic eyes were the same his hair was worse tangled but his clothes had been made by a tailor i didn t know i said to him we ve bought a cottage in the bronx with the money said he any evening at then said i when you led us against the lumberman the klondiker it wasn t altogether on account of the unerring artistic adjustment of nature well not altogether said kraft with a grin memoirs of a yellow dog i don t suppose it will knock any of you people off your perch to read a contribution from an animal mr kipling and a good many others have demonstrated the fact that animals can express themselves in remunerative english and no magazine goes to press nowadays without an animal story in it except the old style monthlies that are still running pictures of bryan and the mont pelee horror but you needn t look for any stuck up literature in my piece such as bearoo the bear and snakoo the snake and tammanoo the tiger talk in the jungle books a yellow dog that s spent most of his life in a cheap new york flat sleeping in a corner on an old sateen underskirt the one she spilled port wine on at the lady longshoremen s banquet mustn t be expcctcd to perform any tricks with the art of speech i was born a yellow pup date locality pedigree and weight unknown the first thing i can recollect an old woman had me in a basket at broadway and twenty third trying to sell me to a fat lady old mother hubbard was boosting me to beat the band as a genuine pomeranian hambletonian red irish cochin china stoke pogis fox terrier the fat lady chased a v around among the samples of gros grain flannelette

a couple of siberian bloodhounds this scene is what runs the best seller into the twenty ninth edition before the publisher has had time to draw a check for the advance royalties the american hero shucks his coat and throws it over the heads of the bloodhounds gives the mitrailleuse a slap with his mitt says yah to the yataghan and lands in kid mccoy s best style on the count s left eye of course we have a neat little prize fight right then and there the count in order to make the go possible seems to be an expert at the art of self defence himself and here we have the corbett sullivan fight done over into literature the book ends with the broker and the princess doing a john cecil clay cover under the linden trees on the gorgonzola walk that winds up the love story plenty good enough but i notice that the book dodges the final issue even a best seller has sense enough to shy at either leaving a chicago grain broker on the throne of lobsterpotsdam or bringing over a real princess to eat fish and potato salad in an italian chalet on michigan avenue what do you think about em why said i i hardly know john there s a saying love levels all ranks you know yes said pescud but these kind of love stories are rank on the level i know something about literature even if i am in plate glass these kind of books are wrong and yet i never go into a train but what they pile em up on me no good can come out of an international clinch between the old world aristocracy and one of us fresh americans when people in real life marry they generally hunt up somebody in their own station a fellow usually picks out a girl that went to the same high school and belonged to the same singing society that he did when young millionaires fall in love they always select the chorus girl that likes the same kind of sauce on the lobster that he does washington newspaper correspondents always many widow ladies ten years older than themselves who keep boarding houses no sir you can t make a novel sound right to me when it makes one of c d gibson s bright young men go abroad and turn kingdoms upside down just because he s a taft american aud took a course at a gymnasium and listen how they talk too pescud picked up the best seller and hunted his page listen at this said he trevelyan is chinning with the princess alwyna at the back end of the tulip garden this is how it goes say not so dearest and sweetest of earth s fairest flowers would i aspire you are a star set high above me in a royal heaven i am only myself yet i am a man and i have a heart to do and dare i have no title save that of an uncrowned sovereign but i have an arm and a sword that yet might free schutzenfestenstein from the plots of traitors think of a chicago man packing a sword and talking about freeing anything that sounded as much like canned pork as that he d be much more likely to fight to have an import duty put on it i think i understand you john said i you want fiction writers to be consistent with their scenes and characters they shouldn t mix turkish pashas with vermont farmers or english dukes with long island clam diggers or italian countesses with montana cowboys or cincinnati brewery agents with the rajahs of india or plain business men with aristocracy high above em added pescud it don t jibe people are divided into classes whether we admit it or not and it s everybody s impulse to stick to their own class they do it too i don t see why people go to work and buy hundreds of thousands of books like that you don t see or hear of any such didoes and capers in real life iii well john said i i haven t read a best seller in a long time maybe i ve had notions about them somewhat like yours but tell me more about yourself getting along all right with the company bully said pescud brightening at once i ve had my salary raised twice since i saw you and i get a commission too i ve bought a neat slice of real estate out in the east end and have run up a house on it next year the firm is going to sell me some shares of stock oh i m in on the line of general prosperity no matter who s elected met your affinity yet john i asked oh i didn t tell you about that did i said pescud with a broader grin ho i said so you ve taken time enough off from your plate glass to have a romance no no said john no romance nothing like that but i ll tell you about it i was on the south bound going to cincinnati about eighteen months ago when i saw across the aisle the finest looking girl i d ever laid eyes on nothing spectacular you know but just the sort you want for keeps well i never was up to the flirtation business either handkerchief automobile postage stamp or door step and she wasn t the kind to start anything she read a book and minded her business which was to make the world prettier and better just by residing on it i kept on looking out of the side doors of my eyes and finally the proposition got out of the pullman class into a case

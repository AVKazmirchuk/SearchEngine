the absent dust from the half calf backs of lamb chaucer hazlitt marcus aurelius montaigne and hood she was exquisite she was a valuable discovery nearly everybody nowadays knows too much oh so much too much of real life i could perceive clearly that azalea adair was very poor a house and a dress she had not much else i fancied so divided between my duty to the magazine and my loyalty to the poets and essayists who fought thomas in the valley of the cumberland i listened to her voice which was like a harpsichord s and found that i could not speak of contracts in the presence of the nine muses and the three graces one hesitated to lower the topic to two cents there would have to be another colloquy after i had regained my commercialism but i spoke of my mission and three o clock of

a home town i should say where few things out of the ordinary ever happen it carries on an extensive trade in stoves and hollow ware with the west and south and its flouring mills have a daily capacity of more than barrels azalea adair seemed to reflect i have never thought of it that way she said with a kind of sincere intensity that seemed to belong to her isn t it in the still quiet places that things do happen i fancy that when god began to create the earth on the first monday morning one could have leaned out one s window and heard the drops of mud splashing from his trowel as he built up the everlasting hills what did the noisiest project in the world i mean the building of the tower of bable result in finally a page and a half of esperanto in the north american review of course said i platitudinously human nature is the same everywhere but there is more color er more drama and movement and er romance in some cities than in others on the surface said azalea adair i have traveled many times around the world in a golden airship wafted on two wings print and dreams i have seen on one of my imaginary tours the sultan of turkey bowstring with his own hands one of his wives who had uncovered her face in public i have seen a man in nashville tear up his theatre tickets because his wife was going out with her face covered with rice powder in san francisco s chinatown i saw the slave girl sing yee dipped slowly inch by inch in boiling almond oil to make her swear she would never see her american lover again she gave in when the boiling oil had reached three inches above her knee at a euchre party in east nashville the other night i saw kitty morgan cut dead by seven of her schoolmates and lifelong friends because she had married a house painter the boiling oil was sizzling as high as her heart but i wish you could have seen the fine little smile that she carried from table to table oh yes it is a humdrum town just a few miles of red brick houses and mud and

missing torn in two pieces and pasted together again with a strip of blue tissue paper it was one of the bills i had given the piratical negro there was no doubt about it go up to mr baker s store on

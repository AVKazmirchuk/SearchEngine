finger tips the grand opera stars of all the continents from jenny lind to emma abbott only to depreciate their endowments he spoke of larynxes of chest notes of phrasing arpeggios and other strange paraphernalia of the throaty art he admitted as though driven to a corner that jenny lind had a note or two in the high register that miss hinkle had not yet acquired but that was a mere matter of practice and training and as a peroration he predicted solemnly predicted a career in vocal art for the coming star of the southwest and one of which grand old texas may well be proud hitherto unsurpassed in the annals of musical history when we left at ten ileen gave each of us her usual warm cordial handshake entrancing smile and invitation to call again i could not see that one was favored above or below another but three of us knew we knew we knew that frankness and honesty had won and that the rivals now numbered three instead of four down at the station jacks brought out a pint bottle of the proper stuff and we celebrated the downfall of a blatant interloper four days went by without anything happening worthy of recount on the fifth jacks and i entering the brush arbor for our supper saw the mexican youth instead of a divinity in a spotless waist and a navy blue skirt taking in the dollars through the barbed wire wicket we rushed into the kitchen meeting pa hinkle coming out with two cups of hot coffee in his hands where s ileen we asked in recitative pa hinkle was a kindly man well gents said he it was a sudden notion she took but i ve got the money and i let her have her way she s gone to a corn a conservatory in boston for four years for to have her voice cultivated now excuse me to pass gents for this coffee s hot and my thumbs is tender that night there were four instead of three of us sitting on the station platform and swinging our feet c vincent vesey was one of us we discussed things while dogs barked at the moon that rose as big as a five cent piece or a flour barrel over the chaparral and what we discussed was whether it is better to lie to a woman or to tell her the truth and as all of us were young then we did not come to a decision

unpublished poems of david mignot the song was over the words were david s the air one of the countryside the company about the inn table applauded heartily for the young poet paid for the wine only the notary m papineau shook his head a little at the lines for he was a man of books and he had not drunk with the rest david went out into the village street where the night air drove the wine vapour from his head and then he remembered that he and yvonne had quarrelled that day and that he had resolved to leave his home that night to seek fame and honour in the great world outside when my poems are on every man s tongue he told himself in a fine exhilaration she will perhaps think of the hard words she spoke this day except the roisterers in the tavern the village folk were abed david crept softly into his room in the shed of his father s cottage and made a bundle of his small store of clothing with this upon a staff he set his face outward upon the road that ran from vernoy he passed

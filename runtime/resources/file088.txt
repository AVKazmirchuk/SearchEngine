with her she had attended a convent school in new orleans for two years and when she chose to display her accomplishments no one could detect any difference between her and the girls of norfolk and manhattan but it was delicious to see her at home dressed as she sometimes was in the native costume with bare shoulders and flowing sleeves bernard brannigan was the great merchant of coralio besides his store he maintained a train of pack mules and carried on a lively trade with the interior towns and villages he had married a native lady of high castilian descent but with a tinge of indian brown showing through her olive cheek the union of the irish and the spanish had produced as it so often has an offshoot of rare beauty and variety they were very excellent people indeed and the upper story of the house was ready to be placed at the service of geddie and paula as soon as he should make up his mind to speak about it by the time two hours were whiled away the consul tired of reading the papers lay scattered about him on the gallery reclining there he gazed dreamily out upon an eden a clump of banana plants interposed their broad shields between him and the sun the gentle slope from the consulate to the sea was covered with the dark green foliage of lemon trees and orange trees just bursting into bloom a lagoon pierced the land like a dark jagged crystal and above it a pale ceiba tree rose almost to the clouds the waving coconut palms on the beach flared their decorative green leaves against the slate of an almost quiescent sea his senses were cognizant of brilliant scarlet and ochres and the vert of the coppice of odors of fruit and bloom and the smoke from chanca s clay oven under the calabash tree of the treble laughter of the native women in their huts the song of the robin the salt taste of the breeze the diminuendo of the faint surf running along the shore and gradually of a white speck growing to a blur that intruded itself upon the drab prospect of the sea lazily interested he watched this blur increase until it became the idalia steaming at full speed coming down the coast without changing his position he kept his eyes upon the beautiful white yacht as she drew swiftly near and came opposite to coralio then sitting upright he saw her float steadily past and on he had seen the frequent splash of her polished brass work and the stripes of her deck awnings so much and no more like a ship on a magic lantern slide the idalia had crossed the illuminated circle of the consul s little world and was gone save for the tiny cloud of smoke that was left hanging over the brim of the sea she might have been an immaterial thing a chimera of his idle brain geddie went into his office and sat down to dawdle over his report if the reading of the article in the paper had left him unshaken this silent passing of the idalia had done for him still more it had brought the calm and peace of a situation from which all uncertainty had been erased he knew that men sometimes hope without being aware of it now since she had come two thousand miles and had passed without a sign not even his unconscious self need cling to the past any longer after dinner when the sun was low behind the mountains geddie walked on the little strip of beach under the coconuts the wind was blowing mildly landward and the surface of the sea was rippled by tiny wavelets a miniature breaker spreading with a soft swish upon the sand brought with its something round and shiny that rolled back again as the wave receded the next influx beached it clear and geddie picked it up the thing was a long necked wine bottle of colorless glass the cork had been driven in tightly to the level of the mouth and the end covered with dark red sealing wax the bottle contained only what seemed to be a sheet of paper much curled from the manipulation it had undergone while being inserted in the sealing wax was the impression of a seal probably of a signet ring bearing the initials of a monogram but the impression had been hastily made and the letters were past anything more certain than a shrewd conjecture ida payne had always worn a signet ring in preference to any other finger decoration geddie thought he could make out the familiar i p and a queer sensation of disquietude went over him more personal and intimate was this reminder of her than had been the sight of the vessel she was doubtless on he walked back to his house and set the bottle on his desk throwing off his hat and coat and lighting a lamp for the night had crowded precipitately upon the brief twilight he began to examine his piece of sea salvage by holding the bottle near the light and turning it judiciously he made out that it contained a double sheet of note paper filled with close writing further that the paper was of the same size and shade as that always used by ida and that to the best of his belief the handwriting was hers the imperfect glass of the bottle so distorted the rays of light that he could read no word of the writing but certain capital letters of which he caught comprehensive glimpses were ida s he felt sure there was a little smile both of perplexity and amusement in geddie s eyes as he set the bottle down and laid three cigars side by side on his desk he fetched his steamer chair from the gallery and stretched himself comfortably he would smoke

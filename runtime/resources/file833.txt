pretty bad but she refused to change clothes or rather added the officer with a smile to put on some i thought i d explain matters to you so you wouldn t think she was being imposed upon what is the charge asked lorison grand larceny diamonds her husband is a jeweller in chicago she cleaned his show case of the sparklers and skipped with a comic opera troupe the policeman perceiving that the interest of the entire group of spectators was centred upon himself and lorison their conference being regarded as a possible new com plication was fain to prolong the situation which reflected his own importance by a little afterpiece of philosophical comment a gentleman like you sir he went on affably would never notice it but it comes in my line to observe what an immense amount of trouble is made by that com bination i mean the stage diamonds and light headed women who aren t satisfied with good homes i tell you sir a man these days and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to the policeman smiled a good night and returned to the side of his charge who had been intently watching lorison s face during the conversation no doubt for some indication of his intention to render succour now at the failure of the sign and at the movement made to continue the ignominious progress she abandoned hope and addressed him thus pointedly you damn chalk faced quitter you was thinking of giving me a hand but you let the cop talk you out of it the first word you re a dandy to tie to say if you ever get a girl she ll have a picnic won t she work you to the queen s taste oh my she concluded with a taunting shrill laugh that rasped lorison like a saw the policemen urged her forward the delighted train of gaping followers closed up the rear and the captive amazon accepting her fate extended the scope of her maledictions so that none in hearing might seem to be slighted then there came upon lorison an overwhelming revulsion of his perspective it may be that he had been ripe for it that the abnormal condition of mind in which he had for so long existed was already about to revert to its balance however it is certain that the events of the last few minutes had furnished the channel if not the impetus for the change the initial determining influence had been so small a thing as the fact and manner of his having been approached by the officer that agent had by the style of his accost restored the loiterer to his former place in society in an instant he had been transformed from a somewhat rancid prowler along the fishy side streets of gentility into an honest gentleman with whom even so lordly a guardian of the peace might agreeably exchange the compliments this then first broke the spell and set thrilling in him a resurrected longing for the fellowship of his kind and the rewards of the virtuous to what end he vehemently asked himself was this fanciful self accusation this empty renunciation this moral squeamishness through which he had been led to abandon what was his heritage in life and not beyond his deserts technically he was uncondemned his sole guilty spot was in thought rather than deed and cognizance of it unshared by others for what good moral or sentimental did he slink retreating like the hedgehog from his own shadow to and fro in this musty bohemia that lacked even the picturesque but the thing that struck home and set him raging was the part played by the amazonian prisoner to the counterpart of that astounding belligerent identical at least in the way of experience to one by her own confession thus far fallen had he not three hours since been united in marriage how desirable and natural it had seemed to him then and how monstrous it seemed now how the words of diamond thief number two yet burned in his ears if you ever get a cirl she ll have a picnic what did that that this women instinc tively knew him for one they could hoodwink still again there reverberated the policeman s sapient contribution to his agony a man these days and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to oh yes he had been a fool he had looked at things from the wrong standpoint but the wildest note in all the clamour was struck by pain s forefinger jealousy now at least he felt that keenest sting a mounting love unworthily bestowed whatever she might be he loved her he bore in his own breast his doom a grating comic flavour to his pre dicament struck him suddenly and he laughed creakingly as he swung down the echoing pavement an impetuous desire to act to battle with his fate seized him he stopped upon his heel and smote his palms together triumphantly his wife was where but there was a tangible link an outlet more or less navigable through which his derelict ship of matrimony might yet be safely towed the priest like all imaginative men with pliable natures lorison was when thoroughly stirred apt to become tempest uous with a high and stubborn indignation upon him be retraced his steps to the intersecting street by which he had come down this he hurried to the corner where he had parted with an astringent grimace tinctured the thought his wife thence still back he harked follow ing through an unfamiliar district his stimulated recollec tions of the way they had come from that preposterous wedding many times he went abroad and nosed his way back to the trail furious at last when he reached the dark calamitous building in which his madness had culminated and found the black hallway he dashed down

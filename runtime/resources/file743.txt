stock provided he can borrow the dollar that man added his deadly work to the tourist s innocent praise and okochee fell the cooloosa river winds through a range of small mountains passes okochee and then blends its waters trippingly as fall the mellifluous indian syllables with the chattahoochee okochee rose as it were from its sunny seat on the post office stoop hitched up its suspender and threw a granite dam two hundred and forty feet long and sixty feet high across the cooloosa one mile above the town thereupon a dimpling sparkling lake backed up twenty miles among the little mountains thus in the great game of municipal rivalry did okochee match that famous drawing card the hudson it was conceded that nowhere could the palisades be judged superior in the way of scenery and grandeur following the picture card was played the ace of commercial importance fourteen thousand horsepower would this dam furnish cotton mills factories and manufacturing plants would rise up as the green corn after a shower the spindle and the flywheel and turbine would sing the shrewd glory of okochee along the picturesque heights above the lake would rise in beauty the costly villas and the splendid summer residences of capital the naphtha launch of the millionaire would spit among the romantic coves the verdured hills would take formal shapes of terrace lawn and park money would be spent like water in okochee and water would be turned into money the fate of the good town is quickly told capital decided not to invest of all the great things promised the scenery alone came to fulfilment the wooded peaks the impressive promontories of solemn granite the beautiful green slants of bank and ravine did all they could to reconcile okochee to the delinquency of miserly gold the sunsets gilded the dreamy draws and coves with a minting that should charm away heart burning okochee true to the instinct of its blood and clime was lulled by the spell it climbed out of the arena loosed its suspender sat down again on the post office stoop and took a chew it consoled itself by drawling sarcasms at the city council which was not to blame causing the fathers as has been said to seek back streets and figure perspiringly on the sinking fund and the appropriation for interest due the youth of okochee they who were to carry into the rosy future the burden of the debt accepted failure with youth s uncalculating joy for here was sport aquatic and nautical added to the meagre round of life s pleasures in yachting caps and flowing neckties they pervaded the lake to its limits girls wore silk waists embroidered with anchors in blue and pink the trousers of the young men widened at the bottom and their hands were proudly calloused by the oft plied oar fishermen were under the spell of a deep and tolerant jjoy sailboats and rowboats furrowed the lenient waves popcorn and ice cream booths sprang up about the little wooden pier two small excursion steamboats were built and plied the delectable waters okochee philosophically gave up the hope of eating turtle soup with a gold spoon and settled back not ill content to its regular diet of lotus and fried hominy and out of this slow wreck of great expectations rose up j pinkney bloom with his wad and his prosperous cheery smile needless to say j pinkney was no product of georgia soil he came out of that flushed and capable region known as the north he called himself a promoter his enemies had spoken of him as a grafter okochee took a middle course and held him to be no better nor no worse than a yank far up the lake eighteen miles above the town the eye of this cheerful camp follower of booms had spied out a graft he purchased there a precipitous tract of five hundred acres at forty five cents per acre and this he laid out and subdivided as the city of skyland the queen city of the switzerland of the south streets and avenues were surveyed parks designed corners of central squares reserved for the proposed opera house board of trade lyceum market public schools and exposition hall the price of lots ranged from five to five hundred dollars positively no lot would be priced higher than five hundred dollars while the boom was growing in okochee j pinkney s circulars maps and prospectuses were flying through the mails to every part of the country investors sent in their money by post and the skyland real estate company j pinkney bloom returned to each a deed duly placed on record to the best lot at the price on hand that day all this time the catamount screeched upon the reserved lot of the skyland board of trade the opossum swung by his tail over the site of the exposition hall and the owl hooted a melancholy recitative to his audience of young squirrels in opera house square later when the money was coming in fast j pinkney caused to be erected in the coming city half a dozen cheap box houses and persuaded a contingent of indigent natives to occupy them thereby assuming the role of poulation in subsequent prospectuses which became accordingly more seductive and remunerative so when the dream faded and okochee dropped back to digging bait and nursing its two and a half per cent tax j pinkney bloom unloving of checks and drafts and the cold interrogatories of bankers strapped about his fifty two inch waist a soft leather belt containing eight thousand dollars in big bills and said that all was very good one last trip he was making to skyland before departing to other salad fields skyland was a regular post office and the steamboat dixie belle under contract delivered the mail bag generally empty twice a week there was a little business there to be settled

cabbages and kings the proem by the carpenter they will tell you in anchuria that president miraflores of that volatile republic died by his own hand in the coast town of coralio that he had reached thus far in flight from the inconveniences of an imminent revolution and that one hundred thousand dollars government funds which he carried with him in an american leather valise as a souvenir of his tempestuous administration was never afterward recovered for a real a boy will show you his grave it is back of the town near a little bridge that spans a mangrove swamp a plain slab of wood stands at its head some one has burned upon the headstone with a hot iron this inscription ramon angel de las cruzes y miraflores presidente de la republica de anchuria que sea su juez dios it is characteristic of this buoyant people that they pursue no man beyond the grave let god be his judge even with the hundred thousand unfound though they greatly coveted the hue and cry went no further than that to the stranger or the guest the people of coralio will relate the story of the tragic end of their former president how he strove to escape from the country with the publice funds and also with dona isabel guilbert the young american opera singer and how being apprehended by members of the opposing political party in coralio he shot himself through the head rather than give up the funds and in consequence the senorita guilbert they will relate further that dona isabel her adventurous bark of fortune shoaled by the simultaneous loss of her distinguished admirer and the souvenir hundred thousand dropped anchor on this stagnant coast awaiting a rising tide they say in coralio that she found a prompt and prosperous tide in the form of frank goodwin an american resident of the town an investor who had grown wealthy by dealing in the products of the country a banana king a rubber prince a sarsaparilla indigo and mahogany baron the senorita guilbert you will be told married senor goodwin one month after the president s death thus in the very moment when fortune had ceased to smile wresting from her a gift greater than the prize withdrawn of the american don frank goodwin and of his wife the natives have nothing but good to say don frank has lived among them for years and has compelled their respect his lady is easily queen of what social life the sober coast affords the wife of the governor of the district herself who was of the proud castilian family of monteleon y dolorosa de los santos y mendez feels honored to unfold her napkin with olive hued ringed hands at the table of senora goodwin were you to refer with your northern prejudices to the vivacious past of mrs goodwin when her audacious and gleeful abandon in light opera captured the mature president s fancy or to her share in that statesman s downfall and malfeasance the latin shrug of the shoulder would be your only answer and rebuttal what prejudices there were in coralio concerning senora goodwin seemed now to be in her favor whatever they had been in the past it would seem that the story is ended instead of begun that the close of tragedy and the climax of a romance have covered the ground of interest but to the more curious reader it shall be some slight instruction to trace the close threads that underlie the ingenious web of circumstances the headpiece bearing the name of president miraflores is daily scrubbed with soap bark and sand an old half breed indian tends the grave with fidelity and the dawdling minuteness of inherited sloth he chops down the weeds and ever springing grass with his machete he plucks ants and scorpions and beetles from it with his horny fingers and sprinkles its turf with water from the plaza fountain there is no grave anywhere so well kept and ordered only by following out the underlying threads will it be made clear why the old indian galves is secretly paid to keep green the grave of president miraflores by one who never saw that unfortunate statesman in life or in death and why that one was wont to walk in the twilight casting from a distance looks of gentle sadness upon that unhonored mound elsewhere than at coralio one learns of the impetuous career of isabel guilbert new orleans gave her birth and the mingled french and spanish creole nature that tinctured her life with such turbulence and warmth she had little education but a knowledge of men and motives that seemed to have come by instinct far beyond the common woman was she endowed with intrepid rashness with a love for the pursuit of adventure to the brink of danger and with desire for the pleasures of life her spirit was one to chafe under any curb she was eve after the fall but before the bitterness of it was felt she wore life as a rose in her bosom of the legion of men who had been at her feet it was said that but one was so fortunate as to engage her fancy to president miraflores the brilliant but unstable ruler of anchuria she yielded the key to her resolute heart how then do we find her as the coralians would have told you the wife of frank goodwin and happily living a life of dull and dreamy inaction the underlying threads reach far stretching across the sea following them out it will be made plain why shorty o day of the columbia detective agency resigned his position and for a lighter pastime it shall be a duty and a pleasing sport to wander with momus beneath the tropic stars where melpomene once stalked austere now to cause laughter to echo from those lavish jungles and frowing crags where formerly rang the cries of pirate s victims to lay aside pike and cutlass and attack with quip and jollity to draw one saving titter of mirth from the rusty casque of romance this were pleasant to do in the shade of the lemon trees on that coast that is curved like lips set for smiling for there are yet tales of the spanish main that segment of continent washed by the tempestuous caribbean and presenting to the sea a formidable border of tropicle jungle topped by the overweening cordilleras is still begirt by mystery and romance in past times buccaneers and revolutionists roused the echoes of its cliffs and the condor wheeled perpetually above where in the green groves they made food for him with their matchlocks and toledos taken and retaken by sea rovers by adverse powers and by sudden uprising of rebellious factions the historic miles of adventurous coast has scarcely known for hundreds of years whom rightly to call its master pizarro balboa sir francis drake and bolivar did what they could to make it a part of christendom sir john morgan lafitte and other eminent swashbucklers bombarded and pounded it in the name of abaddon the game still goes on the guns of the rovers are silenced but the tintype man the enlarged photograph brigand the kodaking tourist and the scouts of the gentle brigade of fakirs have found it out and carry on the work the hucksters of germany france and sicily now bag in small change across their counters gentlemen adventurers throng the waiting rooms of its rulers with proposals for railways and concessions the little opera bouffe nations play at government and intrigue until some day a big silent gunboat glides into the offing and warns them not to break their toys and with these changes comes also the small adventurer with empty pockets to fill light of heart busy brained the modern fairy prince bearing an alarm clock with which more surely than by the sentimental kiss to awaken the beautiful tropics from their centuries sleep generally he wears a shamrock which he matches pridefully against the extravagant palms and it is he who had driven melpomene to the wings and set comedy to dancing before the footlights of the southern cross so there is a little tale to tell of many things perhaps to the promiscuous ear of the walrus it shall come with most avail for in it there are indeed shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbage palms and presidents instead of kings add to these a little love and counterplotting and scatter everywhere throughout the maze a trail of tropical dollars dollars warmed no more by the torrid sun than by the hot palms of the scouts of fortune and after all here seems to be life itself with talk enough to weary the most garrulous of walruses i fox in the morning coralio reclined in the mid day heat like some vacuous beauty lounging in a guarded harem the town lay at the sea s edge on a strip of alluvial coast it was set like a little pearl in an emerald band behind it and seeming almost to topple imminent above it rose the sea following range of the cordilleras in front the sea was spread a smiling jailer but even more incorruptible than the frowning mountains the waves swished along the smooth beach the parrots screamed in the orange and ceiba trees the palms waved their limber fronds foolishly like an awkward chorus at the prima donna s cue to enter suddenly the town was full of excitement a native boy dashed down a grass grown street shrieking busca el senor goodwin ha venido un telegrafo por el the word passed quickly telegrams do not come to any one in coralio the cry for senor goodwin was taken up by a dozen officious voices the main street running parallel to the beach became populated with those who desired to expedite the delivery of the dispatch knots of women with complexions varying from palest olive to deepest brown gathered at street corners and plaintively carolled un telegrafo por senor goodwin the comandante don senor el coronel encarnacion rios who was loyal to the ins and suspected goodwin s devotion to the outs hissed aha and wrote in his secret memorandum book the accusive fact that senor goodwin had on that momentous date received a telegram in the midst of the hullabaloo a man stepped to the door of a small wooden building and looked out above the door was a sign that read keogh and clancy a nomenclature that seemed not to be indigenous to that tropical soil the man in the door was billy keogh scout of fortune and progress and latter day rover of the spanish main tintypes and photographs were the weapons with which keogh and clancy were at that time assailing the hopeless shores outside the shop were set two large frames filled with specimens fo their art and skill keogh leaned in the doorway his bold and humorous countenance wearing a look of interest at the unusual influx of life and sound in the street when the meaning of the disturbance became clear to him he placed a hand beside his mouth and shouted hey frank in such a robustious voice that the feeble clamor of the natives was drowned and silenced fifty yards away on the seaward side of the street stood the abode of the consul for the united states out from the door of this building tumbled goodwin at the call he had been smoking with willard geddie the consul on the back porch of the consulate which was conceded to be the coolest spot in coralio hurry up shouted keogh there s a riot in town on account of a telegram that s come for you you want to be careful about these things my boy it won t do to trifle with the feelings of the public this way you ll be getting a pink note some day with violet scent on it and then the country ll be steeped in the throes of a revolution goodwin had strolled up the street and met the boy with the message the ox eyed women gazed at him with shy admiration for his type drew them he was big blond and jauntily dressed in white linen with buckskin zapatos his manner was courtly with a merciful eye when the telegram had been delivered and the bearer of it dismissed with a gratuity the relieved populace returned to the contiguities of shade from which curiosity had drawn it the women to their baking in the mud ovens under the orange trees or to the interminable combing of their long straight hair the men to their cigarettes and gossip in the cantinas goodwin sat on keogh s doorstep and read his telegram it was from bob englehart an american who lived in san mateo the capital city of anchuria eighty miles in the interior englehart was a gold miner an ardent revolutionist and good people that he was a man of resource and imagination was proven by the telegram he had sent it had had been his task to send a confidential message to his friend in coralio this could not have been accomplished in either spanish or english for the eye politic in anchuria was an active one but englehart was a diplomatist there existed but one code upon which he might make requisition with promise of safety the great and potent code of slang so here is the message that slipped unconstrued through the fingers of curious officials and came to the eye of goodwin his nibs skedaddled yesterday per jack rabbit line with all the coin in the kitty and the bundle of muslin he s spoony about the boodle is six figures short our crowd in good shape but we need the spondulicks you collar it the main guy and the dry goods are headed for the briny you to know what to do bob this screed remarkable as it was had no mystery for goodwin he was the most successful of the small advance guard of speculative americans that had invaded anchuria and he had not reached that enviable pinnacle without having well exercised the arts of foresight and deduction he had taken up political intrigue as a matter of business he was acute enough to wield a certain influence among the leading schemers and he was prosperous enough to be able to purchase the respect of the petty officeholders there was always a revolutionary party and to it he had allied himself for the adherents of a new administration received the rewards of their labors there was now a liberal party seeking to overturn president miraflores if the wheel successfully revolved goodwin stood to win a concession to manzanas of the finest coffee lands in the interior certain incidents in the recent career of president miraflores had excited a shrewd suspicion in goodwin s mind that the government was near a dissolution from another cause than that of a revolution and now englehart s telegram had come as a corroboration of his wisdom the telegram which had remained unintelligible to the anchurian linguists who had applied to it in vain their knowledge of spanish and elemental english conveyed a stimulating piece of news to goodwin s understanding it informed him that the president of the republic had decamped from the capital city with the contents of the treasury furthermore that he was accompanied in his flight by that winning adventuress isabel guilbert the opera singer whose troupe of performers had been entertained by the president at san mateo during the past month on a scale less modest than that with which royal visitors are often content the reference to the jackrabbit line could mean nothing else than the mule back system of transport that prevailed between coralio and the capital the hint that the boodle was six figures short made the condition of the national treasury lamentably clear also it was convincingly true that the ingoing party its way now made a pacific one would need the spondulicks unless its pledges should be fulfilled and the spoils held for the delectation of the victors precarious indeed would be the position of the new government therefore it was exceeding necessary to collar the main guy and recapture the sinews of war and government goodwin handed the message to keogh read that billy he said it s from bob englehart can you manage the cipher keogh sat in the other half of the doorway and carefully perused the telegram tis not a cipher he said finally tis what they call literature and that s a system of language put in the mouths of people that they ve never been introduced to by writers of imagination the magazines invented it but i never knew before that president norvin green had stamped it with the seal of his approval tis now no longer literature but language the dictionaries tried but they couldn t make it go for anything but dialect sure now that the western union indorses it it won t be long till a race of people will spring up that speaks it you re running too much to philology billy said goodwin do you make out the meaning of it sure replied the philosopher of fortune all languages come easy to the man who must know em i ve even failed to misunderstand an order to evacuate in classical chinese when it was backed up by the muzzle of a breech loader this little literary essay i hold in my hands means a game of fox in the morning ever play that frank when you was a kid i think so said goodwin laughing you join hands all round and you do not interrupted keogh you ve got a fine sporting game mixed up in your head with all around the rosebush the spirit of fox in the morning is opposed to the holding of hands i ll tell you how it s played this president man and his companion in play they stand up over in san mateo ready for the run and shout fox in the morning me and you standing here we say goose and gander they say how many miles is it to london town we say only a few if your legs are long enough how many comes out they say more than you re able to catch and then the game commences i catch the idea said goodwin it won t do to let the goose and gander slip through your fingers billy their feathers are too valuable our crowd is prepared and able to step into the shoes of the government at once but with the treasury empty we d stay in power about as long as a tenderfoot would stick on an untamed bronco we must play the fox on every foot of the coast to prevent their getting out of the country by the mule back schedule said keogh it s five days down from san mateo we ve got plenty of time to set our outposts there s only three places on the coast where they can hope to sail from here and solitas and alazan they re the only points we ll have to guard it s as easy as a chess problem fox to play and mate in three moves oh goosey goosey gander whither do you wander by the blessing of the literary telegraph the boodle of this benighted fatherland shall be preserved to the honest political party that is seeking to overthrow it the situation had been justly outlined by keogh the down trail from the capital was at all times a weary road to travel a jiggety joggety journey it was ice cold and hot wet and dry the trail climbed appalling mountains wound like a rotten string about the brows of breathless precipices plunged through chilling snow fed streams and wriggled like a snake through sunless forests teeming with menacing insect and animal life after descending to the foothills it turned to a trident the central prong ending at alazan another branched off to coralio the third penetrated to solitas between the sea and the foothills stretched the five miles breadth of alluvial coast here was the flora ofthe tropics in its rankest and most prodigal growth spaces here and there had been wrested from the jungle and planted with bananas and cane and orange groves the rest was a riot of wild vegetation the home of monkeys tapirs jaguars alligators and prodigious reptiles and insects where no road was cut a serpent could scarcely make its way through the tangle of vines and creepers across the treacherous mangrove swamps few things without wings could safely pass therefore the fugitives could hope to reach the coast only by one of the routes named keep the matter quiet billy advised goodwin we don t want the ins to know that the president is in flight i suppose bob s information is something of a scoop in the capital as yet otherwise he would not have tried to make his message a confidential one and besides everybody would have heard the news i m going around now to see dr zavalla and start a man up the trail to cut the telegraph wire as goodwin rose keogh threw his hat upon the grass by the door and expelled a tremendous sigh what s the trouble billy asked goodwin pausing that s the first time i heard you sigh tis the last said keogh with that sorrowful puff of wind i resign myself to a life of praiseworthy but harassing honesty what are tintypes if you please to the opportunities of the great and hilarious class of ganders and geese not that i would be a president frank and the boodle he s got is too big for me to handle but in some ways i feel my conscience hurting me for addicting myself to photographing a nation instead of running away with it frank did you ever see the bundle of muslin that his excellency has wrapped up and carried off isabel guilbert said goodwin laughing no i never did from what i ve heard of her though i imagine that she wouldn t stick at anything to carry her point don t get romantic billy sometimes i begin to fear that there s irish blood in your ancestry i never saw her either went on keogh but they say she s got all the ladies of mythology sculpture and fiction reduced to chromos they say she can look at a man once and he ll turn monkey and climb trees to pick coconuts for her think of that president man with lord know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars in one hand and this muslin siren in the other galloping down the hill on a sympathetic mule amid songbirds and flowers and here is billy keogh because he is virtuous condemned to the unprofitable swindle of slandering the faces of missing links on tin for an honest living tis an injustice of nature cheer up said goodwin you are a pretty poor fox to be envying a gander maybe the enchanting guilbert will take a fancy to you and your tintypes after we impoverish her royal escort she could do worse reflected keogh but she won t tis not a tintype gallery but a gallery of the gods that she s fitted to adorn she s a very wicked lady and the president man is in luck but i hear clancy swearing in the back room for having to do all the work and keogh plunged for the rear of the gallery whistling gaily in a spontaneous way that belied his recent sigh over the questionable good luck of the flying president goodwin turned from the main street into a much narrower one that intersected it at a right angle these side streets were covered by a growth of thick rank grass which was kept to a navigable shortness by the machetes of the police stone sidewalks little more than a ledge in width ran along the base of the mean and monotonous adobe houses at the outskirts of the village these streets dwindled to nothing and here were set the palm thatched huts of the caribs and the poorer natives and the shabby cabins of negroes from jamaica and the west india islands a few structures raised their heads above the red tiled roofs of the one story houses the bell tower of the calaboza the hotel de los extranjeros the residence of the vesuvius fruit company s agent the store and residence of bernard brannigan a ruined cathedral in which columbus had once set foot and most imposing of all the casa morena the summer white house of the president of anchuria on the principal street running along the beach the broadway of coralio were the larger stores the government bodega and post office the cuartel the rum shops and the market place on his way goodwin passed the house of bernard brannigan it was a modern wooden building two stories in height the ground floor was occupied by brannigan s store the upper one contained the living apartments a wide cool porch ran around the house half way up its outer walls a handsome vivacious girl neatly dressed in flowing white leaned over the railing and smiled down upon goodwin she was no darker than many an andalusian of high descent and she sparkled and glowed like a tropical moonlight good evening miss paula said goodwin taking off his hat with his ready smile there was little difference in his manner whether he addressed women or men everybody in coralio liked to receive the salutation of the big american is there any news mr goodwin please don t say no isn t it warm i feel just like mariana in her moated grange or was it a range it s hot enough no there s no news to tell i believe said goodwin with a mischievous look in his eye except that old geddie is getting grumpier and crosser every day if something doesn t happen to relieve his mind i ll have to quit smoking on his back porch and there s no other place available that is cool enough he isn t grumpy said paula brannigan impulsively when he but she ceased suddenly and drew back with a deepening color for her mother had been a mestizo lady and the spanish blood had brought to paula a certain shyness that was an adornment to the other half of her demonstrative nature ii the lotus and the bottle willard greddie consul for the united states in coralio was working leisurely on his yearly report goodwin who had strolled in as he did daily for a smoke on the much coveted porch had found him so absorbed in his work that he departed after roundly abusing the consul for his lack of hospitality i shall complain to the civil service department said goodwin or is it a department perhaps it s only a theory one gets neither civility nor service from you you won t talk and you won t set out anything to drink what kind of a way is that of representing your government goodwin strolled out and across to the hotel to see if he could bully the quarantine doctor into a game on coralio s solitary billiard table his plans were completed for the interception of the fugitives from the capital and now it was but a waiting game that he had to play the consul was interested in his report he was only twenty four and he had not been in coralio long enough for his enthusiasm to cool in the heat of the tropics a paradox that may be allowed between cancer and capricorn so many thousand bunches of bananas so mnay thousand oranges and coconuts so many ounces of gold dust pounds of rubber coffee indigo and sarparilla actually exports were twenty per cent greater than for the previous year a little thrill of satisfaction ran through the consul perhaps he thought the state department upon reading his introduction would notice and then he leaned back in his chair and laughed he was getting as bad as the others for the moment he had forgotten that coralio was an insignificant republic lying along the by ways of a second rate sea he thought of gregg the quarantine doctor who subscribed for the london lancet expecting to find it quoting his reports to the home board of health concerning the yellow fever germ the consul knew that not one in fifty of his acquaintances in the states had ever heard of coralio he knew that two men at any rate would have to read his report some underling in the state department and a compositor in the public printing office perhaps the typesticker would note the increase of commerce in coralio and speak of it over the cheese and beer to a friend he had just written most unaccountable is the supineness of the large exporters in the united states in permitting the french and german houses to practically control the trade interests of this rich and productive country when he heard the hoarse notes of a steamer s siren geddie laid down his pen and gathered his panama hat and umbrella by the sound he knew it to be the valhalla one of the line of fruit vessels plying for the vesuvius company down to ninos of five years every one in coralio could name you each incoming steamer by the note of her siren the consul sauntered by a roundabout shaded way to the beach by reason of long practice he gauged his stroll so accurately that by the time he arrived on the sandy shore the boat of the customs officials was rowing back from the steamer which had been boarded and inspected according to the laws of anchuria there is no harbor at coralio vessels of the draught of the valhalla must ride at anchor a mile from shore when they take on fruit it is conveyed on lighters and freighter sloops at solitas where there was a fine harbor ships of many kinds were to be seen but in the roadstead off coralio scarcely any save the fruiters paused now and then a tramp coaster or a mysterious brig from spain and then a tramp coaster or a mysterious brig from spain or a saucy french barque would hang innocently for a few days in the offing then the custom house crew would become doubly vigilant and wary at night a sloop or two would be making strange trips in and out along the shore and in the morning the stock of three star hennessey wines and drygoods in coralio would be found vastly increased it has also been said that the customs officials jingled more silver in the pockets of their red striped trousers and that the record books showed no increase in import duties received the custom s boat and the valhalla gig reached the shore at the same time when they grounded in the shallow water there was still five yards of rolling surf between them and dry sand then half clothed caribs dashed into the water and brought in on their backs the valhalla s purser and the little native officials in their cotton undershirts blue trousers with red stripes and flapping straw hats at college geddie had been a treasure as a first baseman he now closed his umbrella stuck it upright in the sand and stooped with his hands resting upon his knees the purser burlesquing the pitcher s contortions hurled at the consul the heavy roll of newspapers tied with a string that the steamer always brought for him geddie leaped high and caught the roll with a sounding thwack the loungers on the beach about a third of the population of the town laughed and applauded delightedly every week they expected to see that roll of papers delivered and received in that same manner and they were never disappointed innovations did not flourish in coralio the consul re hoisted his umbrella and walked back to the consulate this home of a great nation s representative was a wooden structure of two rooms with a native built gallery of poles bamboo and nipa palm running on three sides of it one room was the official apartment furnished chastely with a flat top desk a hammock and three uncomfortable cane seated chairs engravings of the first and latest president of the country represented hung against the wall the other room was the consul s living apartment it was eleven o clock when he returned from the beach and therefore breakfast time chanca the carib woman who cooked for him was just serving the meal on the side of the gallery facing the sea a spot famous as the coolest in coralio the breakfast consisted of shark s fin soup stew of land crabs breadfruit a boiled iguana steak aquacates a freshly cut pineapple claret and coffee geddie took his seat and unrolled with luxurious laziness his bundle of newspapers here in coralio for two days or longer he would read the goings on in the world very much as we of the world read those whimsical contributions to inexact science that assume to portray the doings of the martians after he had finished with the papers they would be sent on the rounds of the other english speaking residents of the town the paper that came first to his hand was one of those bulky mattresses of printed stuff upon which the readers of certain new york journals are supposed to take their sabbath literary nap opening this the consul rested it upon the table supporting its weight with the aid of the back of a chair then he partook of his meal deliberately turning the leaves from time to time and glancing half idly at the contents presently he was struck by something familiar to him in a picture a half page badly printed reproduction of a photograph of a vessel languidly interested he leaned for a nearer scrutiny and a view of the florid headlines of the column next to the picture yes he was not mistaken the engraving was of the eight hundred ton yacht idalia belonging to that prince of good fellows midas of the money market and society s pink of perfection j ward tolliver slowly sipping his black coffee geddie read the column of print following a listed statement of mr tolliver s real estate and bonds came a description of the yacht s furnishings and then the grain of news no bigger than a mustard seed mr tolliver with a party of favored guests would sail the next day on a six weeks cruise along the central american and south american coasts and among the bahama islands among the guests were mrs cumberland payne and miss ida payne of norfolk the writer with the fatuous presumption that was demanded of him by his readers had concocted a romance suited to their palates he bracketed the names of miss payne and mr tolliver until he had well nigh read the marriage ceremony over them he played coyly and insinuatingly upon the strings of on dit and madame rumor and a little bird and no one would be surprised and ended with congratulations geddie having finished his breakfast took his papers to the edge of the gallery and sat there in his favorite steamer chair with his feet on the bamboo railing he lighted a cigar and looked out upon the sea he felt a glow of satisfaction at finding he was so little disturbed by what he had read he told himself that he had conquered the distress that had sent him a voluntary exile to this far land of the lotus he could never forget ida of course but there was no longer any pain in thinking about her when they had had that misunderstanding and quarrel he had impulsively sought this consulship with the desire to retaliate upon her by detaching himself from her world and presence he had succeeded thoroughly in that during the twelve months of his life in coralio no word had passed between them though he had sometimes heard of her through the dilatory correspondence with the few friends to whom he still wrote still he could not repress a little thrill of satisfaction at knowing that she had not yet married tolliver or any one else but evidently tolliver had not yet abandoned hope well it made no difference to him now he had eaten of the lotus he was happy and content in this land of perpetual afternoon those old days of life in the states seemed like an irritating dream he hoped ida would be as happy as he was the climate as balmy as that of distant avalon the fetterless idyllic round of enchanted days the life among this indolent romantic people a life full of music flowers and low laughter the influence of the imminent sea and mountains and the many shapes of love and magic and beauty that bloomed in the white tropic nights with all he was more than content also there was paula brannigan geddie intended to marry paula if of course she would consent but he felt rather sure that she would do that somehow he kept postponing his proposal several times he had been quite near to it but a mysterious something always held him back perhaps it was only the unconscious instinctive conviction that the act would sever the last tie that bound him to his old world he could be very happy with paula few of the native girls could be compared with her she had attended a convent school in new orleans for two years and when she chose to display her accomplishments no one could detect any difference between her and the girls of norfolk and manhattan but it was delicious to see her at home dressed as she sometimes was in the native costume with bare shoulders and flowing sleeves bernard brannigan was the great merchant of coralio besides his store he maintained a train of pack mules and carried on a lively trade with the interior towns and villages he had married a native lady of high castilian descent but with a tinge of indian brown showing through her olive cheek the union of the irish and the spanish had produced as it so often has an offshoot of rare beauty and variety they were very excellent people indeed and the upper story of the house was ready to be placed at the service of geddie and paula as soon as he should make up his mind to speak about it by the time two hours were whiled away the consul tired of reading the papers lay scattered about him on the gallery reclining there he gazed dreamily out upon an eden a clump of banana plants interposed their broad shields between him and the sun the gentle slope from the consulate to the sea was covered with the dark green foliage of lemon trees and orange trees just bursting into bloom a lagoon pierced the land like a dark jagged crystal and above it a pale ceiba tree rose almost to the clouds the waving coconut palms on the beach flared their decorative green leaves against the slate of an almost quiescent sea his senses were cognizant of brilliant scarlet and ochres and the vert of the coppice of odors of fruit and bloom and the smoke from chanca s clay oven under the calabash tree of the treble laughter of the native women in their huts the song of the robin the salt taste of the breeze the diminuendo of the faint surf running along the shore and gradually of a white speck growing to a blur that intruded itself upon the drab prospect of the sea lazily interested he watched this blur increase until it became the idalia steaming at full speed coming down the coast without changing his position he kept his eyes upon the beautiful white yacht as she drew swiftly near and came opposite to coralio then sitting upright he saw her float steadily past and on he had seen the frequent splash of her polished brass work and the stripes of her deck awnings so much and no more like a ship on a magic lantern slide the idalia had crossed the illuminated circle of the consul s little world and was gone save for the tiny cloud of smoke that was left hanging over the brim of the sea she might have been an immaterial thing a chimera of his idle brain geddie went into his office and sat down to dawdle over his report if the reading of the article in the paper had left him unshaken this silent passing of the idalia had done for him still more it had brought the calm and peace of a situation from which all uncertainty had been erased he knew that men sometimes hope without being aware of it now since she had come two thousand miles and had passed without a sign not even his unconscious self need cling to the past any longer after dinner when the sun was low behind the mountains geddie walked on the little strip of beach under the coconuts the wind was blowing mildly landward and the surface of the sea was rippled by tiny wavelets a miniature breaker spreading with a soft swish upon the sand brought with its something round and shiny that rolled back again as the wave receded the next influx beached it clear and geddie picked it up the thing was a long necked wine bottle of colorless glass the cork had been driven in tightly to the level of the mouth and the end covered with dark red sealing wax the bottle contained only what seemed to be a sheet of paper much curled from the manipulation it had undergone while being inserted in the sealing wax was the impression of a seal probably of a signet ring bearing the initials of a monogram but the impression had been hastily made and the letters were past anything more certain than a shrewd conjecture ida payne had always worn a signet ring in preference to any other finger decoration geddie thought he could make out the familiar i p and a queer sensation of disquietude went over him more personal and intimate was this reminder of her than had been the sight of the vessel she was doubtless on he walked back to his house and set the bottle on his desk throwing off his hat and coat and lighting a lamp for the night had crowded precipitately upon the brief twilight he began to examine his piece of sea salvage by holding the bottle near the light and turning it judiciously he made out that it contained a double sheet of note paper filled with close writing further that the paper was of the same size and shade as that always used by ida and that to the best of his belief the handwriting was hers the imperfect glass of the bottle so distorted the rays of light that he could read no word of the writing but certain capital letters of which he caught comprehensive glimpses were ida s he felt sure there was a little smile both of perplexity and amusement in geddie s eyes as he set the bottle down and laid three cigars side by side on his desk he fetched his steamer chair from the gallery and stretched himself comfortably he would smoke those three cigars while considering the problem for it amounted to a problem he almost wished that he had not found the bottle but the bottle was there why should it have drifted in from the sea whence come so many disquieting things to disturb his peace in this dreamy land where time seemed so redundant he had fallen into the habit of bestowing much thought upon even trifling matters he bagan to speculate upon many fanciful theories concerning the story of the bottle rejecting each in turn ships in danger of wreck or disablement sometimes cast forth such precarious messengers calling for aid but he had seen the idalia not three hours before safe and speeding suppose the crew had mutinied and imprisoned the passengers below and the message was one begging for succor but premising such an improbable outrage would the agitated captives have taken the pains to fill four pages of note paper with carefully penned arguments to their rescue thus by elimination he soon rid the matter of the more unlikely theories and was reduced though aversely to the less assailable ones that the bottle contained a message to himself ida knew he was in coralio she must have launched the bottle while the yacht was passing and the wind blowing fairly toward the shore as soon as geddie reached this conclusion a wrinkle came between his brows and a stubborn look settled around his mouth he sat looking out through the doorway at the gigantic fire flies traversing the quiet streets if this was a message to him from ida what could it mean save an overture at reconciliation and if that why had she not used the same methods of the post instead of this uncertain and even flippant means of communication a note in an empty bottle cast into the sea there was something light and frivolous about it if not actually contemptuous the thought stirred his pride and subdued whatever emotions had been resurrected by the finding of the bottle geddie put on his coat and hat and walked out he followed a street that led him along the border of the little plaza where a band was playing and people were rambling care free and indolent some timorous senoritas scurrying past with fire flies tangled in the jetty braids of their hair glanced at him with shy flattering eyes the air was languorous with the scent of jasmin and orange blossoms the consul stayed his steps at the house of bernard brannigan paula was swinging in a hammock on the gallery she rose from it like a bird from its nest the color came to her cheeck at the sound of geddie s voice he was charmed at the sight of her costume a flounced muslin dress with a little jacket of white flannel all made with neatness and style he suggested a stroll and they walked out to the old indian well on the hill road they sat on the curb and there geddie made the expected but long deferred speech certain though he had been that she would not say him nay he was still thrilled at the completeness and sweetness of her surrender here was surely a heart made for love and steadfastness here was no caprice or questionings or captious standards of convention when geddie kissed paula at her door that night he was happier than he had ever been before here in this hollow lotus land ever to live and lie reclined seemed to him as it has seemed to many mariners the best as well as the easiest his future would be an ideal one he had attained a paradise without a serpent his eve would be indeed a part of him unbeguiled and therefore more beguiling he had made his decision tonight and his heart was full of serene assured content geddie went back to his house whistling that finest and saddest love song la golondrina at the door his tame monkey leaped down from his shelf chattering briskly the consul turned to his desk to get him some nuts he usually kept there reaching in the half darkness his hand struck against the bottle he started as if he had touched the cold rotundity of a serpent he had forgotten that the bottle was there he lighted the lamp and fed the monkey then very deliberately he lighted a cigar and took the bottle in his hand and walked down the path to the beach there was a moon and the sea was glorious the breeze had shifted as it did each evening and was now rushing steadily seaward stepping to the water s edge geddie hurled the unopened bottle far out into the sea it disappeared for a moment and then shot upward twice its length geddie stood still watching it the moonlight was so bright that he could see it bobbing up and down with the little waves slowly it receded from the shore flashing and turning as it went the wind was carrying it out to sea soon it became a mere speck doubtfully discerned at irregular intervals and then the mystery of it was swallowed up by the greater mystery of the ocean geddie stood still upon the beach smoking and looking out upon the water simon oh simon wake up there simon bawled a sonorous voice at the edge of the water old simon cruz was a half breed fisherman and smuggler who lived in a hut on the beach out of his earliest nap simon was thus awakened he slipped on his shoes and went outside just landing from one of the valhalla s boats was the third mate of that vessel who was an acquaintance of simon s and three sailors from the fruiter go up simon called the mate and find doctor gregg or mr goodwin or anybody that s a friend to mr geddie and bring em here at once saints of the skies said simon sleepily nothing has happened to mr geddie he s under that tarpauling said the mate pointing to the boat and he s rather more than half drowned we seen him from the steamer nearly a mile out from shore swimmin like mad after a bottle that was floatin in the water outward bound we lowered the gig and started for him he nearly had his hand on the bottle when he gave out and went under we pulled him out in time to save him maybe but the doctor is the one to decide that a bottle said the old man rubbing his eyes he was not yet fully awake where is the bottle driftin along out there some eres said the mate jerking his thumb toward the sea get on with you simon iii smith goodwin and the ardent patriot zavalla took all the precautions that their foresight could contrive to prevent the escape of president miraflores and his companion the sent trusted messengers up the coast to solitas and alazan to warn the local leaders of the flight and to instruct them to patrol the water line and arrest the fugitives at all hazards should they reveal themselves in that territory after this was done there remained only to cover the district about coralio and await the coming of the quarry the nets were well spread the roads were so few the opportunities for embarkation so limited and the two or three probable points of exit so well guarded that it would be strange indeed if there should slip through the meshes so much of the country s dignity romance and collateral the president would without doubt move as secretly as possible and endeavor to board a vessel by stealth from some secluded point along the shore on the fourth day after the receipt of englehart s telegram the karlsefin a norwegian steamer chartered by the new orleans fruit trade anchored off coralio with three horse toots of her siren the karlesfin ws not one of the line operated by the vesuvius fruit company she was something of a dilettante doing odd jobs for a company that was scarcely important enough to figure as a rival to the vesuvius the movements of the karlesfin were dependent upon the state of the market sometimes she would ply steadily between the spanish main and new orleans in the regular transport of fruit next she would be maing erratic trips to mobile or charleston or even as far north as new york according to the distribution of the fruit supply goodwin lounged upon the beach with the susual crowd of idlers that had gathered to view the steamer now that president miraflores might be expected to reach the borders of his abjured country at any time the orders were to keep a strict and unrelenting watch every vessel that approached the shores might now be considered a possible means of escape for the fugitives and an eye was kept even on the slopes and dories that belonged to the sea going contingent of coralio goodwin and zavalla moved everywhere but without ostentation watching the loopholes of escape the customs official crowded importantly into their boat and rowed out to the karlesfin a boat from the steamer landed her purser with his papers and took out the quarantine doctor with his green umbrella and clinical thermometer next a swarm of caribs began to load upon lighters the thousands of bunches of bananas heaped upon the shore and row them out to the steamer the karlesfin had no passenger list and was soon done with the attention of the authorities the purser declared that the steamer would remain at anchor until morning taking on her fruit during the night the karlesfin had come he said from new york to which port her latest load of oranges and coconuts had been conveyed two or three of the freighter sloops were engaged to assist in the work for the captain was anxious to make a quick return in order to reap the advantage offered by a certain dearth of fruit in the states about four o clock in the afternoon another of those marine monsters not very familiar in those waters hove in sight following the fateful idalia a graceful steam yacht painted a light buff clean cut as a steel engraving the beautiful vessel hovered off shore see sawing the waves as lightly as a duck in a rain barrel a swift boat manned by a crew in uniform came ashore and a stocky built man leaped to the sands the newcomer seemed to turn a disapproving eye upon the rather motley congregation of native anchurians and made his way at once toward goodwin who was the most conspicuously anglo saxon figure present goodwin greeted him with courtesy conversation developed that the newly landed one was named smith and that he had come in a yacht a meagre biography truly for the yacht was most apparent and the smith not beyond a reasonable guess before the revelation yet to the eye of goodwin who has seen several things there was a discrepancy between smith and his yacht a bullet headed man smith was with an oblique dead eye and the moustache of a cocktail mixer and unless he had shifted costumes before putting off for shore he had affronted the deck of his correct vessel clad in a pearl gray derby a gay plaid suit and vaudeville neckwear men owning pleasure yachts generally harmonize better with them smith looked business but he was no advertiser he commented upon the scenery remarking upon its fidelity to the pictures in the geography and then inquired for the united states consul goodwin pointed out the starred and striped bunting hanging from above the little consulate which was concealed behind the orange trees mr geddie the consul will be sure to be there said goodwin he was very nearly drowned a few days ago while taking a swim in the sea and the doctor has ordered him to remain indoors for some time smith ploughed his way through the sand to the consulate his haberdashery creating violent discord against the smooth tropical blues and greens geddie was lounging in his hammock somewhat pale of face and languid in pose on that night when the valhalla s boat had brought him ashore apparently drenched to death by the sea doctor gregg and his other friends had toiled for hours to preserve the little spark of life that remained to him the bottle with its impotent message was gone out to sea and the problem that it had provoked was reduced to a simple sum in addition one and one make two by the rule of arithmetic one by the rule of romance there is a quaint old theory that man may have two souls a peripheral one which serves ordinarily and a central one which is stirred only at certain times but then with activity and vigor while under the domination of the former a man will shave vote pay taxes give money to his family buy subscription books and comport himself on the average plan but let the central soul suddenly become dominant and he may in the twinkling of an eye turn upon the partner of his joys with furious execration he may change his politics while you could snap your fingers he may deal out deadly insult to his dearest friend he may get him instanter to a monastery or a dance hall he may elope or hang himself or he may write a song or poem or kiss his wife unasked or give his funds to the search of a microbe then the peripheral soul will return and we have our safe sane citizen again it is but the revolt of the ego against order

the news about this ranch dick has got his new house well under way the pet lamb is doing finely and i take the cake for cooking mutton steak and fine gravy the chickens are doing mighty well the garden produces magnificent prickly pears and grass onions are worth two for five cents and mr haynes has shot a mexican please send by express to this ranch cooks and washwomen blind or wooden legged

a red sash and swears so fluently that he has been mistaken often for a member of the texas legislature if you see dr beall bow to him for me politely but distantly he refuses to waste a line upon me i suppose he is too much engaged in courting to write any letters give dr hall my profoundest regards i think about him invariably whenever he is occupying my thoughts influenced by the contents of

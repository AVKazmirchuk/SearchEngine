yards away marthy serene and comfortable sat in her rocking chair before the door in the shade of the house with her feet resting luxuriously upon the steps randy who was playing with a pair of spurs on the ground looked up for a moment at his father and went on spinning the rowels and singing a little song marthy turned her head lazily against the back of the chair and considered the arrivals

between the vegetable kingdom and the decorations of a waldorf astoria scene in a third avenue theatre i haven t looked up our family tree but i believe we were raised by grafting a gum overshoe on to a cent table d hote stalk of asparagus you take a white bulldog with a bourke cockran air of independence about him and a rubber plant and there you have the fauna and flora of a flat what the shamrock is to ireland the rubber plant is to the dweller in flats and furnished rooms we get moved from one place to another so quickly that the only way we can get our picture taken is with a kinetoscope we are the vagrant vine and the flitting fig tree you know the proverb where the rubber plant sits in the window the moving van draws up to the door we are the city equivalent to the woodbine and the honeysuckle no other vegetable except the pittsburg stogie can withstand as much handling as we can when the family to which we belong moves into a flat they set us in the front window and we become lares and penates fly paper and the peripatetic emblem of home sweet home we aren t as green as we look i guess we are about what you would call the soubrettes of the conservatory you try sitting in the front window of a flat in manhattan and looking out into the street all day and back into the flat at night and see whether you get wise or not hey talk about the tree of

up they left me with the rest of their goods at a second hand store i was put out in front for sale along with the jobbiest lot you ever heard of being lumped into one bargain think of this little

your case better said keogh with fiery emphasis you tear up ten thousand dollars like an old rag because the way you ve spread on five dollars worth of paint hurts your conscience next time i pick a side partner in a scheme the man has got to go before a notary and swear he never even heard the word ideal mentioned keogh strode from the room white hot white paid little attention to his resentment the scorn of billy keogh seemed a trifling thing beside the greater self scorn he had escaped in coralio the excitement waxed an outburst was imminent the cause of this demonstration of displeasure was the presence in the town of a big pink cheeked englishman who it was said was an agent of his government come to clinch the bargain by which the president placed his people in the hands of a foreign power it was charged that not only had he given away priceless concessions but that the public debt was to be transferred into the hands of the english and the custom houses turned over to them as a guarantee the long enduring people had determined to make their protest felt on that night in coralio and in other towns their ire found vent veiling mobs mercurial but dangerous roamed the streets they overthrew the great bronze statue of the president that stood in the center of the plaza and hacked it to shapeless pieces they tore from public buildings the tablets set there proclaiming the glory of the illustrious liberator his pictures in the government offices were demolished the mobs even attacked the casa morena but were driven away by the military which remained faithful to the executive all the night terror reigned the greatness of losada was shown by the fact that by noon the next day order was restored and he was still absolute he issued proclamations denying positively that any negotiation of any kind had been entered into with england sir stafford vaughn the pink cheeked englishman also declared in placards and in public print that his presence there had no international significance he was a traveller without guile in fact so he stated he had not even spoken with the president or been in his presence since his arrival during this disturbance white was preparing for his homeward voyage in the steamship that was to sail within two or three days about noon keogh the restless took his camera out with the hope of speeding the lagging hours the town was now as quiet as if peace had never departed from her perch on the red tiled roofs about the middle of the afternoon keogh hurried back to the hotel with something decidedly special in his air he retired to the little room where he developed his pictures later on he came out to white on the balcony with a luminous grim predatory smile on his face do you know what that is he asked holding up a x photograph mounted on cardboard snap shot of a senorita sitting in the sand alliteration unintentional guessed white lazily wrong saidkeogh with shining eyes it s a slung shot it s a can of dynamite it s a gold mine it s a sight draft on your president man for twenty thousand dollars yes sir twenty thousand this time and no spoiling the picture no ethics of art in the way art you with your smelly little tubes i ve got you skinned to death with a kodak take a look at that white took the picture in his hand and gave a long whistle jove he exclaimed but wouldn t that stir up a row in town if you let it be seen how in the world did you get it billy you know that high wall around the president man s back garden i was up there trying to get a bird s eye of the town i happened to notice a chink in the wall where a stone and a lot of plaster had slid out thinks i i ll take a peep through to see how mr president s cabbages are growing the first thing i saw was him and this sir englishman sitting at a little table about twenty feet away they had the table all spread over with documents and they were hobnobbing over them as thick as two pirates twas a nice corner of the garden all private and shady with palms and orange trees and they had a pail of champagne set by handy in the grass i knew then was the time for me to make my big hit in art so i raised the machine up to the crack and pressed the button just as i did so them old boys shook hands on the deal you see they took that way in the picture keogh put on his coat and hat what are you going to do with it asked white me said keogh in a hurt tone why i m going to tie a pink ribbon to it and hang it on the what not of course i m surprised at you but while i m out you just try to figure out what ginger cake potentate would be most likely to want to buy this work of art for his private collection just to keep it out of circulation the sunset was reddening the tops of the coconut palms when billy keogh came back from casa morena he nodded to the artist s questioning gaze and lay down on a cot with his hands under the back of his head i saw him he paid the money like a little man they didn t want to let me in at first i told em it was important yes that president man is on the plenty able list he s got a beautiful business system about the way he uses his brains all i had to do

a wounded snipe he was marked simultaneously as game by two hunters one was bully mcguire whose system of sport required the use of a strong arm and the misuse of an eight inch piece of lead pipe the other nimrod of the asphalt was spider kelley a sportsman with more refined methods in pouncing upon their self evident prey mr kelley was a shade the quicker his elbow fended accurately the onslaught of mr mcguire g wan he commanded harshly i saw it first mcguire slunk away awed by superior intelligence pardon me said mr kelley to the general but you got balled up in the shuffle didn t you let me assist you he picked up the general s hat and brushed the dust from it the ways of mr kelley could not but succeed the general bewildered and dismayed by the resounding streets welcomed his deliverer as a caballero with a most disinterested heart i have a desire said the general to return to the hotel of o brien in which i am stop caramba se or there is a loudness and rapidness of going and coming in the city of this nueva york mr kelley s politeness would not suffer the distinguished colombian to brave the dangers of the return unaccompanied at the door of the hotel espanol they paused a little lower down on the opposite side of the street shone the modest illuminated sign of el refugio mr kelley to whom few streets were unfamiliar knew the place exteriorly as a dago joint all foreigners mr kelley classed under the two heads of dagoes and frenchmen he proposed to the general that they repair thither and substantiate their acquaintance with a liquid foundation an hour later found general falcon and mr kelley seated at a table in the conspirator s corner of el refugio bottles and glasses were between them for the tenth time the general confided the secret of his mission to the estados unidos he was here he declared to purchase arms stands of winchester rifles for the colombian revolutionists he had drafts in his pocket drawn by the cartagena bank on its new york correspondent for at other tables other revolutionists were shouting their political secrets to their fellow plotters but none was as loud as the general he pounded the table he hallooed for some wine he roared to his friend that his errand was a secret one and not to be hinted at to a living soul mr kelley himself was stirred to sympathetic enthusiasm he grasped the general s hand across the table monseer he said earnestly i don t know where this country of yours is but i m for it i guess it must be a branch of the united states though for the poetry guys and the schoolmarms call us columbia too sometimes it s a lucky thing for you that you butted into me to night i m the only man in new york that can get this gun deal through for you the secretary of war of the united states is me best friend he s in the city now and i ll see him for you to morrow in the meantime monseer you keep them drafts tight in your inside pocket i ll call for you to morrow and take you to see him say that ain t the district of columbia you re talking about is it concluded mr kelley with a sudden qualm you can t capture that with no guns it s been tried with more no no no exclaimed the general it is the republic of colombia it is a g r reat republic on the top side of america of the south yes yes all right said mr kelley reassured now suppose we trek along home and go by by i ll write to the secretary to night and make a date with him it s a ticklish job to get guns out of new york mcclusky himself can t do it they parted at the door of the hotel espanol the general rolled his eyes at the moon and sighed it is a great country your nueva york he said truly the cars in the streets devastate one and the engine that cooks the nuts terribly makes a squeak in the ear but ah se or kelley the se oras with hair of much goldness and admirable fatness they are magnificas muy magnificas kelley went to the nearest telephone booth and called up mccrary s caf e far up on broadway he asked for jimmy dunn is that jimmy dunn asked kelley yes came the answer you re a liar sang back kelley joyfully your e the secretary of war wait there till i come up i ve got the finest thing down here in the way of a fish you ever baited for it s a colorado maduro with a gold band around it and free coupons enough to buy a red hall lamp and a statuette of psyche rubbering in the brook i ll be up on the next car jimmy dunn was an a m of crookdom he was an artist in the confidence line he never saw a bludgeon in his life and he scorned knockout drops in fact he would have set nothing before an intended victim but the purest of drinks if it had been possible to procure such a thing in new york it was the ambition of spider kelley to elevate himself into jimmy s class these two gentlemen held a conference that night at mccrary s kelley explained he s as easy as a gumshoe he s from the island of colombia where there s a strike or a feud or something going on and they ve sent him up here to buy winchesters to arbitrate the thing with he showed me two drafts for each and one for on a bank here s truth jimmy i felt real mad with him because he didn t have it in thousand dollar bills and hand it to me on a silver waiter now we ve got to wait till he goes to the bank and gets the money for us they talked it over for two hours and then dunn said bring him to no broadway at four o clock to morrow afternoon in due time kelley called at the hotel espanol for the general he found the wily warrior engaged in delectable conversation with mrs o brien the secretary of war is waitin for us said kelley the general tore himself away with an effort ay se or he said with a sigh duty makes a call but se or the se oras of your estados unidos how beauties for exemplification take you la madame o brien que magnifica she is one goddess one juno what you call one ox eyed juno now mr kelley was a wit and better men have been shriveled by the fire of their own imagination sure he said with a grin but you mean a peroxide juno don t you mrs o brien heard and lifted an auriferous head her businesslike eye rested for an instant upon the disappearing form of mr kelley except in street cars one should never be unnecessarily rude to a lady when the gallant colombian and his escort arrived at the broadway address they were held in an anteroom for half an hour and then admitted into a well equipped office where a distinguished looking man with a smooth face wrote at a desk general falcon was presented to the secretary of war of the united states and his mission made known by his old friend mr kelley ah colombia said the secretary significantly when he was made to understand i m afraid there will be a little difficutly in that case the president and i differ in our sympathies there he prefers the established government while i the secretary gave the general a mysterious but encouraging smile you of course know general falcon that since the tammany war an act of congress has been passed requiring all manufactured arms and ammunition exported from this country to pass through the war department now if i can do anything for you i will be glad to do so to oblige my old friend mr kelley but it must be in absolute secrecy as the president as i have said does not regard favorably the efforts of your revolutionary party in colombia i will have my orderly bring a list of the available arms now in the warehouse the secretary struck a bell and an orderly with the letters a d t on his cap stepped promptly into the room bring me schedule b of the small arms inventory said the secretary the orderly quickly returned with a printed paper the secretary studied it closely i find he said that in warehouse of government stores there is shipment of stands of winchester rifles that were ordered by the sultan of morocco who forgot to send the cash with his order our rule is that legal tender must be paid down at the time of purchase my dear kelley your friend general falcon shall have this lot of arms if he desires it at the manufacturer s price and you will forgive me i am sure if i curtail our interview i am expecting the japanese minister and charles murphy every moment as one result of this interview the general was deeply grateful to his esteemed friend mr kelley as another the nimble secretary of war was extremely busy during the next two days buying empty rifle cases and filling them with bricks which were then stored in a warehouse rented for that purpose as still another when the general returned to the hotel espanol mrs o brien went up to him plucked a thread from his lapel and said say se or i don t want to butt in but what does that monkey faced cat eyed rubber necked tin horn tough want with you sangre de mi vida exclaimed the general impossible it is that you speak of my good friend se or kelley come into the summer garden said mrs o brien i want to have a talk with you let us suppose that an hour has elapsed and you say said the general that for the sum of can be purchased the furnishment of the house and the lease of one year with this garden so lovely so resembling unto the patios of my cara colombia and dirt cheap at that sighed the lady ah dios breathed general falcon what to me is war and politics this spot is one paradise my country it have other brave heroes to continue the fighting what to me should be glory and the shooting of mans ah no it is here i have found one angel let us buy the hotel espanol and you shall be mine and the money shall not be waste on guns mrs o brien rested her blond pompadour against the shoulder of the colombian patriot oh se or she sighed happily ain t you terrible two days later was the time appointed for the delivery of the arms to the general the boxes of supposed rifles were stacked in the rented warehouse and the secretary of war sat upon them waiting for his friend kelley to fetch the victim mr kelley hurried at the hour to the hotel espanol he found the general behind the desk adding up accounts i have decide said the general to buy not guns i have to day buy the insides of this hotel and there shall be marrying of the general perrico ximenes villablanca falcon with la madame o brien mr kelley almost strangled say you old bald headed bottle of shoe polish he spluttered you re a swindler that s what you are you ve bought a boarding house with money belonging to your infernal country wherever it is ah said the general footing up a column that is what you call politics war and revolution they are not nice yes it is not best that one shall always follow minerva no it is of quite desirable to keep hotels and be with that juno that ox eyed juno ah what hair of the gold it is that she have mr kelley choked again ah senor kelley said the general feelingly and finally is it that you have never eaten of the corned beef hash that madame o brien she make babes in the jungle montague silver the finest street man and art grafter in the west says to me once in little rock if you ever lose your mind billy and get too old to do honest swindling among grown men go to new york in the west a sucker is born every minute but in new york they appear in chunks of roe you can t count em two years afterward i found that i couldn t remember the names of the russian admirals and i noticed some gray hairs over my left ear so i knew the time had arrived for me to take silver s advice i struck new york about noon one day and took a walk up broadway and i run against silver himself all encompassed up in a spacious kind of haberdashery leaning against a hotel and rubbing the half moons on his nails with a silk handkerchief paresis or superannuated i asks him hello billy says silver i m glad to see you yes it seemed to me that the west was accumulating a little too much wiseness i ve been saving new york for dessert i know it s a low down trick to take things from these people they only know this and that and pass to and fro and think ever and anon i d hate for my mother to know i was skinning these weak minded ones she raised me better is there a crush already in the waiting rooms of the old doctor that does skin grafting i asks well no says silver you needn t back epidermis to win to day i ve only been here a month but i m ready to begin and the members of willie manhattan s sunday school class each of whom has volunteered to contribute a portion of cuticle toward this rehabilitation may as well send their photos to the evening daily i ve been studying the town says silver and reading the papers every day and i know it as well as the cat in the city hall knows an o sullivan people here lie down on the floor and scream and kick when you are the least bit slow about taking money from them come up in my room and i ll tell you we ll work the town together billy for the sake of old times silver takes me up in a hotel he has a quantity of irrelevant objects lying about there s more ways of getting money from these metropolitan hayseeds says silver than there is of cooking rice in charleston s c they ll bite at anything the brains of most of em commute the wiser they are in intelligence the less perception of cognizance they have why didin t a man the other day sell j p morgan an oil portrait of rockefeller jr for andrea del sarto s celebrated painting of the young saint john you see that bundle of printed stuff in the corner billy that s gold mining stock i started out one day to sell that but i quit it in two hours why got arrested for blocking the street people fought to buy it i sold the policeman a block of it on the way to the station house and then i took it off the market i don t want people to give me their money i want some little consideration connected with the transaction to keep my pride from being hurt i want em to guess the missing letter in chic go or draw to a pair of nines before they pay me a cent of money now there s another little scheme that worked so easy i had to quit it you see that bottle of blue ink on the table i tattooed an anchor on the back of my hand and went to a bank and told em i was admiral dewey s nephew they offered to cash my draft on him for a thousand but i didn t know my uncle s first name it shows though what an easy town it is as for burglars they won t go in a house now unless there s a hot supper ready and a few college students to wait on em they re slugging citizens all over the upper part of the city and i guess taking the town from end to end it s a plain case of assault and battery monty says i when silver had slacked up you may have manhattan correctly discriminated in your perorative but i doubt it i ve only been in town two hours but it don t dawn upon me that it s ours with a cherry in it there ain t enough rus in urbe about it to suit me i d be a good deal much better satisfied if the citizens had a straw or more in their hair and run more to velveteen vests and buckeye watch charms they don t look easy to me you ve got it billy says silver all emigrants have it new york s bigger than little rock or europe and it frightens a foreigner you ll be all right i tell you i feel like slapping the people here because they don t send me all their money in laundry baskets with germicide sprinkled over it i hate to go down on the street to get it who wears the diamonds in this town why winnie the wiretapper s wife and bella the buncosteerer s bride new yorkers can be worked easier than a blue rose on a tidy the only thing that bothers me is i know i ll break the cigars in my vest pocket when i get my clothes all full of twenties i hope you are right monty says i but i wish all the same i had been satisfied with a small business in little rock the crop of farmers is never so short out there but what you can get a few of em to sign a petition for a new post office that you can discount for at the county bank the people hear appear to possess instincts of self preservation and illiberality i fear me that we are not cultured enough to tackle this game don t worry says silver i ve got this jayville near tarrytown correctly estimated as sure as north river is the hudson and east river ain t a river why there are people living in four blocks of broadway who never saw any kind of a building except a skyscraper in their lives a good live hustling western man ought to get conspicuous enough here inside of three months to incur either jerome s clemency or lawson s displeasure hyperbole aside says i do you know of any immediate system of buncoing the community out of a dollar or two except by applying to the salvation army or having a fit on miss helen gould s doorsteps dozens of em says silver how much capital have you got billy a thousand i told him i ve got says he we ll pool and do a big piece of business there s so many ways we can make a million that i don t know how to begin the next morning silver meets me at the hotel and he is all sonorous and stirred with a kind of silent joy we re to meet j p morgan this afternoon says he a man i know in the hotel wants to introduce us he s a friend of his he says he likes to meet people from the west that sounds nice and plausible says i i d like to know mr morgan it won t hurt us a bit says silver to get acquainted with a few finance kings i kind of like the social way new york has with strangers the man silver knew was named klein at three o clock klein brought his wall street friend to see us in silver s room mr morgan looked some like his pictures and he had a turkish towel wrapped around his left foot and he walked with a cane mr silver and mr pescud says klein it sounds superfluous says he to mention the name of the greatest financial cut it out klein says mr morgan i m glad to know you gents i take great interest in the west klein tells me you re from little rock i think i ve a railroad or two out there somewhere if either of you guys would like to deal a hand or two of stud poker i now pierpont cuts in klein you forget excuse me gents says morgan since i ve had the gout so bad i sometimes play a social game of cards at my house neither of you never knew one eyed peters did you while you was around little rock he lived in seattle new mexico before we could answer mr morgan hammers on the floor with his can and begins to walk up and down swearing in a loud tone of voice they have been pounding your stocks to day on the street pierpont asks klein smiling stocks no roars mr morgan it s that picture i sent an agent to europe to buy i just thought about it he cabled me to day that it ain t to be found in all italy i d pay to morrow for that picture yes i give the agent a la carte in purchasing it i cannot understand why the art galleries will allow a de vinchy to why mr morgan says klein i thought you owned all of the de vinchy paintings what is the picture like mr morgan asks silver it must be as big as the side of the flatiron building i m afraid your art education is on the bum mr silver says morgan the picture is inches by and it is called love s idle hour it represents a number of cloak models doing the two step on the bank of a purple river the cablegram said it might have been brought to this country my collection will never be complete without that picture well so long gents us financiers must keep early hours mr morgan and klein went away together in a cab me and silver talked about how simple and unsuspecting great people was and silver said what a shame it would be to try to rob a man like mr morgan and i said i thought it would be rather imprudent myself klein proposes a stroll after dinner and me and him and silver walks down toward seventh avenue to see the sights klein sees a pair of cuff links that instigate his admiration in a pawnshop window and we all go in while he buys em after we got back to the hotel and klein had gone silver jumps at me and waves his hands did you see it says he did you see it billy what i asks why that picture that morgan wants it s hanging in that pawnshop behind the desk i didn t say anything because klein was there it s the article sure as you live the girls are as natural as paint can make them all measuring and and skirts if they had any skirts and they re doing a buck and wing on the bank of a river with the blues what did mr morgan say he d give for it oh don t make me tell you they can t know what it is in that pawnshop when the pawnshop opened the next morning me and silver was standing there as anxious as if we wanted to soak our sunday suit to buy a drink we sauntered inside and began to look at watch chains that s a violent specimen of a chromo you ve got up there remarked silver casual to the pawnbroker but i kind of enthuse over the girl with the shoulderblades and red bunting would an offer of for it cause you to knock over any fragile articles of your stock in hurrying it off the nail the pawnbroker smiles and goes on showing us plate watch chains that picture says he was pledged a year ago by an italian gentleman i loaned him on it it is called love s idle hour and it is by leonardo de vinchy two days ago the legal time expired and it became an unredeemed pledge here is a style of chain that is worn a great deal now at the end of half an hour me and silver paid the pawnbroker and walked out with the picture silver got into a cab with it and started for morgan s office i goes to the hotel and waits for him in two hours silver comes back did you see mr morgan i asks how much did he pay you for it silver sits down and fools with a tassel on the table cover i never exactly saw mr morgan he says because mr morgan s been in europe for a month but what s worrying me billy is this the department stores have all got that same picture on sale framed for and they charge for the frame alone that s what i can t understand the day resurgent i can see the artist bite the end of his pencil and frown when it comes to drawing his easter picture for his legitimate pictorial conceptions of figures pertinent to the festival are but four in number first comes easter pagan goddess of spring here his fancy may have free play a beautiful maiden with decorative hair and the proper number of toes will fill the bill miss clarice st vavasour the well known model will pose for it in the lethergogallagher or whatever it was that trilby called it second the melancholy lady with upturned eyes in a framework of lilies this is magazine covery but reliable third miss manhattan in the fifth avenue easter sunday parade fourth maggie murphy with a new red feather in her old straw hat happy and self conscious in the grand street turnout of course the rabbits do not count nor the easter eggs since the higher criticism has hard boiled them the limited field of its pictorial possibilities proves that easter of all our festival days is the most vague and shifting in our conception it belongs to all religions although the pagans invented it going back still further to the first spring we can see eve choosing with pride a new green leaf from the tree ficus carica now the object of this critical and learned preamble is to set forth the theorem that easter is neither a date a season a festival a holiday nor an occasion what it is you shall find out if you follow in the footsteps of danny mccree easter sunday dawned as it should bright and early in its place on the calendar between saturday and monday at the sun rose and at danny followed its example he went into the kitchen and washed his face at the sink his mother was frying bacon she looked at his hard smooth knowing countenance as he juggled with the round cake of soap and thought of his father when she first saw him stopping a hot grounder between second and third twenty two years before on a vacant lot in harlem where the la paloma apartment house now stands in the front room of the flat danny s father sat by an open window smoking his pipe with his dishevelled gray hair tossed about by the breeze he still clung to his pipe although his sight had been taken from him two years before by a precocious blast of giant powder that went off without permission very few blind men care for smoking for the reason that they cannot see the smoke now could you enjoy having the news read to you from an evening newspaper unless you could see the colors of the headlines tis easter day said mrs mccree scramble mine said danny after breakfast he dressed himself in the sabbath morning costume of the canal street importing house dray chauffeur frock coat striped trousers patent leathers gilded trace chain across front of vest and wing collar rolled brim derby and butterfly bow from schonstein s between fourteenth street and tony s fruit stand saturday night sale you ll be goin out this day of course danny said old man mccree a little wistfully tis a kind of holiday they say well it s fine spring weather i can feel it in the air why should i not be going out demanded danny in his grumpiest chest tones should i stay in am i as good as a horse one day of rest my team has a week who earns the money for the rent and the breakfast you ve just eat i d like to know answer me that all right lad said the old man i m not complainin while me two eyes was good there was nothin better to my mind than a sunday out there s a smell of turf and burnin brush comin in the windy i have me tobaccy a good fine day and rist to ye lad times i wish your mother had larned to read so i might hear the rest about the hippopotamus but let that be now what is this foolishness he talks of hippopotamuses asked danny of his mother as he passed through the kitchen have you been taking him to the zoo and for what i have not said mrs mccree he sets by the windy all day tis little recreation a blind man among the poor gets at all i m thinkin they wander in their minds at times one day he talks of grease without stoppin for the most of an hour i looks to see if there s lard burnin in the fryin pan there is not he says i do not understand tis weary days sundays and holidays and all for a blind man danny there was no better nor stronger than him when he had his two eyes tis a fine day son injoy yeself ag inst the morning there will be cold supper at six have you heard any talk of a hippopotamus asked danny of mike the janitor as he went out the door downstairs i have not said mike pulling his shirtsleeves higher but tis the only subject in the animal natural and illegal lists of outrages that i ve not been compained to about these two days see the landlord or else move out if ye like have ye hippopotamuses in the lease no then it was the old man who spoke of it said danny likely there s nothing in it danny walked up the street to the avenue and then struck northward into the heart of the district where easter modern easter in new bright raiment leads the pascal march out of towering brown churches came the blithe music of anthems from the choirs the broad sidewalks were moving parterres of living flowers so it seemed when your eye looked upon the ester girl gentlemen frock coated silk hatted gardeniaed sustained the background of the tradition children carried lilies in their hands the windows of the brownstone mansions were packed with the most opulent creations of flora the sister of the lady of the lilies around a corner white gloved pink gilled and tightly buttoned walked corrigan the cop shield to the curb danny knew him why corrigan he asked is easter i know it comes the first you re full after the moon rises on the seventeenth of march but why is it a proper and religious ceremony or does the governor appoint it out of politics tis an annual celebration said corrigan with the judicial air of the third deputy police commissioner peculiar to new york it extends up to harlem sometimes they has the reserves out at one hundred and twenty fifth street in my opinion tis not political thanks said danny and say did you ever hear a man complain of hippopotamuses when not specially in drink i mean nothing larger than sea turtles said corrigan reflecting and there was wood alcohol in that danny wandered the double heavy incumbency of enjoying simultaneously a sunday and a festival day was his the sorrows of the hand toiler fit him easily they are worn so often that they hang with the picturesque lines of the best tailor made garments that is why well fed artists of pencil and pen find in the griefs of the common people their most striking models but when the philistine would disport himself the grimness of melpomene herself attends upon his capers therefore danny set his jaw hard at easter and took his pleasure sadly the family entrance of dugan s caf e was feasible so danny yielded to the vernal season as far as a glass of bock seated in a dark linoleumed humid back room his heart and mind still groped after the mysterious meaning of the springtime jubilee say tim he said to the waiter why do they have easter skiddoo said tim closing a sophisticated eye is that a new one all right tony pastor s for you last night i guess i give it up what s the answer two apples or a yard and a half from dugan s danny turned back eastward the april sun seemed to stir in him a vague feeling that he could not construe he made a wrong diagnosis and decided that it was katy conlon a block from her house on avenue a he met her going to church they pumped hands on the corner gee but you look dumpish and dressed up said katy what s wrong come away with me to church and be cheerful what s doing at church asked danny why it s easter sunday silly i waited till after eleven expectin you might come around to go what does this easter stand for katy asked danny gloomily nobody seems to know nobody as blind as you said katy with spirit you haven t even looked at my new hat and skirt why it s when all the girls put on new spring clothes silly are you coming to church with me i will said danny if this easter is pulled off there they ought to be able to give some excuse for it not that the hat ain t a beauty the green roses are great at church the preacher did some expounding with no pounding he spoke rapidly for he was in a hurry to get home to his early sabbath dinner but he knew his business there was one word that controlled his theme resurrection not a new creation but a new life arising out of the old the congregation had heard it often before but there was a wonderful hat a combination of sweet peas and lavender in the sixth pew from the pulpit it attracted much attention after church danny lingered on a corner while katy waited with pique in her sky blue eyes are you coming along to the house she asked but don t mind me i ll get there all right you seem to be studyin a lot about something all right will i see you at any time specially mr mccree i ll be around wednesday night as usual said danny turning and crossing the street katy walked away with the green roses dangling indignantly danny stopped two blocks away he stood still with his hands in his pockets at the curb on the corner his face was that of a graven image deep in his soul something stirred so small so fine so keen and leavening that his hard fibres did not recognize it it was something more tender than the april day more subtle than the call of the senses purer and deeper rooted than the love of woman for had he not turned away from green roses and eyes that had kept him chained for a year and danny did not know what it was the preacher who was in a hurry to go to his dinner had told him but danny had had no libretto with which to follow the drowsy intonation but the preacher spoke the truth suddenly danny slapped his leg and gave forth a hoarse yell of delight hippopotamus he shouted to an elevated road pillar well how is that for a bum guess why blast my skylights i know what he was driving at now hippopotamus wouldn t that send you to the bronx it s been a year since he heard it and he didn t miss it so very far we quit at b c and this comes next well a wooden man wouldn t have guessed what he was trying to get out of him danny caught a crosstown car and went up to the rear flat that his labor supported old man mccree was still sitting by the window his extinct pipe lay on the sill will that be you lad he asked danny flared into the rage of a strong man who is surprised at the outset of committing a good deed who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house he snapped viciously have i no right to come in ye re a faithful lad said old man mccree with a sigh is it evening yet danny reached up on a shelf and took down a thick book labeled in gilt letters the history of greece dust was on it half an inch thick he laid it on the table and found a place in it marked by a strip of paper and then he gave a short roar at the top of his voice and said was it the hippopotamus you wanted to be read to about then did i hear ye open the book said old man mccree many and weary be the months since my lad has read it to me i dinno but i took a great likings to them greeks ye left off at a place tis a fine day outside lad be out and take rest from your work i have gotten used to me chair by the windy and me pipe pel peloponnesus was the place where we left off and not hippopotamus said danny the war began there it kept something doing for thirty years the headlines says that a guy named philip of macedon in b c got to be boss of greece by getting the decision at the battle of cher cheronaea i ll read it with his hand to his ear rapt in the peloponnesian war old man mccree sat for an hour listening then he got up and felt his way to the door of the kitchen mrs mccree was slicing cold meat she looked up tears were running from old man mccree s eyes do you hear our lad readin to me he said there is none finer in the land my two eyes have come back to me again after supper he said to danny tis a happy day this easter and now ye will be off to see katy in the evening well enough who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house said danny angrily have i no right to stay in it after supper there is yet to come the reading of the battle of corinth b c when the kingdom as they say became an in integral portion of the roman empire am i nothing in this house the fifth wheel the ranks of the bed line moved closer together for it was cold they were alluvial deposit of the stream of life lodged in the delta of fifth avenue and broadway the bed liners stamped their freezing feet looked at the empty benches in madison square whence jack frost had evicted them and muttered to one another in a confusion of tongues the flatiron building with its impious cloud piercing architecture looming mistily above them on the opposite delta might well have stood for the tower of babel whence these polyglot idlers had been called by the winged walking delegate of the lord standing on a pine box a head higher than his flock of goats the preacher exhorted whatever transient and shifting audience the north wind doled out to him it was a slave market fifteen cents bought you a man you deeded him to morpheus and the recording angel gave you credit the preacher was incredibly earnest and unwearied he had looked over the list of things one may do for one s fellow man and had assumed for himself the task of putting to bed all who might apply at his soap box on the nights of wednesday and sunday that left but five nights for other philanthropists to handle and had they done their part as well this wicked city might have become a vast arcadian dormitory where all might snooze and snore the happy hours away letting problem plays and the rent man and business go to the deuce the hour of eight was but a little while past sightseers in a small dark mass of pay ore were gathered in the shadow of general worth s monument now and then shyly ostentatiously carelessly or with conscientious exactness one would step forward and bestow upon the preacher small bills or silver then a lieutenant of scandinavian coloring and enthusiasm would march away to a lodging house with a squad of the redeemed all the while the preacher exhorted the crowd in terms beautifully devoid of eloquence splendid with the deadly accusative monotony of truth before the picture of the bed liners fades you must hear one phrase of the preacher s the one that formed his theme that night it is worthy of being stenciled on all the white ribbons in the world no man ever learned to be a drunkard on five cent whisky think of it tippler it covers the ground from the sprouting rye to the potter s field a clean profiled erect young man in the rear rank of the bedless emulated the terrapin drawing his head far down into the shell of his coat collar it was a well cut tweed coat and the trousers still showed signs of having flattened themselves beneath the compelling goose but conscientiously i must warn the milliner s apprentice who reads this expecting a reginald montressor in straits to peruse no further the young man was no other than thomas mcquade ex coachman discharged for drunkenness one month before and now reduced to the grimy ranks of the one night bed seekers if you live in smaller new york you must know the van smuythe family carriage drawn by the two pound to shot bays the carriage is shaped like a bath tub in each end of it reclines an old lady van smuythe holding a black sunshade the size of a new year s eve feather tickler before his downfall thomas mcquade drove the van smuythe bays and was himself driven by annie the van smuythe lady s maid but it is one of the saddest things about romance that a tight shoe or an empty commissary or an aching tooth will make a temporary heretic of any cupid worshiper and thomas s physical troubles were not few therefore his soul was less vexed with thoughts of his lost lady s maid than it was by the fancied presence of certain non existent things that his racked nerves almost convinced him were flying dancing crawling and wriggling on the asphalt and in the air above and around the dismal campus of the bed line army nearly four weeks of straight whisky and a diet limited to crackers bologna and pickles often guarantees a psycho zoological sequel thus desperate freezing angry beset by phantoms as he was he felt the need of human sympathy and intercourse the bed liner standing at his right was a young man of about his own age shabby but neat what s the diagnosis of your case freddy asked thomas with the freemasonic familiarity of the damned booze that s mine you don t look like a panhandler neither am i a month ago i was pushing the lines over the backs of the finest team of percheron buffaloes that ever made their mile down fifth avenue in and look at me now say how do you come to be at this bed bargain counter rummage sale the other young man seemed to welcome the advances of the airy ex coachman no said he mine isn t exactly a case of drink unless we allow that cupid is a bartender i married unwisely according to the opinion of my unforgiving relatives i ve been out of work for a year because i don t know how to work and i ve been sick in bellevue and other hospitals for months my wife and kid had to go back to her mother i was turned out of the hospital yesterday and i haven t a cent that s my tale of woe tough luck said thomas a man alone can pull through all right but i hate to see the women and kids get the worst of it just then there hummed up fifth avenue a motor car so splendid so red so smoothly running so craftily demolishing the speed regulations that it drew the attention even of the listless bed liners suspended and pinioned on its left side was an extra tire when opposite the unfortunate company the fastenings of this tire became loosed it fell to the asphalt bounded and rolled rapidly in the wake of the flying car thomas mcquade scenting an opportunity darted from his place among the preacher s goats in thirty seconds he had caught the rolling tire swung it over his shoulder and was trotting smartly after the car on both sides of the avenue people were shouting whistling and waving canes at the red car pointing to the enterprising thomas coming up with the lost tire one dollar thomas had estimated was the smallest guerdon that so grand an automobilist could offer for the service he had rendered and save his pride two blocks away the car had stopped there was a little brown muffled chauffeur driving and an imposing gentleman wearing a magnificent sealskin coat and a silk hat on a rear seat thomas proffered the captured tire with his best ex coachman manner and a look in the brighter of his reddened eyes that was meant to be suggestive to the extent of a silver coin or two and receptive up to higher denominations but the look was not so construed the sealskinned gentleman received the tire placed it inside the car gazed intently at the ex coachman and muttered to himself inscrutable words strange strange said he once or twice even i myself have fancied that the chaldean chiroscope has availed could it be possible then he addressed less mysterious words to the waiting and hopeful thomas sir i thank you for your kind rescue of my tire and i would ask you if i may a question do you know the family of van smuythes living in washington square north oughtn t i to replied thomas i lived there wish i did yet the sealskinned gentleman opened a door of the car step in please he said you have been expected thomas mcquade obeyed with surprise but without hesitation a seat in a motor car seemed better than standing room in the bed line but after the lap robe had been tucked about him and the auto had sped on its course the peculiarity of the invitation lingered in his mind maybe the guy hasn t got any change was his diagnosis lots of these swell rounders don t lug about any ready money guess he ll dump me out when he gets to some joint where he can get cash on his mug anyhow it s a cinch that i ve got that open air bed convention beat to a finish submerged in his greatcoat the mysterious automobilist seemed himself to marvel at the surprises of life wonderful amazing strange he repeated to himself constantly when the car had well entered the crosstown seventies it swung eastward a half block and stopped before a row of high stooped brownstone front houses be kind enough to enter my house with me said the sealskinned gentleman when they had alighted he s going to dig up sure reflected thomas following him inside there was a dim light in the hall his host conducted him through a door to the left closing it after him and leaving them in absolute darkness suddenly a luminous globe strangely decorated shone faintly in the centre of an immense room that seemed to thomas more splendidly appointed than any he had ever seen on the stage or read of in fairy tales the walls were hidden by gorgeous red hangings embroidered with fantastic gold figures at the rear end of the room were draped porti eres of dull gold spangled with silver crescents and stars the furniture was of the costliest and rarest styles the ex coachman s feet sank into rugs as fleecy and deep as snowdrifts there were three or four oddly shaped stands or tables covered with black velvet drapery thomas mcquade took in the splendors of this palatial apartment with one eye with the other he looked for his imposing conductor to find that he had disappeared b gee muttered thomas this listens like a spook shop shouldn t wonder if it ain t one of these moravian nights adventures that you read about wonder what became of the furry guy suddenly a stuffed owl that stood on an ebony perch near the illuminated globe slowly raised his wings and emitted from his eyes a brilliant electric glow with a fright born imprecation thomas seized a bronze statuette of hebe from a cabinet near by and hurled it with all his might at the terrifying and impossible fowl the owl and his perch went over with a crash with the sound there was a click and the room was flooded with light from a dozen frosted globes along the walls and ceiling the gold porti eres parted and closed and the mysterious automobilist entered the room he was tall and wore evening dress of perfect cut and accurate taste a vandyke beard of glossy golden brown rather long and wavy hair smoothly parted and large magnetic orientally occult eyes gave him a most impressive and striking appearance if you can conceive a russian grand duke in a rajah s throneroom advancing to greet a visiting emperor you will gather something of the majesty of his manner but thomas mcquade was too near his d t s to be mindful of his p s and q s when he viewed this silken polished and somewhat terrifying host he thought vaguely of dentists say doc said he resentfully that s a hot bird you keep on tap i hope i didn t break anything but i ve nearly got the williwalloos and when he threw them candle power lamps of his on me i took a snap shot at him with that little brass flatiron girl that stood on the sideboard that is merely a mechanical toy said the gentleman with a wave of his hand may i ask you to be seated while i explain why i brought you to my house perhaps you would not understand nor be in sympathy with the psychological prompting that caused me to do so so i will come to the point at once by venturing to refer to your admission that you know the van smuythe family of washington square north any silver missing asked thomas tartly any joolry displaced of course i know em any of the old ladies sunshades disappeared well i know em and then what the grand duke rubbed his white hands together softly wonderful he murmured wonderful shall i come to believe in the chaldean chiroscope myself let me assure you he continued that there is nothing for you to fear instead i think i can promise you that very good fortune awaits you we will see do they want me back asked thomas with something of his old professional pride in his voice i ll promise to cut out the booze and do the right thing if they ll try me again but how did you get wise doc b gee it s the swellest employment agency i was ever in with its flashlight owls and so forth with an indulgent smile the gracious host begged to be excused for two minutes he went out to the sidewalk and gave an order to the chauffeur who still waited with the car returning to the mysterious apartment he sat by his guest and began to entertain him so well by his witty and genial converse that the poor bed liner almost forgot the cold streets from which he had been so recently and so singularly rescued a servant brought some tender cold fowl and tea biscuits and a glass of miraculous wine and thomas felt the glamour of arabia envelop him thus half an hour sped quickly and then the honk of the returned motor car at the door suddenly drew the grand duke to his feet with another soft petition for a brief absence two women well muffled against the cold were admitted at the front door and suavely conducted by the master of the house down the hall through another door to the left and into a smaller room which was screened and segregated from the larger front room by heavy double porti eres here the furnishings were even more elegant and exquisitely tasteful than in the other on a gold inlaid rosewood table were scattered sheets of white paper and a queer triangular instrument or toy apparently of gold standing on little wheels the taller woman threw back her black veil and loosened her cloak she was fifty with a wrinkled and sad face the other young and plump took a chair a little distance away and to the rear as a servant or an attendant might have done you sent for me professor cherubusco said the elder woman wearily i hope you have something more definite than usual to say i ve about lost the little faith i had in your art i would not have responded to your call this evening if my sister had not insisted upon it madam said the professor with his princeliest smile the true art cannot fail to find the true psychic and potential branch sometimes requires time we have not succeeded i admint with the cards the crystal the stars the magic formulae of zarazin nor the oracle of po but we have at last discovered the true psychic route the chaldean chiroscope has been successful in our search the professor s voice had a ring that seemed to proclaim his belief in his own words the elderly lady looked at him with a little more interest why there was no sense in those words that it wrote with my hands on it she said what do you mean the words were these said professor cherubusco rising to his full magnificent height by the fifth wheel of the chariot he shall come i haven t seen many chariots said the lady but i never saw one with five wheels progress said the professor progress in science and mechanics has accomplished it though to be exact we may speak of it only as an extra tire progress in occult art has advanced in proportion madam i repeat that the chaldean chiroscope has succeeded i can not only answer the question that you have propounded but i can produce before your eyes the proof thereof and now the lady was disturbed both in her disbelief and in her poise o professor she cried anxiously when where has he been found do not keep me in suspense i beg you will excuse me for a very few minutes said professor cherubusco and i think i can demonstrate to you the efficacy of the true art thomas was contentedly munching the last crumbs of the bread and fowl when the enchanter appeared suddenly at his side are you willing to return to your old home if you are assured of a welcome and restoration to favor he asked with his courteous royal smile do i look bughouse answered thomas enough of the footback life for me but will they have me again the old lady is as fixed in her ways as a nut on a new axle my dear young man said the other she has been searching for you everywhere great said thomas i m on the job that team of dropsical domedaries they call horses is a handicap for a first class coachman like myself but i ll take the job back sure doc they re good people to be with and now a change came o er the suave countenance of the caliph of bagdad he looked keenly and suspiciously at the ex coachman may i ask what your name is he said shortly you ve been looking for me said thomas and don t know my name you re a funny kind of sleuth you must be one of the central office gumshoers i m thomas mcquade of course and i ve been chauffeur of the van smuythe elephant team for a year they fired me a month ago for well doc you saw what i did to your old owl i went broke on booze and when i saw the tire drop off your whiz wagon i was standing in that squad of hoboes at the worth monument waiting for a free bed now what s the prize for the best answer to all this to his intense surprise thomas felt himself lifted by the collar and dragged without a word of explanation to the front door this was opened and he was kicked forcibly down the steps with one heavy disillusionizing humiliating impact of the stupendous arabian s shoe as soon as the ex coachman had recovered his feet and his wits he hastened as fast as he could eastward toward broadway crazy guy was his estimate of the mysterious automobilist just wanted to have some fun kiddin i guess he might have dug up a dollar anyhow now i ve got to hurry up and get back to that gang of bum bed hunters before they all get preached to sleep when thomas reached the end of his two mile walk he found the ranks of the homeless reduced to a squad

the first evening that mrs jessup knew about our arrangement i got to the bench before paisley did supper was just over and mrs jessup was out there with a fresh pink dress on and almost cool enough to handle i sat down by her and made a few specifications about the moral surface of nature as set forth by the landscape and the contiguous perspective that evening was surely a case in point the moon was attending to business in the section of sky where it belonged and the trees was making shadows on the ground according to science and nature and there was a kind of conspicuous hullabaloo going on in the bushes between the bullbats and the orioles and the jack rabbits and other feathered insects of the forest and the wind out of the mountains was singing like a jew s harp in the pile of old tomato cans by the railroad track i felt a kind of sensation in my left side something like dough rising in a crock by the fire mrs jessup had moved up closer oh mr hicks says she when one is alone in the world don t they feel it more aggravated on a beautiful night like this i rose up off the bench at once excuse me ma am says i but i ll have to wait till paisley comes before i can give a audible hearing to leading questions like that and then i explained to her how we was friends cinctured by years of embarrassment and travel and complicity and how we had agreed to take no advantage of each other in any of the more mushy walks of life such as might be fomented by sentiment and proximity mrs jessup appears to think serious about the matter for a minute and then she breaks into a species of laughter that makes the wildwood resound in a few minutes paisley drops around with oil of bergamot on his hair and sits on the other side of mrs jessup and inaugurates a sad tale of adventure in which him and pieface lumley has a skinning match of dead cows in for a silver mounted saddle in the santa rita valley during the nine months drought now from the start of that courtship i had paisley fish hobbled and tied to a post each one of us had a different system of reaching out for the easy places in the female heart paisley s scheme was to petrify em with wonderful relations of events that he had either come across personally or in large print i think he must have got his idea of subjugation from one of shakespeare s shows i see once called othello there is a coloured man in it who acquires a duke s daughter by disbursing to her a mixture of the talk turned out by rider haggard lew dockstader and dr parkhurst but that style of courting don t work well off the stage now i give you my own recipe for inveigling a woman into that state of affairs when she can be referred to as n e jones learn how to pick up her hand and hold it and she s yours it ain t so easy some men grab at it so much like they was going to set a dislocation of the shoulder that you can smell the arnica and hear em tearing off bandages some take it up like a hot horseshoe and hold it off at arm s length like a druggist pouring tincture of asafoetida in a bottle and most of em catch hold of it and drag it right out before the lady s eyes like a boy finding a baseball in the grass without giving her a chance to forget that the hand is growing on the end of her arm them ways are all wrong i ll tell you the right way did you ever see a man sneak out in the back yard and pick up a rock to throw at a tomcat that was sitting on a fence looking at him he pretends he hasn t got a thing in his hand and that the cat don t see him and that he don t see the cat that s the idea never drag her hand out where she ll have to take notice of it don t let her know that you think she knows you have the least idea she is aware you are holding her hand that was my rule of tactics and as far as paisley s serenade about hostilities and misadventure went he might as well have been reading to her a time table of the sunday trains that stop at ocean grove new jersey one night when i beat paisley to the bench by one pipeful my friendship gets subsidised for a minute and i asks mrs jessup if she didn t think a h was easier to write than a j in a second her head was mashing the oleander flower in my button hole and i leaned over and but i didn t if you don t mind says i standing up we ll wait for paisley to come before finishing this i ve never done anything dishonourable yet to our friendship and this won t be quite fair mr hicks says mrs jessup looking at me peculiar in the dark if it wasn t for but one thing i d ask you to hike yourself down the gulch and never disresume your visits to my house and what is that ma am i asks you are too good a friend not to make a good husband says she in five minutes paisley was on his side of mrs jessup in silver city in the summer of he begins i see jim batholomew chew off a chinaman s ear in the blue light saloon on account of a crossbarred muslin shirt that what

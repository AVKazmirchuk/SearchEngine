have heard me say i was a shepherd i have also had the fancy at times that i am a poet if it be the test of a poet to adore and cherish the beautiful that fancy is now strengthened can i serve you in any way mademoiselle the young woman looked up at him with eyes dry and mournful his frank glowing face made serious by the gravity of the adventure his strong straight figure and the liquid sympathy in his blue eyes perhaps also her imminent need of long denied help and kindness thawed her to sudden tears monsieur she said in low tones you look to be true and kind he is my uncle the brother of my father and my only relative he loved my mother and he hates me because i am like her he has made my life one long terror i am afraid of his very looks and never before dared to disobey him but to night he would have married me to a man three times my age you will forgive me for bringing this vexation upon you monsieur you will of course decline this mad act he tries to force upon you but let me thank you for your generous words at least i have had none spoken to me in so long there was now something more than generosity in the poet s eyes poet he must have been for yvonne was forgotten this fine new loveliness held him with its freshness and grace the subtle perfume from her filled him with strange emotions his tender look fell warmly upon her she leaned to it thirstily ten minutes said david is given me in which to do what i would devote years to achieve i will not say i pity you mademoiselle it would not be true i love you i cannot ask love from you yet but let me rescue you from this cruel man and in time love may come i think i have a future i will not always be a shepherd for the present i will cherish you with all my heart and make your life less sad will you trust your fate to me mademoiselle ah you would sacrifice yourself from pity from love the time is almost up mademoiselle you will regret it and despise me i will live only to make you happy and myself worthy of you her fine small hand crept into his from beneath her cloak i will trust you she breathed with my life and and love may not be so far off as you think tell him once away from the power of his eyes i may forget david went and stood before the marquis the black figure stirred and the mocking eyes glanced at the great hall clock two minutes to spare a shepherd requires eight minutes to decide whether he will accept a bride of beauty and income speak up shepherd do you consent to become mademoiselle s husband mademoiselle said david standing proudly has done me the honour to yield to my request that she become my wife well said said the marquis you have yet the making of a courtier in you master shepherd mademoiselle could have drawn a worse prize after all and now to be done with the affair as quick as the church and the devil will allow he struck the table soundly with his sword hilt the landlord came knee shaking bringing more candles in the hope of anticipating the great lord s whims fetch a priest said the marquis a priest do you understand in ten minutes have a priest here or the landlord dropped his candles and flew the priest came heavy eyed and ruffled he made david mignot and lucie de verennes man and wife pocketed a gold piece that the marquis tossed him and shuffled out again into the night wine ordered the marquis spreading his ominous fingers at the host fill glasses he said when it was brought he stood up at the head of the table in the candlelight a black mountain of venom and conceit with something like the memory of an old love turned to poison in his eyes as it fell upon his niece monsieur mignot he said raising his wineglass drink after i say this to you you have taken to be your wife one who will make your life a foul and wretched thing the blood in her is an inheritance running black lies and red ruin she will bring you shame and anxiety the devil that descended to her is there in her eyes and skin and mouth that stoop even to beguile a peasant there is your promise monsieur poet for a happy life drink your wine at last mademoiselle i am rid of you the marquis drank a little grievous cry as if from a sudden wound came from the girl s lips david with his glass in his hand stepped forward three paces and faced the marquis there was little of a shepherd in his bearing just now he said calmly you did me the honor to call me monsieur may i hope therefore that my marriage to mademoiselle has placed me somewhat nearer to you in let us say reflected rank has given me the right to stand more as an equal to monseigneur in a certain little piece of business i have in my mind you may hope shepherd sneered the marquis then said david dashing his glass of wine into the contemptuous eyes that mocked him perhaps you will condescend to fight me the fury of the great lord outbroke in one sudden curse like a blast from a horn he tore his sword from its black sheath he called to the hovering landlord a sword there for this lout he turned to the lady with a laugh that chilled her heart and said you put much labour upon me madame it

lambs during his ranching days than he did of his cherished fruit warding it from the hungry wolves that whistled and howled and shot their marbles and peered through the fence that surrounded his property in the house next to dry valley s lived a widow with a pack of children that gave the husbandman frequent anxious misgivings in the woman there was a strain of the spanish she had wedded one of the name of o brien dry valley was a connoisseur in cross strains and he foresaw trouble in the offspring of this union between the two homesteads ran a crazy picket fence overgrown with morning glory and wild gourd vines often he could see little heads with mops of black hair and flashing dark eyes dodging in and out between the pickets keeping tabs on the reddening berries late one afternoon dry valley went to the post office when he came back like mother hubbard he found the deuce to pay the descendants of iberian bandits and hibernian cattle raiders had swooped down upon his strawberry patch to the outraged vision of dry valley there seemed to be a sheep corral full of them perhaps they numbered five or six between the rows of green plants they were stooped hopping about like toads gobbling silently and voraciously his finest fruit dry valley slipped into the house got his whip and charged the marauders the lash curled about the legs of the nearest a greedy ten year old before they knew they were discovered his screech gave warning and the flock scampered for the fence like a drove of javelis flushed in the chaparral dry valley s whip drew a toll of two more elfin shrieks before they dived through the vine clad fence and disappeared dry valley less fleet followed them nearly to the pickets checking his useless pursuit he rounded a bush dropped his whip and stood voiceless motionless the capacity of his powers consumed by the act of breathing and preserving the perpendicular behind the bush stood panchita o brien scorning to fly she was nineteen the oldest of the raiders her night black hair was gathered back in a wild mass and tied with a scarlet ribbon she stood with reluctant feet yet nearer the brook than to the river for childhood had environed and detained her she looked at dry valley johnson for a moment with magnificent insolence and before his eyes slowly crunched a luscious berry between her white teeth then she turned and walked slowly to the fence with a swaying conscious motion such as a duchess might make use of in leading a promenade there she turned again and grilled dry valley johnson once more in the dark flame of her audacious eyes laughed a trifle school girlishly and twisted herself with pantherish quickness between the pickets to the o brien side of the wild gourd vine dry valley picked up his whip and went into his house he stumbled as he went up the two wooden steps the old mexican woman who cooked his meals and swept his house called him to supper as he went through the rooms dry valley went on stumbled down the front steps out the gate and down the road into a mesquite thicket at the edge of town he sat down in the grass and laboriously plucked the spines from a prickly pear one by one this was his attitude of thought acquired in the days when his problems were only those of wind and wool and water a thing had happened to the man a thing that if you are eligible you must pray may pass you by he had become enveloped in the indian summer of the soul dry valley had had no youth even his childhood had been one of dignity and seriousness at six he had viewed the frivolous gambols of the lambs on his father s ranch with silent disapproval his life as a young man had been wasted the divine fires and impulses the glorious exaltations and despairs the glow and enchantment of youth had passed above his head never a thrill of romeo had he known he was but a melancholy jaques of the forest with a ruder philosophy lacking the bitter sweet flavour of experience that tempered the veteran years of the rugged ranger of arden and now in his sere and yellow leaf one scornful look from the eyes of panchita o brien had flooded the autumnal landscape with a tardy and delusive summer heat but a sheepman is a hardy animal dry valley johnson had weathered too many northers to turn his back on a late summer spiritual or real old he would show them by the next mail went an order to san antonio for an outfit of the latest clothes colours and styles and prices no object the next day went the recipe for the hair restorer clipped from a newspaper for dry valley s sunburned auburn hair was beginning to turn silvery above his ears dry valley kept indoors closely for a week except for frequent sallies after youthful strawberry snatchers then a few days later he suddenly emerged brilliantly radiant in the hectic glow of his belated midsummer madness a jay bird blue tennis suit covered him outwardly almost as far as his wrists and ankles his shirt was ox blood his collar winged and tall his necktie a floating oriflamme his shoes a venomous bright tan pointed and shaped on penitential lasts a little flat straw hat with a striped band desecrated his weather beaten head lemon coloured kid gloves protected his oak tough hands from the benignant may sunshine this sad and optic smiting creature teetered out of its den smiling foolishly and smoothing its gloves for men

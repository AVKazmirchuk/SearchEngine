flew and the little narrow gauge cars began to unload aglaia flour there the miller s orders were to store the flour in the gallery of the old mill church and that every one who attended the church was to carry home a sack of it two weeks after that abram strong came for his yearly visit to the eagle house and became father abram again that season the eagle house had fewer guests than usual among them was rose chester miss chester came to lakelands from atlanta where she worked in a department store this was the first vacation outing of her life the wife of the store manager had once spent a summer at the eagle house she had taken a fancy to rose and had persuaded her to go there for her three weeks holiday the manager s wife gave her a letter to mrs rankin who gladly received her in her own charge and care miss chester was not very strong she was about twenty and pale and delicate from an indoor life but one week of lakelands gave her a brightness and spirit that changed her wonderfully the time was early september when the cumberlands are at their greatest beauty the mountain foliage was growing brilliant with autumnal colours one breathed aerial champagne the nights were deliciously cool causing one to snuggle cosily under the warm blankets of the eagle house father abram and miss chester became great friends the old miller learned her story from mrs rankin and his interest went out quickly to the slender lonely girl who was making her own way in the world the mountain country was new to miss chester she had lived many years in the warm flat town of atlanta and the grandeur and variety of the cumberlands delighted her she was determined to enjoy every moment of her stay her little hoard of savings had been estimated so carefully in connection with her expenses that she knew almost to a penny what her very small surplus would be when she returned to work miss chester was fortunate in gaining father abram for a friend and companion he knew every road and peak and slope of the mountains near lakelands through him she became acquainted with the solemn delight of the shadowy tilted aisles of the pine forests the dignity of the bare crags the crystal tonic mornings the dreamy golden afternoons full of mysterious sadness so her health improved and her spirits grew light she had a laugh as genial and hearty in its feminine way as the famous laugh of father abram both of them were natural optimists and both knew how to present a serene and cheerful face to the world one day miss chester learned from one of the guests the history of father abram s lost child quickly she hurried away and found the miller seated on his favourite rustic bench near the chalybeate spring he was surprised when his little friend slipped her hand into his and looked at him with tears in her eyes oh father abram she said i m so sorry i didn t know until to day about your little daughter you will find her yet some day oh i hope you will the miller looked down at her with his strong ready smile thank you miss rose he said in his usual cheery tones but i do not expect to find aglaia for a few years i hoped that she had been stolen by vagrants and that she still lived but i have lost that hope i believe that she was drowned i can understand said miss chester how the doubt must have made it so hard to bear and yet you are so cheerful and so ready to make other people s burdens light good father abram good miss rose mimicked the miller smiling who thinks of others more than you do a whimsical mood seemed to strike miss chester oh father abram she cried wouldn t it be grand if i should prove to be your daughter wouldn t it be romantic and wouldn t you like to have me for a daughter indeed i would said the miller heartily if aglaia had lived i could wish for nothing better than for her to have grown up to be just such a little woman as you are maybe you are aglaia he continued falling in with her playful mood can t you remember when we lived at the mill miss chester fell swiftly into serious meditation her large eyes were fixed vaguely upon something in the distance father abram was amused at her quick return to seriousness she sat thus for a long time before she spoke no she said at length with a long sigh i can t remember anything at all about a mill i don t think that i ever saw a flour mill in my life until i saw your funny little church and if i were your little girl i would remember it wouldn t i i m so sorry father abram so am i said father abram humouring her but if you cannot remember that you are my little girl miss rose surely you can recollect being some one else s you remember your own parents of course oh yes i remember them very well especially my father he wasn t a bit like you father abram oh i was only making believe come now you ve rested long enough you promised to show me the pool where you can see the trout playing this afternoon i never saw a trout late one afternoon father abram set out for the old mill alone he often went to sit and think of the old days when he lived in the cottage across the road time had smoothed away the sharpness of his grief until he no longer found the memory of those

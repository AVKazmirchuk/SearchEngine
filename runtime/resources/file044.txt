meal it might in time overcome the presence of one i went on ministering to my fatal vice although i felt that each time i shoved a potato into my mouth in mame s presence i might be burying my fondest hopes i think collier must have spoken to mame and got the same answer for one day he orders a cup of coffee and a cracker and sits nibbling the corner of it like a girl in the parlour that s filled up in the kitchen previous on cold roast and fried cabbage i caught on and did the same and maybe we thought we d made a hit the next day we tried it again and out comes old man dugan fetching in his hands the fairy viands kinder off yer feed ain t ye gents he asks fatherly and some sardonic thought i d spell mame a bit seein the work was light and my rheumatiz can stand the strain so back me and collier had to drop to the heavy grub again i noticed about that time that i was seized by a most uncommon and devastating appetite i ate until mame must have hated to see me darken the door afterward i found out that i had been made the victim of the first dark and irreligious trick played on me by ed collier him and me had been taking drinks together uptown regular trying to drown our thirst for food that man had bribed about ten bartenders to always put a big slug of appletree s anaconda appetite bitters in every one of my drinks but the last trick he played me was hardest to forget one day collier failed to show up at the tent a man told me he left town that morning my only rival now was the bill of fare a few days before he left collier had presented me with a two gallon jug of fine whisky which he said a cousin had sent him from kentucky i now have reason to believe that it contained appletree s anaconda appetite bitters almost exclusively i continued to devour tons of provisions in mame s eyes i remained a mere biped more ruminant than ever about a week after collier pulled his freight there came a kind of side show to town and hoisted a tent near the railroad i judged it was a sort of fake museum and curiosity business i called to see mame one night and ma dugan said that she and thomas her younger brother had gone to the show that same thing happened for three nights that week saturday night i caught her on the way coming back and got to sit on the steps a while and talk to her i noticed she looked different her eyes were softer and shiny like instead of a mame dugan to fly from the voracity of man and raise violets she seemed to be a mame more in line as god intended her approachable and suited to bask in the light of the brazilians and the kindler you seem to be right smart inveigled says i with the unparalleled exhibition of the world s living curiosities and wonders it s a change says mame you ll need another says i if you keep on going every night don t be cross jeff says she it takes my mind off business don t the curiosities eat i ask not all of them some of them are wax look out then that you don t get stuck says i kind of flip and foolish mame blushed i didn t know what to think about her my hopes raised some that perhaps my attentions had palliated man s awful crime of visibly introducing nourishment into his system she talked some about the stars referring to them with respect and politeness and i drivelled a quantity about united hearts homes made bright by true affection and the kindler mame listened without scorn and i says to myself jeff old man you re removing the hoodoo that has clung to the consumer of victuals you re setting your heel upon the serpent that lurks in the gravy bowl monday night i drop around mame is at the unparalleled exhibition with thomas now may the curse of the forty one seven sided sea cooks says i and the bad luck of the nine impenitent grasshoppers rest upon this self same sideshow at once and forever more amen i ll go to see it myself to morrow night and investigate its baleful charm shall man that was made to inherit the earth be bereft of his sweetheart first by a knife and fork and then by a ten cent circus the next night before starting out for the exhibition tent i inquire and find out that mame is not at home she is not at the circus with thomas this time for thomas waylays me in the grass outside of the grub tent with a scheme of his own before i had time to eat supper what ll you give me jeff says he if i tell you something the value of it son i says sis is stuck on a freak says thomas one of the side show freaks i don t like him she does i overheard em talking thought maybe you d like to know say jeff does it put you wise two dollars worth there s a target rifle up town that i frisked my pockets and commenced to dribble a stream of halves and quarters into thomas s hat the information was of the pile driver system of news and it telescoped my intellects for a while while i was leaking small change and smiling foolish on the outside and suffering disturbances internally i was saying idiotically and pleasantly thank you thomas thank you er a freak you said thomas now could you make out the monstrosity s entitlements a

while you get your hair cut weeklies it s all right pick this african man raisuli hides burdick harris up in the mountains and advertises his price to the governments of different nations now you wouldn t think for a minute goes on caligula that john hay would have chipped in and helped this graft along if it wasn t a square game would you why no says i i ve always stood right in with bryan s policies and i couldn t consciously say a word against the republican administration just now but if harris was a greek on what system of international protocols did hay interfere it ain t exactly set forth in the papers says caligula i suppose it s a matter of sentiment you know he wrote this poem little breeches and them greeks wear little or none but anyhow john hay sends the brooklyn and the olympia over and they cover africa with thirty inch guns and then hay cables after the health of the persona grata and how are they this morning he wires is burdick harris alive yet or mr raisuli dead and the king of morocco sends up the seventy thousand dollars and they turn burdick harris loose and there s not half the hard feelings among the nations about this little kidnapping matter as there was about the peace congress and burdick harris says to the reporters in the greek language that he s often heard about the united states and he admires roosevelt next to raisuli who is one of the whitest and most gentlemanly kidnappers that he ever worked alongside of so you see pick winds up caligula we ve got the law of nations on our side we ll cut this colonel man out of the herd and corral him in them little mountains and stick up his heirs and assigns for ten thousand dollars well you seldom little red headed territorial terror i answers you can t bluff your uncle tecumseh pickens i ll be your company in this graft but i misdoubt if you ve absorbed the inwardness of this burdick harris case calig and if on any morning we get a telegram from the secretary of state asking about the health of the scheme i propose to acquire the most propinquitous and celeritous mule in this section and gallop diplomatically over into the neighboring and peaceful nation of alabama iii me and caligula spent the next three days investigating the bunch of mountains into which we proposed to kidnap colonel jackson t rockingham we finally selected an upright slice of topography covered with bushes and trees that you could only reach by a secret path that we cut out up the side of it and the only way to reach the mountain was to follow up the bend of a branch that wound among the elevations then i took in hand an important subdivision of the proceedings i went up to atlanta on the train and laid in a two hundred and fifty dollar supply of the most gratifying and efficient lines of grub that money could buy i always was an admirer of viands in their more palliative and revised stages hog and hominy are not only inartistic to my stomach but they give indigestion to my moral sentiments and i thought of colonel jackson t rockingham president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad and how he would miss the luxury of his home fare as is so famous among wealthy southerners so i sunk half of mine and caligula s capital in as elegant a layout of fresh and canned provisions as burdick harris or any other professional kidnappee ever saw in a camp i put another hundred in a couple of cases of bordeaux two quarts of cognac two hundred havana regalias with gold bands and a camp stove and stools and folding cots i wanted colonel rockingham to be comfortable and i hoped after he gave up the ten thousand dollars he would give me and caligula as good a name for gentlemen and entertainers as the greek man did the friend of his that made the united states his bill collector against africa when the goods came down from atlanta we hired a wagon moved them up on the little mountain and established camp and then we laid for the colonel we caught him one morning about two miles out from mountain valley on his way to look after some of his burnt umber farm land he was an elegant old gentleman as thin and tall as a trout rod with frazzled shirt cuffs and specs on a black string we explained to him brief and easy what we wanted and caligula showed him careless the handle of his forty five under his coat what says colonel rockingham bandits in perry county georgia i shall see that the board of immigration and public improvements hears of this be so unfoolhardy as to climb into that buggy says caligula by order of the board of perforation and public depravity this is a business meeting and we re anxious to adjourn sine qua non we drove colonel rockingham over the mountain and up the side of it as far as the buggy could go then we tied the horse and took our prisoner on foot up to the camp now colonel i says to him we re after the ransom me and my partner and no harm will come to you if the king of mor if your friends send up the dust in the mean time we are gentlemen the same as you and if you give us your word not to try to escape the freedom of the camp is yours i give you my word says the colonel all right says i and now it s eleven o clock and me and mr polk will proceed to inculcate the occasion with a few well timed trivialities in the way of grub thank you says the colonel i believe i could relish a slice of bacon and a plate of hominy but you won t says i emphatic not in this camp we soar in higher regions than them occupied by your celebrated but repulsive dish while the colonel read his paper me and caligula took off our coats and went in for a little luncheon de luxe just to show him caligula was a fine cook of the western brand he could toast a buffalo or fricassee a couple of steers as easy as a woman could make a cup of tea he was gifted in the way of knocking together edibles when haste and muscle and quantity was to be considered he held the record west of the arkansas river for frying pancakes with his left hand broiling venison cutlets with his right and skinning a rabbit with his teeth at the same time but i could do things en casserole and la creole and handle the oil and tobasco as gently and nicely as a french chef so at twelve o clock we had a hot lunch ready that looked like a banquet on a mississippi river steamboat we spread it on the tops of two or three big boxes opened two quarts of the red wine set the olives and a canned oyster cocktail and a ready made martini by the colonel s plate and called him to grub colonel rockingham drew up his campstool wiped off his specs and looked at the things on the table then i thought he was swearing and i felt mean because i hadn t taken more pains with the victuals but he wasn t he was asking a blessing and me and caligula hung our heads and i saw a tear drop from the colonel s eye into his cocktail i never saw a man eat with so much earnestness and application not hastily like a grammarian or one of the canal but slow and appreciative like a anaconda or a real vive bonjour in an hour and a half the colonel leaned back i brought him a pony of brandy and his black coffee and set the box of havana regalias on the table gentlemen says he blowing out the smoke and trying to breathe it back again when we view the eternal hills and the smiling and beneficent landscape and reflect upon the goodness of the creator who excuse me colonel says i but there s some business to attend to now and i brought out paper and pen and ink and laid em before him who do you want to send to for the money i asks i reckon says he after thinking a bit to the vice president of our railroad at the general offices of the company in edenville how far is it to edenville from here i asked about ten miles says he then i dictated these lines and colonel rockingham wrote them out i am kidnapped and held a prisoner by two desperate outlaws in a place which is useless to attempt to find they demand ten thousand dollars at once for my release the amount must be raised immediately and these directions followed come alone with the money to stony creek which runs out of blacktop mountains follow the bed of the creek till you come to a big flat rock on the left bank on which is marked a cross in red chalk stand on the rock and wave a white flag a guide will come to you and conduct you to where i am held lose no time after the colonel had finished this he asked permission to take on a postscript about how he was being treated so the railroad wouldn t feel uneasy in its bosom about him we agreed to that he wrote down that he had just had lunch with the two desperate ruffians and then he set down the whole bill of fare from cocktails to coffee he wound up with the remark that dinner would be ready about six and would probably be a more licentious and intemperate affair than lunch me and caligula read it and decided to let it go for we being cooks were amenable to praise though it sounded out of place on a sight draft for ten thousand dollars i took the letter over to the mountain valley road and watched for a messenger by and by a colored equestrian came along on horseback riding toward edenville i gave him a dollar to take the letter to the railroad offices and then i went back to camp iv about four o clock in the afternoon caligula who was acting as lookout calls to me i have to report a white shirt signalling on the starboard bow sir i went down the mountain and brought back a fat red man in an alpaca coat and no collar gentlemen says colonel rockingham allow me to introduce my brother captain duval c rockingham vice president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad otherwise the king of morocco says i i reckon you don t mind my counting the ransom just as a business formality well no not exactly says the fat man not when it comes i turned that matter over to our second vice president i was anxious after brother jackson s safetiness i reckon he ll be along right soon what does that lobster salad you mentioned taste like brother jackson mr vice president says i you ll oblige us by remaining here till the second v p arrives this is a private rehearsal and we don t want any roadside speculators selling tickets in half an hour caligula sings out again sail ho looks like an apron on a broomstick i perambulated down the cliff again and escorted up a man six foot three with a sandy beard and no other dimension that you could notice thinks i to myself if he s got ten thousand dollars on his person it s in one bill and folded lengthwise mr patterson g coble our second vice president announces the colonel glad to know you gentlemen says this coble i came up to disseminate the tidings that major tallahassee tucker our general passenger agent is now negotiating a peachcrate full of our railroad bonds with the perry county bank for a loan my dear colonel rockingham was that chicken gumbo or cracked goobers on the bill of fare in your note me and the conductor of fifty six was having a dispute about it another white wings on the rocks hollers caligula if i see any more i ll fire on em and swear they was torpedo boats the guide goes down again and convoys into the lair a person in blue overalls carrying an amount of inebriety and a lantern i am so sure that this is major tucker that i don t even ask him until we are up above and then i discover that it is uncle timothy the yard switchman at edenville who is sent ahead to flag our understandings with the gossip that judge pendergast the railroad s attorney is in the process of mortgaging colonel rockingham s farming lands to make up the ransom while he is talking two men crawl from under the bushes into camp and caligula with no white flag to disinter him from his plain duty draws his gun but again colonel rockingham intervenes and introduces mr jones and mr batts engineer and fireman of train number forty two excuse us says batts but me and jim have hunted squirrels all over this mounting and we don t need no white flag was that straight colonel about the plum pudding and pineapples and real store cigars towel on a fishing pole in the offing howls caligula suppose it s the firing line of the freight conductors and brakeman my last trip down says i wiping off my face if the s e t wants to run an excursion up here just because we kidnapped their president let em we ll put out our sign the kidnapper s cafe and trainmen s home this time i caught major tallahassee tucker by his own confession and i felt easier i asked him into the creek so i could drown him if he happened to be a track walker or caboose porter all the way up the mountain he driveled to me about asparagus on toast a thing that his intelligence in life had skipped up above i got his mind segregated from food and asked if he had raised the ransom my dear sir says he i succeeded in negotiating a loan on thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds of our railroad and never mind just now major says i it s all right then wait till after dinner and we ll settle the business all of you gentlemen i continues to the crowd are invited to stay to dinner we have mutually trusted one another and the white flag is supposed to wave over the proceedings the correct idea says caligula who was standing by me two baggage masters and a ticket agent dropped out of a tree while you was below the last time did the major man bring the money he says i answered that he succeeded in negotiating the loan if any cooks ever earned ten thousand dollars in twelve hours me and caligula did that day at six o clock we spread the top of the mountain with as fine a dinner as the personnel of any railroad ever engulfed we opened all the wine and we concocted entr es and pi ces de resistance and stirred up little savory chef de cuisines and organized a mass of grub such as has been seldom instigated out of canned and bottled goods the railroad gathered around it and the wassail and diversions was intense after the feast me and caligula in the line of business takes major tucker to one side and talks ransom the major pulls out an agglomeration of currency about the size of the price of a town lot in the suburbs of rabbitville arizona and makes this outcry gentlemen says he the stock of the sunrise edenville railroad has depreciated some the best i could do with thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds was to secure a loan of eighty seven dollars and fifty cents on the farming lands of colonel rockingham judge pendergast was able to obtain on a ninth mortgage the sum of fifty dollars you will find the amount one hundred and thirty seven fifty correct a railroad president said i looking this tucker in the eye and the owner of a thousand acres of land and yet gentlemen says tucker the railroad is ten miles long there don t any train run on it except when the crew goes out in the pines and gathers enough lightwood knots to get up steam a long time ago when times was good the net earnings used to run as high as eighteen dollars a week colonel rockingham s land has been sold for taxes thirteen times there hasn t been a peach crop in this part of georgia for two years the wet spring killed the watermelons nobody around here has money enough to buy fertilizer and land is so poor the corn crop failed and there wasn t enough grass to support the rabbits all the people have had to eat in this section for over a year is hog and hominy and pick interrupts caligula mussing up his red hair what are you going to do with that chicken feed i hands the money back to major tucker and then i goes over to colonel rockingham and slaps him on the back colonel says i i hope you ve enjoyed our little joke we don t want to carry it too far kidnappers well wouldn t it tickle your uncle my name s rhinegelder and i m a nephew of chauncey depew my friend s a second cousin of the editor of puck so you can see we are down south enjoying ourselves in our humorous way now there s two quarts of cognac to open yet and then the joke s over what s the use to go into details one or two will be enough i remember major tallahassee tucker playing on a jew s harp and caligula waltzing with his head on the watch pocket of a tall baggage master i hesitate to refer to the cake walk done by me and mr patterson g coble with colonel jackson t rockingham between us and even on the next morning when you wouldn t think it possible there was a consolation for me and caligula we knew that raisuli himself never made half the hit with burdick harris that we did with the sunrise edenville tap railroad the ethics of pig on an east bound train i went into the smoker and found jefferson peters the only man with a brain west of the wabash river who can use his cerebrum cerebellum and medulla oblongata at the same time jeff is in the line of unillegal graft he is not to be dreaded by widows and orphans he is a reducer of surplusage his favorite disguise is that of the target bird at which the spendthrift or the reckless investor may shy a few inconsequential dollars he is readily vocalized by tobacco so with the aid of two thick and easy burning brevas i got the story of his latest autolycan adventure in my line of business said jeff the hardest thing is to find an upright trustworthy strictly honorable partner to work a graft with some of the best men i ever worked with in a swindle would resort to trickery at times so last summer i thinks i will go over into this section of country where i hear the serpent has not yet entered and see if i can find a partner naturally gifted with a talent for crime but not yet contaminated by success i found a village that seemed to show the right kind of a layout the inhabitants hadn t found that adam had been dispossessed and were going right along naming the animals and killing snakes just as if they were in the garden of eden they call this town mount nebo and it s up near the spot where kentucky and west virginia and north carolina corner together them states don t meet well it was in that neighborhood anyway after putting in a week proving i wasn t a revenue officer i went over to the store where the rude fourflushers of the hamlet lied to see if i could get a line on the kind of man i wanted gentlemen says i after we had rubbed noses and gathered round the dried apple barrel i don t suppose there s another community in the whole world into which sin and chicanery has less extensively permeated than this life here where all the women are brave and propitious and all the men honest and expedient must indeed be an idol it reminds me says i of goldstein s beautiful ballad entitled the deserted village which says ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey what art can drive its charms away the judge rode slowly down the lane mother for i m to be queen of the may why yes mr peters says the storekeeper i reckon we air about as moral and torpid a community as there be on the mounting according to censuses of opinion but i reckon you ain t ever met rufe tatum why no says the town constable he can t hardly have ever that air rufe is shore the monstrousest scalawag that has escaped hangin on the galluses and that puts me in mind that i ought to have turned rufe out of the lockup before yesterday the thirty days he got for killin yance goodloe was up then a day or two more won t hurt rufe any though shucks now says i in the mountain idiom don t tell me there s a man in mount nebo as bad as that worse says the storekeeper he steals hogs i think i will look up this mr tatum so a day or two after the constable turned him out i got acquainted with him and invited him out on the edge of town to sit on a log and talk business what i wanted was a partner with a natural rural make up to play a part in some little one act outrages that i was going to book with the pitfall gin circuit in some of the western towns and this r tatum was born for the role as sure as nature cast fairbanks for the stuff that kept eliza from sinking into the river he was about the size of a first baseman and he had ambiguous blue eyes like the china dog on the mantelpiece that aunt harriet used to play with when she was a child his hair waved a little bit like the statue of the dinkus thrower at the vacation in rome but the color of it reminded you of the sunset in the grand canon by an american artist that they hang over the stove pipe holes in the salongs he was the reub without needing a touch you d have known him for one even if you d seen him on the vaudeville stage with one cotton suspender and a straw over his ear i told him what i wanted and found him ready to jump at the job overlooking such a trivial little peccadillo as the habit of manslaughter says i what have you accomplished in the way of indirect brigandage or nonactionable thriftiness that you could point to with or without pride as an evidence of your qualifications for the position why says he in his kind of southern system of procrastinated accents hain t you heard tell there ain t any man black or white in the blue ridge that can tote off a shoat as easy as i can without bein heard seen or cotched i can lift a shoat he goes on out of a pen from under a porch at the trough in the woods day or night anywhere or anyhow and i guarantee nobody won t hear a squeal it s all in the way you grab hold of em and carry em atterwards some day goes on this gentle despoiler of pig pens i hope to become reckernized as the champion shoat stealer of the world it s proper to be ambitious says i and hog stealing will do very well for mount nebo but in the outside world mr tatum it would be considered as crude a piece of business as a bear raid on bay state gas however it will do as a guarantee of good faith we ll go into partnership i ve got a thousand dollars cash capital and with that homeward plods atmosphere of yours we ought to be able to win out a few shares of soon parted preferred in the money market so i attaches rufe and we go away from mount nebo down into the lowlands and all the way i coach him for his part in the grafts i had in mind i had idled away two months on the florida coast and was feeling all to the ponce de leon besides having so many new schemes up my sleeve that i had to wear kimonos to hold em i intended to assume a funnel shape and mow a path nine miles wide though the farming belt of the middle west so we headed in that direction but when we got as far as lexington we found binkley brothers circus there and the blue grass peasantry romping into town and pounding the belgian blocks with their hand pegged sabots as artless and arbitrary as an extra session of a datto bryan drama i never pass a circus without pulling the valve cord and coming down for a little key west money so i engaged a couple of rooms and board for rufe and me at a house near the circus grounds run by a widow lady named peevy then i took rufe to a clothing store and gent s outfitted him he showed up strong as i knew he would after he was rigged up in the ready made rutabaga regalia me and old misfitzky stuffed him into a bright blue suit with a nile green visible plaid effect and riveted on a fancy vest of a light tuskegee normal tan color a red necktie and the yellowest pair of shoes in town they were the first clothes rufe had ever worn except the gingham layette and the butternut top dressing of his native kraal and he looked as self conscious as an igorrote with a new nose ring that night i went down to the circus tents and opened a small shell game rufe was to be the capper i gave him a roll of phony currency to bet with and kept a bunch of it in a special pocket to pay his winnings out of no i didn t mistrust him but i simply can t manipulate the ball to lose when i see real money bet my fingers go on a strike every time i try it i set up my little table and began to show them how easy it was to guess which shell the little pea was under the unlettered hinds gathered in a thick semicircle and began to nudge elbows and banter one another to bet then was when rufe ought to have single footed up and called the turn on the little joker for a few tens and fives to get them started but no rufe i d seen him two or three times walking about and looking at the side show pictures with his mouth full of peanut candy but he never came nigh the crowd piked a little but trying to work the shells without a capper is like fishing without a bait i closed the game with only forty two dollars of the unearned increment while i had been counting on yanking the yeomen for two hundred at least i went home at eleven and went to bed i supposed that the circus had proved too alluring for rufe and that he had succumbed to it concert and all but i meant to give him a lecture on general business principles in the morning just after morpheus had got both my shoulders to the shuck mattress i hears a houseful of unbecoming and ribald noises like a youngster screeching with green apple colic i opens my door and calls out in the hall for the widow lady and when she sticks her head out i says mrs peevy ma am would you mind choking off that kid of yours so that honest people can get their rest sir says she it s no child of mine it s the pig squealing that your friend mr tatum brought home to his room a couple of hours ago and if you are uncle or second cousin or brother to it i d appreciate your stopping its mouth sir yourself if you please i put on some of the polite outside habiliments of external society and went into rufe s room he had gotten up and lit his lamp and was pouring some milk into a tin pan on the floor for a dingy white half grown squealing pig how is this rufe says i you flimflammed in your part of the work to night and put the game on crutches and how do you explain the pig it looks like back sliding to me now don t be too hard on me jeff says he you know how long i ve been used to stealing shoats it s got to be a habit with me and to night when i see such a fine chance i couldn t help takin it well says i maybe you ve really got kleptopigia and maybe when we get out of the pig belt you ll turn your mind to higher and more remunerative misconduct why you should want to stain your soul with such a distasteful feeble minded perverted roaring beast as that i can t understand why jeff says he you ain t in sympathy with shoats you don t understand em like i do this here seems to me to be an animal of more than common powers of ration and intelligence he walked half across the room on his hind legs a while ago well i m going back to bed says i see if you can impress it upon your friend s ideas of intelligence that he s not to make so much noise he was hungry says rufe he ll go to sleep and keep quiet now i always get up before breakfast and read the morning paper whenever i happen to be within the radius of a hoe cylinder or a washington hand press the next morning i got up early and found a lexington daily on the front porch where the carrier had thrown it the first thing i saw in it was a double column ad on the front page that read like this five thousand dollars reward the above amount will be paid and no questions asked for the return alive and uninjured of beppo the famous european educated pig that strayed or was stolen from the side show tents of binkley bros circus last night geo b tapley business manager at the circus grounds i folded up the paper flat put it into my inside pocket and went to rufe s room he was nearly dressed and was feeding the pig the rest of the milk and some apple peelings well well well good morning all i says hearty and amiable so we are up and piggy is having his breakfast what had you intended doing with that pig rufe i m going to crate him up says rufe and express him to ma in mount nebo he ll be company for her while i am away he s a mighty fine pig says i scratching him on the back you called him a lot of names last night says rufe oh well says i he looks better to me this morning i was raised on a farm and i m very fond of pigs i used to go to bed at sundown so i never saw one by lamplight before tell you what i ll do rufe i says i ll give you ten dollars for that pig i reckon i wouldn t sell this shoat says he if it was any other one i might why not this one i asked fearful that he might know something why because says he it was the grandest achievement of my life there ain t airy other man that could have done it if i ever have a fireside and children i ll sit beside it and tell em how their daddy toted off a shoat from a whole circus full of people and maybe my grandchildren too they ll certainly be proud a whole passel why says he there was two tents one openin into the other this shoat was on a platform tied with a little chain i seen a giant and a lady with a fine chance of bushy white hair in the other tent i got the shoat and crawled out from under the canvas again without him squeakin as loud as a mouse i put him under my coat and i must have passed a hundred folks before i got out where the streets was dark i reckon i wouldn t sell that shoat jeff i d want ma to keep it so there d be a witness to what i done the pig won t live long enough i says to use as an exhibit in your senile fireside mendacity your grandchildren will have to take your word for it i ll give you one hundred dollars for the animal rufe looked at me astonished the shoat can t be worth anything like that to you he says what do you want him for viewing me casuistically says i with a rare smile you wouldn t think that i ve got an artistic side to my temper but i have i m a collector of pigs i ve scoured the world for unusual pigs over in the wabash valley i ve got a hog ranch with most every specimen on it from a merino to a poland china this looks like a blooded pig to me rufe says i i believe it s a genuine berkshire that s why i d like to have it i d shore like to accommodate you says he but i ve got the artistic tenement too i don t see why it ain t art when you can steal a shoat better than anybody else can shoats is a kind of inspiration and genius with me specially this one i wouldn t take two hundred and fifty for that animal now listen says i wiping off my forehead it s not so much a matter of business with me as it is art and not so much art as it is philanthropy being a connoisseur and disseminator of pigs i wouldn t feel like i d done my duty to the world unless i added that berkshire to my collection not intrinsically but according to the ethics of pigs as friends and coadjutors of mankind i offer you five hundred dollars for the animal jeff says this pork esthete it ain t money it s sentiment with me seven hundred says i make it eight hundred says rufe and i ll crush the sentiment out of my heart i went under my clothes for my money belt and counted him out forty twenty dollar gold certificates i ll just take him into my own room says i and lock him up till after breakfast i took the pig by the hind leg he turned on a squeal like the steam calliope at the circus let me tote him in for you says rufe and he picks up the beast under one arm holding his snout with the other hand and packs him into my room like a sleeping baby after breakfast rufe who had a chronic case of haberdashery ever since i got his trousseau says he believes he will amble down to misfitzky s and look over some royal purple socks and then i got as busy as a one armed man with the nettle rash pasting on wall paper i found an old negro man with an express wagon to hire and we tied the pig in a sack and drove down to the circus grounds i found george b tapley in a little tent with a window flap open he was a fattish man with an immediate eye in a black skull cap with a four ounce diamond screwed into the bosom of his red sweater are you george b tapley i asks i swear it says he well i ve got it says i designate says he are you the guinea pigs for the asiatic python or the alfalfa for the sacred buffalo neither says i i ve got beppo the educated hog in a sack in that wagon i found him rooting up the flowers in my front yard this morning i ll take the five thousand dollars in large bills if it s handy george b hustles out of his tent and asks me to follow we went into one of the side shows in there was a jet black pig with a pink ribbon around his neck lying on some hay and eating carrots that a man was feeding to him hey mac calls g b nothing wrong with the world wide this morning is there him no says the man he s got an appetite like a chorus girl at a m how d you get this pipe says tapley to me eating too many pork chops last night i pulls out the paper and shows him the ad fake says he don t know anything about it you ve beheld with your own eyes the marvelous world wide porcine wonder of the four footed kingdom eating with preternatural sagacity his matutinal meal unstrayed and unstole good morning i was beginning to see i got in the wagon and told uncle ned to drive to the most adjacent orifice of the nearest alley there i took out my pig got the range carefully for the other opening set his sights and gave him such a kick that he went out the other end of the alley twenty feet ahead of his squeal then i paid uncle ned his fifty cents and walked down to the newspaper office i wanted to hear it in cold syllables i got the advertising man to his window to decide a bet says i wasn t the man who had this ad put in last night short and fat with long black whiskers and a club foot he was not says the man he would measure about six feet by four and a half inches with corn silk hair and dressed like the pansies of the conservatory at dinner time i went back to mrs peevy s shall i keep some soup hot for mr tatum till he comes back she asks if you do ma am says i you ll more than exhaust for firewood all the coal in the bosom of the earth and all the forests on the outside of it so there you see said jefferson peters in conclusion how hard it is ever to find a fair minded and honest business partner but i began with the freedom of long acquaintance the rule should work both ways if you had offered to divide the reward you would not have lost jeff s look of dignified reproach stopped me that don t involve the same principles at all said he mine was a legitimate and moral attempt at speculation buy low and sell high don t wall street endorse it bulls and bears and pigs what s the difference why not bristles as well as horns and fur options the rose of dixie when the rose of dixie magazine was started by a stock company in toombs city georgia there was never but one candidate for its chief editorial position in the minds of its owners col aquila telfair was the man for the place by all the rights of learning family reputation and southern traditions he was its foreordained fit and logical editor so a committee of the patriotic georgia citizens who had subscribed the founding fund of called upon colonel telfair at his residence cedar heights fearful lest the enterprise and the south should suffer by his possible refusal the colonel received them in his great library where he spent most of his days the library had descended to him from his father it contained ten thousand volumes some of which had been published as late as the year when the deputation arrived colonel telfair was seated at his massive white pine centre table reading burton s anatomy of melancholy he arose and shook hands punctiliously with each member of the committee if you were familiar with the rose of dixie you will remember the colonel s portrait which appeared in it from time to time you could not forget the long carefully brushed white hair the hooked high bridged nose slightly twisted to the left the keen eyes under the still black eyebrows the classic mouth beneath the drooping white mustache slightly frazzled at the ends the committee solicitously offered him the position of managing editor humbly presenting an outline of the field that the publication was designed to cover and mentioning a comfortable salary the colonel s lands were growing poorer each year and were much cut up by red gullies besides the honor was not one to be refused in a forty minute speech of acceptance colonel telfair gave an outline of english literature from chaucer to macaulay re fought the battle of chancellorsville and said that god helping him he would so conduct the rose of dixie that its fragrance and beauty would permeate the entire world hurling back into the teeth of the northern minions their belief that no genius or good could exist in the brains and hearts of the people whose property they had destroyed and whose rights they had curtailed offices for the magazine were partitioned off and furnished in the second floor of the first national bank building and it was for the colonel to cause the rose of dixie to blossom and flourish or to wilt in the balmy air of the land of flowers the staff of assistants and contributors that editor colonel telfair drew about him was a peach it was a whole crate of georgia peaches the first assistant editor tolliver lee fairfax had had a father killed during pickett s charge the second assistant keats unthank was the nephew of one of morgan s raiders the book reviewer jackson rockingham had been the youngest soldier in the confederate army having appeared on the field of battle with a sword in one hand and a milk bottle in the other the art editor roncesvalles sykes was a third cousin to a nephew of jefferson davis miss lavinia terhune the colonel s stenographer and typewriter had an aunt who had once been kissed by stonewall jackson tommy webster the head office boy got his job by having recited father ryan s poems complete at the commencement exercises of the toombs city high school the girls who wrapped and addressed the magazines were members of old southern families in reduced circumstances the cashier was a scrub named hawkins from ann arbor michigan who had recommendations and a bond from a guarantee company filed with the owners even georgia stock companies sometimes realize that it takes live ones to bury the dead well sir if you believe me the rose of dixie blossomed five times before anybody heard of it except the people who buy their hooks and eyes in toombs city then hawkins climbed off his stool and told on em to the stock company even in ann arbor he had been used to having his business propositions heard of at least as far away as detroit so an advertising manager was engaged beauregard fitzhugh banks a young man in a lavender necktie whose grandfather had been the exalted high pillow slip of the kuklux klan in spite of which the rose of dixie kept coming out every month although in every issue it ran photos of either the taj mahal or the luxembourg gardens or carmencita or la follette a certain number of people bought it and subscribed for it as a boom for it editor colonel telfair ran three different views of andrew jackson s old home the hermitage a full page engraving of the second battle of manassas entitled lee to the rear and a five thousand word biography of belle boyd in the same number the subscription list that month advanced also there were poems in the same issue by leonina vashti haricot pen name related to the haricots of charleston south carolina and bill thompson nephew of one of the stockholders and an article from a special society correspondent describing a tea party given by the swell boston and english set where a lot of tea was spilled overboard by some of the guests masquerading as indians one day a person whose breath would easily cloud a mirror he was so much alive entered the office of the rose of dixie he was a man about the size of a real estate agent with a self tied tie and a manner that he must have borrowed conjointly from w j bryan hackenschmidt and hetty green he was shown into the editor colonel s pons asinorum colonel telfair rose and began a prince albert bow i m thacker said the intruder taking the editor s chair t t thacker of new york he dribbled hastily upon the colonel s desk some cards a bulky manila envelope and a letter from the owners of the rose of dixie this letter introduced mr thacker and politely requested colonel telfair to give him a conference and whatever information about the magazine he might desire i ve been corresponding with the secretary of the magazine owners for some time said thacker briskly i m a practical magazine man myself and a circulation booster as good as any if i do say it i ll guarantee an increase of anywhere from ten thousand to a hundred thousand a year for any publication that isn t printed in a dead language i ve had my eye on the rose of dixie ever since it started i know every end of the business from editing to setting up the classified ads now i ve come down here to put a good bunch of money in the magazine if i can see my way clear it ought to be made to pay the secretary tells me it s losing money i don t see why a magazine in the south if it s properly handled shouldn t get a good circulation in the north too colonel telfair leaned back in his chair and polished his gold rimmed glasses mr thacker said he courteously but firmly the rose of dixie is a publication devoted to the fostering and the voicing of southern genius its watchword which you may have seen on the cover is of for and by the south but you wouldn t object to a northern circulation would you asked thacker i suppose said the editor colonel that it is customary to open the circulation lists to all i do not know i have nothing to do with the business affairs of the magazine i was called upon to assume editorial control of it and i have devoted to its conduct such poor literary talents as i may possess and whatever store of erudition i may have acquired sure said thacker but a dollar is a dollar anywhere north south or west whether you re buying codfish goober peas or rocky ford cantaloupes now i ve been looking over your november number i see one here on your desk you don t mind running over it with me well your leading article is all right a good write up of the cotton belt with plenty of photographs is a winner any time new york is always interested in the cotton crop and this sensational account of hatfield mccoy feud by a schoolmate of a niece of the governor of kentucky isn t such a bad idea it happened so long ago that most people have forgotten it now here s a poem three pages long called the tyrant s foot by lorella lascelles i ve pawed around a good deal over manuscripts but i never saw her name on a rejection slip miss lascelles said the editor is one of our most widely recognized southern poetesses she is closely related to the alabama lascelles family and made with her own hands the silken confederate banner that was presented to the governor of that state at his inauguration but why persisted thacker is the poem illustrated with a view of the m railroad freight depot at tuscaloosa the illustration said the colonel with dignity shows a corner of the fence surrounding the old homestead where miss lascelles was born all right said thacker i read the poem but i couldn t tell whether it was about the depot of the battle of bull run now here s a short story called rosies temptation by fosdyke piggott it s rotten what is a piggott anyway mr piggott said the editor is a brother of the principal stockholder of the magazine all s right with the world piggott passes said thacker well this article on arctic exploration and the one on tarpon fishing might go but how about this write up of the atlanta new orleans nashville and savannah breweries it seems to consist mainly of statistics about their output and the quality of their beer what s the chip over the bug if i understand your figurative language answered colonel telfair it is this the article you refer to was handed to me by the owners of the magazine with instructions to publish it the literary quality of it did not appeal to me but in a measure i feel impelled to conform in certain matters to the wishes of the gentlemen who are interested in the financial side of the rose i see said thacker next we have two pages of selections from lalla rookh by thomas moore now what federal prison did moore escape from or what s the name of the f f v family that he carries as a handicap moore was an irish poet who died in said colonel telfair pityingly he is a classic i have been thinking of reprinting his translation of anacreon serially in the magazine look out for the copyright laws said thacker flippantly who s bessie belleclair who contributes the essay on the newly completed water works plant in milledgeville the name sir said colonel telfair is the nom de guerre of miss elvira simpkins i have not the honor of knowing the lady but her contribution was sent to us by congressman brower of her native state congressman brower s mother was related to the polks of tennessee now see here colonel said thacker throwing down the magazine this won t do you can t successfully run a magazine for one particular section of the country you ve got to make a universal appeal look how the northern publications have catered to the south and encouraged the southern writers and you ve got to go far and wide for your contributors you ve got to buy stuff according to its quality without any regard to the pedigree of the author now i ll bet a quart of ink that this southern parlor organ you ve been running has never played a note that originated about mason hamlin s line am i right i have carefully and conscientiously rejected all contributions from that section of the country if i understand your figurative language aright replied the colonel all right now i ll show you something thacker reached for his thick manila envelope and dumped a mass of typewritten manuscript on the editors desk here s some truck said he that i paid cash for and brought along with me one by one he folded back the manuscripts and showed their first pages to the colonel here are four short stories four of the highest priced authors in the united states three of em living in new york and one commuting there s a special article on vienna bred society by tom vampson here s an italian serial by captain jack no it s the other crawford here are three separate exposes of city governments by sniffings and here s a dandy entitled what women carry in dress suit cases a chicago newspaper woman hired herself out for five years as a lady s maid to get that information and here s a synopsis of preceding chapters of hall caine s new serial to appear next june and here s a couple of pounds of vers de societe that i got at a rate from the clever magazines that s the stuff that people everywhere want and now here s a writeup with photographs at the ages of four twelve twenty two and thirty of george b mcclellan it s a prognostication he s bound to be elected mayor of new york it make a big hit all over the country he i beg your pardon said colonel telfair stiffening in his chair what was the name oh i see said thacker with half a grin yes he s a son of the general we ll pass that manuscript up but if you ll excuse me colonel it s a magazine we re trying to make go off not the first gun at fort sumter now here s a thing that s bound to get next to you it s an original poem by james whitcomb riley j w himself you know what that means to a magazine i won t tell you what i had to pay for that poem but i ll tell you this riley can make more money writing with a fountain pen than you or i can with one that lets the ink run i ll read you the last two stanzas pa lays around n loafs all day n reads and makes us leave him be he lets me do just like i please n when i m in bad he laughs at me n when i holler loud n say bad words n then begin to tease the cat n pa just smiles ma s mad n gives me jesse crost her knees i always wondered why that wuz i guess it s cause pa never does n after all the lights are out i m sorry bout it so i creep out of my trundle bed to ma s n say i love her a whole heap n kiss her n i hug her tight n it s too dark to see her eyes but every time i do i know she cries n cries n cries n cries i always wondered why that wuz i guess it s cause pa never does that s the stuff continued thacker what do you think of that i am not unfamiliar with the works of mr riley said the colonel deliberately i believe he lives in indiana for the last ten years i have been somewhat of a literary recluse and am familiar with nearly all the books in the cedar heights library i am also of the opinion that a magazine should contain a certain amount of poetry many of the sweetest singers of the south have already contributed to the pages of the rose of dixie i myself have thought of translating from the original for publication in its pages the works of the great italian poet tasso have you ever drunk from the fountain of this immortal poet s lines mr thacker not even a demi tasso said thacker now let s come to the point colonel telfair i ve already invested some money in this as a flyer that bunch of manuscripts cost me my object was to try a number of them in the next issue i believe you make up less than a month ahead and see what effect it has on the circulation i believe that by printing the best stuff we can get in the north south east or west we can make the magazine go you have there the letter from the owning company asking you to co operate with me in the plan let s chuck out some of this slush that you ve been publishing just because the writers are related to the skoopdoodles of skoopdoodle county are you with me as long as i continue to be the editor of the rose said colonel telfair with dignity i shall be its editor but i desire also to conform to the wishes of its owners if i can do so conscientiously that s the talk said thacker briskly now how much of this stuff i ve brought can we get into the january number we want to begin right away there is yet space in the january number said the editor for about eight thousand words roughly estimated great said thacker it isn t much but it ll give the readers some change from goobers governors and gettysburg i ll leave the selection of the stuff i brought to fill the space to you as it s all good i ve got to run back to new york and i ll be down again in a couple of weeks colonel telfair slowly swung his eye glasses by their broad black ribbon the space in the january number that i referred to said he measuredly has been held open purposely pending a decision that i have not yet made a short time ago a contribution was submitted to the rose of dixie that is one of the most remarkable literary efforts that has ever come under my observation none but a master mind and talent could have produced it it would just fill the space that i have reserved for its possible use thacker looked anxious what kind of stuff is it he asked eight thousand words sounds suspicious the oldest families must have been collaborating is there going to be another secession the author of the article continued the colonel ignoring thacker s allusions is a writer of some reputation he has also distinguished himself in other ways i do not feel at liberty to reveal to you his name at least not until i have decided whether or not to accept his contribution well said thacker nervously is it a continued story or an account of

my office and up there s maine and out that way is california and over there is florida and that s your range til court meets you re in my charge and i take the responsibility you be here when you re wanted thanks tom he said kind of carelessly i was sort of hoping you wouldn t lock me up court meets next monday so if you don t object i ll just loaf around the office until then i ve got one favour to ask if it isn t too much if you d let the kids come out in the yard once in a while and have a romp i d like it why not i answered him they re welcome and so are you and come to my house the same as ever you see mr nettlewick you can t make a friend of a thief but neither can you make a thief of a friend all at once the examiner made no answer at that moment was heard the shrill whistle of a locomotive pulling into the depot that was the train on the little narrow gauge road that struck into san rosario from the south the major cocked his ear and listened for a moment and looked at his watch the narrow gauge was in on time the major continued so bob hung around the office reading the papers and smoking i put another deputy to work in his place and after a while the first excitement of the case wore off one day when we were alone in the office bob came over to where i was sitting he looked sort of grim and blue the same look he used to get when he d been up watching for indians all night or herd riding tom says he it s harder than standing off redskins it s harder than lying in the lava desert forty miles from water but i m going to stick it out to the end you know that s been my style but if you d tip me the smallest kind of a sign if you d just say bob i understand why it would make it lots easier i was surprised i don t know what you mean bob i said of course you know that i d do anything under the sun to help you that i could but you ve got me guessing all right tom was all he said and he went back to his newspaper and lit another cigar it was the night before court met when i found out what he meant i went to bed that night with that same old light headed nervous feeling come back upon me i dropped off to sleep about midnight when i awoke i was standing half dressed in one of the court house corridors bob was holding one of my arms our family doctor the other and alice was shaking me and half crying she had sent for the doctor without my knowing it and when he came they had found me out of bed and missing and had begun a search sleep walking said the doctor all of us went back to the house and the doctor told us some remarkable stories about the strange things people had done while in that condition i was feeling rather chilly after my trip out and as my wife was out of the room at the time i pulled open the door of an old wardrobe that stood in the room and dragged out a big quilt i had seen in there with it tumbled out the bag of money for stealing which bob was to be tried and convicted in the morning how the jumping rattlesnakes did that get there i yelled and all hands must have seen how surprised i was bob knew in a flash you darned old snoozer he said with the old time look on his face i saw you put it there i watched you open the safe and take it out and i followed you i looked through the window and saw you hide it in that wardrobe then you blankety blank flop eared sheep headed coyote what did you say you took it for because said bob simply i didn t know you were asleep i saw him glance toward the door of the room where jack and zilla were and i knew then what it meant to be a man s friend from bob s point of view major tom paused and again directed his glance out of the window he saw some one in the stockmen s national bank reach and draw a yellow shade down the whole length of its plate glass big front window although the position of the sun did not seem to warrant such a defensive movement against its rays nettlewick sat up straight in his chair he had listened patiently but without consuming interest to the major s story it had impressed him as irrelevant to the situation and it could certainly have no effect upon the consequences those western people he thought had an exaggerated sentimentality they were not business like they needed to be protected from their friends evidently the major had concluded and what he had said amounted to nothing may i ask said the examiner if you have anything further to say that bears directly upon the question of those abstracted securities abstracted securities sir major tom turned suddenly in his chair his blue eyes flashing upon the examiner what do you mean sir he drew from his coat pocket a batch of folded papers held together by a rubber band tossed them into nettlewick s hands and rose to his feet you ll find those securities there sir every stock bond and share of em i took them from the notes while you were counting the cash examine and compare them for yourself the major led the

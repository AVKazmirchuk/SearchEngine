his own language that one shall find the most beautiful se oras in the world i have not in my colombia viewed among our beauties one so fair but no it is not for the general falcon to think of beauty it is my country that claims my devotion at the corner of broadway and the little rialto the general became involved the street cars bewildered him and the fender of one upset him against a pushcart laden with oranges a cab driver missed him an inch with a hub and poured barbarous execrations upon his head he scrambled to the sidewalk and skipped again in terror when the whistle of a peanut roaster puffed a hot scream in his ear v algame dios what devil s city is this as the general fluttered out of the streamers of passers like a wounded snipe he was marked simultaneously as game by two hunters one was bully mcguire whose system of sport required the use of a strong arm and the misuse of an eight inch piece of lead pipe the other nimrod of the asphalt was spider kelley a sportsman

arms stands of winchester rifles for the colombian revolutionists he had drafts in his pocket drawn by the cartagena bank on its new york correspondent for at other tables other revolutionists were shouting their political secrets to their fellow plotters but none was as loud as the general he pounded the table he hallooed for some wine he roared to his friend that his errand was a secret one and not to be hinted at to a living soul mr kelley himself was stirred to sympathetic enthusiasm he grasped the general s hand across the table monseer he said earnestly i don t know where this

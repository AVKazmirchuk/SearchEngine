every side of himself except one the side that showed the manager of the rancho de las sombras and a jolly chum who had forgiven and forgotten queerly enough the words of mr bannister s description of her property came into her mind all inclosed within a strong barbed wire fence teddy s fenced too said octavia to herself it was not difficult for her to reason out the cause of his fortifications it had originated one night at the hammersmiths ball it occurred at a time soon after she had decided to accept colonel beaupree and his million which was no more than her looks and the entr e she held to the inner circles were worth teddy had proposed with all his impetuosity and fire and she looked him straight in the eyes an said coldly and finally never let me hear any such silly nonsense from you again you won t said teddy with an expression around his mouth and now teddy was inclosed within a strong barbed wire fence it was on this first ride of inspection that teddy was seized by the inspiration that suggested the name of mother goose s heroine and he at once bestowed it upon octavia the idea supported by both a similarity of names and identity of occupations seemed to strike him as a peculiarly happy one and he never tired of using it the mexicans on the ranch also took up the name adding another syllable to accommodate their lingual incapacity for the final p gravely referring to her as la madama bo peepy eventually it spread and madame bo peep s ranch was as often mentioned as the rancho de las sombras came the long hot season from may to september when work is scarce on the ranches octavia passed the days in a kind of lotus eater s dream books hammocks correspondence with a few intimate friends a renewed interest in her old water colour box and easel these disposed of the sultry hours of daylight the evenings were always sure to bring enjoyment best of all were the rapturous horseback rides with teddy when the moon gave light over the wind swept leagues chaperoned by the wheeling night hawk and the startled owl often the mexicans would come up from their shacks with their guitars and sing the weirdest of heart breaking songs there were long cosy chats on the breezy gallery and an interminable warfare of wits between teddy and mrs macintyre whose abundant scotch shrewdness often more than overmatched the lighter humour in which she was lacking and the nights came one after another and were filed away by weeks and months nights soft and languorous and fragrant that should have driven strephon to chloe over wires however barbed that might have drawn cupid himself to hunt lasso in hand among those amorous pastures but teddy kept his fences up one july night madame bo peep and her ranch man ager were sitting on the east gallerv teddy had been exhausting the science of prognostication as to the proba bilities of a price of twenty four cents for the autumn clip and had then subsided into an anesthetic cloud of havana smoke only as incompetent a judge as a woman would have failed to note long ago that at least a third of his salary must have gone up in the fumes of those imported regalias teddy said octavia suddenly and rather sharply what are you working down here on a ranch for one hundred per said teddy glibly and found i ve a good mind to discharge you can t do it said teddy with a grin why not demanded octavia with argumentative heat under contract terms of sale respect all unexpired contracts mine runs until p m december thirty first you might get up at midnight on that date and fire me if you try it sooner i ll be in a position to bring legal proceedings octavia seemed to be considering the prospects of litigation but continued teddy cheerfully i ve been think ing of resigning anyway octavia s rocking chair ceased its motion there were centipedes in this country she felt sure and indians and vast lonely desolate empty wastes all within strong barbed wire fence there was a van dresser pride but there was also a van dresser heart she must know for certain whether or not he had forgotten ah well teddy she said with a fine assumption of polite interest it s lonely down here you re longing to get back to the old life to polo and lobsters and theatres and balls never cared much for balls said teddy virtuously you re getting old teddy your memory is failing nobody ever knew you to miss a dance unless it occurred on the same night with another one which you attended and you showed such shocking bad taste too in dancing too often with the same partner let me see what was that forbes girl s name the one with wall eyes mabel wasn t it no ad le mabel was the one with the bony elbows that wasn t wall in ad le s eyes it was soul we used to talk sonnets together and verlaine just then i was trying to run a pipe from the pierian spring you were on the floor with her said octavia unde flected five times at the hammersmiths hammersmiths what questioned teddy vacuously ball ball said octavia viciously what were we talking of eyes i thought said teddy after some reflection and elbows those hammersmiths went on octavia in her sweetest society prattle after subduing an intense desire to yank a handful of sunburnt sandy hair from the head lying back contentedly against the canvas of the steamer chair had too much money mines wasn t it it was something that paid something to the ton you couldn t get a glass of plain water in their house everything at that ball was dreadfully overdone it was said teddy such a crowd there was octavia continued con scious that she was talking the rapid drivel of a school girl describing her first dance the balconies were as warm as the rooms i lost something at that ball the last sentence was uttered in a tone calculated to remove the barbs from miles of wire so did i confessed teddy in a lower voice a glove said octavia falling back as the enemy approached her ditches caste said teddy halting his firing line without loss i hobnobbed half the evening with one of hammersmith s miners a fellow who kept his hands in his pockets and talked like an archangel about reduction plants and drifts and levels and sluice boxes a pearl gray glove nearly new sighed octavia mournfully a bang up chap that mcardle maintained teddy approvingly a man who hated olives and elevators a man who handled mountains as croquettes and built tunnels in the air a man who never uttered a word of silly nonsense in his life did you sign those lease renewal applications yet madama they ve got to be on file in the land office by the thirty first teddy turned his head lazily octavia s chair was vacant a certain centipede crawling along the lines marked out by fate expounded the situation it was early one morning while octavia and mrs maclntyre were trim ming the honeysuckle on the west gallery teddy had risen and departed hastily before daylight in response to word that a flock of ewes had been scattered from their bedding ground during the night by a thunder storm the centipede driven by destiny showed himself on the floor of the gallery and then the screeches of the two women giving him his cue he scuttled with all his yellow legs through the open door into the furthermost west room which was teddy s arming themselves with domestic utensils selected with regard to their length octavia and mrs maclntyre with much clutching of skirts and skirmishing for the position of rear guard in the attacking force followed once outside the centipede seemed to have disappeared and his prospective murderers began a thorough but cautious search for their victim even in the midst of such a dangerous and absorbing adventure octavia was conscious of an awed curiosity on finding herself in teddy s sanctum in that room he sat alone silently communing with those secret thoughts that he now shared with no one dreamed there whatever dreams he now called on no one to interpret it was the room of a spartan or a soldier in one corner stood a wide canvas covered cot in another a small bookcase in another a grim stand of winchesters and shotguns an immense table strewn with letters papers and documents and surmounted by a set of pigeon holes occupied one side the centipede showed genius in concealing himself in such bare quarters mrs maclntyre was poking a broom handle behind the bookcase octavia approached teddy s cot the room was just as the manager had left it in his hurry the mexican maid had not yet given it her attention there was his big pillow with the imprint of his head still in the centre she thought the horrid beast might have climbed the cot and hidden itself to bite teddy centipedes were thus cruel and vindictive toward managers she cautiously overturned the pillow and then parted her lips to give the signal for reinforcements at sight of a long slender dark object lying there but repressing it in time she caught up a glove a pearl gray glove flattened it might be conceived by many many months of nightly pressure beneath the pillow of the man who had forgotten the hammersmiths ball teddy must have left so hurriedly that morning that he had for once forgotten to transfer it to its resting place by day even managers who are notoriously wily and cunning are sometimes caught up with octavia slid the gray glove into the bosom of her sum mery morning gown it was hers men who put them selves within a strong barbed wire fence and remember hammersmith balls only by the talk of miners about sluice boxes should not be allowed to possess such articles after all what a paradise this prairie country was how it blossomed like the rose when you found things that were thought to be lost how delicious was that morning breeze coming in the windows fresh and sweet with the breath of the yellow ratama blooms might one not stand for a minute with shining far gazing eyes and dream that mistakes might be corrected why was mrs maclntyre poking about so absurdly with a broom i ve found it said mrs macintyre banging the door here it is did you lose something asked octavia with sweetly polite non interest the little devil said mrs maclntyre driven to violence ye ve no forgotten him alretty between them they slew the centipede thus was he rewarded for his agency toward the recovery of things lost at the hammersmiths ball it seems that teddy in due course remembered the glove and when he returned to the house at sunset made a secret but exhaustive search for it not until evening upon the moonlit eastern gallery did he find it it was upon the hand that he had thought lost to him forever and so he was moved to repeat certain nonsense that he had been commanded never never to utter again teddy s fences were down this time there was no ambition to stand in the way and the wooing was as natural and successful as should be between ardent shepherd and gentle shepherdess the prairies changed to a garden the rancho de las sombras became the ranch of light a few days later octavia received a letter from mr bannister in reply to one she had written to him asking some questions about her business a portion of the letter ran as follows i am at a loss to account for your references to the sheep ranch two months after your departure to take up your residence upon it it was discovered that colonel beaupree s title was worthless a deed came to light showing that he disposed of the property before his death the matter was reported to your manager mr westlake who at once repurchad the property it is entirely beyond my powers of conjecture to imagine how you have remained in ignorance of this fact i beg you that will at once confer with that gentleman who will at least corroborate my statement octavia sought teddy with battle in her eye what are you working on this ranch for she asked once more one hundred he began to repeat but saw in her face that she knew she held mr bannister s letter in her hand he knew that the game was up it s my ranch said teddy like a schoolboy detected in evil it s a mighty poor manager that isn t able to absorb the boss s business if you give him time why were you working down here pursued octavia still struggling after the key to the riddle of teddy to tell the truth tave said teddy with quiet candour it wasn t for the salary that about kept me in cigars and sunburn lotions i was sent south by my doctor twas that right lung that was going to the bad on account of over exercise and strain at polo and gym nastics i needed climate and ozone and rest and things of that sort in an instant octavia was close against the vicinity of the affected organ mr bannister s letter fluttered to the floor it s it s well now isn t it teddy sound as a mesquite chunk i deceived you in one thing i paid fifty thousand for your ranch as soon as i found you had no title i had just about that much income accumulated at my banker s while i ve been herding sheep down here so it was almost like picking the thing up on a bargain counter for a penny there s another little surplus of unearned increment piling up there tave i ve been thinking of a wedding trip in a yacht with white ribbons tied to the mast through the mediterranean and then up among the hebrides and down norway to the zuyder zee and i was thinking said octavia softly of a wedding gallop with my manager among the flocks of sheep and back to a wedding breakfast with mrs mae intyre on the gallery with maybe a sprig of orange blossom fastened to the red jar above the table teddy laughed and began to chant little bo peep has lost her sheep and doesn t know where to find em let em alone and they ll come home and octavia drew his head down and whispered in his ear but that is one of the tales they brought behind them the end royallib ru http royallib ru http

not baldy s story he poured out a third drink that was larger by a finger than the first and second baldy was in consultation and the consultee is worthy of his hire i d be king if i was you said baldy so positively that his holster creaked and his spurs rattled webb yeager pushed back his flat brimmed stetson and made further disorder in his straw coloured hair the tonsorial recourse being without avail he followed the liquid example of the more resourceful baldy if a man marries a queen it oughtn t to make him a two spot declared webb epitomising his grievances sure not said baldy sympathetic still thirsty and genuinely solicitous concerning the relative value of the cards by rights you re a king if i was you i d call for a new deal the cards have been stacked on you i ll tell you what you are webb yeager what asked webb with a hopeful look in his pale blue eyes you re a prince consort go easy said webb i never blackguarded you none it s a title explained baldy up among the picture cards but it don t take no tricks i ll tell you webb it s a brand they re got for certain animals in europe say that you or me or one of them dutch dukes marries in a royal family well by and by our wife gets to be queen are we king not in a million years at the coronation ceremonies we march between little casino and the ninth grand custodian of the royal hall bedchamber the only use we are is to appear in photographs and accept the responsibility for the heir apparent that ain t any square deal yes sir webb you re a prince consort and if i was you i d start a interregnum or a habeus corpus or somethin and i d be king if i had to turn from the bottom of the deck baldy emptied his glass to the ratification of his warwick pose baldy said webb solemnly me and you punched cows in the same outfit for years we been runnin on the same range and ridin the same trails since we was boys i wouldn t talk about my family affairs to nobody but you you was line rider on the nopalito ranch when i married santa mcallister i was foreman then but what am i now i don t amount to a knot in a stake rope when old mcallister was the cattle king of west texas continued baldy with satanic sweetness you was some tallow you had as much to say on the ranch as he did i did admitted webb up to the time he found out i was tryin to get my rope over santa s head then he kept me out on the range as far from the ranch house as he could when the old man died they commenced to call santa the cattle queen i m boss of the cattle that s all she tends to all the business she handles all the money i can t sell even a beef steer to a party of campers myself santa s the queen and i m mr nobody i d be king if i was you repeated baldy woods the royalist when a man marries a queen he ought to grade up with her on the hoof dressed dried corned any old way from the chaparral to the packing house lots of folks thinks it s funny webb that you don t have the say so on the nopalito i ain t reflectin none on miz yeager she s the finest little lady between the rio grande and next christmas but a man ought to be boss of his own camp the smooth brown face of yeager lengthened to a mask of wounded melancholy with that expression and his rumpled yellow hair and guileless blue eyes he might have been likened to a schoolboy whose leadership had been usurped by a youngster of superior strength but his active and sinewy seventy two inches and his girded revolvers forbade the comparison what was that you called me baldy he asked what kind of a concert was it a consort corrected baldy a prince consort it s a kind of short card pseudonym you come in sort of between jack high and a four card flush webb yeager sighed and gathered the strap of his winchester scabbard from the floor i m ridin back to the ranch to day he said half heartedly i ve got to start a bunch of beeves for san antone in the morning i m your company as far as dry lake announced baldy i ve got a round up camp on the san marcos cuttin out two year olds the two companeros mounted their ponies and trotted away from the little railroad settlement where they had foregathered in the thirsty morning at dry lake where their routes diverged they reined up for a parting cigarette for miles they had ridden in silence save for the soft drum of the ponies hoofs on the matted mesquite grass and the rattle of the chaparral against their wooden stirrups but in texas discourse is seldom continuous you may fill in a mile a meal and a murder between your paragraphs without detriment to your thesis so without apology webb offered an addendum to the conversation that had begun ten miles away you remember yourself baldy that there was a time when santa wasn t quite so independent you remember the days when old mcallister was keepin us apart and how she used to send me the sign that she wanted to see me old man mac promised to make me look like a colander if i ever come in gun shot of the ranch you remember the sign she used to send baldy the heart with a cross inside of it me cried baldy with intoxicated archness you old sugar stealing coyote don t i remember why you dad blamed old long horned turtle dove the boys in camp was all cognoscious about them hiroglyphs the gizzard and crossbones we used to call it we used to see em on truck that was sent out from the ranch they was marked in charcoal on the sacks of flour and in lead pencil on the newspapers i see one of em once chalked on the back of a new cook that old man mcallister sent out from the ranch danged if i didn t santa s father explained webb gently got her to promise that she wouldn t write to me or send me any word that heart and cross sign was her scheme whenever she wanted to see me in particular she managed to put that mark on somethin at the ranch that she knew i d see and i never laid eyes on it but what i burnt the wind for the ranch the same night i used to see her in that coma mott back of the little horse corral we knowed it chanted baldy but we never let on we was all for you we knowed why you always kept that fast paint in camp and when we see that gizzard and crossbones figured out on the truck from the ranch we knowed old pinto was goin to eat up miles that night instead of grass you remember scurry that educated horse wrangler we had the college fellow that tangle foot drove to the range whenever scurry saw that come meet your honey brand on anything from the ranch he d wave his hand like that and say our friend lee andrews will again swim the hell s point to night the last time santa sent me the sign said webb was once when she was sick i noticed it as soon as i hit camp and i galloped pinto forty mile that night she wasn t at the coma mott i went to the house and old mcallister met me at the door did you come here to get killed says he i ll disoblige you for once i just started a mexican to bring you santa wants you go in that room and see her and then come out here and see me santa was lyin in bed pretty sick but she gives out a kind of a smile and her hand and mine lock horns and i sets down by the bed mud and spurs and chaps and all i ve heard you ridin across the grass for hours webb she says i was sure you d come you saw the sign she whispers the minute i hit camp says i twas marked on the bag of potatoes and onions they re always together says she soft like always together in life they go well together i says in a stew i mean hearts and crosses says santa our sign to love and to suffer that s what they mean and there was old doc musgrove amusin himself with whisky and a palm leaf fan and by and by santa goes to sleep and doc feels her forehead and he says to me you re not such a bad febrifuge but you d better slide out now for the diagnosis don t call for you in regular doses the little lady ll be all right when she wakes up i seen old mcallister outside she s asleep says i and now you can start in with your colander work take your time for i left my gun on my saddle horn old mac laughs and he says to me pumpin lead into the best ranch boss in west texas don t seem to me good business policy i don t know where i could get as good a one it s the son in law idea webb that makes me admire for to use you as a target you ain t my idea for a member of the family but i can use you on the nopalito if you ll keep outside of a radius with the ranch house in the middle of it you go upstairs and lay down on a cot and when you get some sleep we ll talk it over baldy woods pulled down his hat and uncurled his leg from his saddle horn webb shortened his rein and his pony danced anxious to be off the two men shook hands with western ceremony adios baldy said webb i m glad i seen you and had this talk with a pounding rush that sounded like the rise of a covey of quail the riders sped away toward different points of the compass a hundred yards on his route baldy reined in on the top of a bare knoll and emitted a yell he swayed on his horse had he been on foot the earth would have risen and conquered him but in the saddle he was a master of equilibrium and laughed at whisky and despised the centre of gravity webb turned in his saddle at the signal if i was you came baldy s strident and perverting tones i d be king at eight o clock on the following morning bud turner rolled from his saddle in front of the nopalito ranch house and stumbled with whizzing rowels toward the gallery bud was in charge of the bunch of beef cattle that was to strike the trail that morning for san antonio mrs yeager was on the gallery watering a cluster of hyacinths growing in a red earthenware jar king mcallister had bequeathed to his daughter many of his strong characteristics his resolution his gay courage his contumacious self reliance his pride as a reigning monarch of hoofs and horns allegro and fortissimo had been mcallister s temp and tone in santa they survived transposed to the feminine key substantially she preserved the image of the mother who had been summoned to wander in other and less finite green pastures long before the waxing herds of kine had conferred royalty upon the house she had her mother s slim strong figure and grave soft prettiness that relieved in her the severity of the imperious mcallister eye and the mcallister air of royal independence webb stood on one end of the gallery giving orders to two or three sub bosses of various camps and outfits who had ridden in for instructions morning said bud briefly where do you want them beeves to go in town to barber s as usual now to answer that had been the prerogative of the queen all the reins of business buying selling and banking had been held by her capable fingers the handling of cattle had been entrusted fully to her husband in the days of king mcallister santa had been his secretary and helper and she had continued her work with wisdom and profit but before she could reply the prince consort spake up with calm decision you drive that bunch to zimmerman and nesbit s pens i spoke to zimmerman about it some time ago bud turned on his high boot heels wait called santa quickly she looked at her husband with surprise in her steady gray eyes why what do you mean webb she asked with a small wrinkle gathering between her brows i never deal with zimmerman and nesbit barber has handled every head of stock from this ranch in that market for five years i m not going to take the business out of his hands she faced bud turner deliver those cattle to barber she concluded positively bud gazed impartially at the water jar hanging on the gallery stood on his other leg and chewed a mesquite leaf i want this bunch of beeves to go to zimmerman and nesbit said webb with a frosty light in his blue eyes nonsense said santa impatiently you d better start on bud so as to noon at the little elm water hole tell barber we ll have another lot of culls ready in about a month bud allowed a hesitating eye to steal upward and meet webb s webb saw apology in his look and fancied he saw commiseration you deliver them cattle he said grimly to barber finished santa sharply let that settle it is there anything else you are waiting for bud no m m said bud but before going he lingered while a cow s tail could have switched thrice for man is man s ally and even the philistines must have blushed when they took samson in the way they did you hear your boss cried webb sardonically he took off his hat and bowed until it touched the floor before his wife webb said santa rebukingly you re acting mighty foolish to day court fool your majesty said webb in his slow tones which had changed their quality what else can you expect let me tell you i was a man before i married a cattle queen what am i now the laughing stock of the camps i ll be a man again santa looked at him closely don t be unreasonable webb she said calmly you haven t been slighted in any way do i ever interfere in your management of the cattle i know the business side of the ranch much better than you do i learned it from dad be sensible kingdoms and queendoms said webb don t suit me unless i am in the pictures too i punch the cattle and you wear the crown all right i d rather be high lord chancellor of a cow camp than the eight spot in a queen high flush it s your ranch and barber gets the beeves webb s horse was tied to the rack he walked into the house and brought out his roll of blankets that he never took with him except on long rides and his slicker and his longest stake rope of plaited raw hide these he began to tie deliberately upon his saddle santa a little pale followed him webb swung up into the saddle his serious smooth face was without expression except for a stubborn light that smouldered in his eyes there s a herd of cows and calves said he near the hondo water hole on the frio that ought to be moved away from timber lobos have killed three of the calves i forgot to leave orders you d better tell simms to attend to it santa laid a hand on the horse s bridle and looked her husband in the eye are you going to leave me webb she asked quietly i am going to be a man again he answered i wish you success in a praiseworthy attempt she said with a sudden coldness she turned and walked directly into the house webb yeager rode to the southeast as straight as the topography of west texas permitted and when he reached the horizon he might have ridden on into blue space as far as knowledge of him on the nopalito went and the days with sundays at their head formed into hebdomadal squads and the weeks captained by the full moon closed ranks into menstrual companies crying tempus fugit on their banners and the months marched on toward the vast camp ground of the years but webb yeager came no more to the dominions of his queen one day a being named bartholomew a sheep man and therefore of little account from the lower rio grande country rode in sight of the nopalito ranch house and felt hunger assail him ex consuetudine he was soon seated at the mid day dining table of that hospitable kingdom talk like water gushed from him he might have been smitten with aaron s rod that is your gentle shepherd when an audience is vouchsafed him whose ears are not overgrown with wool missis yeager he babbled i see a man the other day on the rancho seco down in hidalgo county by your name webb yeager was his he d just been engaged as manager he was a tall light haired man not saying much perhaps he was some kin of yours do you think a husband said santa cordially the seco has done well mr yeager is one of the best stockmen in the west the dropping out of a prince consort rarely disorganises a monarchy queen santa had appointed as mayordomo of the ranch a trusty subject named ramsay who had been one of her father s faithful vassals and there was scarcely a ripple on the nopalito ranch save when the gulf breeze created undulations in the grass of its wide acres for several years the nopalito had been making experiments with an english breed of cattle that looked down with aristocratic contempt upon the texas long horns the experiments were found satisfactory and a pasture had been set aside for the blue bloods the fame of them had gone forth into the chaparral and pear as far as men ride in saddles other ranches woke up rubbed their eyes and looked with new dissatisfaction upon the long horns as a consequence one day a sunburned capable silk kerchiefed nonchalant youth garnished with revolvers and attended by three mexican vaqueros alighted at the nopalito ranch and presented the following business like epistle to the queen thereof mrs yeager the nopalito ranch dear madam i am instructed by the owners of the rancho seco to purchase head of two and three year old cows of the sussex breed owned by you if you can fill the order please deliver the cattle to the bearer and a check will be forwarded to you at once respectfully webster yeager manager the rancho seco business is business even very scantily did it escape being written especially in a kingdom that night the head of cattle were driven up from the pasture and penned in a corral near the ranch house for delivery in the morning when night closed down and the house was still did santa yeager throw herself down clasping that formal note to her bosom weeping and calling out a name that pride either in one or the other had kept from her lips many a day or did she file the letter in her business way retaining her royal balance and strength wonder if you will but royalty is sacred and there is a veil but this much you shall learn at midnight santa slipped softly out of the ranch house clothed in something dark and plain she paused for a moment under the live oak trees the prairies were somewhat dim and the moonlight was pale orange diluted with particles of an impalpable flying mist but the mock bird whistled on every bough of vantage leagues of flowers scented the air and a kindergarten of little shadowy rabbits leaped and played in an open space near by santa turned her face to the southeast and threw three kisses thitherward for there was none to see then she sped silently to the blacksmith shop fifty yards away and what she did there can only be surmised but the forge glowed red and there was a faint hammering such as cupid might make when he sharpens his arrow points later she came forth with a queer shaped handled thing in one hand and a portable furnace such as are seen in branding camps in the other to the corral where the sussex cattle were penned she sped with these things swiftly in the moonlight she opened the gate and slipped inside the corral the sussex cattle were mostly a dark red but among this bunch was one that was milky white notable among the others and now santa shook from her shoulder something that we had not seen before a rope lasso she freed the loop of it coiling the length in her left hand and plunged into the thick of the cattle the white cow was her object she swung the lasso which caught one horn and slipped off the next throw encircled the forefeet and the animal fell heavily santa made for it like a panther but it scrambled up and dashed against her knocking her over like a blade of grass again she made her cast while the aroused cattle milled around the four sides of the corral in a plunging mass this throw was fair the white cow came to earth again and before it could rise santa had made the lasso fast around a post of the corral with a swift and simple knot and had leaped upon the cow again with the rawhide hobbles in one minute the feet of the animal were tied no record breaking deed and santa leaned against the corral for the same space of time panting and lax and then she ran swiftly to her furnace at the gate and brought the branding iron queerly shaped and white hot the bellow of the outraged white cow as the iron was applied should have stirred the slumbering auricular nerves and consciences of the near by subjects of the nopalito but it did not and it was amid the deepest nocturnal silence that santa ran like a lapwing back to the ranch house and there fell upon a cot and sobbed sobbed as though queens had hearts as simple ranchmen s wives have and as though she would gladly make kings of prince consorts should they ride back again from over the hills and far away in the morning the capable revolvered youth and his vaqueros set forth driving the bunch of sussex cattle across the prairies to the rancho seco ninety miles it was a six days journey grazing and watering the animals on the way the beasts arrived at rancho seco one evening at dusk and were received and counted by the foreman of the ranch the next morning at eight o clock a horseman loped out of the brush to the nopalito ranch house he dismounted stiffly and strode with whizzing spurs to the house his horse gave a great sigh and swayed foam streaked with down drooping head and closed eyes but waste not your pity upon belshazzar the flea bitten sorrel to day in nopalito horse pasture he survives pampered beloved unridden cherished record holder of long distance rides the horseman stumbled into the house two arms fell around his neck and someone cried out in the voice of woman and queen alike webb oh webb i was a skunk said webb yeager hush said santa did you see it i saw it said webb what they meant god knows and you shall know if you rightly read the primer of events be the cattle queen said webb and overlook it if you can i was a mangy sheep stealing coyote hush said santa again laying her fingers upon his mouth there s no queen here do you know who i am i am santa yeager first lady of the bedchamber come here she dragged him from the gallery into the room to the right there stood a cradle with an infant in it a red ribald unintelligible babbling beautiful infant sputtering at life in an unseemly manner there s no queen on this ranch said santa again look at the king he s got your eyes webb down on your knees and look at his highness but jingling rowels sounded on the gallery and bud turner stumbled there again with the same query that he had brought lacking a few days a year ago morning them beeves is just turned out on the trail shall i drive em to barber s or he saw webb and stopped open mouthed ba ba ba ba ba ba shrieked the king in his cradle beating the air with his fists you hear your boss bud said webb yeager with a broad grin just as he had said a year ago and that is all except that when old man quinn owner of the rancho seco went out to look over the herd of sussex cattle that he had bought from the nopalito ranch he asked his new manager what s the nopalito ranch brand wilson x bar y said wilson i thought so said quinn but look at that white heifer there she s got another brand a heart with a cross inside of it what brand is that the ransom of mack me and old mack lonsbury we got out of that little hide and seek gold mine affair with about apiece i say old mack but he wasn t old forty one i should say but he always seemed old andy he says to me i m tired of hustling you and me have been working hard together for three years say we knock off for a while and spend some of this idle money we ve coaxed our way the proposition hits me just right says i let s be nabobs for a while and see how it feels what ll we do take in the niagara falls or buck at faro for a good many years says mack i ve thought that if i ever had extravagant money i d rent a two room cabin somewhere hire a chinaman to cook and sit in my stocking feet and read buckle s history of civilisation that sounds self indulgent and gratifying without vulgar ostentation says i and i don t see how money could be better invested give me a cuckoo clock and a sep winner s self instructor for the banjo and i ll join you a week afterwards me and mack hits this small town of pina about thirty miles out from denver and finds an elegant two room house that just suits us we deposited half a peck of money in the pina bank and shook hands with every one of the citizens in the town we brought along the chinaman and the cuckoo clock and buckle and the instructor with us from denver and they made the cabin seem like home at once never believe it when they tell you riches don t bring happiness if you could have seen old mack sitting in his rocking chair with his blue yarn sock feet up in the window and absorbing in that buckle stuff through his specs you d have seen a picture of content that would have made rockefeller jealous and i was learning to pick out old zip coon on the banjo and the cuckoo was on time with his remarks and ah sing was messing up the atmosphere with the handsomest smell of ham and eggs that ever laid the honeysuckle in the shade when it got too dark to make out buckle s nonsense and the notes in the instructor me and mack would light our pipes and talk about science and pearl diving and sciatica and egypt and spelling and fish and trade winds and leather and gratitude and eagles and a lot of subjects that we d never had time to explain our sentiments about before one evening mack spoke up and asked me if i was much apprised in the habits and policies of women folks why yes says i in a tone of voice i know em from alfred to omaha the feminine nature and similitude says i is as plain to my sight as the rocky mountains is to a blue eyed burro i m onto all their little side steps and punctual discrepancies i tell you andy says mack with a kind of sigh i never had the least amount of intersection with their predispositions maybe i might have had a proneness in respect to their vicinity but i never took the time i made my own living since i was fourteen and i never seemed to get my ratiocinations equipped with the sentiments usually depicted toward the sect i sometimes wish i had says old mack they re an adverse study says i and adapted to points of view although they vary in rationale i have found em quite often obviously differing from each other in divergences of contrast it seems to me goes on mack that a man had better take em in and secure his inspirations of the sect when he s young and so preordained i let my chance go by and i guess i m too old now to go hopping into the curriculum oh i don t know i tells him maybe you better credit yourself with a barrel of money and a lot of emancipation from a quantity of uncontent still i don t regret my knowledge of em i says it takes a man who understands the symptoms and by plays of women folks to take care of himself in this world we stayed on in pina because we liked the place some folks might enjoy their money with noise and rapture and locomotion but me and mack we had had plenty of turmoils and hotel towels the people were friendly ah sing got the swing of the grub we liked mack and buckle were as thick as two body snatchers and i was hitting out a cordial resemblance to buffalo gals can t you come out to night on the banjo one day i got a telegram from speight the man that was working on a mine i had an interest in out in new mexico i had to go out there and i was gone two months i was anxious to get back to pina and enjoy life once more when i struck the cabin i nearly fainted mack was standing in the door and if angels ever wept i saw no reason why they should be smiling then that man was a spectacle yes he was worse he was a spyglass he was the great telescope in the lick observatory he had on a coat and shiny shoes and a white vest and a high silk hat and a geranium as big as an order of spinach was spiked onto his front and he was smirking and warping his face like an infernal storekeeper or a kid with colic hello andy says mack out of his face glad to see you back things have happened since you went away i know it says i and a sacrilegious sight it is god never made you that way mack lonsbury why do you scarify his works with this presumptuous kind of ribaldry why andy says he they ve elected me justice of the peace since you left i looked at mack close he was restless and inspired a justice of the peace ought to be disconsolate and assuaged just then a young woman passed on the sidewalk and i saw mack kind of half snicker and blush and then he raised up his hat and smiled and bowed and she smiled and bowed and went on by no hope for you says i if you ve got the mary jane infirmity at your age i thought it wasn t going to take on you and patent leather shoes all this in two little short months i m going to marry the young lady who just passed to night says mack in a kind of flutter i forgot something at the post office says i and walked away quick i overtook that young woman a hundred yards away i raised my hat and told her my name she was about nineteen and young for her age she blushed and then looked at me cool like i was the snow scene from the two orphans i understand you are to be married to night i said correct says she you got any objections listen sissy i begins my name is miss rebosa redd says she in a pained way i know it says i now rebosa i m old enough to have owed money to your father and that old specious dressed up garbled sea sick ptomaine prancing about avidiously like an irremediable turkey gobbler with patent leather shoes on is my best friend why did you go and get him invested in this marriage business why he was the only chance there was answers miss rebosa nay says i giving a sickening look of admiration at her complexion and style of features with your beauty you might pick any kind of a man listen rebosa old mack ain t the man you want he was twenty two when you was n e reed as the papers say this bursting into bloom won t last with him he s all ventilated with oldness and rectitude and decay old mack s down with a case of indian summer he overlooked his bet when he was young and now he s suing nature for the interest on the promissory note he took from cupid instead of the cash rebosa are you bent on having this marriage occur why sure i am says she oscillating the pansies on her hat and so is somebody else i reckon what time is it to take place i asks at six o clock says she i made up my mind right away what to do i d save old mack if i could to have a good seasoned ineligible man like that turn chicken for a girl that hadn t quit eating slate pencils and buttoning in the back was more than i could look on with easiness rebosa says i earnest drawing upon my display of knowledge concerning the feminine intuitions of reason ain t there a young man in pina a nice young man that you think a heap of yep says rebosa nodding her pansies sure there is what do you think gracious does he like you i asks how does he stand in the matter crazy says rebosa ma has to wet down the front steps to keep him from sitting there all the time but i guess that ll be all over after to night she winds up with a sigh rebosa says i you don t really experience any of this adoration called love for old mack do you lord no says the girl shaking her head i think he s as dry as a lava bed the idea who is this young man that you like rebosa i inquires it s eddie bayles says she he clerks in crosby s grocery but he don t make but thirty five a month ella noakes was wild about him once old mack tells me i says that he s going to marry you at six o clock this evening that s the time says she it s to be at our house rebosa says i listen to me if eddie bayles had a thousand dollars cash a thousand dollars mind you would buy him a store of his own if you and eddie had that much to excuse matrimony on would you consent to marry him this evening at five o clock the girl looks at me a minute and i can see these inaudible cogitations going on inside of her as women will a thousand dollars says she of course i would come on says i we ll go and see eddie we went up to crosby s store and called eddie outside he looked to be estimable and freckled and he had chills and fever when i made my proposition at five o clock says he for a thousand dollars please don t wake me up well you are the rich uncle retired from the spice business in india i ll buy out old crosby and run the store myself we went inside and got old man crosby apart and explained it i wrote my check for a thousand dollars and handed it to him if eddie and rebosa married each other at five he was to turn the money over to them and then i gave em my blessing and went to wander in the wildwood for a season i sat on a log and made cogitations on life and old age and the zodiac and the ways of women and all the disorder that goes with a lifetime i passed myself congratulations that i had probably saved my old friend mack from his attack of indian summer i knew when he got well of it and shed his infatuation and his patent leather shoes he would feel grateful to keep old mack disinvolved thinks i from relapses like this is worth more than a thousand dollars and most of all i was glad that i d made a study of women and wasn t to be deceived any by their means of conceit and evolution it must have been half past five when i got back home i stepped in and there sat old mack on the back of his neck in his old clothes with his blue socks on the window and the history of civilisation propped up on his knees this don t look like getting ready for a wedding at six i says to seem innocent oh says mack reaching for his tobacco that was postponed back to five o clock they sent me over a note saying the hour had been changed it s all over now what made you stay away so long andy you heard about the wedding i asks i operated it says he i told you i was justice of the peace the preacher is off east to visit his folks and i m the only one in town that can perform the dispensations of marriage i promised eddie and rebosa a month ago i d marry em he s a busy lad and he ll have a grocery of his own some day he will says i there was lots of women at the wedding says mack smoking up but i didn t seem to get any ideas from em i wish i was informed in the structure of their attainments like you said you was that was two months ago says i reaching up for the banjo telemachus friend returning from a hunting trip i waited at the little town of los pinos in new mexico for the south bound train which was one hour late i sat on the porch of the summit house and discussed the functions of life with telemachus hicks the hotel proprietor perceiving that personalities were not out of order i asked him what species of beast had long ago twisted and mutilated his left ear being a hunter i was concerned in the evils that may befall one in the pursuit of game that ear says hicks is the relic of true friendship an accident i persisted no friendship is an accident said telemachus and i was silent the only perfect case of true friendship i ever knew went on my host was a cordial intent between a connecticut man and a monkey the monkey climbed palms in barranquilla and threw down cocoanuts to the man the man sawed them in two and made dippers which he sold for two reales each and bought rum the monkey drank the milk of the nuts through each being satisfied with his own share of the graft they lived like brothers but in the case of human beings friendship is a transitory art subject to discontinuance without further notice i had a friend once of the entitlement of paisley fish that i imagined was sealed to me for an endless space of time side by side for seven years we had mined ranched sold patent churns herded sheep took photographs and other things built wire fences and picked prunes thinks i neither homocide nor flattery nor riches nor sophistry nor drink can make trouble between me and paisley fish we was friends an amount you could hardly guess at we was friends in business and we let our amicable qualities lap over and season our hours of recreation and folly we certainly had days of damon and nights of pythias one summer me and paisley gallops down into these san andres mountains for the purpose of a month s surcease and levity dressed in the natural store habiliments of man we hit this town of los pinos which certainly was a roof garden spot of the world and flowing with condensed milk and honey it had a street or two and air and hens and a eating house and that was enough for us we strikes the town after supper time and we concludes to sample whatever efficacy there is in this eating house down by the railroad tracks by the time we had set down and pried up our plates with a knife from the red oil cloth along intrudes widow jessup with the hot biscuit and the fried liver now there was a woman that would have tempted an anchovy to forget his vows she was not so small as she was large and a kind of welcome air seemed to mitigate her vicinity the pink of her face was the in hoc signo of a culinary temper and a warm disposition and her smile would have brought out the dogwood blossoms in december widow jessup talks to us a lot of garrulousness about the climate and history and tennyson and prunes and the scarcity of mutton and finally wants to know where we came from spring valley says i big spring valley chips in paisley out of a lot of potatoes and knuckle bone of ham in his mouth that was the first sign i noticed that the old fidus diogenes business between me and paisley fish was ended forever he knew how i hated a talkative person and yet he stampedes into the conversation with his amendments and addendums of syntax on the map it was big spring valley but i had heard paisley himself call it spring valley a thousand times without saying any more we went out after supper and set on the railroad track we had been pardners

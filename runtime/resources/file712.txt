in the bridle paths and burrowing under the grass where the ground was soft enough the likes of head of people successfully battled against the night air in central park alone ye know i live in the elegant furnished apart ment house called the beersheba flats over against the elevated portion of the new york central rail road when the order come to the flats that all hands must turn out and sleep in the park according to the instructions of the consulting committee of the city club and the murphy draying returfing and sod ding company there was a look of a couple of fires and an eviction

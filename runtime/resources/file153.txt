in a gondola in venice on a moonlight night and brag about their drainage canal i ve seen a southerner on being introduced to the king of england hand that monarch without batting his eyes the information that his grandaunt on his mother s side was related by marriage to the perkinses of charleston i knew a new yorker who was kidnapped for ransom by some afghanistan bandits his people sent over the money and he came back to kabul with the agent afghanistan the natives said to him through an interpreter well not so slow do you think oh i don t know says he and he begins to tell them about a cab driver at sixth avenue and broadway those ideas don t suit me i m not tied down to anything that isn t miles in diameter just put me down as e rushmore coglan citizen of the terrestrial sphere my cosmopolite made a large adieu and left me for he thought he saw some one through the chatter and smoke whom he knew so i was left with the would be periwinkle who was reduced to wurzburger without further ability to voice his aspirations to perch melodious upon the summit of a valley i sat reflecting upon my evident cosmopolite and wondering how the poet had managed to miss him he was my discovery and i believed in him how was it the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their cities hem as a child to the mother s gown not so e rushmore coglan with the

resort agents were blowing the air and answers to lawson were growing milder handorgans fountains and pinochle were playing everywhere the windows of mrs murphy s boarding house were open a group of boarders were seated on the high stoop upon round flat mats like german pancakes in one of the second floor front windows mrs mccaskey awaited her husband supper was cooling on the table its heat went

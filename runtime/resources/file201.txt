we expected trouble but there wasn t any the citizens saw that we had em the nearest railroad was thirty miles away and it would be two weeks at least before the river would be fordable so they began to cuss amiable and throw down dollars on the bar till it sounded like a selection on the xylophone there was about grown up adults in bird city that had arrived at years of indiscretion and the majority of em required from three to twenty drinks a day to make life endurable the blue snake was the only place where they could get em till the flood subsided it was beautiful and simple as all truly great swindles are about ten o clock the silver dollars dropping on the bar slowed down to playing two steps and marches instead of jigs but i looked out the window and saw a hundred or two of our customers standing in line at bird city savings and loan co and i knew they were borrowing more money to be sucked in by the clammy tendrils of the octopus at the fashionable hour of noon everybody went home to dinner we told the bartenders to take advantage of the lull and do the same then me and andy counted the receipts we had taken in we calculated that if bird city would only remain an island for two weeks the trust would be able to endow the chicago university with a new dormitory of padded cells for the faculty and present every worthy poor man in texas with a farm provided he furnished the site for it andy was especial inroaded by self esteem at our success the rudiments of the scheme having originated in his own surmises and premonitions he got off the safe and lit the biggest cigar in the house jeff says he i don t suppose that anywhere in the world you could find three cormorants with brighter ideas about down treading the proletariat than the firm of peters satan and tucker incorporated we have sure handed the small consumer a giant blow in the sole apoplectic region no well says i it does look as if we would have to take up gastritis and golf or be measured for kilts in spite of ourselves this little turn in bug juice is verily all to the skibo and i can stand it says i i d rather batten than bant any day andy pours himself out four fingers of our best rye and does with it as was so intended it was the first drink i had ever known him to take by way of liberation says he to the gods and then after thus doing umbrage to the heathen diabetes he drinks another to our success and then he begins to toast the trade beginning with raisuli and the northern pacific and on down the line to the little ones like the school book combine and the oleomargarine outrages and the lehigh valley and great scott coal federation it s all right andy says i to drink the health of our brother monopolists but don t overdo the wassail you know our most eminent and loathed multi corruptionists live on weak tea and dog biscuits andy went in the back room awhile and came out dressed in his best clothes there was a kind of murderous and soulful look of gentle riotousness in his eye that i didn t like i watched him to see what turn the whiskey was going to take in him there are two times when you never can tell what is going to happen one is when a man takes his first drink and the other is when a woman takes her latest in less than an hour andy s skate had turned to an ice yacht he was outwardly decent and managed to preserve his aquarium but inside he was impromptu and full of unexpectedness jeff says he do you know that i m a crater a living crater that s a self evident hypothesis says i but you re not irish why don t you say creature according to the rules and syntax of america i m the crater of a volcano says he i m all aflame and crammed inside with an assortment of words and phrases that have got to have an exodus i can feel millions of synonyms and parts of speech rising in me says he and i ve got to make a speech of some sort drink says andy always drives me to oratory it could do no worse says i from my earliest recollections says he alcohol seemed to stimulate my sense of recitation and rhetoric why in bryan s second campaign says andy they used to give me three gin rickeys and i d speak two hours longer than billy himself could on the silver question finally they persuaded me to take the gold cure if you ve got to get rid of your excess verbiage says i why not go out on the river bank and speak a piece it seems to me there was an old spell binder named cantharides that used to go and disincorporate himself of his windy numbers along the seashore no says andy i must have an audience i feel like if i once turned loose people would begin to call senator beveridge the grand young sphinx of the wabash i ve got to get an audience together jeff and get this oral distension assuaged or it may turn in on me and i d go about feeling like a deckle edge edition de luxe of mrs e d e n southworth on what special subject of the theorems and topics does your desire for vocality seem to be connected with i asks i ain t particular says andy i am equally good and varicose on all subjects i can take up the matter of russian immigration or the poetry

they printed above each instalment a synopsis of succeeding chapters mary laughed merrily bob ames told us once she said of a funny thing you did it was when you and he were on a train in the south and you got off at a town where you hadn t intended to stop just because the brakeman hung up a sign in the end of the car with the name of the next station on it i remember said ives that next station has been the thing i ve always tried to get away from i know it said mary and you ve been very foolish i hope you didn t find what you wanted not to find or get off at the station where there wasn t any or whatever it was you expected wouldn t happen to you during the three years you ve been away there was something i wanted before i went away said ives mary looked in his eyes clearly with a slight but perfectly sweet smile there was she said you wanted me and you could have had me as you very well know without replying ives let his gaze wander slowly about the room there had been no change in it since last he had been in it three years before he vividly recalled the thoughts that had been in his mind then the contents of that room were as fixed in their way as the everlasting hills no change would ever come there except the inevitable ones wrought by time and decay that silver mounted album would occupy that corner of that table those pictures would hang on the walls those chairs be found in their same places every morn and noon and night while the household hung together the brass andirons were monuments to order and stability herre and there were relics of a hundred years ago which were still living mementos and would be for many years to come one going from and coming back to that house would never need to forecast or doubt he would find what he left and leave what he found the veiled lady chance would never lift her hand to the knocker on the outer door and before him sat the lady who belonged in the room cool and sweet and unchangeable she was she offered no surprises if one should pass his life with her though she might grow white haired and wrinkled he would never perceive the change three years he had been away from her and she was still waiting for him as established and constant as the house itself he was sure that she had once cared for him it was the knowledge that she would always do so that had driven him away thus his thoughts ran i am going to be married soon said mary on the next thursday afternoon forster came hurriedly to ive s hotel old man said he we ll have to put that dinner off for a year or so i m going abroad the steamer sails at four that was a great talk we had the other night and it decided me i m going to knock around the world and get rid of that incubus that has been weighing on both you and me the terrible dread of knowing what s going to happen i ve done one thing that hurts my conscience a little but i know it s best for both of us i ve written to the lady to whom i was engaged and explained everything told her plainly why i was leaving that the monotony of matrimony would never do for me don t you think i was right it is not for me to say answered ives go ahead and shoot elephants if you think it will bring the element of chance into your life we ve got to decide these things for ourselves but i tell you one thing forster i ve found the way i ve found out the biggest hazard in the world a game of chance that never is concluded a venture that may end in the highest heaven or the blackest pit it will keep a man on edge until the clods fall on his coffin because he will never know not until his last day and not then will he know it is a voayge without a rudder or compass and you must be captain and crew and keep watch every day and night yourself with no one to relieve you i have found the venture don t bother yourself about leaving mary marsden forster i married her yesterday at noon the duel the gods lying beside their nectar on lympus and peeping over the edge of the cliff perceive a difference in cities although it would seem that to their vision towns must appear as large or small ant hills without special characteristics yet it is not so studying the habits of ants frm so great a height should be but a mild diversion when coupled with the soft drink that mythology tells us is their only solace but doubtless they have amused themselves by the comparison of villages and towns and it will be no news to them nor perhaps to many mortals that in one particularity new york stands unique among the cities of the world this shall be the theme of a little story addressed to the man who sits smoking with his sabbath slippered feet on another chair and to the woman who snatches the paper for a moment while boiling greens or a narcotized baby leaves her free with these i love to sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings new york city is inhabited by mysterious strangers thus beating bird centre by three millions and half a dozen nine s they came here in various ways and for many reasons hendrik hudson the art schools green goods the stork the annual dressmakers convention the pennsylvania railroad love of money the stage cheap excursion rates brains personal column ads heavy walking shoes ambition freight trains all these have had a hand in making up the population but every man jack when he first sets foot on the stones of manhattan has got to fight he has got to fight at once until either he or his adversary wins there is no resting between rounds for there are no rounds it is slugging from the first it is a fight to a finish your opponent is the city you must do battle with it from the time the ferry boat lands you on the island until either it is yours or it has conquered you it is the same whether you have a million in your pocket or only the price of a week s lodging the battle is to decide whether you shall become a new yorker or turn the rankest outlander and philistine you must be one or the other you cannot remain neutral you must be for or against lover or enemy bosom friend or outcast and oh the city is a general in the ring not only by blows does it seek to subdue you it woos you to its heart with the subtlety of a siren it is a combination of delilah green chartreuse beethoven chloral and john l in his best days in other cities you may wander and abide as a stranger man as long as you please you may live in chicago until your hair whitens and be a citizen and still prate of beans if boston mothered you and without rebuke you may become a civic pillar in any other town but knickerbocker s and all the time publicly sneering at its buildings comparing them with the architecture of colonel telfair s residence in jackson miss whence you hail and you will not be set upon but in new york you must be either a new yorker or an invader of a modern troy concealed in the wooden horse of your conceited provincialism and this dreary preamble is only to introduce to you the unimportant figures of william and jack they came out of the west together where they had been friends they came to dig their fortunes out of the big city father knickerbocker met them at the ferry giving one a right hander on the nose and the other an upper cut with his left just to let them know that the fight was on william was for business jack was for art both were young and ambitious so they countered and clinched i think they were from nebraska or possibly missouri or minnesota anyhow they were out for success and scraps and scads and they tackled the city like two lochinvars with brass knucks and a pull at the city hall four years afterward william and jack met at luncheon the business man blew in like a march wind hurled his silk hat at a waiter dropped into the chair that was pushed under him seized the bill of fare and had ordered as far as cheese before the artist had time to do more than nod after the nod a humorous smile came into his eyes billy he said you re done for the city has gobbled you up it has taken you and cut you to its pattern and stamped you with its brand you are so nearly like ten thousand men i have seen to day that you couldn t be picked out from them if it weren t for your laundry marks camembert finished william what s that oh you ve still got your hammer out for new york have you well little old noisyville on the subway is good enough for me it s giving me mine and say i used to think the west was the whole round world only slightly flattened at the poles whenever bryan ran i used to yell myself hoarse about the free expense and hang my hat on the horizon and say cutting things in the grocery to little soap drummers from the east but i d never seen new york then jack me for it from the rathskellers up sixth avenue is the west to me now have you heard this fellow crusoe sing the desert isle for him i say but my wife made me go give me may irwin or e s willard any time poor billy said the artist delicately fingering a cigarette you remember when we were on our way to the east how we talked about this great wonderful city and how we meant to conquer it and never let it get the best of us we were going to be just the same fellows we had always been and never let it master us it has downed you old man you have changed from a maverick into a butterick don t see exactly what you are driving at said william i don t wear an alpaca coat with blue trousers and a seersucker vest on dress occasions like i used to do at home you talk about being cut to a pattern well ain t the pattern all right when you re in rome you ve got to do as the dagoes do this town seems to me to have other alleged metropolises skinned to flag stations according to the railroad schedule i ve got in mind chicago and saint jo and paris france are asterisk stops which means you wave a red flag and get on every other tuesday i like this little suburb of tarrytown on the hudson there s something or somebody doing all the time i m clearing a year selling automatic pumps and i m living like kings up why yesterday i was introduced to john w gates i took an auto ride with a wine agent s sister i saw two men run over by a street car and i seen edna may play in the evening talk about the west why the other night i woke everybody up in the hotel hollaring i dreamed i was walking on a board sidewalk in oshkosh what have you got against this town jack there s only one thing in it that i don t care for and that s a ferryboat the artist gazed dreamily at the cartridge paper on the wall this town said he is a leech it drains the blood of the country whoever comes to it accepts a challenge to a duel abandoning the figure of the leech it is a juggernaut a moloch a monster to which the innocence the genius and the beauty of the land must pay tribute hand to hand every newcomer must struggle with the leviathan you ve lost billy it shall never conquer me i hate it as one hates sin or pestilence or the color work in a ten cent magazine i despise its very vastness and power it has the poorest millionaires the littlest great men the lowest skyscrapers the dolefulest pleasures of any town i ever saw it has caught you old man but i will never run beside its chariot wheels it glosses itself as the chinaman glosses his collars give me the domestic finish i could stand a town ruled by wealth or one ruled by an aristocracy but this is one controlled by its lowest ingredients claiming culture it is the crudest asseverating its pre eminence it is the basest denying all outside values and virtue it is the narrowest give me the pure and the open heart of the west country i would go back there to morrow if i could don t you like this filet mignon said william shucks now what s the use to knock the town it s the greatest ever i couldn t sell one automatic pump between harrisburg and tommy o keefe s saloon in sacramento where i sell twenty here and have you seen sara bernardt in andrew mack yet the town s got you billy said jack all right said william i m going to buy a cottage on lake ronkonkoma next summer at midnight jack raised his window and sat close to it he caught his breath at what he saw though he had seen and felt it a hundred times far below and around lay the city like a ragged purple dream the irregular houses were like the broken exteriors of cliffs lining deep gulches and winding streams some were mountainous some lay in long desert ca ons such was the background of the wonderful cruel enchanting bewildering fatal great city but into this background were cut myriads of brilliant parallelograms and circles and squares through which glowed many colored lights and out of the violet and purple depths ascended like the city s soul sounds and odors and thrills that make up the civic body there arose the breath of gaiety unrestrained of love of hate of all the passions that man can know there below him lay all things good or bad that can be brought from the four corners of the earth to instruct please thrill enrich despoil elevate cast down nurture or kill thus the flavor of it came up to him and went into his blood there was a knock on his door a telegram had come for him it came from the west and these were its words come back and the answer will be yes dolly he kept the boy waiting ten minutes and then wrote the reply impossible to leave here at present then he sat at the window again and let the city put its cup of mandragora to his lips again after all it isn t a story but i wanted to know which one of the heroes won the battle against the city so i went to a very learned friend and laid the case before him what he said was please don t bother me i have christmas presents to buy so there it rests and you will have to decide for yourself what you want night had fallen on that great and beautiful city known as bagdad on the subway and with the night came the enchanted glamour that belongs not to arabia alone in different masquerade the streets bazaars and walled houses of the occidental city of romance were filled with the same kind of folk that so much interested our interesting old friend the late mr h a rashid they wore clothes eleven hundred years nearer to the latest styles than h a saw in old bagdad but they were about the same people underneath with the eye of faith you could have seen the little hunchback sinbad the sailor fitbad the tailor the beautiful persian the one eyed calenders ali baba and forty robbers on every block and the barber and his six brothers and all the old arabian gang easily but let us revenue to our lamb chops old tom crowley was a caliph he had in preferred stocks and bonds with solid gold edges in these times to be called a caliph you must have money the old style caliph business as conducted by mr rashid is not safe if you hold up a person nowadays in a bazaar or a turkish bath or a side street and inquire into his private and personal affairs the police court ll get you old tom was tired of clubs theatres dinners friends music money and everything that s what makes a caliph you must get to despise everything that money can buy and then go out and try to want something that you can t pay for i ll take a little trot around town all by myself thought old tom and try if i can stir up anything new let s see it seems i ve read about a king or a cardiff giant or something in old times who used to go about with false whiskers on making persian dates with folks he hadn t been introduced to that don t listen like a bad idea i certainly have got a case of humdrumness and fatigue on for the ones i do know that old cardiff used to pick up cases of trouble as he ran upon em and give em gold sequins i think it was and make em marry or got em good government jobs now i d like something of that sort my money is as good as his was even if the magazines do ask me every month where i got it yes i guess i ll do a little cardiff business to night and see how it goes plainly dressed old tom crowley left his madison avenue palace and walked westward and then south as he stepped to the sidewalk fate who holds the ends of the strings in the central offices of all the enchanted cities pulled a thread and a young man twenty blocks away looked at a wall clock and then put on his coat james turner worked in one of those little hat cleaning establishments on sixth avenue in which a fire alarms rings when you push the door open and where they clean your hat while you wait two days james stood all day at an electric machine that turned hats around faster than the best brands of champagne ever could have done overlooking your mild impertinence in feeling a curiosity about the personal appearance of a stranger i will give you a modified description of him weight complexion hair and brain light height five feet six age about twenty three dressed in a suit of greenish blue serge pockets containing two keys and sixty three cents in change but do not misconjecture because this description sounds like a general alarm that james was either lost or a dead one allons james stood all day at his work his feet were tender and extremely susceptible to impositions being put upon or below them all day long they burned and smarted causing him much suffering and inconvenience but he was earning twelve dollars per week which he needed to support his feet whether his feet would support him or not james turner had his own conception of what happiness was just as you and i have ours your delight is to gad about the world in yachts and motor cars and to hurl ducats at wild fowl mine is to smoke a pipe at evenfall and watch a badger a rattlesnake and an owl go into their common prairie home one by one james turner s idea of bliss was different but it was his he would go directly to his boarding house when his day s work was done after his supper of small steak bessemer potatoes stooed not stewed apples and infusion of chicory he would ascend to his fifth floor back hall room then he would take off his shoes and socks place the soles of his burning feet against the cold bars of his iron bed and read clark russell s sea yarns the delicious relief of the cool metal applied to his smarting soles was his nightly joy his favorite novels never palled upon him the sea and the adventures of its navigators were his sole intellectual passion no millionaire was ever happier than james turner taking his ease when james left the hat cleaning shop he walked three blocks out of his way home to look over the goods of a second hand bookstall on the sidewalk stands he had more than once picked up a paper covered volume of clark russell at half price while he was bending with a scholarly stoop over the marked down miscellany of cast off literature old tom the caliph sauntered by his discerning eye made keen by twenty years experience in the manufacture of laundry soap save the wrappers recognized instantly the poor and discerning scholar a worthy object of his caliphanous mood he descended the two shallow stone steps that led from the sidewalk and addressed without hesitation the object of his designed munificence his first words were no worse than salutatory and tentative james turner looked up coldly with sartor resartus in one hand and a mad marriage in the other beat it said he i don t want to buy any coat hangers or town lots in hankipoo new jersey run along now and play with your teddy bear young man said the caliph ignoring the flippancy of the hat cleaner i observe that you are of a studious disposition learning is one of the finest things in the world i never had any of it worth mentioning but i admire to see it in others i come from the west where we imagine nothing but facts maybe i couldn t understand the poetry and allusions in them books you are picking over but i like to see somebody else seem to know what they mean i m worth about and i m getting richer every day i made the height of it manufacturing aunt patty s silver soap i invented the art of making it i experimented for three years before i got just the right quantity of chloride of sodium solution and caustic potash mixture to curdle properly and after i had taken some out of the soap business i made the rest in corn and wheat futures now you seem to have the literary and scholarly turn of character and i ll tell you what i ll do i ll pay for your education at the finest college in the world i ll pay the expense of your rummaging over europe and the art galleries and finally set you up in a good business you needn t make it soap if you have any objections i see by your clothes and frazzled necktie that you are mighty poor and you can t afford to turn down the offer well when do you want to begin the hat cleaner turned upon old tom the eye of the big city which is an eye expressive of cold and justifiable suspicion of judgment suspended as high as haman was hung of self preservation of challenge curiosity defiance cynicism and strange as you may think it of a childlike yearning for friendliness and fellowship that must be hidden when one walks among the stranger bands for in new bagdad one in order to survive must suspect whosoever sits dwells drinks rides walks or sleeps in the adjacent chair house booth seat path or room say mike said james turner what s your line anyway shoe laces i m not buying anything you better put an egg in your shoe and beat it before incidents occur to you you can t work off any fountain pens gold spectacles you found on the street or trust company certificate house clearings on me say do i look like i d climbed down one of them missing fire escapes at helicon hall what s vitiating you anyhow son said the caliph in his most harunish tones as i said i m worth i don t want to have it all put in my coffin when i die i want to do some good with it i seen you handling over these here volumes of literature and i thought i d keep you i ve give the missionary societies but what did i get out of it nothing but a receipt from the secretary now you are just the kind of young man i d like to take up and see what money could make of him volumes of clark russell were hard to find that evening at the old book shop and james turner s smarting and aching feet did not tend to improve his temper humble hat cleaner though he was he had a spirit equal to any caliph s say you old faker he said angrily be on your way i don t know what your game is unless you want change for a bogus bill well i don t carry that much around with me but i do carry a pretty fair left handed punch that you ll get if you don t move on you are a blamed impudent little gutter pup said the caliph then james delivered his self praised punch old tom seized him by the collar and kicked him thrice the hat cleaner rallied and clinched two bookstands were overturned and the books sent flying a copy came up took an arm of each and marched them to the nearest station house fighting and disorderly conduct said the cop to the sergeant three hundred dollars bail said the sergeant at once asseveratingly and inquiringly sixty three cents said james turner with a harsh laugh the caliph searched his pockets and collected small bills and change amounting to four dollars i am worth he said forty million dollars but lock em up ordered the sergeant in his cell james turner laid himself on his cot ruminating maybe he s got the money and maybe he ain t but if he has or he ain t what does he want to go round butting into other folks s business for when a man knows what he wants and can get it it s the same as to him then an idea came to him that brought a pleased look to his face he removed his socks drew his cot close to the door stretched himself out luxuriously and placed his tortured feet against the cold bars of the cell door something hard and bulky under the blankets of his cot gave one shoulder discomfort he reached under and drew out a paper covered volume by clark russell called a sailor s sweetheart he gave a great sigh of contentment presently to his cell came the doorman and said say kid that old gazabo that was pinched with you for scrapping seems to have been the goods after all he phoned to his friends and he s out at the desk now with a roll of yellowbacks as big as a pullman car pillow he wants to bail you and for you to come out and see him tell him i ain t in said james turner sixes and sevens the last of the troubadours inexorably sam galloway saddled his pony he was going away from the rancho altito at the end of a three months visit it is not to be expected that a guest should put up with wheat coffee and biscuits yellow streaked with saleratus for longer than that nick napoleon the big negro man cook had never been able to make good biscuits once before when nick was cooking at the willow ranch sam had been forced to fly from his cuisine after only a six weeks sojourn on sam s face was an expression of sorrow deepened with regret and slightly tempered by the patient forgiveness of a connoisseur who cannot be understood but very firmly and inexorably he buckled his saddle cinches looped his stake rope and hung it to his saddle horn tied his slicker and coat on the cantle and looped his quirt on his right wrist the merrydews householders of the rancho altito men women children and servants vassals visitors employes dogs and casual callers were grouped in the gallery of the ranch house all with faces set to the tune of melancholy and grief for as the coming of sam galloway to any ranch camp or cabin between the rivers frio or bravo del norte aroused joy so his departure caused mourning and distress and then during absolute silence except for the bumping of a hind elbow of a hound dog as he pursued a wicked flea sam tenderly and carefully tied his guitar across his saddle on top of his slicker and coat the guitar was in a green duck bag and if you catch the significance of it it explains sam sam galloway was the last of the troubadours of course you know about the troubadours the encyclopaedia says they flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries what they flourished doesn t seem clear you may be pretty sure it wasn t a sword maybe it was a fiddlebow or a forkful of spaghetti or a lady s scarf anyhow sam galloway was one of em sam put on a martyred expression as he mounted his pony but the expression on his face was hilarious compared with the one on his pony s you see a pony gets to know his rider mighty well and it is not unlikely that cow ponies in pastures and at hitching racks had often guyed sam s pony for being ridden by a guitar player instead of by a rollicking cussing all wool cowboy no man is a hero to his saddle horse and even an escalator in a department store might be excused for tripping up a troubadour oh i know i m one and so are you you remember the stories you memorize and the card tricks you study and that little piece on the piano how does it go ti tum te tum ti tum those little arabian ten minute entertainments that you furnish when you go up to call on your rich aunt jane you should know that omnae personae in tres partes divisae sunt namely brons troubadours and workers barons have no inclination to read such folderol as this and workers have no time so i know you must be a troubadour and that you will understand sam galloway whether we sing act dance write lecture or paint we are only troubadours so let us make the worst of it the pony with the dante alighieri face guided by the pressure of sam s knees bore that wandering minstrel sixteen miles southeastward nature was in her most benignant mood league after league of delicate sweet flowerets made fragrant the gently undulating prairie the east wind tempered the spring warmth wool white clouds flying in from the mexican gull hindered the direct rays of the april sun sam sang songs as he rode under his pony s bridle he had tucked some sprigs of chaparral to keep away the deer flies thus crowned the long faced quadruped looked more dantesque than before and judging by his countenance seemed to think of beatrice straight as topography permitted sam rode to the sheep ranch of old man ellison a visit to a sheep ranch seemed to him desirable just then there had been too many people too much noise argument competition confusion at rancho altito he had never conferred upon old man ellison the favour of sojourning at his ranch but he knew he would be welcome the troubadour is his own passport everywhere the workers in the castle let down the drawbridge to him and the baron sets him at his left hand at table in the banquet hall there ladies smile upon him and applaud his songs and stories while the workers bring boars heads and flagons if the baron nods once or twice in his carved oaken chair he does not do it maliciously old man ellison welcomed the troubadour flatteringly he had often heard praises of sam galloway from other ranchmen who had been complimented by his visits but had never aspired to such an honour for his own humble barony i say barony because old man ellison was the last of the barons of course mr bulwer lytton lived too early to know him or he wouldn t have conferred that sobriquet upon warwick in life it is the duty and the function of the baron to provide work for the workers and lodging and shelter for the troubadours old man ellison was a shrunken old man with a short yellow white beard and a face lined and seamed by past and gone smiles his ranch was a little two room box house in a grove of hackberry trees in the lonesomest part of the sheep country his household consisted of a kiowa indian man cook four hounds a pet sheep and a half tamed coyote chained to a fence post he owned sheep which he ran on two sections of leased land and many thousands of acres neither leased nor owned three or four times a year some one who spoke his language would ride up to his gate and exchange a few bald ideas with him those were red letter days to old man ellison then in what illuminated embossed and gorgeously decorated capitals must have been written the day on which a troubadour a troubadour who according to the encyclopaedia should have flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries drew rein at the gates of his baronial castle old man ellison s smiles came back and filled his wrinkles when he saw sam he hurried out of the house in his shuffling limping way to greet him hello mr ellison called sam cheerfully thought i d drop over and see you a while notice you ve had fine rains on your range they ought to make good grazing for your spring lambs well well well said old man ellison i m mighty glad to see you sam i never thought you d take the trouble to ride over to as out of the way an old ranch as this but you re mighty welcome light i ve got a sack of new oats in the kitchen shall i bring out a feed for your hoss oats for him said sam derisively no sir ee he s as fat as a pig now on grass he don t get rode enough to keep him in condition i ll just turn him in the horse pasture with a drag rope on if you don t mind i am positive that never during the eleventh and thirteenth centuries did baron troubadour and worker amalgamate as harmoniously as their parallels did that evening at old man ellison s sheep ranch the kiowa s biscuits were light and tasty and his coffee strong ineradicable hospitality and appreciation glowed on old man ellison s weather tanned face as for the troubadour he said to himself that he had stumbled upon pleasant places indeed a well cooked abundant meal a host whom his lightest attempt to entertain seemed to delight far beyond the merits of the exertion and the reposeful atmosphere that his sensitive soul at that time craved united to confer upon him a satisfaction and luxurious ease that he had seldom found on his tours of the ranches after the delectable supper sam untied the green duck bag and took out his guitar not by way of payment mind you neither sam galloway nor any other of the true troubadours are lineal descendants of the late tommy tucker you have read of tommy tucker in the works of the esteemed but often obscure mother goose tommy tucker sang for his supper no true troubadour would do that he would have his supper and then sing for art s sake sam galloway s repertoire comprised about fifty funny stories and between thirty and forty songs he by no means stopped there he could talk through twenty cigarettes on any topic that you brought up and he never sat up when he could lie down and never stood when he could sit i am strongly disposed to linger with him for i am drawing a portrait as well as a blunt pencil and a tattered thesaurus will allow i wish you could have seen him he was small and tough and inactive beyond the power of imagination to conceive he wore an ultramarine blue woollen shirt laced down the front with a pearl gray exaggerated sort of shoestring indestructible brown duck clothes inevitable high heeled boots with mexican spurs and a mexican straw sombrero that evening sam and old man ellison dragged their chairs out under the hackberry trees they lighted cigarettes and the troubadour gaily touched his guitar many of the songs he sang were the weird melancholy minor keyed canciones that he had learned from the mexican sheep herders and vaqueros one in particular charmed and soothed the soul of the lonely baron it was a favourite song of the sheep herders beginning huile huile palomita which being translated means fly fly little dove sam sang it for old man ellison many times that evening the troubadour stayed on at the old man s ranch there was peace and quiet and appreciation there such as he had not found in the noisy camps of the cattle kings no audience in the world could have crowned the work of poet musician or artist with more worshipful and unflagging approval than that bestowed upon his efforts by old man ellison no visit by a royal personage to a humble woodchopper or peasant could have been received with more flattering thankfulness and joy on a cool canvas covered cot in the shade of the hackberry trees sam galloway passed the greater part of his time there he rolled his brown paper cigarettes read such tedious literature as the ranch afforded and added to his repertoire of improvisations that he played so expertly on his guitar to him as a slave ministering to a great lord the kiowa brought cool water from the red jar hanging under the brush shelter and food when he called for it the prairie zephyrs fanned him mildly mocking birds at morn and eve competed with but scarce equalled the sweet melodies of his lyre a perfumed stillness seemed to fill all his world while old man ellison was pottering among his flocks of sheep on his mile an hour pony and while the kiowa took his siesta in the burning sunshine at the end of the kitchen sam would lie on his cot thinking what a happy world he lived in and how kind it is to the ones whose mission in life it is to give entertainment and pleasure here he had food and lodging as good as he had ever longed for absolute immunity from care or exertion or strife an endless welcome and a host whose delight at the sixteenth repetition of a song or a story was as keen as at its initial giving was there ever a troubadour of old who struck upon as royal a castle in his wanderings while he lay thus meditating upon his blessings little brown cottontails would shyly frolic through the yard a covey of white topknotted blue quail would run past in single file twenty yards away a paisano bird out hunting for tarantulas would hop upon the fence and salute him with sweeping flourishes of its long tail in the eighty acre horse pasture the pony with the dantesque face grew fat and almost smiling the troubadour was at the end of his wanderings old man ellison was his own vaciero that means that he supplied his sheep camps with wood water and rations by his own labours instead of hiring a vaciero on small ranches it is often done one morning he started for the camp of incarnacion felipe de la cruz y monte piedras one of his sheep herders with the week s usual rations of brown beans coffee meal and sugar two miles away on the trail from old fort ewing he met face to face a terrible being called king james mounted on a fiery prancing kentucky bred horse king james s real name was james king but people reversed it because it seemed to fit him better and also because it seemed to please his majesty king james was the biggest cattleman between the alamo plaza in san antone and bill hopper s saloon in brownsville also he was the loudest and most offensive bully and braggart and bad man in southwest texas and he always made good whenever he bragged and the more noise he made the more dangerous he was in the story papers it is always the quiet mild mannered man with light blue eyes and a low voice who turns out to be really dangerous but in real life and in this story such is not the case give me my choice between assaulting a large loudmouthed rough houser and an inoffensive stranger with blue eyes sitting quietly in a corner and you will see something doing in the corner every time king james as i intended to say earlier was a fierce two hundred pound sunburned blond man as pink as an october strawberry and with two horizontal slits under shaggy red eyebrows for eyes on that day he wore a flannel shirt that was tan coloured with the exception of certain large areas which were darkened by transudations due to the summer sun there seemed to be other clothing and garnishings about him such as brown duck trousers stuffed into immense boots and red handkerchiefs and revolvers and a shotgun laid across his saddle and a leather belt with millions of cartridges shining in it but your mind skidded off such accessories what held your gaze was just the two little horizontal slits that he used for eyes this was the man that old man ellison met on the trail and when you count up in the baron s favour that he was sixty five and weighed ninety eight pounds and had heard of king james s record and that he the baron had a hankering for the vita simplex and had no gun with him and wouldn t have used it if he had you can t censure him if i tell you that the smiles with which the troubadour had filled his wrinkles went out of them and left them plain wrinkles again but he was not the kind of baron that flies from danger he reined in the mile an hour pony no difficult feat and saluted the formidable monarch king james expressed himself with royal directness you re that old snoozer that s running sheep on this range ain t you said he what right have you got to do it do you own any land or lease any i have two sections leased from the state said old man ellison mildly not by no means you haven t said king james your lease expired yesterday and i had a man at the land office on the minute to take it up you don t control a foot of grass in texas you sheep men have got to git your time s up it s a cattle country and there ain t any room in it for snoozers this range you ve got your sheep on is mine i m putting up a wire fence forty by sixty miles and if there s a sheep inside of it when it s done it ll be a dead one i ll give you a week to move yours away if they ain t gone by then i ll send six men over here with winchesters to make mutton out of the whole lot and if i find you here at the same time this is what you ll get king james patted the breech of his shot gun warningly old man ellison rode on to the camp of incarnacion he sighed many times and the wrinkles in his face grew deeper rumours that the old order was about to change had reached him before the end of free grass was in sight other troubles too had been accumulating upon his shoulders his flocks were decreasing instead of growing the price of wool was declining at every clip even bradshaw the storekeeper at frio city at whose store he bought his ranch supplies was dunning him for his last six months bill and threatening to cut him off and so this last greatest calamity suddenly dealt out to him by the terrible king james was a crusher when the old man got back to the ranch at sunset he found sam galloway lying on his cot propped against a roll of blankets and wool sacks fingering his guitar hello uncle ben the troubadour called cheerfully you rolled in early this evening i been trying a new twist on the spanish fandango to day i just about got it here s how she goes listen that s fine that s mighty fine said old man ellison sitting on the kitchen step and rubbing his white scotch terrier whiskers i reckon you ve got all the musicians beat east and west sam as far as the roads are cut out oh i don t know said sam reflectively but i certainly do get there on variations i guess i can handle anything in five flats about as well as any of em but you look kind of fagged out uncle ben ain t you feeling right well this evening little tired that s all sam if you ain t played yourself out let s have that mexican piece that starts off with huile huile palomita it seems that that song always kind of soothes and comforts me after i ve been riding far or anything bothers me why seguramente senor said sam i ll hit her up for you as often as you like and before i forget about it uncle ben you want to jerk bradshaw up about them last hams he sent us they re just a little bit strong a man sixty five years old living on a sheep ranch and beset by a complication of disasters cannot successfully and continuously dissemble moreover a troubadour has eyes quick to see unhappiness in others around him because it disturbs his own ease so on the next day sam again questioned the old man about his air of sadness and abstraction then old man ellison told him the story of king james s threats and orders and that pale melancholy and red ruin appeared to have marked him for their own the troubadour took the news thoughtfully he had heard much about king james on the third day of the seven days of grace allowed him by the autocrat of the range old man ellison drove his buckboard to frio city to fetch some necessary supplies for the ranch bradshaw was hard but not implacable he divided the old man s order by two and let him have a little more time one article secured was a new fine ham for the pleasure of the troubadour five miles out of frio city on his way home the old man met king james riding into town his majesty could never look anything but fierce and menacing but to day his slits of eyes appeared to be a little wider than they usually were good day said the king gruffly i ve been wanting to see you i hear it said by a cowman from sandy yesterday that you was from jackson county mississippi originally i want to know if that s a fact born there said old man ellison and raised there till i was twenty one this man says went on king james that he thinks you was related to the jackson county reeveses was he right aunt caroline reeves said the old man was my half sister she was my aunt said king james i run away from home when i was sixteen now let s re talk over some things that we discussed a few days ago they call me a bad man and they re only half right there s plenty of room in my pasture for your bunch of sheep and their increase for a long time to come aunt caroline used to cut out sheep in cake dough and bake em for me you keep your sheep where they are and use all the range you want how s your finances the old man related his woes in detail dignifiedly with restraint and candour she used to smuggle extra grub into my school basket i m speaking of aunt caroline said king james i m going over to frio city to day and i ll ride back by your ranch to morrow i ll draw out of the bank there and bring it over to you and i ll tell bradshaw to let you have everything you want on credit you are bound to have heard the old saying at home that the jackson county reeveses and kings would stick closer by each other than chestnut burrs well i m a king yet whenever i run a cross a reeves so you look out for me along about sundown to morrow and don t worry about nothing shouldn t wonder if the dry spell don t kill out the young grass old man ellison drove happily ranchward once more the smiles filled out his wrinkles very suddenly by the magic of kinship and the good that lies somewhere in all hearts his troubles had been removed on reaching the ranch he found that sam galloway was not there his guitar hung by its buckskin string to a hackberry limb moaning as the gulf breeze blew across its masterless strings the kiowa endeavoured to explain sam he catch pony said he and say he ride to frio city what for no can damn sabe say he come back to night maybe so that all as the first stars came out the troubadour rode back to his haven he pastured his pony and went into the house his spurs jingling martially old man ellison sat at the kitchen table having a tin cup of before supper coffee he looked contented and pleased hello sam said he i m darned glad to see ye back i don t know how i managed to get along on this ranch anyhow before ye dropped in to cheer things up i ll bet ye ve been skylarking around with some of them frio city gals now that s kept ye so late and then old man ellison took another look at sam s face and saw that the minstrel had changed the man of action and while sam is unbuckling from his waist old man ellison s six shooter that the latter had left behind when he drove to town we may well pause to remark that anywhere and whenever a troubadour lays down the guitar and takes up the sword trouble is sure to follow it is not the expert thrust of athos nor the cold skill of aramis nor the iron wrist of porthos that we have to fear it is the gascon s fury the wild and unacademic attack of the troubadour the sword of d artagnan i done it said sam i went over to frio city to do it i couldn t let him put the skibunk on you uncle ben i met him in summers s saloon i knowed what to do i said a few things to him that nobody else heard he reached for his gun first half a dozen fellows saw him do it but i got mine unlimbered first three doses i gave him right around the lungs and a saucer could have covered up all of em he won t bother you no more this is king james you speak of asked old man ellison while he sipped his coffee you bet it was and they took me before the county judge and the witnesses what saw him draw his gun first was all there well of course they put me under bond to appear before the court but there was four or five boys on the spot ready to sign the bail he won t bother you no more uncle ben you ought to have seen how close them bullet holes was together i reckon playing a guitar as much as i do must kind of limber a fellow s trigger finger up a little don t you think uncle ben then there was a little silence in the castle except for the spluttering of a venison steak that the kiowa was cooking sam said old man ellison stroking his white whiskers with a tremulous hand would you mind getting the guitar and playing that huile huile palomita piece once or twice it always seems to be kind of soothing and comforting when a man s tired and fagged out there is no more to be said except that the title of the story is wrong it should have been called the last of the barons there never will be an end to the troubadours and now and then it does seem that the jingle of their guitars will drown the sound of the muffled blows of the pickaxes and trip hammers of all the workers in the world the sleuths in the big city a man will disappear with the suddenness and completeness of the flame of a candle that is blown out all the agencies of inquisition the hounds of the trail the sleuths of the city s labyrinths the closet detectives of theory and induction will be invoked to the search most often the man s face will be seen no more sometimes he will reappear in sheboygan or in the wilds of terre haute calling himself one of the synonyms of smith and without memory of events up to a certain time including his grocer s bill sometimes it will be found after dragging the rivers and polling the restaurants to see if he may be waiting for a well done sirloin that he has moved next door this snuffing out of a human being like the erasure of a chalk man from a blackboard is one of the most impressive themes in dramaturgy the case of mary snyder in point should not be without interest a man of middle age of the name of meeks came from the west to new york to find his sister mrs mary snyder a widow aged fifty two who had been living for a year in a tenement house in a crowded neighbourhood at her address he was told that mary snyder had moved away longer than a month before no one could tell him her new address on coming out mr meeks addressed a policeman who was standing on the corner and explained his dilemma my sister is very poor he said and i am anxious to find her i have recently made quite a lot of money in a lead mine and i want her to share my prosperity there is no use in advertising her because she cannot read the policeman pulled his moustache and looked so thoughtful and mighty that meeks could almost feel the joyful tears of his sister mary dropping upon his bright blue tie you go down in the canal street neighbourhood said the policeman and get a job drivin the biggest dray you can find there s old women always gettin knocked over by drays down there you might see er among em if you don t want to do that you better go round to headquarters and get em to put a fly cop onto the dame at police headquarters meeks received ready assistance a general alarm was sent out and copies of a photograph of mary snyder that her brother had were distributed among the stations in mulberry street the chief assigned detective mullins to the case the detective took meeks aside and said this is not a very difficult case to unravel shave off your whiskers fill your pockets with good cigars and meet me in the cafe of the waldorf at three o clock this afternoon meeks obeyed he found mullins there they had a bottle of wine while the detective asked questions concerning the missing woman now said mullins new york is a big city but we ve got the detective business systematized there are two ways we can go about finding your sister we will try one of em first you say she s fifty two a little past said meeks the detective conducted the westerner to a branch advertising office of one of the largest dailies there he wrote the following ad and submitted it to meeks wanted at once one hundred attractive chorus girls for a new musical comedy apply all day at no broadway meeks was indignant my sister said he is a poor hard working elderly woman i do not see what aid an advertisement of this kind would be toward finding her all right said the detective i guess you don t know new york but if you ve got a grouch against this scheme we ll try the other one it s a sure thing but it ll cost you more never mind the expense said meeks we ll try it the sleuth led him back to the waldorf engage a couple of bedrooms and a parlour he advised and let s go up this was done and the two were shown to a superb suite on the fourth floor meeks looked puzzled the detective sank into a velvet armchair and pulled out his cigar case i forgot to suggest old man he said that you should have taken the rooms by the month they wouldn t have stuck you so much for em by the month exclaimed meeks what do you mean oh it ll take time to work the game this way i told you it would cost you more we ll have to wait till spring there ll be a new city directory out then very likely your sister s name and address will be in it meeks rid himself

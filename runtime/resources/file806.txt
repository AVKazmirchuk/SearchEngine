a quartered oak desk i am telling you that dodson of the firm of dodson decker wall street brokers opened his eyes peabody the confidential clerk was standing by his chair hesitating to speak there

house he will settle at one eighty five said dodson bolivar cannot carry double a blackjack bargainer the most disreputable thing in yancey goree s law office was goree himself sprawled in his creakv old arm chair the rickety little office built of red brick was set flush with the street the main street of the town of bethel bethel rested upon the foot hills of the blue ridge above it the mountains were piled to the sky far below it the turbid catawba gleamed yellow along its disconsolate valley the june day was at its sultriest hour bethel dozed in the tepid shade trade was not it was so still that goree reclining in his chair distinctly heard the clicking of the chips in the grand jury room where the court house gang was playing poker from the open back door of the office a well worn path meandered across the grassy lot to the court house the treading out of that path had cost goree all he ever had first inheritance of a few thousand dollars next the old family home and latterly the last shreds of his self respect and manhood the gang had cleaned him out the broken gambler had turned drunkard and parasite he had lived to see this day come when the men who had stripped him denied him a seat at the game his word was no longer to be taken the daily bouts at cards had arranged itself accordingly and to him was assigned the ignoble part of the onlooker the sheriff the county clerk a sportive deputy a gay attorney and a chalk faced man hailing from the valley sat at table and the sheared one was thus tacitly advised to go and grow more wool soon wearying of his ostracism goree had departed for his office muttering to himself as he unsteadily traversed the unlucky pathway after a drink of corn whiskey from a demijohn under the table he had flung himself into the chair staring in a sort of maudlin apathy out at the mountains immersed in the summer haze the little white patch he saw away up on the side of blackjack was laurel the village near which he had been born and bred there also was the birthplace of the feud between the gorees and the coltranes now no direct heir of the gorees survived except this plucked and singed bird of misfortune to the coltranes also but one male supporter was left colonel abner col trane a man of substance and standing a member of the state legislature and a contemporary with goree s father the feud had been a typical one of the region it had left a red record of hate wrong and slaughter but yancey goree was not thinking of feuds his befuddled brain was hopelessly attacking the problem of the future maintenance of himself and his favourite follies of late old friends of the family had seen to it that he had whereof to eat and a place to sleep but whiskey they would not buy for him and he must have whiskey his law business was extinct no case had been intrusted

and pictures musical instruments and papered walls figure it to yourself they exclaim but they cannot tell you in coralio as you shall learn what became of the money that frank goodwin dropped into the orange tree but that shall come later for the palms are fluttering in the breeze bidding us to sport and gaiety v cupid s exile number two the united states of america after looking over its stock of consular timber selected mr john de graffenreid atwood of dalesburg alabama for a successor to willard geddie resigned without prejudice to mr atwood it will have to be acknowledged that in this instance it was the man who sought the office as with the self banished geddie it was nothing less than the artful smiles of lovely woman that had driven johnny atwood to the desperate expedient of accepting office under a despised federal government so that he might go far far away and never see again the false fair face that had wrecked his young life the consulship at coralio seemed to offer a retreat sufficiently removed and romantic enough to inject the necessary drama into the pastoral scenes of dalesburg life it was while playing the part of cupid s exile that johnny added his handiwork to the long list of casualties along the spanish main by his famous manipulation of the shoe market and his unparalleled feat of elevating the most despised and useless weed in his own country from obscurity to be a valuable product in international commerce the trouble began as trouble often begins instead of ending with a romance in dalesburg there was a man named elijah hemstetter who kept a general store his family consisted of one daughter called rosine a name that atoned much for hemstetter this young woman was possessed of plentiful attractions so that the young men of the community were agitated in their bosoms among the more agitated was johnny the son of judge atwood who lived in the big colonial mansion on the edge of dalesburg it would seem that the desirable rosine should have been pleased to return the affection of an atwood a name honored all over the state long before and since the war it does seem that she should have gladly consented to have been led into that stately but rather empty colonial mansion but not so there was a cloud on the horizon a threatening cumulus cloud in the shape of a lively and shrewd young farmer in the neighborhood who dared to enter the lists as a rival to the high born atwood one night johnny propounded to rosine a question that is considered of much importance by the young of the human species the accessories were all there moonlight oleanders magnolias the mockingbird s song whether or no the shadow of pinkney dawson that prosperous young farmer came between them on that occasion is not known but rosine s answer was unfavorable mr john de graffenreid atwood bowed till his hat touched the lawn grass and went away with his head high but with a sore wound in his pedigree and heart a hemstetter refuse an atwood zounds among other accidents of that year was a democratic president judge atwood was a warhorse of democracy johnny persuaded him to set the wheels moving for some foreign appointment he would go away away perhaps in years to come rosine would think how true how faithful his love had been and would drop a tear maybe in the cream she would be skimming for pink dawson s breakfast the wheels of politics revolved and johnny was appointed consul to coralio just before leaving he dropped in at hemstetter s to say good bye there was a queer pinkish look about rosine s eyes and had the two been alone the united states might have had to cast about for another consul but pink dawson was there of course talking about his acre orchard and the three mile alfalfa tract and the acre pasture so johnny shook hands with rosine as coolly as if he were only going to run up to montgomery for a couple of days they had the royal manner when they chose those atwoods if you happen to strike anything in the way of a good investment down there johnny said pink dawson just let me know will you i reckon i could lay my hands on a few extra thousands most any time for a profitable deal certainly pink said johnny pleasantly if i strike anything of that sort i ll let you in with pleasure so johnny went down to mobile and took a fruit steamer for the coast of anchuria when the new consul arrived in coralio the strangeness of the scenes diverted him much he was only twenty two and the grief of youth was not worn like a garment as it is by older men it has its seasons when it reigns and then it is unseated for time by the assertion of the keen senses billy keogh and johnny seemed to conceive a mutual friendship at once keogh took the new consul about town and presented him to the handful of americans and the smaller number of french and germans who made up the foreign contingent and then of course he had to be more formally introduced to the native officials and have his credentials transmitted through an interpreter there was something about the young southerner that the sophisticated keogh liked his manner was simple almost to boyishness but he possessed the cool carelessness of a man of far greater age and experience neither uniforms nor titles red tape nor foreign languages mountains nor sea weighed upon his spirits he was heir to all ages an atwood of dalesburg and you might know every thought conceived to his bosom geddie came down to the consulate to explain the duties and workings of the office he and keogh tried to interest the new consul in their description of the work that his government expected him to perform it s all right said johnnie from the hammock that he had set up as the official reclining place if anything turns up that has to be done i ll let you fellows do it you can t expect a democrat to work during his first term of holding office you might look over these headings suggested geddie of the different lines of exports you will have to keep account of the fruit is classified and there are the valuable woods coffee rubber that last account sounds all right interrupted mr atwood sounds as if it could be stretched i want to buy a new flag a monkey a guitar and a barrel of pineapples will the rubber account stretch over em that s merely statistics said geddie smiling the expense account is what you want it is supposed to have a slight elasticity the stationery items are sometimes carelessly audited by the state department we re wasting our time said keogh this man was born to hold office he penetrates to the root of the art at one step of his eagle eye the true genius of government shows its hand in every word of his speech i didn t take this job with any intention of working explained johnny lazily i wanted to go somewhere in the world where they didn t talk about farms there are none here are there not the kind you are acquainted with answered the ex consul there is no such art here as agriculture there never was a plow or a reaper within the boundaries of anchuria this is the country for me murmured the consul and immediately he fell asleep the cheerful tintypist pursued his intimacy with johnny in spite of open charges that he did so to obtain a preemption on a seat in that coveted spot the rear gallery of the consulate but whether his designs were selfish or purely friendly keogh achieved that desirable privilege few were the nights on which the two could not be found reposing there in the sea breeze with their heels on the railing and the cigars and brandy conveniently near one evening they sat thus mainly silent for their talk had dwindled before the stilling influence of an unusual night there was a great full moon and the sea mother of pearl almost every sound was hushed for the air was but faintly stirring and the town lay panting waiting for the night to cool offshore lay the fruit steamer andador of the vesuvius line full laden and scheduled to sail at six in the morning there were no loiterers on the beach so bright was the moonlight that the two men could see the small pebbles shining on the beach where the gentle surf wetted them then down the coast tacking close to shore slowly swam a little sloop white winged like some snowy sea fowl its course lay within twenty points of the wind s eye so it veered in and out again in long slow strokes like the movements of a graceful skater again the tactics of its crew brought it close in shore this time nearly opposite the consulate and then there blew from the sloop clear and surprising notes as if from a horn of elfland a fairy bugle it might have been sweet and silvery and unexpected playing with spirit the familiar air of home sweet home it was a scene set for the land of the lotus the authority of the sea and the tropics the mystery that attends unknown sails and the prestige of drifting music on moonlit waters gave it an anodynous charm johnny atwood felt it and thought of dalesburg but as soon as keogh s mind had arrived at a theory concerning the peripatetic solo he sprang to the railing and his ear rending yawp fractured the silence of coralio like a cannon shot mel lin ger a hoy the sloop was now on its outward tack but from it came a clear answering hail good bye billy go ing home bye the andador was the sloop s destination no doubt some passenger with a sailing permit from some up the coast point had come down in this sloop to catch the regular fruit steamer on its return trip like a coquettish pigeon the little boat tacked on its eccentric way until at last its white sail was lost to sight against the larger bulk of the fruiter s side that s old h p mellinger explained keogh dropping back into his chair he s going back to new york he was a private secretary of the late hot foot president of this grocery and fruit stand that they call a country his job s over now and i guess old mellinger is glad why does he disappear to music like zo zo the magic queen asked johnny just to show em that he doesn t care that noise you heard is a phonograph said keogh i sold him that mellinger had a graft in this country that was the only thing of its kind in the world the tooting machine saved it for him once and he always carried it around with him afterward tell me about it demanded johnny betraying interest i m no disseminator of narratives said keogh i can use language for purposes of speech but when i attempt a discourse the words come out as they will and they may make sense when they strike the atmosphere or they may not i want to hear about the graft persisted johnny you ve got no right to refuse i ve told you all about every man woman and hitching post in dalesburg you shall hear it said keogh i said my instincts of narrative were perplexed don t you believe it it s an art i ve acquired along with many other of the graces and sciences vi the phonograph and the graft what was this this graft asked johnny with the impatience of the great public to whom tales are told tis contrary to art and philosophy to give you the information said keogh calmly the art of narrative consists in concealing from your audience everything it wants to know until after you expose your favorite opinions on topics foreign to the subject a good story is like a bitter pill with the sugar coating inside of it i will begin if you please with a horoscope located in the cherokee nation and end with a moral tune on the phonograph me and henry horsecollar brought the first phonograph to this country henry was a quarter breed quarter back cherokee educated east in the idioms of football and west in contraband whiskey and a gentleman the same as you and me he was easy and romping in his ways a man about six foot with a kind of rubber tire movement yes he was a little man about five foot five or five foot eleven he was what you would call a medium tall man of average smallness henry had quit college once and the muscogee jail three times the last named institution on account of introducing and selling whisky in the territories henry horsecollar never let any cigar stores come up and stand behind him he didn t belong to that tribe of indians henry and me met at texarkana and figured out this phonograph scheme he had which came to him out of a land allotment in the reservation i had run down from little rock on account of a distressful scene i had witnessed on the street there a man stood on a box and passed around some gold watches screw case stem winders elgin movement very elegant twenty bucks they cost you over the counter at three dollars the crowd fought for the tickers the man happened to find a valise full of them handy and he passed them out like putting hot biscuits on a plate the backs were hard to unscrew but the crowd put its ear to the case and they ticked mollifying and agreeable three of these watches were genuine tickers the rest were only kickers hey why empty cases with one of them horny black bugs that fly around electric lights in em them bugs kick off minutes and seconds industrious and beautiful so this man i was speaking of cleaned up and then he went away because he knew that when it came time to wind watches in little rock an entomologist would be needed and he wasn t one so as i say henry had and i had the idea of introducing the phonograph to south america was henry s but i took to it freely being fond of machinery of all kinds the latin races says henry explaining easy in the idioms he learned at college are peculiarly adapted to be victims of the phonograph they yearn for music and color and gaiety they give wampum to the hand organ man and the four legged chicken in the tent when they re three months behind with the grocery and the bread fruit tree then says i we ll export canned music to the latins but i m mindful of mr julius caesar s account of em where he says omnia gallia in tres partes divisa est which is the same as to say we will need all of our gall in devising means to tree them parties i hated to make a show of education but i was disinclined to be overdone in syntax by a mere indian a member of a race to which we owe nothing except the land on which the united states is situated we bought a fine phonograph in texarkana one of the best make and half a trunkful of records we packed up and took the t and p for new orleans from that celebrated center of molasses and disfranchised coon songs we took a steamer for south america we landed at solitas forty miles up the coast from here twas a palatable enough place to look at the houses were clean and white and to look at em stuck around among the scenery they reminded you of hard boiled eggs served with lettuce there was a block of skyscraper mountains in the suburbs and they kept pretty quiet like they had crept up there and were watching the town and the sea was remarking sh sh sh on the beach and now and then a ripe coconut would drop kerblip in the sand and that was all there was doing yes i judge that town was considerably on the quiet i judge that after gabriel quits blowing his horn and the car starts with philadelphia swinging to the last strap and pine gully arkansas hanging onto the rear step this town of solitas will wake up and ask if anybody spoke the captain went ashore with us and offered to conduct what he seemed to like to call the obsequies he introduced henry and me to the united states consul and a roan man the head of the department of mercenary and licentious dispostions the way it read upon his sign i thouch here again a week from today says the captain by that time we told him we ll be amassing wealth in the interior towns with our galvanized prima donna and correct imitations of sousa s band excavating a march from a tin mine ye ll not says the captain ye ll be hypnotized any gentleman in the audience who kindly steps upon the stage and looks this country in the eye will be converted to the hypothesis that he s but a fly in the elgin creamery ye ll be standing knee deep in the surf waiting for me and your machine for making hamburger steak out of the hitherto respected art of music will be playing there s no place like home henry skinned a twenty off his roll and received from the bureau of mercenary dispositions a paper bearing a red seal and a dialect story and no change then we got the consul full of red wine and struck him for a horoscope he was a thin youngish kind of man i should say past fifty sort of french irish in his affections and puffed up with disconsolation yes he was a flattened kind of man in whom drink lay stagnant inclined to corpulence and misery yes i think he was a kind of dutchman being very sad and genial in his ways the marvelous invention he says entitled the phonograph has never invaded these shores the people have never heard it they would not believe it if they should simple hearted children of nature progress has never condemned them to accept the work of a can opener as an overture and rag time might incite them to a bloody revolution but you can try the experiment the best chance you have is that the populace may not wake up when you play there s two ways says the consul they may take it they may become inebriated with attention like an atlanta colonel listening to marching through georgia or they will get excited and transpose the key of the music with an axe and yourselves into a dungeon in the latter case says the consul i ll do my duty by cabling to the state department and i ll wrap the stars and stripes around you when you come to be shot and threaten them with the vengeance of the greatest gold export and financial reserve nation on earth the flag is full of bullet holes now says the consul made in that way twice before says the consul i have cabled our government for a couple of gunboats to protect american citizens the first time the department sent me a pair of gum boots the other time was when a man named pease was going to be executed here they referred that appeal to the secretary of agriculture let us now disturb the senor behind the bar for a subsequence of the red wine thus soliloquized the consul of solitas to me and henry horsecollar but notwithstanding we hired a room that afternoon in the calle de los angeles the main street that runs along the shore and put our trunks there twas a good sized room dark and cheerful but small twas on a various street diversified by houses and conservatory plants the peasantry of the city passed to and fro on the fine pasturage between the sidewalks twas for the world like an opera chorus when the royal kafoozlum is about to enter we were rubbing the dust off the machine and getting fixed to start business the next day when a big fine looking white man in white clothes stopped at the door and looked in we extended the invitations and he walked inside and sized us up he was chewing a long cigar and wrinkling his eyes meditative like a girl trying to decide which dress to wear to the party new york he says to me finally originally and from time to time i says hasn t it rubbed off yet it s simple says he when you know how it s the fit of the vest they don t cut vests right anywhere else coats maybe but not vests the white man looks at henry horsecollar and hesitates injun says henry tame injun mellinger says the man homer p mellinger boys you re confiscated you re babes in the wood without a chaperon or referee and it s my duty to start you going i ll knock out the props and launch you proper in the pellucid waters of this tropical mud puddle you ll have to be christened and if you ll come with me i ll break a bottle of wine across your bows according to hoyle well for two days homer p mellinger did the honors that man cut ice in anchuria he was it he was the royal kafoozlum if me and henry was babes in the wood he was a robin redbreast from the topmost bough him and me and henry horsecollar locked arms and toted that phonograph around and had wassail and diversions everywhere we found doors open we went inside and set the machine going and mellinger called upon the people to observe the artful music and his two lifelong friends the senores americanos the opera chorus was agitated with esteem and followed us from house to house there was a different kind of drink to be had with every tune the natives had acquirements of a pleasant thing in the way of a drink that gums itself to the recollection they chop off the end of a green coconut and pour in on the juice of it french brandy and other adjuvants we had them and other things mine and henry s money was counterfeit everything was on homer p mellinger that man could find rolls of bills concealed in places on his person where hermann the wizard couldn t have conjured out a rabbit or an omelette he could have founded universities and made orchid collections and then had enough left to purchase the colored vote of his country henry and me wondered what his graft was one evening he told us boys said he i ve deceived you you think i m a painted butterfly but in fact i m the hardest worked man in this country ten years ago i landed on its shores and two years ago on the point of its jaw yes i guess i can get the decision over this ginger cake commonwealth at the end of any round i choose i ll confide in you because you are my countrymen and guests even if you have assaulted my adopted shores with the worst system of noises ever set to music my job is private secretary to the president of this republic and my duties are running it i m not headlined in the bills but i m the mustard in the salad dressing just the same there isn t a law goes before congress there isn t a concession granted there isn t an import duty levied but what h p mellinger he cooks and seasons it in the front office i fill the president s inkstand and search visiting statesmen for dirks and dynamite but in the back room i dictate the policy of the government you d never guess in the world how i got my pull it s the only graft of its kind on earth i ll put you wise you remember the old top liner in the copy book honesty is the best policy that s it i m working honestly for a graft i m the only honest man in the republic the government knows it the people know it the boodlers know it the foreign investors know it i make the government keep its faith if a man is promised a job he gets it if outside capital buys a concession it gets the goods i run the monopoly of square dealing here there s no competition if colonel diogenes were to flash his lantern in this precinct he d have my address inside of two minutes there isn t big money in it but it s a sure thing and lets a man sleep of nights thus homer p mellinger made oration to me and henry horsecollar and later he divested himself of this remark boys i m to hold a soiree this evening with a gang of leading citizens and i want your assistance you bring the musical corn sheller and give the affair the outside appearance of a function there s important business on hand but it mustn t show i can talk to you people i ve been pained for years on account of not having anybody to blow off and brag to i get homesick sometimes and i d swap the entire perquisites of office for just one hour to have a stein and a caviar sandwich somewhere on thirty fourth street and stand and watch the street cars go by and smell the peanut roaster at old giuseppe s fruit stand yes said i there s fine caviar at billy renfrew s cafe corner of thirty fourth and god knows it interrupts mellinger and if you d told me you knew billy renfrew i d have invented tons of ways of making you happy billy was my side kicker in new york there is a man who never knew what crooked was here i am working honesty for a graft but that man loses money on it carrambos i get sick at times of this country everything s rotten from the executive down to the coffee pickers they re plotting to down each other and skin their friends if a mule driver takes off his hat to an official that man figures it out that he s a popular idol and set his pegs to stir up a revolution and upset the administration it s one of my little chores as private secretary to smell out these revolutions and affix the kibosh before they break out and scratch the paint off the government property that s why i m down here now in this mildewed coast town the governor of the district and his crew are plotting to uprise i ve got every one of their names and they re invited to listen to the phonograph tonight compliments of h p m that s the way i ll get them in a bunch and things are on the program to happen to them we three were sitting at table in the cantina of the purified saints mellinger poured out wine and was looking some worried i was thinking they re a sharp crowd he says kind of fretful they re capitalized by a foreign syndicate after rubber and they re loaded to the muzzle for bribing i m sick goes on mellinger of comic opera i want to smell east river and wear suspenders again at times i feel loke throwing up my job but i m d n fool enough to be sort of proud of it there s mellinger they say here por dios you can t touch him with a million i d like to take that record back and show it to billy renfrow some day and that tightens my grip whenever i see a fat thing that i could corral just by winking one eye and losing my graft by they can t monkey with me they know it what money i get i make honest and spend it some day i ll make a pile and go back and eat caviar with billy tonight i ll show you how to handle a bunch of corruptionists i ll show them what mellinger private secretary means when you spell it with the cotton and tissue paper off mellinger appears shaky and breaks his glass against the neck of the bottle i says to myself white man if i m not mistaken there s been a bait laid out where the tail of your eye could see it that night according to arrangements me and henry took the phonograph to a room in a dobe house in a dirty side street where the grass was knee high twas a long room lit with smoky oil lamps there was plenty of chairs and a table at the back end we set the phonograph on the table mellinger was there walking up and down disturbed in his predicaments he chewed cigars and spat em out and he bit the thumb nail of his left hand by and by the invitations to the musicale come sliding in by pairs and threes and spade flushes their color was of a diversity running from a three day s smoked meerschaum to a patent leather polish they were as polite as wax being devastated with enjoyments to give senor mellinger the good evenings i understood their spanish talk i ran a pumping engine two years in a mexican silver mine and had it pat but i never let on maybe fifty of em had come and was seated when in slid the king bee the governor of the district mellinger met him at the door and escorted him to the grand stand when i saw that latin man i knew that mellinger private secretary had all the dances on his card taken that was a big squashy man the color of a rubber overshoe and he had an eye like a head waiter s mellinger explained fluent in the castilian idioms that his soul was disconcerted with joy at introducing to his respected friends america s greatest invention the wonder of the age henry got the cue and run on an elegant brass band record and the festivities became initiated the governor man had a bit of english under his hat and when the music was choked off he says ver r ree fine gr r r r racias the american gentlemen the so esplendeed moosic as to playee the table was a long one and henry and me sat at the end of it next the wall the governor sat at the other end homer p mellinger stood at the side of it i was just wondering how mellinger was going to handle his crowd when the home talent suddenly opened the services that governor man was suitable for uprisings and policies i judge he was a ready kind of man who took his own time yes he was full of attention and immediateness he leaned his hands on the table and imposed his face toward the secretary man do the american senors understand spanish he asks in his native accents they do not says mellinger then listen goes on the latin man prompt the musics are of sufficient prettiness but not of necessity let us speak of business i well know why we are here since i observe my compatriots you had a whisper yesterday senor mellinger of our proposals tonight we will speak out we know that you stand in the president s favor and we know your influence the government will be changed we know the worth of your services we esteem your friendship and aid so much that mellinger praises his hand but the governor man bottles him up do not speak until i have done the governor man then draws a package wrapped in paper from his pocket and lays it on the table by mellinger s hand in that you will find fifty thousand dollars in money of your country you can do nothing against us but you can be worth that for us go back to the capital and obey our instructions take that money now we trust you you will find with it a paper giving in detail the work you will be expected to do for us do not have the unwiseness to refuse the governor man paused with his eyes fixed on mellinger full of expressions and observances i looked at mellinger and was glad billy renfrew couldn t see him then the sweat was popping out on his forehead and he stood dumb tapping the little package with the ends of his fingers the colorado maduro gang was after his graft he had only to change his politics and stuff five fingers in his inside pocket henry whispers to me and wants the pause in the program interpreted i whisper back h p is up against a bribe senator s size and the coons have got him going i saw mellinger s hand moving closer to the package he s weakening i whispered to henry we ll remind him says henry of the peanut roaster on thirty fourth street new york henry stooped down and got a record from the basketful we d brought slid it in the phonograph and started her off it was a cornet solo very neat and beautiful and the name of it was home sweet home not one of them fifty odd men in the room moved while it was playing and the governor man kept his eyes steady on mellinger i saw mellinger s head go up little by little and his hand came creeping away from the package not until the last note sounded did anybody stir and there homer p mellinger takes up the bundle of boodle and slams it in the governor man s face that s my answer says mellinger private secretary and there ll be another in the morning i have proofs of conspiracy against every man of you the show is over gentlemen there s one more act puts in the governor man you are a servant i believe employed by the president to copy letters and answer raps at the door i am governor here senores i call upon you in the name of the cause to seize this man that brindled gang of conspirators shoved back their chairs and advanced in force i could see where mellinger had made a mistake in massing his enemy so as to make a grand stand play i think he made another one too but we can pass that mellinger s idea of a graft and mine being different according to estimations and points of view there was only one window and door in that room and they were in the front end here was fifty odd latin men coming in a bunch to obstruct the legislation of mellinger you may say there were three of us for me and henry simultaneous declared new york city and the cherokee nation in sympathy with the weaker party then it was that henry horsecollar rose to a point of disorder and intervened showing admirable the advantages of education as applied to the american indian s natural intellect and native refinement he stood up and smoothed back his hair on each side with his hands as you have seen little girls do when they play get behind me both of you says henry what s it to be chief i asked i m going to buck center says henry in his football idioms there isn t a tackle in the lot of them follow me close and rush the game then that cultured red man exhaled an arrangement of sounds with his mouth that made the latin aggregation pause with thoughtfulness and hesitations the matter of his proclamation seemed to be a cooperation of the carlisle war whoop with the cherokee college yell he went at the chocolate team like a bean out of a little boy s nigger shooter his right elbow laid out the governor man on the gridiron and he made a lane the length of the crowd so wide that a woman could have carried a stepladder through it without striking against anything all mellinger and me had to do was to follow it took us just three minutes to get out of that street around to military headquarters where mellinger had things his own way a colonel and a battalion of bare toed infantry turned out and went back to the scene of the musicale with us but the conspirator gang was gone but we recaptured the phonograph with honors of war and marched back to the cuartel with it playing all coons look alike to me the next day mellinger takes me and henry to one side and begins to shed tens and twenties i want to buy that phonograph says he i liked that last tune it played at the soiree this is more money than the machine is worth says i tis government expense money says mellinger the government pays for it and it s getting the tune grinder cheap me and henry knew that pretty well we knew that it had saved homer p mellinger s graft when he was on the point of losing it but we never let him know we knew it now you boys better slide off further down the coast for a while says mellinger till i get the screws put on these fellows here if you don t they ll give you trouble and if you ever happen to see billy renfrew again before i do tell him i m coming back to new york as soon as i can make a stake honest me and henry laid low until the day the steamer came back when we saw the captain s boat on the beach we went down and stood in the edge of the water the captain grinned when he saw us i told you you d be waiting he says where s the hamburger machine it stays behind i says to play home sweet home i told you so says the captain again climb in the boat and that said keogh is the way me and henry horsecollar introduced the phonograph into this country henry went back to the states but i ve been rummaging around in the tropics ever since they say mellinger never travelled a mile after that without his phonograph i guess it kept him reminded about his graft whenever he saw the siren voice of the boodler tip him the wink with a bribe in his hand i suppose he s taking it home with him as a souvenir remarked the consul not as a souvenir said keogh he ll need two of em in new york running day and night vii money maze the new administration of anchuria entered upon its duties and privileges with enthusiasm its first act was to send an agent to coralio with imperative orders to recover if possible the sum of money ravished from the treasury by the ill fated miraflores colonel emilio falcon the private secretary of losada the new president was despatched from the capital upon this important mission the position of private secretary to a tropical president is a responsible one he must be a diplomat a spy a ruler of men a body guard to his chief and a smeller out of plots and nascent revolutions often he is the power behind the throne the dictator of policy and a president chooses him with a dozen times the care with which he selects a matrimonial mate colonel falcon a handsome and urbane gentleman of castilian courtesy and debonnaire manners came to coralio with the task before him of striking upon the cold trail of the lost money there he conferred with the military authorities who had received instructions to cooperate with him in the search colonel falcon established his headquarters in one of the rooms of the casa morena here for a week he held informal sittings much as if he were a kind of unified grand jury and summoned before him all those whose testimony might illumine the financial tragedy that had accompanied the less momentous one of the late president s death two or three who were thus examined among whom was the barber esteban declared that they had identified the body of the president before its burial of a truth testified esteban before the mighty secretary it was he the president consider how could i shave a man and not see his face he sent for me to shave him in a small house he had a beard very black and thick had i ever seen the president before why not i saw him once ride forth in a carriage from the vapor in solitas when i shaved him he gave me a gold piece and said there was to be no talk but i am a liberal i am devoted to my country and i spake of these things to senor goodwin it is known said colonel falcon smoothly that the late president took with him an american leather valise containing a large amount of money did you see that de veras no esteban answered the light in the little house was but a small lamp by which i could scarcely see to shave the president such a thing there may have been but i did not see it no also in the room was a young lady a senorita of much beauty that i could see even in so small a light but the money senor or the thing in which it was carried that i did not see the comandante and other officers gave testimony that they had been awakened and alarmed by the noise of a pistol shot in the hotel de los extranjeros hurrying thither to protect the peace and dignity of the republic they found a man lying dead with a pistol clutched in his hand beside him was a young woman weeping sorely senor goodwin was also in the room when they entered it but of the valise of money they saw nothing madame timotea ortiz the proprietress of the hotel in which the game of fox in the morning had been played out told of the coming of the two guests to her house to my house they came said she one senor not quite old and one senorita of sufficient handsomeness they desired not to eat or to drink not even of my aguardiente which is the best to their rooms they ascended numero nueve and numero diez later came senor goodwin who ascended to speak with them then i heard a great noise like that of a canon and they said that the pobre presidente had shot himself esta bueno i saw nothing of money or of the thing you call veliz that you say he carried it in colonel falcon soon came to the reasonable conclusion that if any one in coralio could furnish a clue to the vanished money frank goodwin must be the man but the wise secretary pursued a different course in seeking information from the american goodwin was a powerful friend to the new administration and one who was not to be carelessly dealt with in respect to either his honesty or his courage even the private secretary of his excellency hesitated to have this rubber prince and mahogany baron haled before him as a common citizen of anchuria so he sent goodwin a flowery epistle each word petal dripping with honey requesting the favor of an interview goodwin replied with an invitation to dinner at his own house before the hour named the american walked over to the casa morena and greeted his guest frankly and friendly then the two strolled in the cool of the afternoon to goodwin s home in the environs the american left colonel falcon in a big cool shadowed room with a floor of inlaid and polished woods that any millionaire in the states would have envied excusing himself for a few minutes he crossed a patio shaded with deftly arranged awnings and plants and entered a long room looking upon the sea in the opposite wing of the house the broad jalousies were opened wide and the ocean breeze flowed in through the room an invisible current of coolness and health goodwin s wife sat near one of the windows making a water color sketch of the afternoon seascape here was a woman who looked to be happy and more she looked to be content had a poet been inspired to pen just similes concerning her favor he would have likened her full clear eyes with their white encircled gray irises to moonflowers with none of the goddesses whose traditional charms have become coldly classic would the discerning rhymester have compared her she was purely paradisaic not olympian if you can imagine eve after the eviction beguiling the flaming warriors and serenely reentering the garden you will have her just so human and still so harmonious with eden seemed mrs goodwin when her husband entered she looked up and her lips curved and parted her eyelids fluttered twice or thrice a movement remindful proesy forgive us of the tail wagging of a faithful dog and a little ripple went through her like the commotion set up in a weeping willow by a puff of wind thus she ever acknowledged his coming were it twenty times a day if they who sometimes sat over their wine in coralio reshaping old diverting stories of the madcap career of isabel guilbert could have seen the wife of frank goodwin that afternoon in the estimable aura of her happy wifehood they might have disbelieved or have agreed to forget those graphic annals of the life of the one for whom their president gave up his country and his honor i have brought a guest to dinner said goodwin one colonel falcon from san mateo he is come on government business i do not think you will care to see him so i prescribe for you one of those convenient and indisputable feminine headaches he has come to inquire about the lost money has he not asked mrs goodwin going on with her sketch a good guess acknowledged goodwin he has been holding an inquisition among the natives for three days i am next on his list of witnesses but as he feels shy about dragging one of uncle sam s subjects before him he consents to give it the outward appearance of a social function he will apply the torture over my own wine and provender has he found any one who saw the valise of money not a soul even madama ortiz whose eyes are so sharp for the sight of a revenue official does not remember that there was any baggage mrs goodwin laid down her brush and sighed i am so sorry frank she said that they are giving you so much trouble about the money but we can t let them know about it can we not without doing our intelligence a great injustice said goodwin with a smile and a shrug that he had picked up from the natives americano though i am they would have me in the calaboza in half an hour if they knew we had appropriated that valise no we must appear as ignorant about the money as the other ignoramuses in coralio do you think that this man they have sent suspects you she asked with a little pucker of her brows he d better not said the american carelessly it s lucky that no one caught a sight of the valise except myself as i was in the rooms when the shot was fired it is not surprising that they should want to investigate my part in the affair rather closely but there s no cause for alarm this colonel is down on the list of events for a good dinner with a dessert of american bluff that will end the matter i think mrs goodwin rose and walked to the window goodwin followed and stood by her side she leaned to him and rested in the protection of his strength as she had always rested since that dark night on which he had first made himself her tower of refuge thus they stood for a little while straight through the lavish growth of tropical branch and leaf and vine that confronted them had been cunningly trimmed a vista that ended at the cleared environs of coralio on the banks of the mangrove swamp at the other end of the aerial tunnel they could see the grave and wooden headpiece that bore the name of the unhappy president miraflores from this window when the rains forbade the open and from the green and shady slopes of goodwin s fruitful lands when the skies were smiling his wife was wont to look upon that grave with a gentle sadness that was now scarcely a mar to her happiness i loved him so frank she said even after that terrible flight and its awful ending and you have been so good to me and have made me so happy it has all grown into such a strange puzzle if they were to find out that we got the money do you think they would force you to make the amount good to the government they would undoubtedly try answered goodwin you are right about its being a puzzle and it must remain a puzzle to falcon and all his countrymen until it solves itself you and i who know more than any one else only know half of the solution we must not let even a hint about this money get abroad let them come to the theory that the president concealed it in the mountains during his journey or that he found means to ship it out of the country before he reached coralio i don t think that falcon suspects me he is making a closer investigation according to his orders but he will find out nothing thus they spake together had any one overheard or overseen them as they discussed the lost funds of anchuria there would have been a second puzzle presented for upon the faces and in the bearing of each of them was visible if countenances are to be believed saxon honesty and pride and honorable thoughts in goodwin s steady eye and firm lineaments molded into material shape by the inward spirit of kindness and generosity and courage there was nothing reconcilable with his words as for his wife physiognomy championed her even in the face of their accusive talk nobility was in her guise purity was in her glance the devotion that she manifested had not even the appearance of that feeling that now and then inspires a woman to share the guilt of her partner out of the pathetic greatness other love no there was a discrepancy here between what the eye would have seen and the ear have heard dinner was served to goodwin and his guest in the patio under cool foliage and flowers the american begged the illustrious secretary to excuse the absence of mrs goodwin who was suffering he said from a headache brought on by a slight calentura after the meal they lingered according to the custom over their coffee and cigars colonel falcon with true castilian delicacy waited for his host to open the question that they had met to discuss he had not long to wait as soon as the cigars were lighted the american cleared the way by inquiring whether the secretary s investigations in the town had furnished him with any clue to the lost funds i have found no one yet admitted colonel falcon who even had sight of the valise or the money yet i have persisted it has been proven in the capital that president miraflores set out from san mateo with one hundred thousand dollars belonging to the government accompanied by senorita isabel guilbert the opera singer the government officially and personally is loathe to believe concluded colonel falcon with a smile that our late president s tastes would have permitted him to abandon on the route as excess baggage either of the desirable articles with which his flight was burdened i suppose you would like to hear what i have to say about the affair said goodwin coming directly to the point it will not require many words on that night with others of our friends here i was keeping a lookout for the president having been notified of his flight by a telegram in our national cipher from englehart one of our leaders in the capital about ten o clock that night i saw a man and a woman hurrying along the streets they went to the hotel de los extranjeros and engaged rooms i followed them upstairs leaving esteban who had come up to watch outside the barber had told me that he had shaved the beard from the president s face that night therefore i was prepared when i entered the rooms to find him with a smooth face when i apprehended him in the name of the people he drew a pistol and shot himself instantly in a few minutes many officers and citizens were on the spot i suppose you have been informed of the subsequent facts goodwin paused losada s agent maintained an attitude of waiting as if he expected a continuance and now went on the american looking steadily into the eyes of the other man and giving each word a deliberate emphasis you will oblige me by attending carefully to what i have to add i saw no valise or receptacle of any kind or any money belonging to the republic of anchuria if president miraflores decamped with any funds belonging to the treasury of this country or to himself or to any one else i saw no trace of it in the house or elsewhere at that time or at any other does that statement cover the ground of the inquiry you wished to make of me colonel falcon bowed and described a fluent curve with his cigar his duty was performed goodwin was not to be disputed he was a loyal supporter of the government and enjoyed the full confidence of the new president his rectitude had been the capital that had brought him fortune in anchuria just as it had formed the lucrative graft of mellinger the secretary of miraflores i thank you senor goodwin said falcon for speaking plainly but senor goodwin i am instructed to pursue every clue that presents itself in this matter there is one that i have not yet touched upon our friends in france senor have a saying cherchez la femme when there is a mystery without a clue but here we do not have to search the woman who accompanied the late president in his flight must surely i must interrupt you there interposed goodwin it is true that when i entered the hotel for the purpose of intercepting president miraflores i found a lady there i must beg of you to remember that that lady is now my wife i speak for her as i do for myself she knows nothing of the fate of the valise or of the money that you are seeking you will say to his excellency that i guarantee her innocence i do not need to add to you colonel falcon that i do not care to have her questioned or disturbed colonel falcon bowed again por supuesto no he cried and to indicate that the inquiry was ended he added and now senor let me beg of you to show me that sea view from your galeria of which you spoke i am a lover of the sea in the early evening goodwin walked back to the town with his guest leaving him at the corner of the calle grande as he was returning homeward one beelzebub blythe with the air of a courtier and the outward aspect of a scarecrow pounced upon him hopefully from the door of a pulperia blythe had been re christened beelzebub as an acknowledgement of the greatness of his fall once in some distant paradise lost he had foregathered with the angels of the earth but fate had hurled him headlong down to the tropics where flamed in his bosom a fire that was seldom quenched in coralio they called him a beach comber but he was in reality a categorical idealist who strove to anamorphosize the dull verities of life by the means of brandy and rum as beelzebub himself might have held in his clutch with unwitting tenacity his harp or crown during his tremendous fall so his namesake had clung to his gold rimmed eyeglasses as the only souvenir of his lost estate these he wore with impressiveness and distinction while he combed beaches and extracted toll from his friends by some mysterious means he kept his drink reddened face always smoothly shaven for the rest he sponged gracefully upon whomsoever he could for enough to keep him pretty drunk and sheltered from the rains and night dews hallo goodwin called the derelict airily i was hoping i d strike you i wanted to see you particularly suppose we go where we can talk of course you know there s a chap down here looking up the money old miraflores lost yes said goodwin i ve been talking with him let s go into espada s place i can spare you ten minutes they went into the pulperia and sat at a little table upon stools with rawhide tops have a drink said goodwin they can t bring it too quickly said blythe i ve been in a drought ever since morning hi muchacho el aguardiente por aca now what do you want to see me about asked goodwin when the drinks were before them confound it old man drawled blythe why do you spoil a golden moment like this with business i wanted to see you well this has the preference he gulped down his brandy and gazed longingly into the empty glass have another suggested goodwin between gentlemen said the fallen angel i don t quite like your use of that word another it isn t quite delicate but the concrete idea that the word represents is not displeasing the glasses were refilled blythe sipped blissfully from his as he began to enter the state of a true idealist i must trot along in a minute or two hinted goodwin was there anything in particular blythe did not reply at once old losada would make it a hot country he remarked at length for the man who swiped that gripsack of treasury

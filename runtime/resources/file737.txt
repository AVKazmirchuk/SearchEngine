without anything it ll be a dry old easter for me pearson took off his hat and drove road bunner at a gallop into the chaparral east of the espinosa ranch house as his stirrups rattled against the brush burrows s long legged sorrel struck out down the narrow stretch of open prairie to the southwest tonia hung up her quirt and went into the sitting room i m mighty sorry daughter that you didn t get your hat said her mother oh don t worry mother said tonia coolly i ll have a new hat all right in time to morrow when burrows reached the end of the strip of prairie he pulled his sorrel to the right and let him pick his way daintily across a sacuista flat through which ran the ragged dry bed of an arroyo then up a gravelly hill matted with bush the hoarse scrambled and at length emerged with a snort of satisfaction into a stretch of high level prairie grassy and dotted with the lighter green of mesquites in their fresh spring foliage always to the right burrows bore until in a little while he struck the old indian trail that followed the nueces southward and that passed twenty eight miles to the southeast through lone elm here burrows urged the sorrel into a steady lope as he settled himself in the saddle for a long ride he heard the drumming of hoofs the hollow thwack of chaparral against wooden stirrups the whoop of a comanche and wells pearson burst out of the brush at the right of the trail like a precocious yellow chick from a dark green easter egg except in the presence of awing femininity melancholy found no place in pearson s bosom in tonia s presence his voice was as soft as a summer bullfrog s in his reedy nest now at his gleesome yawp rabbits a mile away ducked their ears and sensitive plants closed their fearful fronds moved your lambing camp pretty far from the ranch haven t you neighbor asked pearson as road runner fell in at the sorrel s side twenty eight miles said burrows looking a little grim pearson s laugh woke an owl one hour too early in his water elm on the river bank half a mile away all right for you sheepman i like an open game myself we re two locoed he milliners hat hunting in the wilderness i notify you burr to mind your corrals we ve got an even start and the one that gets the headgear will stand some higher at the espinosa you ve got a good pony said burrows eyeing road runner s barrel like body and tapering legs that moved as regularly as the pistonrod of an engine it s a race of course but you re too much of a horseman to whoop it up this soon say we travel together till we get to the home stretch i m your company agreed pearson and i admire your sense if there s hats at lone elm one of em shall set on miss tonia s brow to morrow and you won t be at the crowning i ain t bragging burr but that sorrel of yours is weak in the fore legs my horse against yours offered burrows that miss tonia wears the hat i take her to cactus to morrow i ll take you up shouted pearson but oh it s just like horse stealing for me i can use that sorrel for a lady s animal when when somebody comes over to mucho calor and burrows dark face glowered so suddenly that the cowman broke off his sentence but pearson could never feel any pressure for long what s all this easter business about burr he asked cheerfully why do the women folks have to have new hats by the almanac or bust all cinches trying to get em it s a seasonable statute out of the testaments explained burrows it s ordered by the pope or somebody and it has something to do with the zodiac i don t know exactly but i think it was invented by the egyptians it s an all right jubilee if the heathens did put their brand on it said pearson or else tonia wouldn t have anything to do with it and they pull it off at church too suppose there ain t but one hat in the lone elm store burr then said burrows darkly the best man of us ll take it back to the espinosa oh man cried pearson throwing his hat high and catching it again there s nothing like you come off the sheep ranges before you talk good and collateral to the occasion and if there s more than one then said burrows we ll pick our choice and one of us ll get back first with his and the other won t there never was two souls proclaimed pearson to the stars that beat more like one heart than yourn and mine me and you might be riding on a unicorn and thinking out of the same piece of mind at a little past midnight the riders loped into lone elm the half a hundred houses of the big village were dark on its only street the big wooden store stood barred and shuttered in a few moments the horses were fastened and pearson was pounding cheerfully on the door of old sutton the storekeeper the barrel of a winchester came through a cranny of a solid window shutter followed by a short inquiry wells pearson of the mucho calor and burrows of green valley was the response we want to buy some goods in the store sorry to wake you up but we must have em come on out vncle tommy and get a move on you uncle tommy was slow but at length they got him behind his counter with a kerosene lamp

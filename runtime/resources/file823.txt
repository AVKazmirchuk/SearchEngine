said was that i did not believe it practicable just now the guys with wads are not in the frame of mind to slack up on the mazuma and the man with the portable tin banqueting canister isn t exactly ready to join the bible class you can bet your variegated socks that the situation is all spifflicated up from the battery to breakfast what the country needs is for some bully old bloke like cobden or some wise guy like old ben frank lin to sashay up to the front and biff the nigger s head with the baseball do you catch my smoke what rivington pulled me by the arm impatiently please come on he

people that is quite unique did you say that this is the bowery variety of slang oh well said rivington giving it up i ll tell you straight that s one of our college professors talking he ran down for a day or two at the club it s a sort of fad with him lately to use slang in his conversation he thinks it improves language the man he is talking to is one of new york s famous social economists now will you come on you can t use that you know no i agreed i can t use that would you call that typical of new york of course not said rivington with a sigh of relief i m glad you see the difference but if you want to hear the real old tough bowery slang i ll take you down where you ll get your fill of it i would like it i said that is if it s the real thing i ve often read it in books but i never heard it do you think it will be dangerous to go unprotected among those characters oh no said rivington not at this time of night to tell the truth i haven t been along the bowery in a long time but i know it as well as i do broadway we ll look up some of the typical bowery boys and get them to talk it ll be worth your while they talk a peculiar dialect that you won t hear any where else on earth

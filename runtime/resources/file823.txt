world is a rock to you no doubt but you must be an aaron and smite it with your rod then things better than water will gush out of it for you that is what the world is for it gives to me whatever i want from it god has blessed you said the old man it is only work that i have known and now i can get no more i must go home said morley rising and buttoning his coat i stopped here only for a smoke i hope you may find work may your kindness be rewarded this night said the old man oh said morley you have your wish already i am satisfied i think good luck follows me like a dog i am for yonder bright hotel across the square for the night and what a moon that is lighting up the city to night i think no one enjoys the moonlight and such little things as i do well a goodnight to you morley walked to the corner where he would cross to his hotel he blew slow streams of smoke from his cigar heavenward a policeman passing saluted to his benign nod what a fine moon it was the clock struck nine as a girl just entering womanhood stopped on the corner waiting for the approaching car she was hurrying as if homeward from employment or delay her eyes were clear and pure she was dressed in simple white she looked eagerly for the car and neither to the right nor the left morley knew her eight years before he had sat on the same bench with her at school there had been no sentiment between them nothing but the friendship of innocent days but he turned down the side street to a quiet spot and laid his suddenly burning face against the cool iron of a lamp post and said dully god i wish i could die the buyer from cactus city it is well that hay fever and colds do not obtain in the healthful vicinity of cactus city texas for the dry goods emporium of navarro platt situated there is not to be sneezed at twenty thousand people in cactus city scatter their silver coin with liberal hands for the things that their hearts desire the bulk of this semiprecious metal goes to navarro platt their huge brick building covers enough ground to graze a dozen head of sheep you can buy of them a rattlesnake skin necktie an automobile or an eighty five dollar latest style ladies tan coat in twenty different shades navarro platt first introduced pennies west of the colorado river they had been ranchmen with business heads who saw that the world did not necessarily have to cease its revolutions after free grass went out every spring navarro senior partner fifty five half spanish cosmopolitan able polished had gone on to new york to buy goods this year he shied at taking up the long trail he was undoubtedly growing older and he looked at his watch several times a day before the hour came for his siesta john he said to his junior partner you shall go on this year to buy the goods platt looked tired i m told said he that new york is a plumb dead town but i ll go i can take a whirl in san antone for a few days on my way and have some fun two weeks later a man in a texas full dress suit black frock coat broad brimmed soft white hat and lay down collar inch high with black wrought iron necktie entered tile wholesale cloak and suit establishment of zizzbaum son on lower broadway old zizzbaum had the eye of an osprey the memory of an elephant and a mind that unfolded from him in three movements like the puzzle of the carpenter s rule he rolled to the front like a brunette polar bear and shook platt s hand and how is the good mr navarro in texas he said the trip was too long for him this year so we welcome mr platt instead a bull s eye said platt and i d give forty acres of unirrigated pecos county land to know how you did it i knew grinned zizzbaum just as i know that the rainfall in el paso for the year was inches or an increase of inches and that therefore navarro platt will buy a stock of suits this spring instead of as in a dry year but that will be tomorrow there is first a cigar in my private office that will remove from your mouth the taste of the ones you smuggle across the rio grande and like because they are smuggled it was late in the afternoon and business for the day had ended zizzbaum left platt with a half smoked cigar and came out of the private office to son who was arranging his diamond scarfpin before a mirror ready to leave abey lie said you will have to take mr platt around to night and show him things they are customers for ten years mr navarro and i we played chess every moment of spare time when he came that is good but mr platt is a young man and this is his first visit to new york he should amuse easily all right said abey screwing the guard tightly on his pin i ll take him on after he s seen the flatiron and the head waiter at the hotel astor and heard the phonograph play under the old apple tree it ll be half past ten and mr texas will be ready to roll up in his blanket i ve got a supper engagement at but he ll be all to the mrs winslow before then the next morning at platt walked into the store ready to do business he had a bunch of hyacinths pinned on his lapel zizzbaum himself waited on him navarro platt were good customers and never failed to take their discount for cash and what did you think of our little town asked zizzbaum with the fatuous smile of the manhattanite i shouldn t care to live in it said the texan your son and i knocked around quite a little last night you ve got good water but cactus city is better lit up we ve got a few lights on broadway don t you think mr platt and a good many shadows said platt i think i like your horses best i haven t seen a crowbait since i ve been in town zizzbaum led him up stairs to show the samples of suits ask miss asher to come he said to a clerk miss asher came and platt of navarro platt felt for the first time the wonderful bright light of romance and glory descend upon him he stood still as a granite cliff above the canon of the colorado with his wide open eyes fixed upon her she noticed his look and flushed a little which was contrary to her custom miss asher was the crack model of zizzbaum son she was of the blond type known as medium and her measurements even went the required standard a little better she had been at zizzbaum s two years and knew her business her eye was bright but cool and had she chosen to match her gaze against the optic of the famed basilisk that fabulous monster s gaze would have wavered and softened first incidentally she knew buyers now mr platt said zizzbaum i want you to see these princess gowns in the light shades they will be the thing in your climate this first if you please miss asher swiftly in and out of the dressing room the prize model flew each time wearing a new costume and looking more stunning with every change she posed with absolute self possession before the stricken buyer who stood tongue tied and motionless while zizzbaum orated oilily of the styles on the model s face was her faint impersonal professional smile that seemed to cover something like weariness or contempt when the display was over platt seemed to hesitate zizzbaum was a little anxious thinking that his customer might be inclined to try elsewhere but platt was only looking over in his mind the best building sites in cactus city trying to select one on which to build a house for his wife to be who was just then in the dressing room taking off an evening gown of lavender and tulle take your time mr platt said zizzbaum think it over to night you won t find anybody else meet our prices on goods like these i m afraid you re having a dull time in new york mr platt a young man like you of course you miss the society of the ladies wouldn t you like a nice young lady to take out to dinner this evening miss asher now is a very nice young lady she will make it agreeable for you why she doesn t know me said platt wonderingly she doesn t know anything about me would she go i m not acquainted with her would she go repeated zizzbaum with uplifted eyebrows sure she would go i will introduce you sure she would go he called miss asher loudly she came calm and slightly contemptuous in her white shirt waist and plain black skirt mr platt would like the pleasure of your company to dinner this evening said zizzbaum walking away sure said miss asher looking at the ceiling i d be much pleased nine eleven west twentieth street what time say seven o clock all right but please don t come ahead of time i room with a school teacher and she doesn t allow any gentlemen to call in the room there isn t any parlor so you ll have to wait in the hall i ll be ready at half past seven platt and miss asher sat at a table in a broadway restaurant she was dressed in a plain filmy black platt didn t know that it was all a part of her day s work with the unobtrusive aid of a good waiter he managed to order a respectable dinner minus the usual broadway preliminaries miss asher flashed upon him a dazzling smile mayn t i have something to drink she asked why certainly said platt anything you want a dry martini she said to the waiter when it was brought and set before her platt reached over and took it away what is this he asked a cocktail of course i thought it was some kind of tea you ordered this is liquor you can t drink this what is your first name to my intimate friends said miss asher freezingly it is helen listen helen said platt leaning over the table for many years every time the spring flowers blossomed out on the prairies i got to thinking of somebody that i d never seen or heard of i knew it was you the minute i saw you yesterday i m going back home to morrow and you re going with me i know it for i saw it in your eyes when you first looked at me you needn t kick for you ve got to fall into line here s a little trick i picked out for you on my way over he flicked a two carat diamond solitaire ring across the table miss asher flipped it back to him with her fork don t get fresh she said severely i m worth a hundred thousand dollars said platt i ll build you the finest house in west texas you can t buy me mr buyer said miss asher if you had a hundred million i didn t think i d have to call you down you didn t look like the others to me at first but i see you re all alike all who asked platt all you buyers you think because we girls have to go out to dinner with you or lose our jobs that you re privileged to say what you please well forget it i thought you were different from the others but i see i was mistaken platt struck his fingers on the table with a gesture of sudden illuminating satisfaction i ve got it he exclaimed almost hilariously the nicholson place over on the north side there s a big grove of live oaks and a natural lake the old house can be pulled down and the new one set further back put out your pipe said miss asher i m sorry to wake you up but you fellows might as well get wise once for all to where you stand i m supposed to go to dinner with you and help jolly you along so you ll trade with old zizzy but don t expect to find me in any of the suits you buy do you mean to tell me said platt that you go out this way with customers and they all they all talk to you like i have they all make plays said miss asher but i must say that you ve got em beat in one respect they generally talk diamonds while you ve actually dug one up how long have you been working helen got my name pat haven t you i ve been supporting myself for eight years i was a cash girl and a wrapper and then a shop girl until i was grown and then i got to be a suit model mr texas man don t you think a little wine would make this dinner a little less dry you re not going to drink wine any more dear it s awful to think how i ll come to the store to morrow and get you i want you to pick out an automobile before we leave that s all we need to buy here oh cut that out if you knew how sick i am of hearing such talk after the dinner they walked down broadway and came upon diana s little wooded park the trees caught platt s eye at once and he must turn along under the winding walk beneath them the lights shone upon two bright tears in the model s eyes i don t like that said platt what s the matter don t you mind said miss asher well it s because well i didn t think you were that kind when i first saw you but you are all like and now will you take me home or will i have to call a cop platt took her to the door of her boarding house they stood for a minute in the vestibule she looked at him with such scorn in her eyes that even his heart of oak began to waver his arm was half way around her waist when she struck him a stinging blow on the face with her open hand as he stepped back a ring fell from somewhere and bounded on the tiled floor platt groped for it and found it now take your useless diamond and go mr buyer she said this was the other one the wedding ring said the texan holding the smooth gold band on the palm of his hand miss asher s eyes blazed upon him in the half darkness was that what you meant did you somebody opened the door from inside the house good night said platt i ll see you at the store to morrow miss asher ran up to her room and shook the school teacher until she sat up in bed ready to scream fire where is it she cried that s what i want to know said the model you ve studied geography emma and you ought to know where is a town called cac cac carac caracas city i think they called it how dare you wake me up for that said the school teacher caracas is in venezuela of course what s it like why it s principally earthquakes and negroes and monkeys and malarial fever and volcanoes i don t care said miss asher blithely i m going there to morrow the badge of policeman o roon it cannot be denied that men and women have looked upon one another for the first time and become instantly enamored it is a risky process this love at first sight before she has seen him in bradstreet or he has seen her in curl papers but these things do happen and one instance must form a theme for this story though not thank heaven to the overshadowing of more vital and important subjects such as drink policemen horses and earldoms during a certain war a troop calling itself the gentle riders rode into history and one or two ambuscades the gentle riders were recruited from the aristocracy of the wild men of the west and the wild men of the aristocracy of the east in khaki there is little telling them one from another so they became good friends and comrades all around ellsworth remsen whose old knickerbocker descent atoned for his modest rating at only ten millions ate his canned beef gayly by the campfires of the gentle riders the war was a great lark to him so that he scarcely regretted polo and planked shad one of the troopers was a well set up affable cool young man who called himself o roon to this young man remsen took an especial liking the two rode side by side during the famous mooted up hill charge that was disputed so hotly at the time by the spaniards and afterward by the democrats after the war remsen came back to his polo and shad one day a well set up affable cool young man disturbed him at his club and he and o roon were soon pounding each other and exchanging opprobrious epithets after the manner of long lost friends o roon looked seedy and out of luck and perfectly contented but it seemed that his content was only apparent get me a job remsen he said i ve just handed a barber my last shilling no trouble at all said remsen i know a lot of men who have banks and stores and things downtown any particular line you fancy yes said o roon with a look of interest i took a walk in your central park this morning i d like to be one of those bobbies on horseback that would be about the ticket besides it s the only thing i could do i can ride a little and the fresh air suits me think you could land that for me remsen was sure that he could and in a very short time he did and they who were not above looking at mounted policemen might have seen a well set up affable cool young man on a prancing chestnut steed attending to his duties along the driveways of the park and now at the extreme risk of wearying old gentlemen who carry leather fob chains and elderly ladies who but no grandmother herself yet thrills at foolish immortal romeo there must be a hint of love at first sight it came just as remsen was strolling into fifth avenue from his club a few doors away a motor car was creeping along foot by foot impeded by a freshet of vehicles that filled the street in the car was a chauffeur and an old gentleman with snowy side whiskers and a scotch plaid cap which could not be worn while automobiling except by a personage not even a wine agent would dare do it but these two were of no consequence except perhaps for the guiding of the machine and the paying for it at the old gentleman s side sat a young lady more beautiful than pomegranate blossoms more exquisite than the first quarter moon viewed at twilight through the tops of oleanders remsen saw her and knew his fate he could have flunk himself under the very wheels that conveyed her but he knew that would be the last means of attracting the attention of those who ride in motor cars slowly the auto passed and if we place the poets above the autoists carried the heart of remsen with it here was a large city of millions and many women who at a certain distance appear to resemble pomegranate blossoms yet he hoped to see her again for each one fancies that his romance has its own tutelary guardian and divinity luckily for remsen s peace of mind there came a diversion in the guise of a reunion of the gentle riders of the city there were not many of them perhaps a score and there was wassail and things to eat and speeches and the spaniard was bearded again in recapitulation and when daylight threatened them the survivors prepared to depart but some remained upon the battlefield one of these was trooper o roon who was not seasoned to potent liquids his legs declined to fulfil the obligations they had sworn to the police department i m stewed remsen said o roon to his friend why do they build hotels that go round and round like catherine wheels they ll take away my shield and break me i can think and talk con con consec sec secutively but i s s stammer with my feet i ve got to go on duty in three hours the jig is up remsen the jig is up i tell you look at me said remsen who was his smiling self pointing to his own face whom do you see here goo fellow said o roon dizzily goo old remsen not so said remsen you see mounted policeman o roon look at your face no you can t do that without a glass but look at mine and think of yours how much alike are we as two french table d hote dinners with your badge on your horse in your uniform will i charm nurse maids and prevent the grass from growing under people s feet in the park this day i will have your badge and your honor besides having the jolliest lark i ve been blessed with since we licked spain promptly on time the counterfeit presentment of mounted policeman o roon single footed into the park on his chestnut steed in a uniform two men who are unlike will look alike two who somewhat resemble each other in feature and figure will appear as twin brothers so remsen trotted down the bridle paths enjoying himself hugely so few real pleasures do ten millionaires have along the driveway in the early morning spun a victoria drawn by a pair of fiery bays there was something foreign about the affair for the park is rarely used in the morning except by unimportant people who love to be healthy poor and wise in the vehicle sat an old gentleman with snowy side whiskers and a scotch plaid cap which could not be worn while driving except by a personage at his side sat the lady of remsen s heart the lady who looked like pomegranate blossoms and the gibbous moon remsen met them coming at the instant of their passing her eyes looked into his and but for the ever coward s heart of a true lover he could have sworn that she flushed a faint pink he trotted on for twenty yards and then wheeled his horse at the sound of runaway hoofs the bays had bolted remsen sent his chestnut after the victoria like a shot there was work cut out for the impersonator of policeman o roon the chestnut ranged alongside the off bay thirty seconds after the chase began rolled his eye back at remsen and said in the only manner open to policemen s horses well you duffer are you going to do your share you re not o roon but it seems to me if you d lean to the right you could reach the reins of that foolish slow running bay ah you re all right o roon couldn t have done it more neatly the runaway team was tugged to an inglorious halt by remsen s tough muscles the driver released his hands from the wrapped reins jumped from his seat and stood at the heads of the team the chestnut approving his new rider danced and pranced reviling equinely the subdued bays remsen lingering was dimly conscious of a vague impossible unnecessary old gentleman in a scotch cap who talked incessantly about something and he was acutely conscious of a pair of violet eyes that would have drawn saint pyrites from his iron pillar or whatever the allusion is and of the lady s smile and look a little frightened but a look that with the ever coward hears of a true lover he could not yet construe they were asking his name and bestowing upon him wellbred thanks for his heroic deed and the scotch cap was especially babbling and insistent but the eloquent appeal was in the eyes of the lady a little thrill of satisfaction ran through remsen because he had a name to give which without undue pride was worthy of being spoken in high places and a small fortune which with due pride he could leave at his end without disgrace he opened his lips to speak and closed them again who was he mounted policeman o roon the badge and the honor of his comrade were in his hands if ellsworth remsen ten millionaire and knickerbocker had just rescued pomegranate blossoms and scotch cap from possible death where was policeman o roon off his beat exposed disgraced discharged love had come but before that there had been something that demanded precedence the fellowship of men on battlefields fighting an alien foe remsen touched his cap looked between the chestnut s ears and took refuge in vernacularity don t mention it he said stolidly we policemen are paid to do these things it s our duly and he rode away rode away cursing noblesse oblige but knowing he could never have clone anything else at the end of the day remsen sent the chestnut to his stable and went to o roon s room the policeman was again a well set up affable cool young man who sat by the window smoking cigars i wish you and the rest of the police force and all badges horses brass buttons and men who can t drink two glasses of brut without getting upset were at the devil said remsen feelingly o roon smiled with evident satisfaction good old remsen he said affably i know all about it they trailed me down and cornered me here two hours ago there was a little row at home you know and i cut sticks just to show them i don t believe i told you that my governor was the earl of ardsley funny you should bob against them in the park if you damaged that horse of mine i ll never forgive you i m going to buy him and take him back with me oh yes and i think my sister lady angela you know wants particularly for you to come up to the hotel with me this evening didn t lose my badge did you remsen i ve got to turn that in at headquarters when i resign brickdust row blinker was displeased a man of less culture and poise and wealth would have sworn but blinker always remembered that he was a gentleman a thing that no gentleman should do so he merely looked bored and sardonic while he rode in a hansom to the center of disturbance which was the broadway office of lawyer oldport who was agent for the blinker estate i don t see said blinker why i should be always signing confounded papers i am packed and was to have left for the north woods this morning now i must wait until to morrow morning i hate night trains my best razors are of course at the bottom of some unidentifiable trunk it is a plot to drive me to bay rum and a monologueing thumb handed barber give me a pen that doesn t scratch i hate pens that scratch sit down said double chinned gray lawyer oldport the worst has not been told you oh the hardships of the rich the papers are not yet ready to sign they will be laid before you to morrow at eleven you will miss another day twice shall the barber tweak the helpless nose of a blinker be thankful that your sorrows do not embrace a haircut if said blinker rising the act did not involve more signing of papers i would take my business out of your hands at once give me a cigar please if said lawyer oldport i had cared to see an old friend s son gulped down at one mouthful by sharks i would have ordered you to take it away long ago now let s quit fooling alexander besides the grinding task of signing your name some thirty times to morrow i must impose upon you the consideration of a matter of business of business and i may say humanity or right i spoke to you about this five years ago but you would not listen you were in a hurry for a coaching trip i think the subject has come up again the property oh property interrupted blinker dear mr oldport i think you mentioned to morrow let s have it all at one dose to morrow signatures and property and snappy rubber bands and that smelly sealing wax and all have luncheon with me well i ll try to remember to drop in at eleven to morrow morning the blinker wealth was in lands tenements and hereditaments as the legal phrase goes lawyer oldport had once taken alexander in his little pulmonary gasoline runabout to see the many buildings and rows of buildings that he owned in the city for alexander was sole heir they had amused blinker very much the houses looked so incapable of producing the big sums of money that lawyer oldport kept pilling up in banks for him to spend in the evening blinker went to one of his clubs intending to dine nobody was there except some old fogies playing whist who spoke to him with grave politeness and glared at him with savage contempt everybody was out of town but here he was kept in like a schoolboy to write his name over and over on pieces of paper his wounds were deep blinker turned his back on the fogies and said to the club steward who had come forward with some nonsense about cold fresh salmon roe symons i m going to coney island he said it as one might say all s off i m going to jump into the river the joke pleased symons he laughed within a sixteenth of a note of the audibility permitted by the laws governing employees certainly sir he tittered of course sir i think i can see you at coney mr blinker blinker got a pager and looked up the movements of sunday steamboats then he found a cab at the first corner and drove to a north river pier he stood in line as democratic as you or i and bought a ticket and was trampled upon and shoved forward until at last he found himself on the upper deck of the boat staring brazenly at a girl who sat alone upon a camp stool but blinker did not intend to be brazen the girl was so wonderfully good looking that he forgot for one minute that he was the prince incog and behaved just as he did in society she was looking at him too and not severely a puff of wind threatened blinker s straw hat he caught it warily and settled it again the movement gave the effect of a bow the girl nodded and smiled and in another instant he was seated at her side she was dressed all in white she was paler than blinker imagined milkmaids and girls of humble stations to be but she was as tidy as a cherry blossom and her steady supremely frank gray eyes looked out from the intrepid depths of an unshadowed and untroubled soul how dare you raise your hat to me she asked with a smile redeemed severity i didn t blinker said but he quickly covered the mistake by extending it to i didn t know how to keep from it after i saw you i do not allow gentlemen to sit by me to whom i have not been introduced she said with a sudden haughtiness that deceived him he rose reluctantly but her clear teasing laugh brought him down to his chair again i guess you weren t going far she declared with beauty s magnificent self confidence are you going to coney island asked blinker me she turned upon him wide open eyes full of bantering surprise why what a question can t you see that i m riding a bicycle in the park her drollery took the form of impertinence and i am laying brick on a tall factory chimney said blinker mayn t we see coney together i m all alone and i ve never been there before it depends said the girl on how nicely you behave i ll consider your application until we get there blinker took pains to provide against the rejection of his application he strove to please to adopt the metaphor of his nonsensical phrase he laid brick upon brick on the tall chimney of his devoirs until at length the structure was stable and complete the manners of the best society come around finally to simplicity and as the girl s way was that naturally they were on a mutual plane of communication from the beginning he learned that she was twenty and her name was florence that she trimmed hats in a millinery shop that she lived in a furnished room with her best chum elia who was cashier in a shoe store and that a glass of milk from the bottle on the window sill and an egg that boils itself while you twist up your hair makes a breakfast good enough for any one florence laughed when she heard blinker well she said it certainly slows that you have imagination it gives the smiths a chance for a little rest anyhow they landed at coney and were dashed on the crest of a great human wave of mad pleasure seekers into the walks and avenues of fairyland gone into vaudeville with a curious eye a critical mind and a fairly withheld judgment blinker considered the temples pagodas and kiosks of popularized delights hoi polloi trampled hustled and crowded him basket parties bumped him sticky children tumbled howling under his feet candying his clothes insolent youths strolling among the booths with hard won canes under one arm and easily won girls on the other blew defiant smoke from cheap cigars into his face the publicity gentlemen with megaphones each before his own stupendous attraction roared like niagara in his ears music of all kinds that could be tortured from brass reed hide or string fought in the air to grain space for its vibrations against its competitors but what held blinker in awful fascination was the mob the multitude the proletariat shrieking struggling hurrying panting hurling itself in incontinent frenzy with unabashed abandon into the ridiculous sham palaces of trumpery and tinsel pleasures the vulgarity of it its brutal overriding of all the tenets of repression and taste that were held by his caste repelled him strongly in the midst of his disgust he turned and looked down at florence by his side she was ready with her quick smile and upturned happy eyes as bright and clear as the water in trout pools the eyes were saying that they had the right to be shining and happy for was their owner not with her for the present man her gentleman friend and holder of the keys to the enchanted city of fun blinker did not read her look accurately but by some miracle he suddenly saw coney aright he no longer saw a mass of vulgarians seeking gross joys he now looked clearly upon a hundred thousand true idealists their offenses were wiped out counterfeit and false though the garish joys of these spangled temples were he perceived that deep under the gilt surface they offered saving and apposite balm and satisfaction to the restless human heart here at least was the husk of romance the empty but shining casque of chivalry the breath catching though safe guarded dip and flight of adventure the magic carpet that transports you to the realms of fairyland though its journey be trough but a few poor yards of space he no longer saw a rabble but his brothers seeking the ideal there was no magic of poesy here or of art but the glamour of their imagination turned yellow calico into cloth of gold and the megaphones into the silver trumpets of joy s heralds almost humbled blinker rolled up the shirt sleeves of his mind and joined the idealists you are the lady doctor he said to florence how shall we go about doing this jolly conglomeration of fairy tales incorporated we will begin there said the princess pointing to a fun pagoda on the edge of the sea and we will take there all in one by one they caught the eight o clock returning boat and sat filled with pleasant fatigue against the rail in the bow listening to the italians fiddle and harp blinker had thrown off all care the north woods seemed to him an uninhabitable wilderness what a fuss he had made over signing his name pooh he could sign it a hundred times and her name was as pretty as she was florence he said it to himself a great many times as the boat was nearing its pier in the north river a two funnelled drab foreign looking sea going steamer was dropping down toward the bay the boat turned its nose in toward its slip the steamer veered as if to seek midstream and then yawed seemed to increase its speed and struck the coney boat on the side near the stern cutting into it with a terrifying shock and crash while the six hundred passengers on the boat were mostly tumbling about the decks in a shrieking panic the captain was shouting at the steamer that it should not back off and leave the rent exposed for the water to enter but the steamer tore its way out like a savage sawfish and cleaved its heartless way full speed ahead the boat began to sink at its stern but moved slowly toward the slip the passengers were a frantic mob unpleasant to behold blinker held florence tightly until the boat had righted itself she made no sound or sign of fear he stood on a camp stool ripped off the slats above his head and pulled down a number of the life preservers he began to buckle one around florence the rotten canvas split and the fraudulent granulated cork came pouring out in a stream florence caught a handful of it and laughed gleefully it looks like breakfast food she said take it off they re no good she unbuckled it and threw it on the deck she made blinker sit down and sat by his side and put her hand in his what ll you bet we don t reach the pier all right she said and began to hum a song and now the captain moved among the passengers and compelled order the boat would undoubtedly make her slip he said and ordered the women and children to the bow where they could land first the boat very low in the water at the stern tried gallantly to make his promise good florence said blinker as she held him close by an arm and hand i love you that s what they all say she replied lightly i am not one of they all he persisted i never knew any one i could love before i could pass my life with you and be happy every day i am rich i can make things all right for you that s what they all say said the girl again weaving the words into her little reckless song don t say that again said blinker in a tone that made her look at him in frank surprise why shouldn t i say it she asked calmly they all do who are they he asked jealous for the first time in his existence why the fellows i know do you know so many oh well i m not a wall flower she answered with modest complacency where do you see these these men at your home of course not i meet them just as i did you sometimes on the boat sometimes in the park sometimes on the street i m a pretty good judge of a man i can tell in a minute if a fellow is one who is likely to get fresh what do you mean by fresh why try to kiss you me i mean do any of them try that asked blinker clenching his teeth sure all men do you know that do you allow them some not many they won t take you out anywhere unless you do she turned her head and looked searchingly at blinker her eyes were as innocent as a child s there was a puzzled look in them as though she did not understand him what s wrong about my meeting fellows she asked wonderingly everything he answered almost savagely why don t you entertain your company in the house where you live is it necessary to pick up tom dick and harry on the streets she kept her absolutely ingenuous eyes upon his if you could see the place where i live you wouldn t ask that i live in brickdust row they call it that because there s red dust from the bricks crumbling over everything i ve lived there for more than four years there s no place to receive company you can t have anybody come to your room what else is there to do a girl has got to meet the men hasn t she yes he said hoarsely a girl has got to meet a has got to meet the men the first time one spoke to me on the street she continued i ran home and cried all night but you get used to it i meet a good many nice fellows at church i go on rainy days and stand in the vestibule until one comes up with an umbrella i wish there was a parlor so i could ask you to call mr blinker are you really sure it isn t smith now the boat landed safely blinker had a confused impression of walking with the girl through quiet crosstown streets until she stopped at a corner and held out her hand i live just one more block over she said thank you for a very pleasant afternoon blinker muttered something and plunged northward till he found a cab a big gray church loomed slowly at his right blinker shook his fist at it through the window i gave you a thousand dollars last week he cried under his breath and she meets them in your very doors there is something wrong there is something wrong at eleven the next day blinker signed his name thirty times with a new pen provided by lawyer oldport now let me go to the woods he said surlily you are not looking well said lawyer oldport the trip will do you good but listen if you will to that little matter of business of which i spoke to you yesterday and also five years ago there are some buildings fifteen in number of which there are new five year leases to be signed your father contemplated a change in the lease provisions but never made it he intended that the parlors of these houses should not be sub let but that the tenants should be allowed to use them for reception rooms these houses are in the shopping district and are mainly tenanted by young working girls as it is they are forced to seek companionship outside this row of red brick blinker interrupted him with a loud discordant laugh brickdust row for an even hundred he cried and i own it have i guessed right the tenants have some such name for it said lawyer oldport blinker arose and jammed his hat down to his eyes do what you please with it he said harshly remodel it burn it raze it to the ground but man it s too late i tell you it s too late it s too late it s too late the making of a new yorker besides many other things raggles was a poet he was called a tramp but that was only an elliptical way of saying that he was a philosopher an artist a traveller a naturalist and a discoverer but most of all he was a poet in all his life he never wrote a line of verse he lived his poetry his odyssey would have been a limerick had it been written but to linger with the primary proposition raggles was a poet raggles s specialty had he been driven to ink and paper would have been sonnets to the cities he studied cities as women study their reflections in mirrors as children study the glue and sawdust of a dislocated doll as the men who write about wild animals study the cages in the zoo a city to raggles was not merely a pile of bricks and mortar peopled by a certain number of inhabitants it was a thing with a soul characteristic and distinct an individual conglomeration of life with its own peculiar essence flavor and feeling two thousand miles to the north and south east and west raggles wandered in poetic fervor taking the cities to his breast he footed it on dusty roads or sped magnificently in freight cars counting time as of no account and when he had found the heart of a city and listened to its secret confession he strayed on restless to another fickle raggles but perhaps he had not met the civic corporation that could engage and hold his critical fancy through the ancient poets we have learned that the cities are feminine so they were to poet raggles and his mind carried a concrete and clear conception of the figure that symbolized and typified each one that he had wooed chicago seemed to swoop down upon him with a breezy suggestion of mrs partington plumes and patchouli and to disturb his rest with a soaring and beautiful song of future promise but raggles would awake to a sense of shivering cold and a haunting impression of ideals lost in a depressing aura of potato salad and fish thus chicago affected him perhaps there is a vagueness and inaccuracy in the description but that is raggles s fault he should have recorded his sensations in magazine poems pittsburg impressed hint as the play of othello performed in the russian language in a railroad station by dockstader s minstrels a royal and generous lady this pittsburg though homely hearty with flushed face washing the dishes in a silk dress and white kid slippers and bidding raggles sit before the roaring fireplace and drink champagne with his pigs feet and fried potatoes new orleans had simply gazed down upon him from a balcony he could see her pensive starry eves and catch the flutter of her fan and that was all only once he came face to face with her it was at dawn when she was flushing the red bricks of the banquette with a pail of water she laughed and hummed a chansonette and filled raggles s shoes with ice cold water allons boston construed herself to the poetic raggles in an erratic and singular way it seemed to him that he had drunk cold tea and that the city was a white cold cloth that had been bound tightly around his brow to spur him to some unknown but tremendous mental effort and after all he came to shovel snow for a livelihood and the cloth becoming wet tightened its knots and could not be removed indefinite and unintelligible ideas you will say but your disapprobation should be tempered with gratitude for these are poets fancies and suppose you had come upon them in verse one day raggles came and laid siege to the heart of the great city of manhattan she was the greatest of all and he wanted to learn her note in the scale to taste and appraise and classify and solve and label her and arrange her with the other cities that had given him up the secret of their individuality and here we cease to be raggles s translator and become his chronicler raggles landed from a ferry boat one morning and walked into the core of the town with the blase air of a cosmopolite he was dressed with care to play the role of an unidentified man no country race class clique union party clan or bowling association could have claimed him his clothing which had been donated to him piece meal by citizens of different height but same number of inches around the heart was not yet as uncomfortable to his figure as those speciments of raiment self measured that are railroaded to you by transcontinental tailors with a suit case suspenders sills handkerchief and pearl studs as a bonus without money as a poet should be but with the ardor of an astronomer discovering a new star in the chorus of the milky way or a man who has seen ink suddenly flow from his fountain pen raggles wandered into the great city late in the afternoon he drew out of the roar and commotion with a look of dumb terror on his countenance he was defeated puzzled discomfited frightened other cities had been to him as long primer to read as country maidens quickly to fathom as send price of subscription with answer rebuses to solve as oyster cocktails to swallow but here was one as cold glittering serene impossible as a four carat diamond in a window to a lover outside fingering damply in his pocket his ribbon counter salary the greetings of the other cities he had known their homespun kindliness their human gamut of rough charity friendly curses garrulous curiosity and easily estimated credulity or indifference this city of manhattan gave him no clue it was walled against him like a river of adamant it flowed past him in the streets never an eye was turned upon him no voice spoke to him his heart yearned for the clap of pittsburg s sooty hand on his shoulder for chicago s menacing but social yawp in his ear for the pale and eleemosynary stare through the bostonian eyeglass even for the precipitate but unmalicious boot toe of louisville or st louis on broadway raggles successful suitor of many cities stood bashful like any country swain for the first time he experienced the poignant humiliation of being ignored and when he tried to reduce this brilliant swiftly changing ice cold city to a formula he failed utterly poet though he was it offered him no color similes no points of comparison no flaw in its polished facets no handle by which he could hold it up and view its shape and structure as he familiarly and often contemptuously had done with other towns the houses were interminable ramparts loopholed for defense the people were bright but bloodless spectres passing in sinister and selfish array the thing that weighed heaviest on raggles s soul and clogged his poet s fancy was the spirit of absolute egotism that seemed to saturate the people as toys are saturated with paint each one that he considered appeared a monster of abominable and insolent conceit humanity was gone from them they were toddling idols of stone and varnish worshipping themselves and greedy for though oblivious of worship from their fellow graven images frozen cruel implacable impervious cut to an identical pattern they hurried on their ways like statues brought by some miracles to motion while soul and feeling lay unaroused in the reluctant marble gradually raggles became conscious of certain types one was an elderly gentleman with a snow white short beard pink unwrinkled face and stony sharp blue eyes attired in the fashion of a gilded youth who seemed to personify the city s wealth ripeness and frigid unconcern another type was a woman tall beautiful clear as a steel engraving goddess like calm clothed like the princesses of old with eyes as coldly blue as the reflection of sunlight on a glacier and another was a by product of this town of marionettes a broad swaggering grim threateningly sedate fellow with a jowl as large as a harvested wheat field the complexion of a baptized infant and the knuckles of a prize fighter this type leaned against cigar signs and viewed the world with frapped contumely a poet is a sensitive creature and raggles soon shrivelled in the bleak embrace of the undecipherable the chill sphinx like ironical illegible unnatural ruthless expression of the city left him downcast and bewildered had it no heart better the woodpile the scolding of vinegar faced housewives at back doors the kindly spleen of bartenders behind provincial free lunch counters the amiable truculence of rural constables the kicks arrests and happy go lucky chances of the other vulgar loud crude cities than this freezing heartlessness raggles summoned his courage and sought alms from the populace unheeding regardless they passed on without the wink of an eyelash to testify that they were conscious of his existence and then he said to himself that this fair but pitiless city of manhattan was without a soul that its inhabitants were manikins moved by wires and springs and that he was alone in a great wilderness raggles started to cross the street there was a blast a roar a hissing and a crash as something struck him and hurled him over and over six yards from where he had been as he was coming down like the stick of a rocket the earth and all the cities thereof turned to a fractured dream raggles opened his eyes first an odor made itself known to him an odor of the earliest spring flowers of paradise and then a hand soft as a falling petal touched his brow bending over him was the woman clothed like the princess of old with blue eyes now soft and humid with human sympathy under his head on the pavement were silks and furs with raggles s hat in his hand and with his face pinker than ever from a vehement burst of oratory against reckless driving stood the elderly gentleman who personified the city s wealth and ripeness from a nearby cafe hurried the by product with the vast jowl and baby complexion bearing a glass full of a crimson fluid that suggested delightful possibilities drink dis sport said the by product holding the glass to raggles s lips hundreds of people huddled around in a moment their faces wearing the deepest concern two flattering and gorgeous policemen got into the circle and pressed back the overplus of samaritans an old lady in a black shawl spoke loudly of camphor a newsboy slipped one of his papers beneath raggles s elbow where it lay on the muddy pavement a brisk young man with a notebook was asking for names a bell clanged importantly and the ambulance cleaned a lane through the crowd a cool surgeon slipped into the midst of affairs how do you feel old man asked the surgeon stooping easily to his task the princess of silks and satins wiped a red drop or two from raggles s brow with a fragrant cobweb me said raggles with a seraphic smile i feel fine he had found the heart of his new city in three days they let him leave his cot for the convalescent ward in the hospital he had been in there an hour when the attendants heard sounds of conflict upon investigation they found that raggles had assaulted and damaged a brother convalescent a glowering transient whom a freight train collision had sent in to be patched up what s all this about inquired the head nurse he was runnin down me town said raggles what town asked the nurse noo york said raggles vanity and some sables when kid brady was sent to the rope by molly mckeever s blue black eyes he withdrew from the stovepipe gang so much for the power of a colleen s blanderin tongue and stubborn true heartedness if you are a man who read this may such an influence be sent you before o clock to morrow if you are a woman may your pomeranian greet you this morning with a cold nose a sign of doghealth and your happiness the stovepipe gang borrowed its name from a sub district of the city called the stovepipe which is a narrow and natural extension of the familiar district known as hell s kitchen the stovepipe strip of town runs along eleventh and twelfth avenues on the river and bends a hard and sooty elbow around little lost homeless dewitt clinton park consider that a stovepipe is an important factor in any kitchen and the situation is analyzed tae chefs in hell s kitchen are many and the stovepipe gang wears the cordon blue the members of this unchartered but widely known brotherhood appeared to pass their time on street corners arrayed like the lilies of the conservatory and busy with nail files and penknives thus displayed as a guarantee of good faith they carried on an innocuous conversation in a word vocabulary to the casual observer as innocent and immaterial as that heard in clubs seven blocks to the east but off exhibition the stovepipes were not mere street corner ornaments addicted to posing and manicuring their serious occupation was the separating of citizens from their coin and valuables preferably this was done by weird and singular tricks without noise or bloodshed but whenever the citizen honored by their attentions refused to impoverish himself gracefully his objections came to be spread finally upon some police station blotter or hospital register the police held the stovepipe gang in perpetual suspicion and respect as the nightingale s liquid note is heard in the deepest shadows so along the stovepipe s dark and narrow confess the whistle for reserves punctures the dull ear of night whenever there was smoke in the stovepipe the tasselled men in blue knew there was fire in hell s kitchen kid brady promised molly to be good kid was the vainest the strongest the wariest and the most successful plotter in the gang therefore the boys were sorry to

so collier and me infested the grub tent with care and activity mame was level full of impartiality twas like a casino hand the way she dealt out her favours one to collier and one to me and one to the board and not a card up her sleeve me and collier naturally got acquainted and gravitated together some on the outside divested of his stratagems he seemed to be a pleasant chap full of an amiable sort of hostility i notice you have an affinity for grubbing in the banquet hall after the guests have fled says i to him one day to draw his conclusions well yes says collier reflecting the tumult of a crowded board seems to harass my sensitive nerves it exasperates mine some too says i nice little girl don t you think i see says collier laughing well now that you mention it i have noticed that she doesn t seem to displease the optic nerve she s a joy to mine says i and i m going after her notice is hereby served i ll be as candid as you admits collier and if the drug stores don t run out of pepsin i ll give you a run for your money that ll leave you a dyspeptic at the wind up so collier and me begins the race the grub department lays in new supplies mame waits on us jolly and kind and agreeable and it looks like an even break with cupid and the cook working overtime in dugan s restaurant twas one night in september when i got mame to take a walk after supper when the things were all cleared away we strolled out a distance and sat on a pile of lumber at the edge of town such opportunities was seldom so i spoke my piece explaining how the brazilian diamonds and the fire kindler were laying up sufficient treasure to guarantee the happiness of two and that both of em together couldn t equal the light from somebody s eyes and that the name of dugan should be changed to peters or reasons why not would be in order mame didn t say anything right away directly she gave a kind of shudder and i began to learn something jeff she says i m sorry you spoke i like you as well as any of them but there isn t a man in the world i d ever marry and there never will be do you know what a man is in my eye he s a tomb he s a sarcophagus for the interment of beafsteakporkchopsliver nbaconham andeggs he s that and nothing more for two years i ve watched men eat eat eat until they represent nothing on earth to me but ruminant bipeds they re absolutely nothing but something that goes in front of a knife and fork and plate at the table they re fixed that way in my mind and memory i ve tried to overcome it but i can t i ve heard girls rave about their sweethearts but i never could understand it a man and a sausage grinder and a pantry awake in me exactly the same sentiments i went to a matinee once to see an actor the girls were crazy about i got interested enough to wonder whether he liked his steak rare medium or well done and his eggs over or straight up that was all no jeff i ll marry no man and see him sit at the breakfast table and eat and come back to dinner and eat and happen in again at supper to eat eat eat but mame says i it ll wear off you ve had too much of it you ll marry some time of course men don t eat always as far as my observation goes they do no i ll tell you what i m going to do mame turns sudden to animation and bright eyes there s a girl named susie foster in terre haute a chum of mine she waits in the railroad eating house there i worked two years in a restaurant in that town susie has it worse than i do because the men who eat at railroad stations gobble they try to flirt and gobble at the same time whew susie and i have it all planned out we re saving our money and when we get enough we re going to buy a little cottage and five acres we know of and live together and grow violets for the eastern market a man better not bring his appetite within a mile of that ranch don t girls ever i commenced but mame heads me off sharp no they don t they nibble a little bit sometimes that s all i thought the confect for goodness sake change the subject says mame as i said before that experience puts me wise that the feminine arrangement ever struggles after deceptions and illusions take england beef made her wieners elevated germany uncle sam owes his greatness to fried chicken and pie but the young ladies of the shetalkyou schools they ll never believe it shakespeare they allow and rubinstein and the rough riders is what did the trick twas a situation calculated to disturb i couldn t bear to give up mame and yet it pained me to think of abandoning the practice of eating i had acquired the habit too early for twenty seven years i had been blindly rushing upon my fate yielding to the insidious lures of that deadly monster food it was too late i was a ruminant biped for keeps it was lobster salad to a doughnut that my life was going to be blighted by it i continued to board at the dugan tent hoping that mame would relent i had sufficient faith in true love to believe that since it has often outlived the absence of a square

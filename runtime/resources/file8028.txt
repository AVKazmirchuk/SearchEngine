us and me and andy declared a cessation of hostilities never so much as floating the fly leaf of a rubber concession prospectus or flashing a brazilian diamond while we was there one day the leading hardware merchant of grassdale drops around to the hotel where me and andy stopped and smokes with us sociable on the side porch we knew him pretty well from pitching quoits in the afternoons in the court house yard he was a loud red man breathing hard but fat and respectable beyond all reason after we talk on all the notorious themes of the day this murkison for such was his entitlements takes a letter out of his coat pocket in a careful careless way and hands it to us to read now what do you think of that says he laughing a letter like that to me me and andy sees at a glance what it is but we pretend to read it through it was one of them old time typewritten green goods letters explaining how for you could get in bills that an expert couldn t tell from the genuine and going on to tell how they were made from plates stolen by an employee of the treasury at washington think of em sending a letter like that to me says murkison again lot s of good men get em says andy if you don t answer the first letter they let you drop if you answer it they write again asking you to come on with your money and do business but think of em writing to me says murkison a few days later he drops around again boys says he i know you are all right or i wouldn t confide in you i wrote to them rascals again just for fun they answered and told me to come on to chicago they said telegraph to j smith when i would start when i get there i m to wait on a certain street corner till a man in a gray suit comes along and drops a newspaper in front of me then i am to ask him how the water is and he knows it s me and i know it s him ah yes says andy gaping it s the same old game i ve often read about it in the papers then he conducts you to the private abattoir in the hotel where mr jones is already waiting they show you brand new real money and sell you all you want at five for one you see em put it in a satchel for you and know it s there of course it s brown paper when you come to look at it afterward oh they couldn t switch it on me says murkison i haven t built up the best paying business in grassdale without having witticisms about me you say it s real money they show you mr tucker i ve always i see by the papers that it always is says andy boys says murkison i ve got it in my mind that them fellows can t fool me i think i ll put a couple of thousand in my jeans and go up there and put it all over em if bill murkison gets his eyes once on them bills they show him he ll never take em off of em they offer for and they ll have to stick to the bargain if i tackle em that s the kind of trader bill murkison is yes i jist believe i ll drop up chicago way and take a to shot on j smith i guess the water ll be fine enough me and andy tries to get this financial misquotation out of murkison s head but we might as well have tried to keep the man who rolls peanuts with a toothpick from betting on bryan s election no sir he was going to perform a public duty by catching these green goods swindlers at their own game maybe it would teach em a lesson after murkison left us me and andy sat a while prepondering over our silent meditations and heresies of reason in our idle hours we always improved our higher selves by ratiocination and mental thought jeff says andy after a long time quite unseldom i have seen fit to impugn your molars when you have been chewing the rag with me about your conscientious way of doing business i may have been often wrong but here is a case where i think we can agree i feel that it would be wrong for us to allow mr murkison to go alone to meet those chicago green goods men there is but one way it can end don t you think we would both feel better if we was to intervene in some way and prevent the doing of this deed i got up and shook andy tucker s hand hard and long andy says i i may have had one or two hard thoughts about the heartlessness of your corporation but i retract em now you have a kind nucleus at the interior of your exterior after all it does you credit i was just thinking the same thing that you have expressed it would not be honorable or praiseworthy says i for us to let murkison go on with this project he has taken up if he is determined to go let us go with him and prevent this swindle from coming off andy agreed with me and i was glad to see that he was in earnest about breaking up this green goods scheme i don t call myself a religious man says i or a fanatic in moral bigotry but i can t stand still and see a man who has built up his business by his own efforts and brains and risk be robbed by an unscrupulous trickster who is a menace to the public good right jeff says andy we ll stick right along with murkison if he insists on going and block this funny business i d hate to see any money dropped in it as bad as you would well we went to see murkison no boys says he i can t consent to let the song of this chicago siren waft by me on the summer breeze i ll fry some fat out of this ignis fatuus or burn a hole in the skillet but i d be plumb diverted to death to have you all go along with me maybe you could help some when it comes to cashing in the ticket to that to shot yes i d really take it as a pastime and regalement if you boys would go along too murkison gives it out in grassdale that he is going for a few days with mr peters and mr tucker to look over some iron ore property in west virginia he wires j smith that he will set foot in the spider web on a given date and the three of us lights out for chicago on the way murkison amuses himself with premonitions and advance pleasant recollections in a gray suit says he on the southwest corner of wabash avenue and lake street he drops the paper and i ask how the water is oh my my my and then he laughs all over for five minutes sometimes murkison was serious and tried to talk himself out of his cogitations whatever they was boys says he i wouldn t have this to get out in grassdale for ten times a thousand dollars it would ruin me there but i know you all are all right i think it s the duty of every citizen says he to try to do up these robbers that prey upon the public i ll show em whether the water s fine five dollars for one that s what j smith offers and he ll have to keep his contract if he does business with bill murkison we got into chicago about p m murkison was to meet the gray man at half past we had dinner at a hotel and then went up to murkison s room to wait for the time to come now boys says murkison let s get our gumption together and inoculate a plan for defeating the enemy suppose while i m exchanging airy bandage with the gray capper you gents come along by accident you know and holler hello murk and shake hands with symptoms of surprise and familiarity then i take the capper aside and tell him you all are jenkins and brown of grassdale groceries and feed good men and maybe willing to take a chance while away from home bring em along he ll say of course if they care to invest now how does that scheme strike you what do you say jeff says andy looking at me why i ll tell you what i say says i i say let s settle this thing right here now i don t see any use of wasting any more time i took a nickel plated out of my pocket and clicked the cylinder around a few times you undevout sinful insidious hog says i to murkison get out that two thousand and lay it on the table obey with velocity says i for otherwise alternatives are impending i am preferably a man of mildness but now and then i find myself in the middle of extremities such men as you i went on after he had laid the money out is what keeps the jails and court houses going you come up here to rob these men of their money does it excuse you i asks that they were trying to skin you no sir you was going to rob peter to stand off paul you are ten times worse says i than that green goods man you go to church at home and pretend to be a decent citizen but you ll come to chicago and commit larceny from men that have built up a sound and profitable business by dealing with such contemptible scoundrels as you have tried to be to day how do you know says i that that green goods man hasn t a large family dependent upon his extortions it s you supposedly respectable citizens who are always on the lookout to get something for nothing says i that support the lotteries and wild cat mines and stock exchanges and wire tappers of this country if it wasn t for you they d go out of business the green goods man you was going to rob says i studied maybe for years to learn his trade every turn he makes he risks his money and liberty and maybe his life you come up here all sanctified and vanoplied with respectability and a pleasing post office address to swindle him if he gets the money you can squeal to the police if you get it he hocks the gray suit to buy supper and says nothing mr tucker and me sized you up says i and came along to see that you got what you deserved hand over the money says i you grass fed hypocrite i put the two thousand which was all in bills in my inside pocket now get out your watch says i to murkison no i don t want it says i lay it on the table and you sit in that chair till it ticks off an hour then you can go if you make any noise or leave any sooner we ll handbill you all over grassdale i guess your high position there is worth more than to you then me and andy left on the train andy was a long time silent then he says jeff do you mind my asking you a question two says i or forty was that the idea you had says he when we started out with murkison why certainly says i what else could it have been wasn t it yours too in about half an hour andy spoke again i think there are times when andy don t exactly understand my system of ethics and moral hygiene jeff says he some time when you have the leisure i wish you d draw off a diagram and foot notes of that conscience of yours i d like to have it to refer to occasionally innocents of broadway i hope some day to retire from business said jeff peters and when i do i don t want anybody to be able to say that i ever got a dollar of any man s money without giving him a quid pro rata for it i ve always managed to leave a customer some little gewgaw to paste in his scrapbook or stick between his seth thomas clock and the wall after we are through trading there was one time i came near having to break this rule of mine and do a profligate and illaudable action but i was saved from it by the laws and statutes of our great and profitable country one summer me and andy tucker my partner went to new york to lay in our annual assortment of clothes and gents furnishings we was always pompous and regardless dressers finding that looks went further than anything else in our business except maybe our knowledge of railroad schedules and an autograph photo of the president that loeb sent us probably by mistake andy wrote a nature letter once and sent it in about animals that he had seen caught in a trap lots of times loeb must have read it triplets instead of trap lots and sent the photo anyhow it was useful to us to show people as a guarantee of good faith me and andy never cared much to do business in new york it was too much like pothunting catching suckers in that town is like dynamiting a texas lake for bass all you have to do anywhere between the north and east rivers is to stand in the street with an open bag marked drop packages of money here no checks or loose bills taken you have a cop handy to club pikers who try to chip in post office orders and canadian money and that s all there is to new york for a hunter who loves his profession so me and andy used to just nature fake the town we d get out our spyglasses and watch the woodcocks along the broadway swamps putting plaster casts on their broken legs and then we d sneak away without firing a shot one day in the papier m ch palm room of a chloral hydrate and hops agency in a side street about eight inches off broadway me and andy had thrust upon us the acquaintance of a new yorker we had beer together until we discovered that each of us knew a man named hellsmith traveling for a stove factory in duluth this caused us to remark that the world was a very small place and then this new yorker busts his string and takes off his tin foil and excelsior packing and starts in giving us his ellen terris beginning with the time he used to sell shoelaces to the indians on the spot where tammany hall now stands this new yorker had made his money keeping a cigar store in beekman street and he hadn t been above fourteenth street in ten years moreover he had whiskers and the time had gone by when a true sport will do anything to a man with whiskers no grafter except a boy who is soliciting subscribers to an illustrated weekly to win the prize air rifle or a widow would have the heart to tamper with the man behind with the razor he was a typical city reub i d bet the man hadn t been out of sight of a skyscraper in twenty five years well presently this metropolitan backwoodsman pulls out a roll of bills with an old blue sleeve elastic fitting tight around it and opens it up there s mr peters says he shoving it over the table to me saved during my fifteen years of business put that in your pocket and keep it for me mr peters i m glad to meet you gentlemen from the west and i may take a drop too much i want you to take care of my money for me now let s have another beer you d better keep this yourself says i we are strangers to you and you can t trust everybody you meet put your roll back in your pocket says i and you d better run along home before some farm hand from the kaw river bottoms strolls in here and sells you a copper mine oh i don t know says whiskers i guess little old new york can take care of herself i guess i know a man that s on the square when i see him i ve always found the western people all right i ask you as a favor mr peters says he to keep that roll in your pocket for me i know a gentleman when i see him and now let s have some more beer in about ten minutes this fall of manna leans back in his chair and snores andy looks at me and says i reckon i d better stay with him for five minutes or so in case the waiter comes in i went out the side door and walked half a block up the street and then i came back and sat down at the table andy says i i can t do it it s too much like swearing off taxes i can t go off with this man s money without doing something to earn it like taking advantage of the bankrupt act or leaving a bottle of eczema lotion in his pocket to make it look more like a square deal well says andy it does seem kind of hard on one s professional pride to lope off with a bearded pard s competency especially after he has nominated you custodian of his bundle in the sappy insouciance of his urban indiscrimination suppose we wake him up and see if we can formulate some commercial sophistry by which he will be enabled to give us both his money and a good excuse we wakes up whiskers he stretches himself and yawns out the hypothesis that he must have dropped off for a minute and then he says he wouldn t mind sitting in at a little gentleman s game of poker he used to play some when he attended high school in brooklyn and as he was out for a good time why and so forth andy brights up a little at that for it looks like it might be a solution to our financial troubles so we all three go to our hotel further down broadway and have the cards and chips brought up to andy s room i tried once more to make this babe in the horticultural gardens take his five thousand but no keep that little roll for me mr peters says he and oblige i ll ask you fer it when i want it i guess i know when i m among friends a man that s done business on beekman street for twenty years right in the heart of the wisest old village on earth ought to know what he s about i guess i can tell a gentleman from a con man or a flimflammer when i meet him i ve got some odd change in my clothes enough to start the game with i guess he goes through his pockets and rains gold certificates on the table till it looked like a autumn day in a lemon grove picture by turner in the salons andy almost smiled the first round that was dealt this boulevardier slaps down his hand claims low and jack and big casino and rakes in the pot andy always took a pride in his poker playing he got up from the table and looked sadly out of the window at the street cars well gentlemen says the cigar man i don t blame you for not wanting to play i ve forgotten the fine points of the game i guess it s been so long since i indulged now how long are you gentlemen going to be in the city i told him about a week longer he says that ll suit him fine his cousin is coming over from brooklyn that evening and they are going to see the sights of new york his cousin he says is in the artificial limb and lead casket business and hasn t crossed the bridge in eight years they expect to have the time of their lives and he winds up by asking me to keep his roll of money for him till next day i tried to make him take it but it only insulted him to mention it i ll use what i ve got in loose change says he you keep the rest for me i ll drop in on you and mr tucker to morrow afternoon about or says he and we ll have dinner together be good after whiskers had gone andy looked at me curious and doubtful well jeff says he it looks like the ravens are trying to feed us two elijahs so hard that if we turned em down again we ought to have the audubon society after us it won t do to put the crown aside too often i know this is something like paternalism but don t you think opportunity has skinned its knuckles about enough knocking at our door i put my feet up on the table and my hands in my pockets which is an attitude unfavorable to frivolous thoughts andy says i this man with the hirsute whiskers has got us in a predicament we can t move hand or foot with his money you and me have got a gentleman s agreement with fortune that we can t break we ve done business in the west where it s more of a fair game out there the people we skin are trying to skin us even the farmers and the remittance men that the magazines send out to write up goldfields but there s little sport in new york city for rod reel or gun they hunt here with either one of two things a slungshot or a letter of introduction the town has been stocked so full of carp that the game fish are all gone if you spread a net here do you catch legitimate suckers in it such as the lord intended to be caught fresh guys who know it all sports with a little coin and the nerve to play another man s game street crowds out for the fun of dropping a dollar or two and village smarties who know just where the little pea is no sir says i what the grafters live on here is widows and orphans and foreigners who save up a bag of money and hand it out over the first counter they see with an iron railing to it and factory girls and little shopkeepers that never leave the block they do business on that s what they call suckers here they re nothing but canned sardines and all the bait you need to catch em is a pocketknife and a soda cracker now this cigar man i went on is one of the types he s lived twenty years on one street without learning as much as you would in getting a once over shave from a lockjawed barber in a kansas crossroads town but he s a new yorker and he ll brag about that all the time when he isn t picking up live wires or getting in front of street cars or paying out money to wire tappers or standing under a safe that s being hoisted into a skyscraper when a new yorker does loosen up says i it s like the spring decomposition of the ice jam in the allegheny river he ll swamp you with cracked ice and back water if you don t get out of the way it s mighty lucky for us andy says i that this cigar exponent with the parsley dressing saw fit to bedeck us with his childlike trust and altruism for says i this money of his is an eyesore to my sense of rectitude and ethics we can t take it andy you know we can t says i for we haven t a shadow of a title to it not a shadow if there was the least bit of a way we could put in a claim to it i d be willing to see him start in for another twenty years and make another for himself but we haven t sold him anything we haven t been embroiled in a trade or anything commercial he approached us friendly says i and with blind and beautiful idiocy laid the stuff in our hands we ll have to give it back to him when he wants it your arguments says andy are past criticism or comprehension no we can t walk off with the money as things now stand i admire your conscious way of doing business jeff says andy and i wouldn t propose anything that wasn t square in line with your theories of morality and initiative but i ll be away to night and most of to morrow jeff says andy i ve got some business affairs that i want to attend to when this free greenbacks party comes in to morrow afternoon hold him here till i arrive we ve all got an engagement for dinner you know well sir about the next afternoon in trips the cigar man with his eyes half open been having a glorious time mr peters says he took in all the sights i tell you new york is the onliest only now if you don t mind says he i ll lie down on that couch and doze off for about nine minutes before mr tucker comes i m not used to being up all night and to morrow if you don t mind mr peters i ll take that five thousand i met a man last night that s got a sure winner at the racetrack to morrow excuse me for being so impolite as to go to sleep mr peters and so this inhabitant of the second city in the world reposes himself and begins to snore while i sit there musing over things and wishing i was back in the west where you could always depend on a customer fighting to keep his money hard enough to let your conscience take it from him at half past andy comes in and sees the sleeping form i ve been over to trenton says andy pulling a document out of his pocket i think i ve got this matter fixed up all right jeff look at that i open the paper and see that it is a corporation charter issued by the state of new jersey to the peters tucker consolidated and amalgamated aerial franchise development company limited it s to buy up rights of way for airship lines explained andy the legislature wasn t in session but i found a man at a postcard stand in the lobby that kept a stock of charters on hand there are shares says andy expected to reach a par value of i had one blank certificate of stock printed andy takes out the blank and begins to fill it in with a fountain pen the whole bunch says he goes to our friend in dreamland for did you learn his name make it out to bearer says i we put the certificate of stock in the cigar man s hand and went out to pack our suit cases illustration we put the certificate of stock in the cigarman s hand on the ferryboat andy says to me is your conscience easy about taking the money now jeff why shouldn t it be says i are we any better than any other holding corporation conscience in art i never could hold my partner andy tucker down to legitimate ethics of pure swindling said jeff peters to me one day andy had too much imagination to be honest he used to devise schemes of money getting so fraudulent and high financial that they wouldn t have been allowed in the bylaws of a railroad rebate system myself i never believed in taking any man s dollars unless i gave him something for it something in the way of rolled gold jewelry garden seeds lumbago lotion stock certificates stove polish or a crack on the head to show for his money i guess i must have had new england ancestors away back and inherited some of their stanch and rugged fear of the police but andy s family tree was in different kind i don t think he could have traced his descent any further back than a corporation one summer while we was in the middle west working down the ohio valley with a line of family albums headache powders and roach destroyer andy takes one of his notions of high and actionable financiering jeff says he i ve been thinking that we ought to drop these rutabaga fanciers and give our attention to something more nourishing and prolific if we keep on snapshooting these hinds for their egg money we ll be classed as nature fakers how about plunging into the fastnesses of the skyscraper country and biting some big bull caribous in the chest well says i you know my idiosyncrasies i prefer a square non illegal style of business such as we are carrying on now when i take money i want to leave some tangible object in the other fellow s hands for him to gaze at and to distract his attention from my spoor even if it s only a komical kuss trick finger ring for squirting perfume in a friend s eye but if you ve got a fresh idea andy says i let s have a look at it i m not so wedded to petty graft that i would refuse something better in the way of a subsidy i was thinking says andy of a little hunt without horn hound or camera among the great herd of the midas americanus commonly known as the pittsburg millionaires in new york i asks no sir says andy in pittsburg that s their habitat they don t like new york they go there now and then just because it s expected of em a pittsburg millionaire in new york is like a fly in a cup of hot coffee he attracts attention and comment but he don t enjoy it new york ridicules him for blowing so much money in that town of sneaks and snobs and sneers the truth is he don t spend anything while he is there i saw a memorandum of expenses for a ten days trip to bunkum town made by a pittsburg man worth once here s the way he set it down r r fare to and from cab fare to and from hotel hotel bill per day tips total that s the voice of new york goes on andy the town s nothing but a head waiter if you tip it too much it ll go and stand by the door and make fun of you to the hat check boy when a pittsburger wants to spend money and have a good time he stays at home that s where we ll go to catch him well to make a dense story more condensed me and andy cached our paris green and antipyrine powders and albums in a friend s cellar and took the trail to pittsburg andy didn t have any especial prospectus of chicanery and violence drawn up but he always had plenty of confidence that his immoral nature would rise to any occasion that presented itself as a concession to my ideas of self preservation and rectitude he promised that if i should take an active and incriminating part in any little business venture that we might work up there should be something actual and cognizant to the senses of touch sight taste or smell to transfer to the victim for the money so my conscience might rest easy after that i felt better and entered more cheerfully into the foul play andy says i as we strayed through the smoke along the cinderpath they call smithfield street had you figured out how we are going to get acquainted with these coke kings and pig iron squeezers not that i would decry my own worth or system of drawing room deportment and work with the olive fork and pie knife says i but isn t the entree nous into the salons of the stogie smokers going to be harder than you imagined if there s any handicap at all says andy it s our own refinement and inherent culture pittsburg millionaires are a fine body of plain wholehearted unassuming democratic men they are rough but uncivil in their manners and though their ways are boisterous and unpolished under it all they have a great deal of impoliteness and discourtesy nearly every one of em rose from obscurity says andy and they ll live in it till the town gets to using smoke consumers if we act simple and unaffected and don t go too far from the saloons and keep making a noise like an import duty on steel rails we won t have any trouble in meeting some of em socially well andy and me drifted about town three or four days getting our bearings we got to knowing several millionaires by sight one used to stop his automobile in front of our hotel and have a quart of champagne brought out to him when the waiter opened it he d turn it up to his mouth and drink it out of the bottle that showed he used to be a glassblower before he made his money one evening andy failed to come to the hotel for dinner about o clock he came into my room landed one jeff says he twelve millions oil rolling mills real estate and natural gas he s a fine man no airs about him made all his money in the last five years he s got professors posting him up now in education art and literature and haberdashery and such things when i saw him he d just won a bet of with a steel corporation man that there d be four suicides in the allegheny rolling mills to day so everybody in sight had to walk up and have drinks on him he took a fancy to me and asked me to dinner with him we went to a restaurant in diamond alley and sat on stools and had a sparkling moselle and clam chowder and apple fritters then he wanted to show me his bachelor apartment on liberty street he s got ten rooms over a fish market with privilege of the bath on the next floor above he told me it cost him to furnish his apartment and i believe it he s got worth of pictures in one room and worth of curios and antiques in another his name s scudder and he s and taking lessons on the piano and barrels of oil a day out of his wells all right says i preliminary canter satisfactory but kay vooly voo what good is the art junk to us and the oil now that man says andy sitting thoughtfully on the bed ain t what you would call an ordinary scutt when he was showing me his cabinet of art curios his face lighted up like the door of a coke oven he says that if some of his big deals go through he ll make j p morgan s collection of sweatshop tapestry and augusta me beadwork look like the contents of an ostrich s craw thrown on a screen by a magic lantern and then he showed me a little carving went on andy that anybody could see was a wonderful thing it was something like years old he said it was a lotus flower with a woman s face in it carved out of a solid piece of ivory scudder looks it up in a catalogue and describes it an egyptian carver named khafra made two of em for king rameses ii about the year b c the other one can t be found the junkshops and antique bugs have rubbered all europe for it but it seems to be out of stock scudder paid for the one he has oh well says i this sounds like the purling of a rill to me i thought we came here to teach the millionaires business instead of learning art from em be patient says andy kindly maybe we will see a rift in the smoke ere long all the next morning andy was out i didn t see him until about noon he came to the hotel and called me into his room across the hall he pulled a roundish bundle about as big as a goose egg out of his pocket and unwrapped it it was an ivory carving just as he had described the millionaire s to me i went in an old second hand store and pawnshop a while ago says andy and i see this half hidden under a lot of old daggers and truck the pawnbroker said he d had it several years and thinks it was soaked by some arabs or turks or some foreign dubs that used to live down by the river i offered him for it and i must have looked like i wanted it for he said it would be taking the pumpernickel out of his children s mouths to hold any conversation that did not lead up to a price of i finally got it for jeff goes on andy this is the exact counterpart of scudder s carving it s absolutely a dead ringer for it he ll pay for it as quick as he d tuck a napkin under his chin and why shouldn t it be the genuine other one anyhow that the old gypsy whittled out why not indeed says i and how shall we go about compelling him to make a voluntary purchase of it andy had his plan all ready and i ll tell you how we carried it out i got a pair of blue spectacles put on my black frock coat rumpled my hair up and became prof pickleman i went to another hotel registered and sent a telegram to scudder to come to see me at once on important art business the elevator dumped him on me in less than an hour he was a foggy man with a clarion voice smelling of connecticut wrappers and naphtha hello profess he shouts how s your conduct i rumpled my hair some more and gave him a blue glass stare sir says i are you cornelius t scudder of pittsburg pennsylvania i am says he come out and have a drink i ve neither the time nor the desire says i for such harmful and deleterious amusements i have come from new york says i on a matter of busi on a matter of art i learned there that you are the owner of an egyptian ivory carving of the time of rameses ii representing the head of queen isis in a lotus flower there were only two of such carvings made one has been lost for many years i recently discovered and purchased the other in a pawn in an obscure museum in vienna i wish to purchase yours name your price well the great ice jams profess says scudder have you found the other one me sell no i don t guess cornelius scudder needs to sell anything that he wants to keep have you got the carving with you profess i shows it to scudder he examines it careful all over it s the article says he it s a duplicate of mine every line and curve of it tell you what i ll do he says i won t sell but i ll buy give you for yours since you won t sell i will says i large bills please i m a man of few words i must return to new york to night i lecture to morrow at the aquarium scudder sends a check down and the hotel cashes it he goes off with his piece of antiquity and i hurry back to andy s hotel according to arrangement andy is walking up and down the room looking at his watch well he says twenty five hundred says i cash we ve got just eleven minutes says andy to catch the b o westbound grab your baggage what s the hurry says i it was a square deal and even if it was only an imitation of the original carving it ll take him some time to find it out he seemed to be sure it was the genuine article it was says andy it was his own when i was looking at his curios yesterday he stepped out of the room for a moment and i pocketed it now will you pick up your suit case and hurry then says i why was that story about finding another one in the pawn oh says andy out of respect for that conscience of yours come on the man higher up across our two dishes of spaghetti in a corner of provenzano s restaurant jeff peters was explaining to me the three kinds of graft every winter jeff comes to new york to eat spaghetti to watch the shipping in east river from the depths of his chinchilla overcoat and to lay in a supply of chicago made clothing at one of the fulton street stores during the other three seasons he may be found further west his range is from spokane to tampa in his profession he takes a pride which he supports and defends with a serious and unique philosophy of ethics his profession is no new one he is an incorporated uncapitalized unlimited asylum for the reception of the restless and unwise dollars of his fellowmen in the wilderness of stone in which jeff seeks his annual lonely holiday he is glad to palaver of his many adventures as a boy will whistle after sundown in a wood wherefore i mark on my calendar the time of his coming and open a question of privilege at provenzano s concerning the little wine stained table in the corner between the rakish rubber plant and the framed palazzio della something on the wall there are two kinds of graft said jeff that ought to be wiped out by law i mean wall street speculation and burglary nearly everybody will agree with you as to one of them said i with a laugh well burglary ought to be wiped out too said jeff and i wondered whether the laugh had been redundant about three months ago said jeff it was my privilege to become familiar with a sample of each of the aforesaid branches of illegitimate art i was sine qua grata with a member of the housebreakers union and one of the john d napoleons of finance at the same time interesting combination said i with a yawn did i tell you i bagged a duck and a ground squirrel at one shot last week over in the ramapos i knew well how to draw jeff s stories let me tell you first about these barnacles that clog the wheels of society by poisoning the springs of rectitude with their upas like eye said jeff with the pure gleam of the muck raker in his own as i said three months ago i got into bad company there are two times in a man s life when he does this when he s dead broke and when he s rich now and then the most legitimate business runs out of luck it was out in arkansas i made the wrong turn at a cross road and drives into this town of peavine by mistake it seems i had already assaulted and disfigured peavine the spring of the year before i had sold worth of young fruit trees there plums cherries peaches and pears the peaviners were keeping an eye on the country road and hoping i might pass that way again i drove down main street as far as the crystal palace drugstore before i realized i had committed ambush upon myself and my white horse bill the peaviners took me by surprise and bill by the bridle and began a conversation that wasn t entirely disassociated with the subject of fruit trees a committee of em ran some trace chains through the armholes of my vest and escorted me through their gardens and orchards their fruit trees hadn t lived up to their labels most of em had turned out to be persimmons and dogwoods with a grove or two of blackjacks and poplars the only one that showed any signs of bearing anything was a fine young cottonwood that had put forth a hornet s nest and half of an old corset cover the peaviners protracted our fruitless stroll to the edge of town they took my watch and money on account and they kept bill and the wagon as hostages they said the first time one of them dogwood trees put forth an amsden s june peach i might come back and get my things then they took off the trace chains and jerked their thumbs in the direction of the rocky mountains and i struck a lewis and clark lope for the swollen rivers and impenetrable forests when i regained intellectualness i found myself walking into an unidentified town on the a t s f railroad the peaviners hadn t left anything in my pockets except a plug of chewing they wasn t after my life and that saved it i bit off a chunk and sits down on a pile of ties by the track to recogitate my sensations of thought and perspicacity and then along comes a fast freight which slows up a little at the town and off of it drops a black bundle that rolls for twenty yards in a cloud of dust and then gets up and begins to spit soft coal and interjections i see it is a young man broad across the face dressed more for pullmans than freights and with a cheerful kind of smile in spite of it all that made phoebe snow s job look like a chimney sweep s fall off says i nunk says he got off arrived at my destination what town is this haven t looked it up on the map yet says i i got in about five minutes before you did how does it strike you hard says he twisting one of his arms around i believe that shoulder no it s all right he stoops over to brush the dust off his clothes when out of his pocket drops a fine nine inch burglar s steel jimmy he picks it up and looks at me sharp and then grins and holds out his hand brother says he greetings didn t i see you in southern missouri last summer selling colored sand at half a dollar a teaspoonful to put into lamps to keep the oil from exploding oil says i never explodes it s the gas that forms that explodes but i shakes hands with him anyway my name s bill bassett says he to me and if you ll call it professional pride instead of conceit i ll inform you that you have the pleasure of meeting the best burglar that ever set a gum shoe on ground drained by the mississippi river well me and this bill bassett sits on the ties and exchanges brags as artists in kindred lines will do it seems he didn t have a cent either and we went into close caucus he explained why an able burglar sometimes had to travel on freights by telling me that a servant girl had played him false in little rock and he was making a quick get away it s part of my business says bill bassett to play up to the ruffles when i want to make a riffle as raffles tis loves that makes the bit go round show me a house with a swag in it and a pretty parlor maid and you might as well call the silver melted down and sold and me spilling truffles and that chateau stuff on the napkin under my chin while the police are calling it an inside job just because the old lady s nephew teaches a bible class i first make an impression on the girl says bill and when she lets me inside i make an impression on the locks but this one in little rock done me says he she saw me taking a trolley ride with another girl and when i came round on the night she was to leave the door open for me it was fast and i had keys made for the doors upstairs but no sir she had sure cut off my locks she was a delilah says bill bassett it seems that bill tried to break in anyhow with his jimmy but the girl emitted a succession of bravura noises like the top riders of a tally ho and bill had to take all the hurdles between there and the depot as he had no baggage they tried hard to check his departure but he made a train that was just pulling out well says bill bassett when we had exchanged memories of our dead lives i could eat this town don t look like it was kept under a yale lock suppose we commit some mild atrocity that will bring in temporary expense money i don t suppose you ve brought along any hair tonic or rolled gold watch chains or similar law defying swindles that you could sell on the plaza to the pikers of the paretic populace have you no says i i left an elegant line of patagonian diamond earrings and rainy day sunbursts in my valise at peavine but they re to stay there until some of those black gum trees begin to glut the market with yellow clings and japanese plums i reckon we can t count on them unless we take luther burbank in for a partner very well says bassett we ll do the best we can maybe after dark i ll borrow a hairpin from some lady and open the farmers and drovers marine bank with it while we were talking up pulls a passenger train to the depot near by a person in a high hat gets off on the wrong side of the train and comes tripping down the track towards us he was a little fat man with a big nose and rat s eyes but dressed expensive and carrying a hand satchel careful as if it had eggs or railroads bonds in it he passes by us and keeps on down the track not appearing to notice the town come on says bill bassett to me starting after him where i asks lordy says bill had you forgot you was in the desert didn t you see colonel manna drop down right before your eyes don t you hear the rustling of general raven s wings i m surprised at you elijah we overtook the stranger in the edge of some woods and as it was after sun down and in a quiet place nobody saw us stop him bill takes the silk hat off the man s head and brushes it with his sleeve and puts it back what does this mean sir says the man when i wore one of these says bill and felt embarrassed i always done that not having one now i had to use yours i hardly know how to begin sir in explaining our business with you but i guess we ll try your pockets first bill bassett felt in all of them and looked disgusted not even a watch he says ain t you ashamed of yourself you whited sculpture going about dressed like a head waiter and financed like a count you haven t even got carfare what did you do with your transfer the man speaks up and says he has no assets or valuables of any sort but bassett takes his hand satchel and opens it out comes some collars and socks and a half a page of a newspaper clipped out bill reads the clipping careful and holds out his hand to the held up party brother says he greetings accept the apologies of friends i am bill bassett the burglar mr peters you must make the acquaintance of mr alfred e ricks shake hands mr peters says bill stands about halfway between me and you mr ricks in the line of havoc and corruption he always gives something for the money he gets i m glad to meet you mr ricks you and mr peters this is the first time i ever attended a full gathering of the national synod of sharks housebreaking swindling and financiering all represented please examine mr rick s credentials mr peters the piece of newspaper that bill bassett handed me had a good picture of this ricks on it it was a chicago paper and it had obloquies of ricks in every paragraph by reading it over i harvested the intelligence that said alleged ricks had laid off all that portion of the state of florida that lies under water into town lots and sold em to alleged innocent investors from his magnificently furnished offices in chicago after he had taken in a hundred thousand or so dollars one of these fussy purchasers that are always making trouble i ve had em actually try gold watches i ve sold em with acid took a cheap excursion down to the land where it is always just before supper to look at his lot and see if it didn t need a new paling or two on the fence and market a few lemons in time for the christmas present trade he hires a surveyor to find his lot for him they run the line out and find the flourishing town of paradise hollow so advertised to be about rods and poles s degrees e of the middle of lake okeechobee this man s lot was under thirty six feet of water and besides had been preempted so long by the alligators and gars that his title looked fishy naturally the man goes back to chicago and makes it as hot for alfred e ricks as the morning after a prediction of snow by the weather bureau ricks defied the allegation but he couldn t deny the alligators one morning the papers came out with a column about it and ricks come out by the fire escape it seems the alleged authorities had beat him to the safe deposit box where he kept his winnings and ricks has to westward ho with only feetwear and a dozen and a half english pokes in his shopping bag he happened to have some mileage left in his book and that took him as far as the town in the wilderness where he was spilled out on me and bill bassett as elijah iii with not a raven in sight for any of us then this alfred e ricks lets out a squeak that he is hungry too and denies the hypothesis that he is good for the value let alone the price of a meal and so there was the three of us representing if we had a mind to draw syllogisms and parabolas labor and trade and capital now when trade has no capital there isn t a dicker to be made and when capital has no money there s a stagnation in steak and onions that put it up to the man with the jimmy brother bushrangers says bill bassett never yet in trouble did i desert a pal hard by in yon wood i seem to see unfurnished lodgings let us go there and wait till dark there was an old deserted cabin in the grove and we three took possession of it after dark bill bassett tells us to wait and goes out for half an hour he comes back with a armful of bread and spareribs and pies panhandled em at a farmhouse on washita avenue says he eat drink and be leary the full moon was coming up bright so we sat on the floor of the cabin and ate in the light of it and this bill bassett begins to brag sometimes says he with his mouth full of country produce i lose all patience with you people that think you are higher up in the profession than i am now what could either of you have done in the present emergency to set us on our feet again could you do it ricksy i must confess mr bassett says ricks speaking nearly inaudible out of a slice of pie that at this immediate juncture i could not perhaps promote an enterprise to relieve the situation large operations such as i direct naturally require careful preparation in advance i i know ricksy breaks in bill bassett you needn t finish you need to make the first payment on a blond typewriter and four roomsful of quartered oak furniture and you need more for advertising contracts and you need two weeks time for the fish to begin to bite your line of relief would be about as useful in an emergency as advocating municipal ownership to cure a man suffocated by eighty cent gas and your graft ain t much swifter brother peters he winds up oh says i i haven t seen you turn anything into gold with your wand yet mr good fairy most anybody could rub the magic ring for a little left over victuals that was only getting the pumpkin ready says bassett braggy and cheerful the coach and six ll drive up to the door before you know it miss cinderella maybe you ve got some scheme under your sleeve holders that will give us a start son says i i m fifteen years older than you are and young enough yet to take out an endowment policy i ve been broke before we can see the lights of that town not half a mile away i learned under montague silver the greatest street man that ever spoke from a wagon there are hundreds of men walking those streets this moment with grease spots on their clothes give me a gasoline lamp a dry goods box and a two dollar bar of white castile soap cut into little

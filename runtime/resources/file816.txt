jury and it will vote mr greaser guilty without leaving the box the plover shooting was fine that afternoon and in the excitement of the sport the case of rafael and the grief of joya trevi as was forgotten the district attor ney and nancy derwent drove out from the town three miles along a smooth grassy road and then struck across a rolling prairie toward a heavy line of timber on piedra creek beyond this creek lay long prairie the favourite haunt of the plover as they were nearing the creek they heard the galloping of a horse to their right and saw a man with black hair and a swarthy face riding toward the woods at a tangent as if he had come up behind them i ve seen that fellow somewhere said littlefield who had a memory for faces but i can t exactly place him some ranchman i suppose taking a short cut home they spent an hour on long prairie shooting from the buckboard nancy derwent an active outdoor western girl was pleased with her twelve bore she had bagged within two brace of her companion s score they started homeward at a gentle trot when within a hundred yards of piedra creek a man rode out of the timber directly toward them it looks like the man we saw coming over remarked miss derwent as the distance between them lessened the district attorney suddenly pulled up his team sharply with his eyes fixed upon the advancing horseman that individ ual had drawn a winchester from its scabbard on his saddle and thrown it over his arm now i know you mexico sam muttered littlefield to himself it was you who shook your rattles in that gentle epistle mexico sam did not leave things long in doubt he had a nice eye in all matters relating to firearms so when he was within good rifle range but outside of danger from no shot he threw up his winchester and opened fire upon the occupants of the buckboard the first shot cracked the back of the seat within the two inch space between the shoulders of littlefield and miss derwent the next went through the dashboard and littlefield s trouser leg the district attorney hustled nancy out of the buck board to the ground she was a little pale but asked no questions she had the frontier instinct that accepts conditions in an emergency without superfluous argument they kept their guns in hand and littlefield hastily gathered some handfuls of cartridges from the pasteboard box on the seat and crowded them into his pockets keep behind the horses nan he commanded that fellow is a ruffian i sent to prison once he s trying to get even he knows our shot won t hurt him at that distance all right bob said nancy steadily i m not afraid but you come close too whoa bess stand still now she stroked bess s mane littlefield stood with his gun ready praying that the desperado would come within range but mexico sam was playing his vendetta along safe lines he was a bird of different feather from the plover his accurate eye drew an imaginary line of circumference around the area of danger from bird shot and upon this line lie rode his horse wheeled to the right and as his victims rounded to the safe side of their equine breast work he sent a ball through the district attorney s hat once he miscalculated in making a d tour and over stepped ms margin littlefield s gun flashed and mexico sam ducked his head to the harmless patter of the shot a few of them stung his horse which pranced promptly back to the safety line the desperado fired again a little cry came from nancy derwent littlefield whirled with blazing eyes and saw the blood trickling down her cheek i m not hurt bob only a splinter struck me i think he hit one of the wheel spokes lord groaned littlefield if i only had a charge of buckshot the ruffian got his horse still and took careful aim fly gave a snort and fell in the harness struck in the neck bess now disabused of the idea that plover were being fired at broke her traces and galloped wildly away mexican sam sent a ball neatly through the fulness of nancy derwent s shooting jacket lie down lie down snapped littlefield close to the horse flat on the ground so he almost threw her upon the grass against the back of the recum bent fly oddly enough at that moment the words of the mexican girl returned to his mind if the life of the girl you love is ever in danger remem ber rafael ortiz littlefield uttered an exclamation open fire on him nan across the horse s back fire as fast as you can you can t hurt him but keep him dodging shot for one minute while i try to work a little scheme nancy gave a quick glance at littlefield and saw him take out his pocket knife and open it then she turned her face to obey orders keeping up a rapid fire at the enemy mexico sam waited patiently until this innocuous fusillade ceased he had plenty of time and he did not care to risk the chance of a bird shot in his eye when could be avoided by a little caution he pulled his heavy stetson low down over his face until the shots ceased then he drew a little nearer and fired with careful aim at what he could see of his victims above the fallen horse neither of them moved he urged his horse a few steps nearer he saw the district attorney rise to one knee and deliberately level his shotgun he pulled his hat down and awaited the harmless rattle of the tiny pellets the shotgun blazed with a heavy report mexico sam

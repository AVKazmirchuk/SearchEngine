hankering for the oral and polyglot system of buncoing that man had a vocabulary of about words and synonyms which arrayed themselves into contraband sophistries and parables when they came out listen says andy to old smoke em out can we do it you behold before you mr smithers two of the finest equipped men on earth for inveigling the proletariat whether by word of mouth sleight of hand or swiftness of foot dukes come and go explorers go and get lost but me and jeff peters says andy go after the come ons forever if you say so we re the two illustrious guests you were expecting and you ll find says andy that we ll give you the true local color of the title r les from the aurora borealis to the ducal portcullis old smoke em out is delighted he takes me and andy up to the inn by an arm apiece telling us on the way that the finest fruits of the can and luxuries of the fast freights should be ours without price as long as we would stay on the porch smoke em out says ladies i have the honor to introduce his gracefulness the duke of marlborough and the famous inventor of the north pole lieut peary the skirts all flutter and the rocking chairs squeak as me and andy bows and then goes on in with old smoke em out to register and then we washed up and turned our cuffs and the landlord took us to the rooms he d been saving for us and got out a demijohn of north carolina real mountain dew i expected trouble when andy began to drink he has the artistic metempsychosis which is half drunk when sober and looks down on airships when stimulated after lingering with the demijohn me and andy goes out on the porch where the ladies are to begin to earn our keep we sit in two special chairs and then the schoolma ams and literaterrers hunched their rockers close around us one lady says to me how did that last venture of yours turn out sir now i d clean forgot to have an understanding with andy which i was to be the duke or the lieutenant and i couldn t tell from her question whether she was referring to arctic or matrimonial expeditions so i gave an answer that would cover both cases well ma am says i it was a freeze out right smart of a freeze out ma am and then the flood gates of andy s perorations was opened and i knew which one of the renowned ostensible guests i was supposed to be i wasn t either andy was both and still furthermore it seemed that he was trying to be the mouthpiece of the whole british nobility and of arctic exploration from sir john franklin down it was the union of corn whiskey and the conscientious fictional form that mr w d howletts admires so much ladies says andy smiling semicircularly i am truly glad to visit america i do not consider the magna charta says he or gas balloons or snow shoes in any way a detriment to the

lieutenant says a schoolma am excitedly andy gives a loud sob the duchess shook me he cries out and slides out of the chair and weeps on the porch well of course that fixed the scheme the women boarders all left the next morning the landlord wouldn t speak to us for two days but when he found we had money to pay our way he loosened up so me and andy had a quiet restful summer after all coming away from crow knob with that we enticed out of old smoke em out playing seven up shearing the wolf jeff peters was always eloquent when the ethics of his profession was under discussion the only times said he that me and andy tucker ever had any hiatuses in our cordial intents was when we differed on the moral aspects of grafting andy had his standards and i had mine i didn t approve of all of andy s schemes for levying contributions from the public and he thought i allowed my conscience to interfere too often for the financial good of the firm we had high arguments sometimes one

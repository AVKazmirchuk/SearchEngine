then turned abruptly and returned to the bench where the young couple sat he took off his hat and began to speak the girl looked at him with the same sprightly glowing interest that she had been giving to the lights and statuary and sky reaching buildings that made the old square seem so far away from bedford county mr er roanoke said pilkins i admire your your indepen your idiocy so much

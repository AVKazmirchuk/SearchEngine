have occurred to him to declare his apple an emblem he had intended after it had been divided and eaten to create diversion by sticking the seeds against his forehead and naming them for young ladies of his acquaintance one he was going to name mrs mcfarland the seed that fell off first would be but twas too late now the apple continued judge menefee charging his jury in modern days occupies though undeservedly a lowly place in our esteem indeed it is so constantly associated with the culinary and the commercial that it is hardly to be classed among the polite fruits but in ancient times this was not so biblical historical and mythological lore abounds with evidences that the apple was the aristocrat of fruits we still say the apple of the eye when we wish to describe something superlatively precious we find in proverbs the comparison to apples of silver no other product of tree or vine has been so utilised in figurative speech who has not heard of and longed for the apples of the hesperides i need not call your attention to the most tremendous and significant instance of the apple s ancient prestige when its consumption by our first parents occasioned the fall of man from his state of goodness and perfection apples like them said the windmill man lingering with the objective article are worth a barrel in the chicago market now what i have to propose said judge menefee conceding an indulgent smile to his interrupter is this we must remain here perforce until morning we have wood in plenty to keep us warm our next need is to entertain ourselves as best we can in order that the time shall not pass too slowly i propose that we place this apple in the hands of miss garland it is no longer a fruit but as i said a prize in award representing a great human idea miss garland herself shall cease to be an individual but only temporarily i am happy to add a low bow full of the old time grace she shall represent her sex she shall be the embodiment the epitome of womankind the heart and brain i may say of god s masterpiece of creation in this guise she shall judge and decide the question which follows but a few minutes ago our friend mr rose favoured us with an entertaining but fragmentary sketch of the romance in the life of the former professor of this habitation the few facts that we have learned seem to me to open up a fascinating field for conjecture for the study of human hearts for the exercise of the imagination in short for story telling let us make use of the opportunity let each one of us relate his own version of the story of redruth the hermit and his lady love beginning where mr rose s narrative ends at the parting of the lovers at the gate this much should be assumed and conceded that the young lady was not necessarily to blame for redruth s becoming a crazed and world hating hermit when we have done miss garland shall render the judgement of woman as the spirit of her sex she shall decide which version of the story best and most truly depicts human and love interest and most faithfully estimates the character and acts of redruth s betrothed according to the feminine view the apple shall be bestowed upon him who is awarded the decision if you are all agreed we shall be pleased to hear the first story from mr dinwiddie the last sentence captured the windmill man he was not one to linger in the dumps that s a first rate scheme judge he said heartily be a regular short story vaudeville won t it i used to be correspondent for a paper in springfield and when there wasn t any news i faked it guess i can do my turn all right i think the idea is charming said the lady passenger brightly it will be almost like a game judge menefee stepped forward and placed the apple in her hand impressively in olden days he said orotundly paris awarded the golden apple to the most beautiful i was at the exposition remarked the windmill man now cheerful again but i never heard of it and i was on the midway too all the time i wasn t at the machinery exhibit but now continued the judge the fruit shall translate to us the mystery and wisdom of the feminine heart take the apple miss garland hear our modest tales of romance and then award the prize as you may deem it just the lady passenger smiled sweetly the apple lay in her lap beneath her robes and wraps she reclined against her protecting bulwark brightly and cosily at ease but for the voices and the wind one might have listened hopefully to hear her purr someone cast fresh logs upon the fire judge menefee nodded suavely will you oblige us with the initial story he asked the windmill man sat as sits a turk with his hat well back on his head on account of the draughts well he began without any embarrassment this is about the way i size up the difficulty of course redruth was jostled a good deal by this duck who had money to play ball with who tried to cut him out of his girl so he goes around naturally and asks her if the game is still square well nobody wants a guy cutting in with buggies and gold bonds when he s got an option on a girl well he goes around to see her well maybe he s hot and talks like the proprietor and forgets that an engagement ain t always a lead pipe cinch well i guess that makes alice warm under the lacy yoke well she answers back sharp well he say

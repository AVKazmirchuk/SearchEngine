to do to get a release from this ice factory you ll get catarrh here johnny and my god you haven t any socks on bellchambers looked down at his sandaled feet and smiled you fellows don t understand he said soothingly it s nice of you to want me to go back but the old life will never know me again i have reached here the goal of all my ambitions i am entirely happy and contented here i shall remain for the remainder of my days you see this robe that i wear bellchambers caressingly touched the straight hanging garment at last i have found something that will not bag at the knees i have attained at that moment the deep boom of the great brass bell reverberated through the monastery it must have been a summons to immediate devotions for brother ambrose bowed his head turned and left the chamber without another word a slight wave of his hand as he passed through the stone doorway seemed to say a farewell to his old friends they left the monastery without seeing him again and this is the story that tommy eyres and lancelot gilliam brought back with them from their latest european tour the girl and the graft the other day i ran across my old friend ferguson pogue pogue is a conscientious grafter of the highest type his headquarters is the western hemisphere and his line of business is anything from speculating in town lots on the great staked plains to selling wooden toys in connecticut made by hydraulic pressure from nutmegs ground to a pulp now and then when pogue has made a good haul he comes to new york for a rest he says the jug of wine and loaf of bread and thou in the wilderness business is about as much rest and pleasure to him as sliding down the bumps at coney would be to president taft give me says pogue a big city for my vacation especially new york i m not much fond of new yorkers and manhattan is about the only place on the globe where i don t find any while in the metropolis pogue can always be found at one of two places one is a little second hand bookshop on fourth avenue where he reads books about his hobbies mahometanism and taxidermy i found him at the other his hall bedroom in eighteenth street where he sat in his stocking feet trying to pluck the banks of the wabash out of a small zither four years he has practised this tune without arriving near enough to cast the longest trout line to the water s edge on the dresser lay a blued steel colt s forty five and a tight roll of tens and twenties large enough around to belong to the spring rattlesnake story class a chambermaid with a room cleaning air fluttered nearby in the hall unable to enter or to flee scandalized by the stocking feet aghast at the colt s yet powerless with her metropolitan instincts to remove herself beyond the magic influence of the yellow hued roll i sat on his trunk while ferguson pogue talked no one could be franker or more candid in his conversation beside his expression the cry of henry james for lacteal nourishment at the age of one month would have seemed like a chaldean cryptogram he told me stories of his profession with pride for he considered it an art and i was curious enough to ask him whether he had known any women who followed it ladies said pogue with western chivalry well not to any great extent they don t amount to much in special lines of graft because they re all so busy in general lines what why they have to who s got the money in the world the men did you ever know a man to give a woman a dollar without any consideration a man will shell out his dust to another man free and easy and gratis but if he drops a penny in one of the machines run by the madam eve s daughters amalgamated association and the pineapple chewing gum don t fall out when he pulls the lever you can hear him kick to the superintendent four blocks away man is the hardest proposition a woman has to go up against he s the low grade one and she has to work overtime to make him pay two times out of five she s salted she can t put in crushers and costly machinery he d notice em and be onto the game they have to pan out what they get and it hurts their tender hands some of em are natural sluice troughs and can carry out to the ton the dry eyed ones have to depend on signed letters false hair sympathy the kangaroo walk cowhide whips ability to cook sentimental juries conversational powers silk underskirts ancestry rouge anonymous letters violet sachet powders witnesses revolvers pneumatic forms carbolic acid moonlight cold cream and the evening newspapers you are outrageous ferg i said surely there is none of this graft as you call it in a perfect and harmonious matrimonial union well said pogue nothing that would justify you every time in calling police headquarters and ordering out the reserves and a vaudeville manager on a dead run but it s this way suppose you re a fifth avenue millionaire soaring high on the right side of copper and cappers you come home at night and bring a diamond brooch to the lady who s staked your for a claim you hand it over she says oh george and looks to see if it s backed she comes up and kisses you you ve waited for it you get it all right it s graft but i m telling you about artemisia blye she was from kansas and she suggested corn in all of

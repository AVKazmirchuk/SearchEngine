eyes were shining go on with the rat killin said be a little while after a procession approached the tree under which hackett holly and saunders were sitting smoking limpy walker was in the lead extracting a doleful tune from his concertina next came the bride and groom the cook wore the gorgeous navajo blanket tied around his waist and carried in one band the waxen white spanish dagger blossom as large as a peck measure and weighing fifteen pounds his hat was ornamented with mesquite branches and yellow ratama blooms a resurrected mosquito bar served as a veil after them stumbled phonograph davis in the character of the bride s father weeping into a saddle blanket with sobs that could be heard a mile away the cow punchers followed by twos loudly commenting upon the bride s appearance in a supposed imitation of the audiences at fashionable weddings hackett rose as the procession halted before him and after a little lecture upon matrimony asked what are your names sally and charles answered the cook join hands charles and sally perhaps there never was a stranger wedding for wedding it was though only two of those present knew it when the ceremony was over the cow punchers gave one yell of congratulation and immediately abandoned their foolery for the night blankets were unrolled and sleep became the paramount question the cook divested of his decorations and the marquis lingered for a moment in the shadow of the grub wagon the marquis leaned her head against his shoulder i didn t know what else to do she was saying father was gone and we kids had to rustle i had helped him so much with the cattle that i thought i d turn cowboy there wasn t anything else i could make a living at i wasn t much stuck on it though after i got here and i d have left only only what you know tell me something when did you first what made you oh it was as soon as we struck the camp when saunders bawled out the marquis and miss sally i saw how rattled you got at the name and i had my sus cheeky whispered the marquis and why should you think that i thought he was calling me miss sally because answered the cook calmly i was the marquis my father was the marquis of borodale but you ll excuse that won t you sally it really isn t my fault you know a fog in santone published in the cosmopolitan october probably written in or shortly after o henry s first successes in new york the drug clerk looks sharply at the white face half concealed by the high turned overcoat collar i would rather not supply you he said doubtfully i sold you a dozen morphine tablets less than an hour ago the customer smiles wanly the fault is in your crooked streets i didn t intend to call upon you twice but i guess i got tangled up excuse me he draws his collar higher and moves out slowly he stops under an electric light at the corner and juggles absorbedly with three or four little pasteboard boxes thirty six he announces to himself more than plenty for a gray mist had swept upon santone that night an opaque terror that laid a hand to the throat of each of the city s guests it was computed that three thousand invalids were hibernating in the town they had come from far and wide for here among these contracted river sliced streets the goddess ozone has elected to linger purest atmosphere sir on earth you might think from the river winding through our town that we are malarial but no sir repeated experiments made both by the government and local experts show that our air contains nothing deleterious nothing but ozone sir pure ozone litmus paper tests made all along the river show but you can read it all in the prospectuses or the santonian will recite it for you word by word we may achieve climate but weather is thrust upon us santone then cannot be blamed for this cold gray fog that came and kissed the lips of the three thousand and then delivered them to the cross that night the tubercles whose ravages hope holds in check multiplied the writhing fingers

impossible joys sent to whisper to them of the egregious folly it is to inhale breath into the lungs only to exhale it again and these used whatever came handy to their relief pistols gas or the beneficent muriate the purchaser of the morphia wanders into the fog and at length finds himself upon a little iron bridge one of the score or more in the heart of the city under which the small

strain of his cough a mocking phthisical rattle seeming to say to him clickety clack just a little rusty cold sir but not from our river litmus paper all along the banks and nothing but ozone clacket y clack the memphis man at last recovers sufficiently to be aware of another overcoated man ten feet away leaning on the rail and just coming out of a paroxysm there is a freemasonry among the three thousand that does away with formalities and introductions

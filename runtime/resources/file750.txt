sea is a geyser never a sparkle or a glimmer of wit marred his words commonplaces as trite and as plentiful as blackberries flowed from his lips no more stirring in quality than a last week s tape running from a ticker quaking a little i tried upon him one of my best pointed jokes it fell back ineffectual with the point broken i loved that man from then on two or three evenings each week i would steal down to heffelbower s and revel in his back room that was my only joy i began to rise early and hurry through my work that i might spend more time in my haven in no other place could i throw off my habit of extracting humorous ideas from my surroundings peter s talk left me no opening had i besieged it ever so hard under this influence i began to improve in spirits it was the recreation from one s labor which every man needs i surprised one or two of my former friends by throwing them a smile and a cheery word as i passed them on the streets several times i dumfounded my family by relaxing long enough to make a jocose remark in their presence i had so long been ridden by the incubus of humor that i seized my hours of holiday with a schoolboy s zest mv work began to suffer it was not the pain and burden to me that it had been i often whistled at my desk and wrote with far more fluency than before i accomplished my tasks impatiently as anxious to be off to my helpful retreat as a drunkard is to get to his tavern my wife had some anxious hours in conjecturing where i spent my afternoons i thought it best not to tell her women do not understand these things poor girl she had one shock out of it one day i brought home a silver coffin handle for a paper weight and a fine fluffy hearse plume to dust my papers with i loved to see them on my desk and think of the beloved back room down at heffelbower s but louisa found them and she shrieked with horror i had to console her with some lame excuse for having them but i saw in her eyes that the prejudice was not removed i had to remove the articles though at double quick time one day peter heffelbower laid before me a temptation that swept me off my feet in his sensible uninspired way he showed me his books and explained that his profits and his business were increasing rapidly he had thought of taking in a partner with some cash he would rather have me than any one he knew when i left his place that afternoon peter had my check for the thousand dollars i had in the bank and i was a partner in his undertaking business i went home with feelings of delirious joy mingled with a certain amount of doubt i was dreading to tell my wife about it but i walked on air to give up the writing of humorous stuff once more to enjoy the apples of life instead of squeezing them to a pulp for a few drops of hard cider to make the pubic feel funny what a boon that would be at the supper table louisa handed me some letters that had come during my absence several of them contained rejected manuscript ever since i first began going to heffelbower s my stuff had been coming back with alarming frequency lately i had been dashing off my jokes and articles with the greatest fluency previously i had labored like a bricklayer slowly and with agony presently i opened a letter from the editor of the weekly with which i had a regular contract the checks for that weekly article were still our main dependence the letter ran thus dear sir as you are aware our contract for the year expires with the present month while regretting the necessity for so doing we must say that we do not care to renew same for the coming year we were quite pleased with your style of humor which seems to have delighted quite a large proportion of our readers but for the past two months we have noticed a decided falling off in its quality your earlier work showed a spontaneous easy natural flow of fun and wit of late it is labored studied and unconvincing giving painful evidence of hard toil and drudging mechanism again regretting that we do not consider your contributions available any longer we are yours sincerely the editor i handed this letter to my wife after she had read it her face grew extremely long and there were tears in her eyes the mean old thing she exclaimed indignantly i m sure your pieces are just as good as they ever were and it doesn t take you half as long to write them as it did and then i suppose louisa thought of the checks that would cease coming oh john she wailed what will you do now for an answer i got up and began to do a polka step around the supper table i am sure louisa thought the trouble had driven me mad and i think the children hoped it had for they tore after me yelling with glee and emulating my steps i was now something like their old playmate as of yore the theatre for us to night i shouted nothing less and a late wild disreputable supper for all of us at the palace restaurant lumpty diddle de dee de dum and then i explained my glee by declaring that i was now a partner in a prosperous undertaking establishment and that written jokes might go hide their heads in sackcloth and ashes for all me with the editor s letter in her hand to

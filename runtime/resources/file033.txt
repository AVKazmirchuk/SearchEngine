once she saw evidence of the recreant reptile s progress in his distinctive trail across a spread of fine sand in the arroyo the living water was bound to lure him he could not be far away so sure was she of his immediate proximity that she perched herself to idle for a time in the curve of a great creeper that looped down from a giant water elm to reach this she climbed from the pathway a little distance up the side of a steep and rugged incline around her chaparral grew thick and high a late blooming ratama tree dispensed from its yellow petals a sweet and persistent odour adown the ravine rustled a seductive wind melancholy with the taste of sodden fallen leaves alvarita removed her hat and undoing the oppressive convolutions of her hair began to slowly arrange it in two long dusky plaits from the obscure depths of a thick clump of evergreen shrubs five feet away two small jewel bright eyes were steadfastly regarding her coiled there lay kuku the great python kuku the magnificent he of the plated muzzle the grooved lips the eleven foot stretch of elegantly and brilliantly mottled skin the great python was viewing his mistress without a sound or motion to disclose his presence perhaps the splendid truant forefelt his capture but screened by the foliage thought to prolong the delight of his escapade what pleasure it was after the hot and dusty car to lie thus smelling the running water and feeling the agreeable roughness of the earth and stones against his body soon very soon the queen would find him and he powerless as a worm in her audacious hands would be returned to the dark chest in the narrow house that ran on wheels alvarita heard a sudden crunching of the gravel below her turning her head she saw a big swarthy mexican with a daring and evil expression contemplating her with an ominous dull eye what do you want she asked as sharply as five hairpins between her lips would permit continuing to plait her hair and looking him over with placid contempt the mexican continued to gaze at her and showed his teeth in a white jagged smile i no hurt y you senorita he said you bet you won t answered the queen shaking back one finished massive plait but don t you think you d better move on not hurt y you no but maybeso take one beso one li l kees you call him the man smiled again and set his foot to ascend the slope alvarita leaned swiftly and picked up a stone the size of a cocoanut vamoose quick she ordered peremptorily you coon the red of insult burned through the mexican s dark skin hidalgo yo he shot between his fangs i am not neg r ro diabla bonita for that you shall pay me he made two quick upward steps this time but the stone hurled by no weak arm struck him square in the chest he staggered back to the footway swerved half around and met another sight that drove all thoughts of the girl from his head she turned her eyes to see what had diverted his interest a man with red brown curling hair and a melancholy sunburned smooth shaven face was coming up the path twenty yards away around the mexican s waist was buckled a pistol belt with two empty holsters he had laid aside his sixes possibly in the jacal of the fair pancha and had forgotten them when the passing of the fairer alvarita had enticed him to her trail his hands now flew instinctively to the holsters but finding the weapons gone he spread his fingers outward with the eloquent abjuring deprecating latin gesture and stood like a rock seeing his plight the newcomer unbuckled his own belt containing two revolvers threw it upon the ground and continued to advance splendid murmured alvarita with flashing eyes as bob buckley according to the mad code of bravery that his sensitive conscience imposed upon his cowardly nerves abandoned his guns and closed in upon his enemy the old inevitable nausea of abject fear wrung him his breath whistled through his constricted air passages his feet seemed like lumps of lead his mouth was dry as dust his heart congested with blood hurt his ribs as it thumped against them the hot june day turned to moist november and still he advanced spurred by a mandatory pride that strained its uttermost against his weakling flesh the distance between the two men slowly lessened the mexican stood immovable waiting when scarce five yards separated them a little shower of loosened gravel rattled down from above to the ranger s feet he glanced upward with instinctive caution a pair of dark eyes brilliantly soft and fierily tender encountered and held his own the most fearful heart and the boldest one in all the rio bravo country exchanged a silent and inscrutable communication alvarita still seated within her vine leaned forward above the breast high chaparral one hand was laid across her bosom one great dark braid curved forward over her shoulder her lips were parted her face was lit with what seemed but wonder great and absolute wonder her eyes lingered upon buckley s let no one ask or presume to tell through what subtle medium the miracle was performed as by a lightning flash two clouds will accomplish counterpoise and compensation of electric surcharge so on that eyeglance the man received his complement of manhood and the maid conceded what enriched her womanly grace by its loss the mexican suddenly stirring ventilated his attitude of apathetic waiting by conjuring swiftly from his bootleg a long knife buckley cast aside his hat and laughed once aloud like a happy school boy at a frolic then empty handed he sprang nimbly and garcia met him without default so soon was the engagement ended that disappointment

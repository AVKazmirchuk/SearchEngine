would have wavered and softened first incidentally she knew buyers now mr platt said zizzbaum i want you to see these princess gowns in the light shades they will be the thing in your climate this

cover something like weariness or contempt when the display was over platt seemed to hesitate zizzbaum was a little anxious thinking that his customer might be inclined to try elsewhere but platt was

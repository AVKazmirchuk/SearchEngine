monkeys jumpin around and crocodiles and pink tailed mockin birds and ye stood knee deep in the rotten water and grabbled roots for the liberation of guatemala of nights we would build smudges in camp to discourage the mosquitoes and sit in the smoke with the guards pacin all around us there was two hundred men working on the road mostly dagoes nigger men spanish men and swedes three or four were irish one old man named halloran a man of hibernian entitlements and discretions explained it to me he had been working on the road a year most of them died in less than six months he was dried up to gristle and bone and shook with chills every third night when you first come says he ye think ye ll leave right away but they hold out your first month s pay for your passage over and by that time the tropics has its grip on ye ye re surrounded by a ragin forest full of disreputable beasts lions and baboons and anacondas waiting to devour ye the sun strikes ye hard and melts the marrow in your bones ye get similar to the lettuce eaters the poetry books speaks about ye forget the elevated sintiments of life such as patriotism revenge disturbances of the peace and the dacint love of a clane shirt ye do your work and ye swallow the kerosene ile and rubber pipestems dished up to ye by the dago cook for food ye light your pipeful and say to yourself nixt week i ll break away and ye go to sleep and call yersilf a liar for ye know yell never do it who is this general man asks i that calls himself de vega tis the man says halloran who is tryin to complete the finishin of the railroad twas the project of a private corporation but it busted and then the government took it up de vegy is a big politician and wants to be president the people want the railroad completed as they re taxed mighty on account of it the de vegy man is pushing it along as a campaign move tis not my way says i to make threats against any man but there s an account to be settled between the railroad man and james o dowd clancy twas that way i thought mesilf at first halloran says with a big sigh until i got to be a lettuce eater the fault s wid these tropics they rejuices a man s system tis a land as the poet says where it always seems to be after dinner i does me work and smokes me pipe and sleeps there s little else in life anyway ye ll get that way yersilf mighty soon don t be harborin any sentiments at all clancy i can t help it says i i m full of em i enlisted in the revolutionary army of this dark country in good faith to fight for its liberty honors and silver candlesticks instead of which i am set to amputatin its scenery and grubbin its roots tis the general man will have to pay for it two months i worked on that railroad before i found a chance to get away one day a gang of us was sent back to the end of the completed line to fetch some picks that had been sent down to port barrios to be sharpened they were brought on a hand car and i noticed when i started away that the car was left there on the track that night about twelve i woke up halloran and told him my scheme run away says halloran good lord clancy do ye mean it why i ain t got the nerve it s too chilly and i ain t slept enough run away i told you clancy i ve eat the lettuce i ve lost my grip tis the tropics that s done it tis like the poet says forgotten are our friends that we have left behind in the hollow lettuce land we will live and lay reclined you better go on clancy i ll stay i guess it s too early and cold and i m sleepy so i had to leave halloran i dressed quiet and slipped out of the tent we were in when the guard came along i knocked him over like a ninepin with a green coconut i had and made for the railroad i got on that hand car and made it fly twas yet a while before daybreak when i saw the lights of port barrios about a mile away i stopped the hand car there and walked to the town i stepped inside the corporations of that town with care and hesitations i was not afraid of the army of guatemala but me soul quaked at the prospect of a hand to hand struggle with its employment bureau tis a country that hires its help easy and keeps em long sure i can fancy missis america and missis guatemala passin a bit of gossip some fine still night across the mountains oh dear says missis america and it s a lot of trouble i m havin ag in with the help senora ma am laws now says

dark as it was i could see a steamer ridin in the harbor with smoke emergin from her stacks i turned down a little grass street that run down to the water on the beach i found a little brown nigger man just about to shove off in a skiff hold on sambo says i savve english heap plenty yes says he with a pleasant grin what steamer is that i asks him and where is it going and what s the news and the

providence for settin the warlike talent of a clancy to gradin the tropics with a pick and shovel but tis not so much a question of insurrections now me little man as tis of the hired man problem tis anxious i am to resign a situation of responsibility and trust with the white wings department of your great and degraded country row me in your little boat out to that steamer and i ll give ye five dollars sinker pacers sinker pacers says i reducing the offer to the language and denomination of the tropic dialects cinco pesos repeats the little man five dollee you give twas not such a bad little man he had hesitations at first sayin that passengers leavin the country had to have papers and passports but at last he took me out alongside the steamer day was just breakin as we struck her and there wasn t a soul to be seen on board the water was very still and the nigger man gave me a lift from the boat and i climbed onto the steamer where her side was sliced to the deck for loadin fruit the hatches was open and i looked down and saw the cargo of bananas that filled the hold to within six feet of the top i thinks to myself clancy you better go as a stowaway it s safer the steamer men might hand you back to the employment bureau the tropic ll get you clancy if you don t watch out so i jumps down easy among the bananas and digs out a hole to hide in among the bunches in an hour or so i could hear the engines goin and feel the steamer rockin and i knew we were off to sea they left the hatches open for ventilation and pretty soon it was light enough in the hold to see fairly well i got to feelin a bit hungry and thought i d have a light fruit lunch by way of refreshment i creeped out of the hole i d made and stood up straight just then i saw another man crawl up about ten feet away and reach out and skin a banana and stuff it into his mouth twas a dirty man black faced and ragged and disgraceful of aspect yes the man was a ringer for the pictures of the fat weary willie in the funny papers i looked again and saw it was my general man de vega the great revolutionist mule rider and pickaxe importer when he saw me the general hesitated with his mouth filled with banana and his eyes the size of coconuts hist i says not a word or they ll put us off and make us walk veev la liberty i adds copperin the sentiment by shovin a banana into the source of it i was certain the general wouldn t recognize me the nefarious work of the tropics had left me lookin different there was half an inch of roan whiskers coverin me face and me costume was a pair of blue overalls and a red shirt how you come in the ship senor asked the general as soon as he could speak by the back door whist says i twas a glorious blow for liberty we struck i continues but we was overpowered by numbers let us accept our defeat like brave men and eat another banana were you in the cause of liberty fightin senor says the general sheddin tears on the cargo to the last says i twas i led the last desperate charge against the minions of the tyrant but it made them mad and we was forced to retreat twas i general procured the mule upon which you escaped could you give that ripe bunch a little boost this way general it s a bit out of my reach thanks say you so brave patriot said the general again weepin ah dios and i have not the means to reward your devotion barely did i my life bring away carrambos what a devil s animal was that mule senor like ships in one storm was i dashed about the skin on myself was ripped away with the thorns and vines upon the bark of a hundred trees did that beast of the infernal bump and cause outrage to the legs of mine in the night to port barrios i came i dispossess myself of that mountain of mule and hasten along the water shore i find a little boat to be tied i launch myself and row to the steamer i cannot see any mans on board so i climbed one rope which hang at the side i then myself hide in the bananas surely i say if the ship captains view me they shall throw me again to those guatemala those things are not good guatemala will shoot general de vega therefore i am hide and remain silent life itself is glorious liberty it is pretty good but so good as life i do not think three days as i said was the trip to new orleans the general man and me got to be cronies of the deepest dye bananas we ate until they were distasteful to the sight and an eyesore to the palate but to bananas alone was the bill of fare reduced at night i crawls out careful on the lower deck and gets a bucketful of fresh water that general de vega was a man inhabited by an engorgement of words and sentences he added to the monotony of the voyage by divestin himself of conversation he believed i was a revolutionist of his own party there bein as he told me a good many americans and other foreigners in its ranks twas a braggart and a conceited little gabbler it was though he considered himself a hero twas on himself he wasted all his regrets at the failing of his plot not a word did the little balloon have to say about the other misbehaving idiots that had been shot or run themselves to death in his revolution the second day out he was feelin pretty braggy and uppish for a stowed away conspirator that owed his existence to a mule and stolen bananas he was tellin me about the great railroad he had been buildin and he relates what he calls a comic incident about a fool irishman he inveigled from new orleans to sling a pick on his little morgue of a narrow gauge line twas sorrowful to hear the little dirty general tell the opprobrious story of how he put salt upon the tail of that reckless and silly bird clancy laugh he did hearty and long he shook with laughin the black faced rebel and outcast standing neck deep in bananas without friends or country ah senor he snickers to death you would have laughed at that drollest irish i say to him strong big mans is need very much in guatemala i will blows strike for your down pressed country he say that shall you do i tell him ah it was an irish so comic he sees one box break upon the wharf that contain for the guard a few gun he think there is gun in all the box but that is all pickaxe yes ah senor could you the face of that irish have seen when they set him to the work twas thus the ex boss of the employment bureau contributed to the tedium of the trip with merry jests and anecdote but now and then he would weep upon the bananas and make oration about the lost cause of liberty and the mule twas a pleasant sound when the steamer bumped against the pier in new orleans pretty soon we heard the pat a pat of hundreds of bare feet and the dago gang that unloads the fruit jumped on the deck and down into the hold me and the general worked a while at passing up the bunches and they thought we were part of the gang after about an hour we managed to slip off the steamer onto the wharf twas a great honor on the hands of an obscure clancy havin the entertainment of the representative of a great foreign filibustering power i first bought for the general and myself many long drinks and things to eat that were not bananas the general man trotted along at my side leaving all the arrangements to me i led him up to lafayette square and set him on a bench in the little park cigarettes i had bought for him and he humped himself down on the seat like a little fat contented hobo i look him over as he sets there and what i see pleases me brown by nature and instinct he is now brindled with dirt and dust praise to the mule his clothes is mostly strings and flaps yes the looks of the general man is agreeable to clancy i asks him delicate if by any chance he brought away anybody s money with him from guatemala he sighs and humps his shoulders against the bench not a cent all right maybe he tells me some of his friends in the tropic outfit will send him funds later the general was as clear a case of no visible means as i ever saw i told him not to move from the bench and then i went up to the corner of poydras and carondelet along there is o hara s beat in five minutes along comes o hara a big fine man red faced with shinin buttons swinging his club twould be a fine thing for guatemala to move into o hara s precinct twould be a fine bit of recreation for danny to suppress revolutions and uprisins once or twice a week with his club is workin yet danny says i walking up to him overtime says o hara looking over me suspicious want some of it fifty forty six is the celebrated city ordinance authorizing arrest conviction and imprisonment of persons that succeed in concealing their crimes from the police don t ye know jimmy clancy says i ye pink gilled monster so when o hara recognized me beneath the scandalous exterior bestowed upon me by the tropics i backed him into a doorway and told him what i wanted and why i wanted it all right jimmy says o hara go back and hold the bench i ll be along in ten minutes in that time o hara strolled through lafayette square and spied two weary willies disgracin one of the benches in ten minutes more j clancy and general de vega late candidate for the presidency of guatemala was in the station house the general is badly frightened and calls upon me to proclaim his distinguishments and rank the man says i to the police used to be a railroad man he s on the bum now tis a little bughouse he is on account of losin his job carrambos says the general fizzin like a little soda fountain you fought senor with my forces in my native country why do you say the lies you shall say i am the general de vega one soldier one caballero railroader says i again on the hog no good been livin for three days on stolen bananas look at him ain t that enough twenty five dollars or sixty days was what the recorder gave the general he didn t have a cent so he took the time they let me go as i knew they would for i had money to show and o hara spoke for me yes sixty days he got twas just so long as i slung a pick for the great country of kam guatemala clancy paused the bright starlight showed a reminiscent look of happy content on his seasoned features keogh leaned in his chair and gave his partner a slap on his thinly clad back that sounded like the crack of the surf on the sands tell em ye divil he chuckled how you got even with the tropical general in the way of agricultural maneuverings having no money concluded clancy with unction they set him to work his fine out with a gang from the parish prison clearing ursulines street around the corner was a saloon decorated genially with electric fans and cool merchandise i made that me headquarters and every fifteen minutes i d walk around and take a look at the little man filibusterin with a rake and shovel twas just such a hot broth of a day as this has been and i d call at him hey monseer and he d look at me black with the damp showin through his shirt in places fat strong mans says i to general de vega is needed in new orleans yes to carry on the good work carrambos erin go bragh xi the remnants of the code breakfast in coralio was at eleven therefore the people did not go to market early the little wooden market house stood on a patch of short trimmed grass under the vivid green foliage of a bread fruit tree thither one morning the venders leisurely convened bringing their wares with them a porch or platform six feet wide encircled the building shaded from the mid morning sun by the projecting grass thatched roof upon this platform the venders were wont to display their goods newly killed beef fish crabs fruit of the country cassava eggs dulces and high tottering stacks of native tortillas as large around as the sombrero of a spanish grandee but on this morning they whose stations lay on the seaward side of the market house instead of spreading their merchandise formed themselves into a softly jabbering and gesticulating group for there upon their space of the platform was sprawled asleep the unbeautiful figure of beelzebub blythe he lay upon a ragged strip of cocoa matting more than ever a fallen angel in appearance his suit of coarse flax soiled bursting at the seams crumpled into a thousand diversified wrinkles and creases inclosed him absurdly like the garb of some effigy that had been stuffed in sport and thrown there after indignity had been wrought upon it but firmly upon the high bridge of his nose reposed his gold rimmed glasses the surviving badge of his ancient glory the sun s rays reflecting quiveringly from the rippling sea upon his face and the voices of the market men woke beelzebub blythe he sat up blinking and leaned his back against the wall of the market drawing a blighted silk handkerchief from his pocket he assiduously rubbed and burnished his glasses and while doing this he became aware that his bedroom had been invaded and that polite brown and yellow men were beseeching him to vacate in favor of their market stuff if the senor would have the goodness a thousand pardons for bringing to him molestation but soon would come the compradores for the day s provisions surely they had ten thousand regrets at disturbing him in this manner they expanded to him the intimation that he must clear out and cease to clog the wheels of trade blythe stepped from the platform with the air of a prince leaving his canopied couch he never quite lost that air even at the lowest point of his fall it is clear that the college of good breeding does not necessarily maintain a chair of morals within its walls blythe shook out his wry clothing and moved slowly up the calle grande through the hot sand he moved without a destination in his mind the little town was languidly stirring to its daily life golden skinned babies tumbled over one another in the grass the sea breeze brought him appetite but nothing to satisfy it throughout coralio were its morning odors those from the heavily fragrant tropical flowers and from the bread baking in the outdoor ovens of clay and the pervading smoke of their fires where the smoke cleared the crystal air with some of the efficacy of faith seemed to remove the mountains almost to the sea bringing them so near that one might count the scarred glades on their wooded sides the light footed caribs were swiftly gliding to their tasks at the waterside already along the bosky trails from the banana groves files of horses were slowly moving concealed except for their nodding heads and plodding legs by the bunches of green golden fruit heaped upon their backs on doorsills sat women combing their long black hair and calling one to another across the narrow thoroughfares peace reigned in coralio arid and bald peace but still peace on that bright morning when nature seemed to be offering the lotus on the dawn s golden platter beelzebub blythe had reached rock bottom further descent seemed impossible that last night s slumber in a public place had done for him as long as he had had a roof to cover him there had remained unbridged the space that separates a gentleman from the beasts of the jungle and the fowls of the air but now he was little more than a whimpering oyster led to be devoured on the sands of a southern sea by the artful walrus circumstance and the implacable carpenter fate to blythe money was now but a memory he had drained his friends of all that their good fellowship had to offer then he had squeezed them to the last drop of their generosity and at last aaron like he had smitten the rock of their hardening bosoms for the scattering ignoble drops of charity itself he had exhausted his credit to the last real with the minute keenness of the shameless sponger he was aware of every source in coralio from which a glass of rum a meal or a piece of silver could be wheedled marshalling each such source in his mind he considered it with all the thoroughness and penetration that hunger and thirst lent him for the task all his optimism failed to thresh a grain of hope from the chaff of his postulations he had played out the game that one night in the open had shaken his nerves until then there had been left to him at least a few grounds upon which he could base his unblushing demands upon his neighbors stores now he must beg instead of borrowing the most brazen sophistry could not dignify by the name of loan the coin contemptuously flung to a beachcomber who slept on the bare boards of the public market but on this morning no beggar would have more thankfully received a charitable coin for the demon thirst had him by the throat the drunkard s matutinal thirst that requires to be slaked at each morning station on the road to tophet blythe walked slowly up the street keeping a watchful eye for any miracle that might drop manna upon him in his wilderness as he passed the popular eating house of madama vasquez madama s boarders were just sitting down to freshly baked bread aguacates pines and delicious coffee that sent forth odorous guarantee of its quality upon the breeze madama was serving she turned her shy stolid melancholy gaze for a moment out the window she saw blythe and her expression turned more shy and embarrassed beelzebub owed her twenty pesos he bowed as he had once bowed to less embarrassed dames to whom he owed nothing and passed on merchants and their clerks were throwing open the solid wooden doors of their shops polite but cool were the glances they cast upon blythe as he lounged tentatively by with the remains of his old jaunty air for they were his creditors almost without exception at the little fountain in the plaza he made an apology for a toilet with his wetted handkerchief across the open square filed the dolorous line of friends to the prisoners in the calaboza bearing the morning meal of the immured the food in their hands roused small longing in blythe it was drink that his soul craved or money to buy it in the streets he met many with whom he had been friends and equals and whose patience and liberality he had gradually exhausted willard geddie and paula cantered past him with the coolest of nods returning from their daily horseback ride along the old indian road keogh passed him at another corner whistling cheerfully and bearing a prize of newly laid eggs for the breakfast of himself and clancy the jovial scout of fortune was one of blythe s victims who had plunged his hand oftenest into his pocket to aid him but now it seemed that keogh too had fortified himself against further invasions his curt greeting and the ominous light in his full gray eye quickened the steps of beelzebub whom desperation had almost incited to attempt an additional loan three drinking shops the forlorn one next visited in succession in all of these his money his credit and his welcome had long since been spent but blythe felt that he would have fawned in the dust at the feet of an enemy that morning for one draught of aguardiente in two of the pulperias his courageous petition for drink was met with a refusal so polite that it stung worse than abuse the third establishment had acquired something of american methods and here he was seized bodily and cast out upon his hands and knees this physical indignity caused a singular change in the man as he picked himself up and walked away an expression of absolute relief came upon his features the specious and conciliatory smile that had been graven there was succeeded by a look of calm and sinister resolve beelzebub had been floundering in the sea of improbability holding by a slender life line to the respectable world that had cast him overboard he must have felt that with this ultimate shock the line had snapped and have experienced the welcome ease of the drowning swimmer who has ceased to struggle blythe walked to the next corner and stood there while he brushed the sand from his garments and repolished his glasses i ve got to do it oh i ve got to do it he told himself aloud if i had a quart of rum i believe i could stave it off yet for a little while but there s no more rum for beelzebub as they call me by the flames of tartarus if i m to sit at the right hand of satan somebody has got to pay the court expenses you ll have to pony up mr frank goodwin you re a good fellow but a gentleman must draw the line at being kicked into the gutter blackmail isn t a pretty word but it s the next station on the road i m travelling with purpose in his steps blythe now moved rapidly through the town by way of its landward environs he passed through the squalid quarters of the improvident negroes and on beyond the picturesque shacks of the poorer mestizos from many points along his course he could see through the umbrageous glades the house of frank goodwin on its wooded hill and as he crossed the little bridge over the lagoon he saw the old indian galvez scrubbing at the wooden slab that bore the name of miraflores beyond the lagoon the lands of goodwin began to slope gently upward a grassy road shaded by a munificent and diverse array of tropical flora wound from the edge of an outlying banana grove to the dwelling blythe took this road with long and purposeful strides goodwin was seated on his coolest gallery dictating letters to his secretary a sallow and capable native youth the household adhered to the american plan of breakfast and that meal had been a thing of the past for the better part of an hour the castaway walked to the steps and flourished a hand good morning blythe said goodwin looking up come in and have a chair anything i can do for you i want to speak to you in private goodwin nodded at his secretary who strolled out under a mango tree and lit a cigarette blythe took the chair that he had left vacant i want some money he began doggedly i m sorry said goodwin with equal directness but you can t have any you re drinking yourself to death blythe your friends have done all they could to help you to brace up you won t help yourself there s no use furnishing you with money to ruin yourself with any longer dear man said blythe tilting back his chair it isn t a question of social economy now it s past that i like you goodwin and i ve come to stick a knife between your ribs i was kicked out of espada s saloon this morning and society owes me reparation for my wounded feelings i didn t kick you out no but in a general way you represent society and in a particular way you represent my last chance i ve had to come down to it old man i tried to do it a month ago when losada s man was here turning things over but i couldn t do it then now it s different i want a thousand dollars goodwin and you ll have to give it to me only last week said goodwin with a smile a silver dollar was all you were asking for an evidence said blythe flippantly that i was still virtuous though under heavy pressure the wages of sin should be something higher than a peso worth forty eight cents let s talk business i am the villain in the third act and i must have my merited if only temporary triumph i saw you collar the late president s valiseful of boodle oh i know it s blackmail but i m liberal about the price i know i m a cheap villain one of the regular sawmill drama kind but you re one of my particular friends and i don t want to stick you hard suppose you go into the details suggested goodwin calmly arranging his letters on the table all right said beelzebub i like the way you take it i despise histrionics so you will please prepare yourself for the facts without any red fire calcium or grace notes on the saxophone on the night that his fly by night excellency arrived in town i was very drunk you will excuse the pride with which i state that fact but it was quite a feat for me to attain that desirable state somebody had left a cot out under the orange trees in the yard of madama ortiz s hotel i stepped over the wall laid down upon it and fell asleep i was awakened by an orange that dropped from the tree upon my nose and i laid there for a while cursing sir isaac newton or whoever it was that invented gravitation for not confining his theory to apples and then along came mr miraflores and his true love with the treasury in a valise and went into the hotel next you hove in sight and held a pow wow with the tonsorial artist who insisted upon talking shop after hours i tried to slumber again but once more my rest was disturbed this time by the noise of the popgun that went off upstairs then that valise came crashing down into an orange tree just above my head and i arose from my couch not knowing when it might begin to rain saratoga trunks when the army and the constabulary began to arrive with their medals and decorations hastily pinned to their pajamas and their snickersnees drawn i crawled into the welcome shadow of a banana plant i remained there for an hour by which time the excitement and the people had cleared away and then my dear goodwin excuse me i saw you sneak back and pluck that ripe and juicy valise from the orange tree i followed you and saw you take it to your own house a hundred thousand dollar crop from one orange tree in a season about breaks the record of the fruit growing industry being a gentleman at that time of course i never mentioned the incident to any one but this morning i was kicked out of a saloon my code of honor is all out at the elbows and i d sell my mother s prayer book for three fingers of aguardiente i m not putting on the screws hard it ought to be worth a thousand to you for me to have slept on that cot through the whole business without waking up and seeing anything goodwin opened two more letters and made memoranda in pencil on them then he called manuel to his secretary who came spryly the ariel when does she sail asked goodwin senor answered the youth at three this afternoon she drops down coast to punta soledad to complete her cargo of fruit from there she sails for new orleans without delay bueno said goodwin these letters may wait yet awhile the secretary returned to his cigarette under the mango tree in round numbers said goodwin facing blythe squarely how much money do you owe in this town not including the sums you have borrowed from me five hundred at a rough guess answered blythe lightly go somewhere in the town and draw up a schedule of your debts said goodwin come back here in two hours and i will send manuel with the money to pay them i will also have a decent outfit of clothing ready for you you will sail on the ariel at three manuel will accompany you as far as the deck of the steamer there he will hand you one thousand dollars in cash i suppose that we needn t discuss what you will be expected to do in return oh i understand piped blythe cheerily i was asleep all the time on the cot under madama ortiz s orange trees and i shake off the dust of coralio forever i ll play fair no more of the lotus for me your proposition is k youre a good fellow goodwin and i let you off light i ll agree to everything but in the meantime i ve a devil of a thirst on old man not a centavo said goodwin firmly until you are on board the ariel you would be drunk in thirty minutes if you had money now but he noticed the blood streaked eyeballs the relaxed form and the shaking hands of beelzebub and he stepped into the dining room through the low window and brought out a glass and a decanter of brandy take a bracer anyway before you go he proposed even as a man to the friend whom he entertains beelzebub blythe s eyes glistened at the sight of the solace for which his soul burned today for the first time his poisoned nerves had been denied their steadying dose and their retort was a mounting torment he grasped the decanter and rattled its crystal mouth against the glass in his trembling hand he flushed the glass and then stood erect holding it aloft for an instant for one fleeting moment he held his head above the drowning waves of his abyss he nodded easily at goodwin raised his brimming glass and murmured a health that men had used in his ancient paradise lost and then so suddenly that he spilled the brandy over his hand he set down his glass untasted in two hours his dry lips muttered to goodwin as he marched down the steps and turned his face toward the town in the edge of the cool banana grove beelzebub halted and snapped the tongue of his belt buckle into another hole i couldn t do it he explained feverishly to the waving banana fronds i wanted to but i couldn t a gentleman can t drink with the man that he blackmails xii shoes john de graffenreid atwood ate of the lotus root stem and flower the tropics gobbled him up he plunged enthusiastically into his work which was to try to forget rosine now they who dine on the lotus rarely consume it plain there is a sauce au diable that goes with it and the distillers are the chefs who prepare it and on johnny s menu card it read brandy with a bottle between them he and billy keogh would sit on the porch of the little consulate at night and roar out great indecorous songs until the natives slipping hastily past would shrug a shoulder and mutter things to themselves about the americanos diablos one day johnny s mozo brought the mail and dumped it on the table johnny leaned from his hammock and fingered the four or five letters dejectedly keogh was sitting on the edge of the table chopping lazily with a paper knife at the legs of a centipede that was crawling among the stationery johnny was in that phase of lotus eating when all the world tastes bitter in one s mouth same old thing he complained fool people writing for information about the country they want to know all about raising fruit and how to make a fortune without work half of em don t even send stamps for a reply they think a consul hasn t anything to do but write letters slit those envelopes for me old man and see what they want i m feeling too rocky to move keogh acclimated beyond all possibility of ill humor drew his chair to the table with smiling compliance on his rose pink countenance and began to slit open the letters four of them were from citizens in various parts of the united states who seemed to regard the consul at coralio as a cyclopedia of information they asked long lists of questions numerically arranged about the climate products possibilities laws business chances and statistics of the country in which the consul had the honor of representing his own government write em please billy said that inert official just a line referring them to the latest consular report tell em the state department will be delighted to furnish the literary gems sign my name don t let your pen scratch billy it ll keep me awake don t snore said keogh amiably and i ll do your work for you you need a corps of assistants anyhow don t see how you ever get out a report wake up a minute here s one more letter it s from your own town too dalesburg that so murmured johnny showing a mild and obligatory interest what s it about postmaster writes explained keogh says a citizen of the town wants some facts and advice from you says the citizen has an idea in his head of coming down where you are and opening a shoe store wants to know if you think the business would pay says he s heard of the boom along this coast and wants to get in on the ground floor in spite of the heat and his bad temper johnny s hammock swayed with his laughter keogh laughed too and the pet monkey on the top shelf of the bookcase chattered in shrill sympathy with the ironical reception of the letter from dalesburg great bunions exclaimed the consul shoe store what ll they ask about next i wonder overcoat factory i reckon say billy of our citizens how many do you suppose ever had on a pair of shoes keogh reflected judicially let s see there s you and me and not me said johnny promptly and incorrectly holding up a foot encased in a disreputable deerskin zapato i haven t been a victim to shoes in months but you ve got em though went on keogh and there s goodwin and blanchard and geddie and old lutz and doc gregg and that italian that s agent for the banana company and there s old delgado no he wears sandals and oh yes there s madama ortiz what kapes the hotel she had on a pair of red kid slippers at the baile the other night and miss pasa her daughter that went to school in the states she brought back some civilized notions in the way of footgear and there s the comandante s sister that dresses up her feet on feast days and mrs geddie who wears a two with a castilian instep and that s about all the ladies let s see don t some of the soldiers at the cuartel no that s so they re allowed shoes only when on the march in barracks they turn their little toeses out to grass bout right agreed the consul not over twenty out of the three thousand ever felt leather on their walking arrangements oh yes coralio is just the town for an enterprising shoe store that doesn t want to part with its goods wonder if old patterson is trying to jolly me he always was full of things he called jokes write him a letter billy i ll dictate it we ll jolly him back a few keogh dipped his pen and wrote at johnny s dictation with many pauses filled in with smoke and sundry travellings of the bottle and glasses the following reply to the dalesburg communication was perpetrated mr obadiah patterson dalesburg ala dear sir in reply to your favor of july d i have the honor to inform you that according to my opinion there is no place on the habitable globe that presents to the eye stronger evidence of the need of a first class shoe store than does the town of coralio there are inhabitants in the place and not a single shoe store the situation speaks for itself this coast is rapidly becoming the goal of enterprising business men but the shoe business is one that has been sadly overlooked or neglected in fact there are a considerable number of our citizens actually without shoes at present besides the want above mentioned there is also a crying need for a brewery a college of higher mathematics a coal yard and a clean and intellectual punch and judy show i have the honor to be your obt servant john de graffenreid atwood u s consul at coralio p s hello uncle obadiah how s the old burg racking along what would the government do without you and me look out for a green headed parrot and a bunch of bananas soon from your old friend johnny i throw in that postscript explained the consul so uncle obadiah won t take offense at the official tone of the letter now billy you get that correspondence fixed up and send pancho to the post office with it the ariadne takes the mail out tomorrow if they make up that load of fruit today the night programme in coralio never varied the recreations of the people were soporific and flat they wandered about barefoot and aimless speaking lowly and smoking cigar or cigarette looking down on the dimly lighted ways one seemed to see a threading maze of brunette ghosts tangled with a procession of insane fireflies in some houses the thrumming of lugubrious guitars added to the depression of the triste night giant tree frogs rattled in the foliage as loudly as the end man s bones in a minstrel troupe by nine o clock the streets were almost deserted not at the consulate was there often a change of bill keogh would come there nightly for coralio s one cool place was the little porch of that official residence the brandy would be kept moving and before midnight sentiment would begin to stir in the heart of the self exiled consul then he would relate to keogh the story of his ended romance each night keogh would listen patiently to the tale and be ready with untiring sympathy but don t you think for a minute thus johnny would always conclude his woeful narrative that i m grieving about that girl billy i ve forgotten her she never enters my mind if she were to enter that door right now my pulse wouldn t gain a beat that s all over long ago don t i know it keogh would answer of course you ve forgotten her proper thing to do wasn t quite k of her to listen to the knocks that er dink pawson kept giving you pink dawson a word of contempt would be in johnny s tones poor white trash that s what he was had five hundred acres of farming land though and that counted maybe i ll have a chance to get back at him some day the dawsons weren t anybody everybody in alabama knows the atwoods say billy did you know my mother was a de graffenreid why no keogh would say is that so he had heard it some three hundred times fact the de graffenreids of hancock county but i never think of that girl any more do i billy not for a minute my boy would be the last sounds heard by the conqueror of cupid at this point johnny would fall into a gentle slumber and keogh would saunter out to his own shack under the calabash tree at the edge of the plaza in a day or two the letter from the dalesburg postmaster and its answer had been forgotten by the coralio exiles but on the th day of july the fruit of the reply appeared upon the tree of events the andador a fruit steamer that visited coralio regularly drew into the offing and anchored the beach was lined with spectators while the quarantine doctor and the custom house crew rowed out to attend to their duties an hour later billy keogh lounged into the consulate clean and cool in his linen clothes and grinning like a pleased shark guess what he said to johnny lounging in his hammock too hot to guess said johnny lazily your shoe store man s come said keogh rolling the sweet morsel on his tongue with a stock of goods big enough to supply the continent as far down as tierra del fuego they re carting his cases over to the custom house now six barges full they brought ashore and have paddled back for the rest oh ye saints in glory won t there be regalements in the air when he gets onto the joke and has an interview with mr consul it ll be worth nine years in the tropics just to witness that one joyful moment keogh loved to take his mirth easily he selected a clean place on the matting and lay upon the floor the walls shook with his enjoyment johnny turned half over and blinked didn t tell me he said that anybody was fool enough to take that letter seriously four thousand dollar stock of goods gasped keogh in ecstasy talk about coals to newcastle why didn t he take a ship load of palm leaf fans to spitzenbergen while he was about it saw the old codger on the beach you ought to have been there when he put on his specs and squinted at the five hundred or so barefooted citizens standing around are you telling the truth billy asked the consul weakly am i you ought to see the buncoed gentleman s daughter he brought along looks she makes the brick dust senoritas here look like tar babies go on said johnny if you can stop that asinine giggling i hate to see a grown man make a laughing hyena of himself name is hemstetter went on keogh he s a hello what s the matter now johnny s moccasined feet struck the floor with a thud as he wriggled out of his hammock get up you idiot he said sternly or i ll brain you with this inkstand that s rosine and her father gad what a drivelling idiot old patterson is get up here billy keogh and help me what the devil are we going to do has all the world gone crazy keogh rose and dusted himself he managed to regain a decorous demeanor situation has got to be met johnny he said with some success at seriousness i didn t think about its being your girl until you spoke first thing to do is to get them comfortable quarters you go down and face the music and i ll trot out to goodwin s and see if mrs goodwin won t take them in they ve got the decentest house in town bless you billy said the consul i knew you wouldn t desert me the world s bound to come to an end but maybe we can stave it off for a day or two keogh hoisted his umbrella and set out for goodwin s house johnny put on his coat and hat he picked up the brandy bottle but set it down again without drinking and marched bravely down to the beach in the shade of the custom house walls he found mr hemstetter and rosine surrounded by a mass of gaping citizens the customs officers were ducking and scraping while the captain of the andador interpreted the business of the new arrivals rosine looked healthy and very much alive she was gazing at the strange scenes around her with amused interest there was a faint blush upon her round cheek as she greeted her old admirer mr hemstetter shook hands with johnny in a very friendly way he was an oldish impractical man one of that numerous class of erratic business men who are forever dissatisfied and seeking a change i am very glad to see you john may i call you john he said let me thank you for your prompt answer to our postmaster s letter of inquiry he volunteered to write to you on my behalf i was looking about for something different in the way of a business in which the profits would be greater i had noticed in the papers that this coast was receiving much attention from investors i am extremely grateful for your advice to come i sold out everything that i possess and invested the proceeds in as fine a stock of shoes as could be bought in the north you have a picturesque town here john i hope business will be as good as your letter justifies me in expecting johnny s agony was abbreviated by the arrival of keogh who hurried up with the news that mrs goodwin would be much pleased to place rooms at the disposal of mr hemstetter and his daughter so there mr hemstetter and rosine were at once conducted and left to recuperate from the fatigue of the voyage while johnny went down to see that the cases of shoes were safely stored in the customs warehouse pending their examination by the officials keogh grinning like a shark skirmished about to find goodwin to instruct him not to expose to mr hemstetter the true state of coralio as a shoe market until johnny had been given a chance to redeem the situation if such a thing were possible that night the consul and keogh held a desperate consultation on the breezy porch of the consulate send em back home began keogh reading johnny s thoughts i would said johnny after a little silence but i ve been lying to you billy all right about that said keogh affably i ve told you hundreds of times said johnny slowly that i had forgotten that girl haven t i about three hundred and seventy five admitted the monument of patience i lied repeated the consul every time i never forgot her for one moment i was an obstinate ass for running away just because she said no once and i was too proud a fool to go back i talked with rosine a few minutes this evening up at goodwin s i found out one thing you remember that farmer fellow who was always after her dink pawson asked keogh pink dawson well he wasn t a hill of beans to her she says she didn t believe a word of the things be told her about me but i m sewed up now billy that tomfool letter we sent ruined whatever chance i had left she ll despise me when she finds out that her old father has been made the victim of a joke that a decent schoolboy wouldn t have been guilty of shoes why he couldn t sell twenty pairs of shoes in coralio if he kept store here for twenty years you put a pair of shoes on one of these caribs or spanish brown boys and what d he do stand on his head and squeal until he d kicked em off none of em ever wore shoes and they never will if i send em back home i ll have to tell the whole story and what ll she think of me i want that girl worse than ever billy and now when she s in reach i ve lost her forever because i tried to be funny when the thermometer was at keep cheerful said the optimistic keogh and let em open the store i ve been busy myself this afternoon we can stir up a temporary boom in foot gear anyhow i ll buy six pairs when the doors open i ve been around and seen all the fellows and explained the catastrophe they ll all buy shoes like they was centipedes frank goodwin will take cases of em the geddies want about eleven pairs between em clancy is going to invest the savings of weeks and even old doc gregg wants three pairs of alligator hide slippers if they ve got any tens blanchard got a look at miss hemstetter and as he s a frenchman no less than a dozen pairs will do for him a dozen customers said johnny for a stock of shoes it won t work there s a big problem here to figure out you go home billy and leave me alone i ve got to work at it all by myself take that bottle of three star along with you no sir not another ounce of booze for the united states consul i ll sit here tonight and pull out the think stop if there s a soft place on this proposition anywhere i ll land on it if there isn t there ll be another wreck to the credit of the gorgeous tropics keogh left feeling that he could be of no use johnny laid a handful of cigars on a table and stretched himself in a steamer chair when the sudden daylight broke silvering the harbor ripples he was still sitting there then he got up whistling a little tune and took his bath at nine o clock he walked down to the dingy little cable office and hung for half an hour over a blank the result of his application was the following message which he signed and had transmitted at a cost of to pinkney dawson dalesburg ala draft for comes to you next mail ship me immediately pounds stiff dry cockleburrs new use here in arts market price twenty cents pound further orders likely rush xiii ships within a week a suitable building had been secured in the calle grande and mr hemstetter s stock of shoes arranged upon their shelves the rent of the store was moderate and the stock made a fine showing of neat white boxes attractively displayed johnny s friends stood by him loyally on

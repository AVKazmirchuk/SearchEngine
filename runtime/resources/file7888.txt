went to see the editor about the fate of his poem he was received over the head of the office boy into the inner office that is decorated with the statuettes by rodin and j g brown when i read the first line of the doe and the brook said the editor i knew it to be the work of one whose life has been heart to heart with nature the finished art of the line did not blind me to that fact to use a somewhat homely comparison it was as if a wild free child of the woods and fields were to don the garb of fashion and walk down broadway beneath the apparel the man would show thanks said conant i suppose the check will be round on thursday as usual the morals of this story have somehow gotten mixed you can take your choice of stay on the farm or don t write poetry the robe of peace mysteries follow one another so closely in a great city that the reading public and the friends of johnny bellchambers have ceased to marvel at his sudden and unexplained disappearance nearly a year ago this particular mystery has now been cleared up but the solution is so strange and incredible to the mind of the average man that only a select few who were in close touch with bellchambers will give it full credence johnny bellchambers as is well known belonged to the intrinsically inner circle of the elite without any of the ostentation of the fashionable ones who endeavor to attract notice by eccentric display of wealth and show he still was au fait in everything that gave deserved lustre to his high position in the ranks of society especially did he shine in the matter of dress in this he was the despair of imitators always correct exquisitely groomed and possessed of an unlimited wardrobe he was conceded to be the best dressed man in new york and therefore in america there was not a tailor in gotham who would not have deemed it a precious boon to have been granted the privilege of making bellchambers clothes without a cent of pay as he wore them they would have been a priceless advertisement trousers were his special passion here nothing but perfection would he notice he would have worn a patch as quickly as he would have overlooked a wrinkle he kept a man in his apartments always busy pressing his ample supply his friends said that three hours was the limit of time that he would wear these garments without exchanging bellchambers disappeared very suddenly for three days his absence brought no alarm to his friends and then they began to operate the usual methods of inquiry all of them failed he had left absolutely no trace behind then the search for a motive was instituted but none was found he had no enemies he had no debts there was no woman there were several thousand dollars in his bank to his credit he had never showed any tendency toward mental eccentricity in fact he was of a particularly calm and well balanced temperament every means of tracing the vanished man was made use of but without avail it was one of those cases more numerous in late years where men seem to have gone out like the flame of a candle leaving not even a trail of smoke as a witness in may tom eyres and lancelot gilliam two of bellchambers old friends went for a little run on the other side while pottering around in italy and switzerland they happened one day to hear of a monastery in the swiss alps that promised something outside of the ordinary tourist beguiling attractions the monastery was almost inaccessible to the average sightseer being on an extremely rugged and precipitous spur of the mountains the attractions it possessed but did not advertise were first an exclusive and divine cordial made by the monks that was said to far surpass benedictine and chartreuse next a huge brass bell so purely and accurately cast that it had not ceased sounding since it was first rung three hundred years ago finally it was asserted that no englishman had ever set foot within its walls eyres and gilliam decided that these three reports called for investigation it took them two days with the aid of two guides to reach the monastery of st gondrau it stood upon a frozen wind swept crag with the snow piled about it in treacherous drifting masses they were hospitably received by the brothers whose duty it was to entertain the infrequent guest they drank of the precious cordial finding it rarely potent and reviving they listened to the great ever echoing bell and learned that they were pioneer travelers in those gray stone walls over the englishman whose restless feet have trodden nearly every corner of the earth at three o clock on the afternoon they arrived the two young gothamites stood with good brother cristofer in the great cold hallway of the monastery to watch the monks march past on their way to the refectory they came slowly pacing by twos with their heads bowed treading noiselessly with sandaled feet upon the rough stone flags as the procession slowly filed past eyres suddenly gripped gilliam by the arm look he whispered eagerly at the one just opposite you now the one on this side with his hand at his waist if that isn t johnny bellchambers then i never saw him gilliam saw and recognized the lost glass of fashion what the deuce said he wonderingly is old bell doing here tommy it surely can t be he never heard of bell having a turn for the religious fact is i ve heard him say things when a four in hand didn t seem to tie up just right that would bring him up for court martial before any church it s bell without a doubt said eyres firmly or i m pretty badly in need of an oculist but think of johnny bellchambers the royal high chancellor of swell togs and the mahatma of pink teas up here in cold storage doing penance in a snuff colored bathrobe i can t get it straight in my mind let s ask the jolly old boy that s doing honors brother cristofer was appealed to for information by that time the monks had passed into the refectory he could not tell to which one they referred bellchambers ah the brothers of st gondrau abandoned their worldly names when they took the vows did the gentlemen wish to speak with one of the brothers if they would come to the refectory and indicate the one they wished to see the reverend abbot in authority would doubtless permit it eyres and gilliam went into the dining hall and pointed out to brother cristofer the man they had seen yes it was johnny bellchambers they saw his face plainly now as he sat among the dingy brothers never looking up eating broth from a coarse brown bowl permission to speak to one of the brothers was granted to the two travelers by the abbot and they waited in a reception room for him to come when he did come treading softly in his sandals both eyres and gilliam looked at him in perplexity and astonishment it was johnny bellchambers but he had a different look upon his smooth shaven face was an expression of ineffable peace of rapturous attainment of perfect and complete happiness his form was proudly erect his eyes shone with a serene and gracious light he was as neat and well groomed as in the old new york days but how differently was he clad now he seemed clothed in but a single garment a long robe of rough brown cloth gathered by a cord at the waist and falling in straight loose folds nearly to his feet he shook hands with his visitors with his old ease and grace of manner if there was any embarrassment in that meeting it was not manifested by johnny bellchambers the room had no seats they stood to converse glad to see you old man said eyres somewhat awkwardly wasn t expecting to find you up here not a bad idea though after all society s an awful sham must be a relief to shake the giddy whirl and retire to er contemplation and er prayer and hymns and those things oh cut that tommy said bellchambers cheerfully don t be afraid that i ll pass around the plate i go through these thing um bobs with the rest of these old boys because they are the rules i m brother ambrose here you know i m given just ten minutes to talk to you fellows that s rather a new design in waistcoats you have on isn t it gilliam are they wearing those things on broadway now it s the same old johnny said gilliam joyfully what the devil i mean why oh confound it what did you do it for old man peel the bathrobe pleaded eyres almost tearfully and go back with us the old crowd ll go wild to see you this isn t in your line bell i know half a dozen girls that wore the willow on the quiet when you shook us in that unaccountable way hand in your resignation or get a dispensation or whatever you have to do to get a release from this ice factory you ll get catarrh here johnny and my god you haven t any socks on bellchambers looked down at his sandaled feet and smiled you fellows don t understand he said soothingly it s nice of you to want me to go back but the old life will never know me again i have reached here the goal of all my ambitions i am entirely happy and contented here i shall remain for the remainder of my days you see this robe that i wear bellchambers caressingly touched the straight hanging garment at last i have found something that will not bag at the knees i have attained at that moment the deep boom of the great brass bell reverberated through the monastery it must have been a summons to immediate devotions for brother ambrose bowed his head turned and left the chamber without another word a slight wave of his hand as he passed through the stone doorway seemed to say a farewell to his old friends they left the monastery without seeing him again and this is the story that tommy eyres and lancelot gilliam brought back with them from their latest european tour the girl and the graft the other day i ran across my old friend ferguson pogue pogue is a conscientious grafter of the highest type his headquarters is the western hemisphere and his line of business is anything from speculating in town lots on the great staked plains to selling wooden toys in connecticut made by hydraulic pressure from nutmegs ground to a pulp now and then when pogue has made a good haul he comes to new york for a rest he says the jug of wine and loaf of bread and thou in the wilderness business is about as much rest and pleasure to him as sliding down the bumps at coney would be to president taft give me says pogue a big city for my vacation especially new york i m not much fond of new yorkers and manhattan is about the only place on the globe where i don t find any while in the metropolis pogue can always be found at one of two places one is a little second hand bookshop on fourth avenue where he reads books about his hobbies mahometanism and taxidermy i found him at the other his hall bedroom in eighteenth street where he sat in his stocking feet trying to pluck the banks of the wabash out of a small zither four years he has practised this tune without arriving near enough to cast the longest trout line to the water s edge on the dresser lay a blued steel colt s forty five and a tight roll of tens and twenties large enough around to belong to the spring rattlesnake story class a chambermaid with a room cleaning air fluttered nearby in the hall unable to enter or to flee scandalized by the stocking feet aghast at the colt s yet powerless with her metropolitan instincts to remove herself beyond the magic influence of the yellow hued roll i sat on his trunk while ferguson pogue talked no one could be franker or more candid in his conversation beside his expression the cry of henry james for lacteal nourishment at the age of one month would have seemed like a chaldean cryptogram he told me stories of his profession with pride for he considered it an art and i was curious enough to ask him whether he had known any women who followed it ladies said pogue with western chivalry well not to any great extent they don t amount to much in special lines of graft because they re all so busy in general lines what why they have to who s got the money in the world the men did you ever know a man to give a woman a dollar without any consideration a man will shell out his dust to another man free and easy and gratis but if he drops a penny in one of the machines run by the madam eve s daughters amalgamated association and the pineapple chewing gum don t fall out when he pulls the lever you can hear him kick to the superintendent four blocks away man is the hardest proposition a woman has to go up against he s the low grade one and she has to work overtime to make him pay two times out of five she s salted she can t put in crushers and costly machinery he d notice em and be onto the game they have to pan out what they get and it hurts their tender hands some of em are natural sluice troughs and can carry out to the ton the dry eyed ones have to depend on signed letters false hair sympathy the kangaroo walk cowhide whips ability to cook sentimental juries conversational powers silk underskirts ancestry rouge anonymous letters violet sachet powders witnesses revolvers pneumatic forms carbolic acid moonlight cold cream and the evening newspapers you are outrageous ferg i said surely there is none of this graft as you call it in a perfect and harmonious matrimonial union well said pogue nothing that would justify you every time in calling police headquarters and ordering out the reserves and a vaudeville manager on a dead run but it s this way suppose you re a fifth avenue millionaire soaring high on the right side of copper and cappers you come home at night and bring a diamond brooch to the lady who s staked your for a claim you hand it over she says oh george and looks to see if it s backed she comes up and kisses you you ve waited for it you get it all right it s graft but i m telling you about artemisia blye she was from kansas and she suggested corn in all of its phases her hair was as yellow as the silk her form was as tall and graceful as a stalk in the low grounds during a wet summer her eyes were as big and startling as bunions and green was her favorite color on my last trip into the cool recesses of your sequestered city i met a human named vaucross he was worth that is he had a million he told me he was in business on the street a sidewalk merchant says i sarcastic exactly says he senior partner of a paving concern i kind of took to him for this reason i met him on broadway one night when i was out of heart luck tobacco and place he was all silk hat diamonds and front he was all front if you had gone behind him you would have only looked yourself in the face i looked like a cross between count tolstoy and a june lobster i was out of luck i had but let me lay my eyes on that dealer again vaucross stopped and talked to me a few minutes and then he took me to a high toned restaurant to eat dinner there was music and then some beethoven and bordelaise sauce and cussing in french and frangipangi and some hauteur and cigarettes when i am flush i know them places i declare i must have looked as bad as a magazine artist sitting there without any money and my hair all rumpled like i was booked to read a chapter from elsie s school days at a brooklyn bohemian smoker but vaucross treated me like a bear hunter s guide he wasn t afraid of hurting the waiter s feelings mr pogue he explains to me i am using you go on says i i hope you don t wake up and then he tells me you know the kind of man he was he was a new yorker his whole ambition was to be noticed he wanted to be conspicuous he wanted people to point him out and bow to him and tell others who he was he said it had been the desire of his life always he didn t have but a million so he couldn t attract attention by spending money he said he tried to get into public notice one time by planting a little public square on the east side with garlic for free use of the poor but carnegie heard of it and covered it over at once with a library in the gaelic language three times he had jumped in the way of automibiles but the only result was five broken ribs and a notice in the papers that an unknown man five feet ten with four amalgam filled teeth supposed to be the last of the famous red leary gang had been run over ever try the reporters i asked him last month says mr vaucross my expenditure for lunches to reporters was get anything out of that i asks that reminds me says he add for perpsin yes i got indigestion how am i supposed to push along your scramble for prominence i inquires contrast something of that sort to night says vaucross it grieves me but i am forced to resort to eccentricity and here he drops his napkin in his soup and rises up and bows to a gent who is devastating a potato under a palm across the room the police commissioner says my climber gratified friend says i in a hurry have ambitions but don t kick a rung out of your ladder when you use me as a stepping stone to salute the police you spoil my appetite on the grounds that i may be degraded and incriminated be thoughtful at the quaker city squab en casserole the idea about artemisia blye comes to me suppose i can manage to get you in the papers says i a column or two every day in all of em and your picture in most of em for a week how much would it be worth to you ten thousand dollars says vaucross warm in a minute but no murder says he and i won t wear pink pants at a cotillon i wouldn t ask you to says i this is honorable stylish and uneffiminate tell the waiter to bring a demi tasse and some other beans and i will disclose to you the opus moderandi we closed the deal an hour later in the rococo rouge et noise room i telegraphed that night to miss artemisia in salina she took a couple of photographs and an autograph letter to an elder in the fourth presbyterian church in the morning and got some transportation and she stopped in topeka long enough to trade a flashlight interior and a valentine to the vice president of a trust company for a mileage book and a package of five dollar notes with scrawled on the band the fifth evening after she got my wire she was waiting all d ecollet ee and dressed up for me and vaucross to take her to dinner in one of these new york feminine apartment houses where a man can t get in unless he plays bezique and smokes depilatory powder cigarettes she s a stunner says vaucross when he saw her they ll give her a two column cut sure this was the scheme the three of us concocted it was business straight through vaucross was to rush miss blye with all the style and display and emotion he could for a month of course that amounted to nothing as far as his ambitions were concerned the sight of a man in a white tie and patent leather pumps pouring greenbacks through the large end of a cornucopia to purchase nutriment and heartsease for tall willowy blondes in new york is as common a sight as blue turtles in delirium tremens but he was to write her love letters the worst kind of love letters such as your wife publishes after you are dead every day at the end of the month he was to drop her and she would bring suit for for breach of promise miss artemisia was to get if she won the suit that was all and if she lost she was to get it anyhow there was a signed contract to that effect sometimes they had me out with em but not often i couldn t keep up to their style she used to pull out his notes and criticize them like bills of lading say you she d say what do you call this letter to a hardware merchant from his nephew on learning that his aunt has nettlerash you eastern duffers know as much about writing love letters as a kansas grasshopper does about tugboats my dear miss blye wouldn t that put pink icing and a little red sugar bird on your bridal cake how long do you expect to hold an audience in a court room with that kind of stuff you want to get down to business and call me tweedlums babe and honeysuckle and sing yourself mama s own big bad puggy wuggy boy if you want any limelight to concentrate upon your sparse gray hairs get sappy after that vaucross dipped his pen in the indelible tabasco his notes read like something or other in the original i could see a jury sitting up and women tearing one another s hats to hear em read and i could see piling up for mr vaucross as much notoriousness as archbishop crammer or the brooklyn bridge or cheese on salad ever enjoyed he seemed mighty pleased at the prospects they agreed on a night and i stood on fifth avenue outside a solemn restaurant and watched em a process server walked in and handed vaucross the papers at this table everybody looked at em and he looked as proud as cicero i went back to my room and lit a five cent cigar for i knew the was as good as ours about two hours later somebody knocked at my door there stood vaucross and miss artemisia and she was clinging yes sir clinging to his arm and they tells me they d been out and got married and they articulated some trivial cadences about love and such and they laid down a bundle on the table and said good night and left and that s why i say concluded ferguson pogue that a woman is too busy occupied with her natural vocation and instinct of graft such as is given her for self preservation and amusement to make any great success in special lines what was in the bundle they left i asked with my usual curiosity why said ferguson there was a scalper s railroad ticket as far as kansas city and two pairs of mr vaucross s old pants the call of the tame when the inauguration was accomplished the proceedings were made smooth by the presence of the rough riders it is well known that a herd of those competent and loyal ex warrriors paid a visit to the big city the newspaper reporters dug out of their trunks the old broad brimmed hats and leather belts that they wear to north beach fish fries and mixed with the visitors no damage was done beyond the employment of the wonderful plural tenderfeet in each of the scribe s stories the westerners mildly contemplated the skyscrapers as high as the third story yawned at broadway hunched down in the big chairs in hotel corridors and altogether looked as bored and dejected as a member of ye ancient and honorable artillery separated during a sham battle from his valet out of this sightseeing delegations of good king teddy s gentlemen of the royal bear hounds dropped one greenbrier nye of pin feather ariz the daily cyclone of sixth avenue s rush hour swept him away from the company of his pardners true the dust from a thousand rustling skirts filled his eyes the mighty roar of trains rushing across the sky deafened him the lightning flash of twice ten hundred beaming eyes confused his vision the storm was so sudden and tremendous that greenbrier s first impulse was to lie down and grab a root and then he remembered that the disturbance was human and not elemental and he backed out of it with a grin into a doorway the reporters had written that but for the widebrimmed hats the west was not visible upon these gauchos of the north heaven sharpen their eyes the suit of black diagonal wrinkled in impossible places the bright blue four in hand factory tied the low turned down collar pattern of the days of seymour and blair white glazed as the letters on the window of the open day and night except sunday restaurants the out curve at the knees from the saddle grip the peculiar spread of the half closed right thumb and fingers from the stiff hold upon the circling lasso the deeply absorbed weather tan that the hottest sun of cape may can never equal the seldom winking blue eyes that unconsciously divided the rushing crowds into fours as though they were being counted out of a corral the segregated loneliness and solemnity of expression as of an emperor or of one whose horizons have not intruded upon him nearer than a day s ride these brands of the west were set upon greenbrier nye oh yes he wore a broadbrimmed hat gentle reader just like those the madison square post office mail carriers wear when they go up to bronx park on sunday afternoons suddenly greenbrier nye jumped into the drifting herd of metropolitan cattle seized upon a man dragged him out of the stream and gave him a buffet upon his collarbone that sent him reeling against a wall the victim recovered his hat with the angry look of a new yorker who has suffered an outrage and intends to write to the trib about it but he looked at his assailant and knew that the blow was in consideration of love and affection after the manner of the west which greets its friends with contumely and uproar and pounding fists and receives its enemies in decorum and order such as the judicious placing of the welcoming bullet demands god in the mountains cried greenbrier holding fast to the foreleg of his cull can this be longhorn merritt the other man was oh look on broadway any day for the pattern business man latest rolled brim derby good barber business digestion and tailor greenbrier nye he exclaimed grasping the hand that had smitten him my dear fellow so glad to see you how did you come to oh to be sure the inaugural ceremonies i remember you joined the rough riders you must come and have luncheon with me of course greenbrier pinned him sadly but firmly to the wall with a hand the size shape and color of a mcclellan saddle longy he said in a melancholy voice that disturbed traffic what have they been doing to you you act just like a citizen they done made you into an inmate of the city directory you never made no such johnny branch execration of yourself as that out on the gila come and have lunching with me you never defined grub by any such terms of reproach in them days i ve been living in new york seven years said merritt it s been eight since we punched cows together in old man garcia s outfit well let s go to a caf e anyhow it sounds good to hear it called grub again they picked their way through the crowd to a hotel and drifted as by a natural law to the bar speak up invited greenbrier a dry martini said merritt oh lord cried greenbrier and yet me and you once saw the same pink gila monsters crawling up the walls of the same hotel in canon diablo a dry but let that pass whiskey straight and they re on you merritt smiled and paid they lunched in a small extension of the dining room that connected with the caf e merritt dexterously diverted his friend s choice that hovered over ham and eggs to a pur ee of celery a salmon cutlet a partridge pie and a desirable salad on the day said greenbrier grieved and thunderous when i can t hold but one drink before eating when i meet a friend i ain t seen in eight years at a by table in a thirty cent town at o clock on the third day of the week i want nine broncos to kick me forty times over a acre section of land get them statistics right old man laughed merritt waiter bring an absinthe frapp e and what s yours greenbrier whiskey straight mourned nye out of the neck of a bottle you used to take it longy straight out of the neck of a bottle on a galloping pony arizona redeye not this ab oh what s the use they re on you merritt slipped the wine card under his glass all right i suppose you think i m spoiled by the city i m as good a westerner as you are greenbrier but somehow i can t make up my mind to go back out there new york is comfortable comfortable i make a good living and i live it no more wet blankets and riding herd in snowstorms and bacon and cold coffee and blowouts once in six months for me i reckon i ll hang out here in the future we ll take in the theatre to night greenbrier and after that we ll dine at i ll tell you what you are merritt said greenbrier laying one elbow in his salad and the other in his butter you are a concentrated effete unconditional short sleeved gotch eared miss sally walker god made you perpendicular and suitable to ride straddle and use cuss words in the original wherefore you have suffered his handiwork to elapse by removing yourself to new york and putting on little shoes tied with strings and making faces when you talk i ve seen you rope and tie a steer in if you was to see one now you d write to the police commissioner about it and these flapdoodle drinks that you inoculate your system with these little essences of cowslip with acorns in em and paregoric flip they ain t anyways in assent with the cordiality of manhood i hate to see you this way well mr greenbrier said merritt with apology in his tone in a way you are right sometimes i do feel like i was being raised on the bottle but i tell you new york is comfortable comfortable there s something about it the sights and the crowds and the way it changes every day and the very air of it that seems to tie a one mile long stake rope around a man s neck with the other end fastened somewhere about thirty fourth street i don t know what it is god knows said greenbrier sadly and i know the east has gobbled you up you was venison and now you re veal you put me in mind of a japonica in a window you ve been signed sealed and diskivered requiescat in hoc signo you make me thirsty a green chartreuse here said merritt to the waiter whiskey straight sighed greenbrier and they re on you you renegade of the round ups guilty with an application for mercy said merritt you don t know how it is greenbrier it s so comfortable here that please loan me your smelling salts pleaded greenbrier if i hadn t seen you once bluff three bluffers from mazatzal city with an empty gun in phoenix greenbrier s voice died away in pure grief cigars he called harshly to the waiter to hide his emotion a pack of turkish cigarettes for mine said merritt they re on you chanted greenbrier struggling to conceal his contempt at seven they dined in the where to dine well column that evening a galaxy had assembled there bright shone the lights o er fair women and br let it go anyhow brave men the orchestra played charmingly hardly had a tip from a diner been placed in its hands by a waiter when it would burst forth into soniferousness the more beer you contributed to it the more meyerbeer it gave you which is reciprocity merritt put forth exertions on the dinner greenbrier was his old friend and he liked him he persuaded him to drink a cocktail i take the horehound tea said greenbrier for old times sake but i d prefer whiskey straight they re on you right said merritt now run your eye down that bill of fare and see if it seems to hitch on any of these items lay me on my lava bed said greenbrier with bulging eyes all these specimens of nutriment in the grub wagon what s this horse with the heaves i pass but look along here s truck for twenty roundups all spelled out in different directions wait till i see the viands ordered merritt turned to the wine list this medoc isn t bad he suggested you re the doc said greenbrier i d rather have whiskey straight it s on you greenbrier looked around the room the waiter brought things and took dishes away he was observing he saw a new york restaurant crowd enjoying itself how was the range when you left the gila asked merritt fine said greenbrier you see that lady in the red speckled silk at that table well she could warm over her beans at my campfire yes the range was good she looks as nice as a white mustang i see once on black river when the coffee came greenbrier put one foot on the seat of the chair next to him you said it was a comfortable town longy he said meditatively yes it s a comfortable town it s different from the plains in a blue norther what did you call that mess in the crock with the handle longy oh yes squabs in a cash roll they re worth the roll that white mustang had just such a way of turning his head and shaking his mane look at her longy if i thought i could sell out my ranch at a fair price i believe i d gyar song he suddenly cried in a voice that paralyzed every knife and fork in the restaurant the waiter dived toward the table two more of them cocktail drinks ordered greenbrier merritt looked at him and smiled significantly they re on me said greenbrier blowing a puff of smoke to the ceiling the unknown quantity the poet longfellow or was it confucius the inventor of wisdom remarked life is real life is earnest and things are not what they seem as mathematics are or is thanks old subscriber the only just rule by which questions of life can be measured let us by all means adjust our theme to the straight edge and the balanced column of the great goddess two and two makes four figures unassailable sums in addition shall be set over against whatever oposing element there may be a mathematician after scanning the above two lines of poetry would say ahem young gentlemen if we assume that x plus that is that life is real then things all of which life includes are real anything that is real is what it seems then if we consider the proposition that things are not what they seem why but this is heresy and not poesy we woo the sweet nymph algebra we would conduct you into the presence of the elusive seductive pursued satisfying mysterious x not long before the beginning of this century septimus kinsolving an old new yorker invented an idea he originated the discovery that bread is made from flour and not from wheat futures perceiving that the flour crop was short and that the stock exchange was having no perceptible effect on the growing wheat mr kinsolving cornered the flour market the result was that when you or my landlady before the war she never had to turn her hand to anything southerners accomodated bought a five cent load of bread you laid down an additional two cents which went to mr kinsolving as a testimonial to his perspicacity a second result was that mr kinsolving quit the game with prof er rake off mr kinsolving s son dan was at college when the mathematical experiment in breadstuffs was made dan came home during vacation and found the old gentleman in a red dressing gown reading little dorrit on the porch of his estimable red brick mansion in washington square he had retired from business with enough extra two cent pieces from bread buyers to reach if laid side by side fifteen times around the earth and lap as far as the public debt of paraguay dan shook hands with his father and hurried over to greenwich village to see his old high school friend kenwitz dan had always admired kenwitz kenwitz was pale curly haired intense serious mathematical studious altruistic socialistic and the natural foe of oligarchies kenwitz had foregone college and was learning watch making in his father s jewelry store dan was smiling jovial easy tempered and tolerant alike of kings and ragpickers the two foregathered joyously being opposites and then dan went back to college and kenwitz to his mainsprings and to his private library in the rear of the jewelry shop four years later dan came back to washington square with the accumulations of b a and two years of europe thick upon him he took a filial look at septimus kinsolving s elaborate tombstone in greenwood and a tedious excursion through typewritten documents with the family lawyer and then feeling himself a lonely and hopeless millionaire hurried down to the old jewelry store across sixth avenue kenwitz unscrewed a magnifying glass from his eye routed out his parent from a dingy rear room and abandoned the interior of watches for outdoors he went with dan and they sat on a bench in washington square dan had not changed much he was stalwart and had a dignity that was inclined to relax into a grin kenwitz was more serious more intense more learned philosophical and socialistic i know about it now said dan finally i pumped it out of the eminent legal lights that turned over to me poor old dad s collections of bonds and boodle it amounts to ken and i am told that he squeezed it out of the chaps that pay their pennies for loaves of bread at little bakeries around the corner you ve studied economics dan and you know all about monopolies and the masses and octopuses and the rights of laboring people i never thought about those things before football and trying to be white to my fellowman were about the extent of my college curriculum but since i came back and found out how dad made his money i ve been thinking i d like awfully well to pay back those chaps who had to give up too much money for bread i know it would buck the line of my income for a good many yards but i d like to make it square with em is there any way it can be done old ways and means kenwitz s big black eyes glowed fierily his thin intellectual face took on almost a sardonic cast he caught dan s arm with the grip of a friend and a judge you can t do it he said emphatically one of the chief punishments of you men of ill gotten wealth is that when you do repent you find that you have lost the power to make reparation or restitution i admire your good intentions dan but you can t do anything those people were robbed of their precious pennies it s too late to remedy the evil you can t pay them back of course said dan lighting his pipe we couldn t hunt up every one of the duffers and hand em back the right change there s an awful lot of em buying bread all the time funny taste they have i never cared for bread especially except for a toasted cracker with the roquefort but we might find a few of em and chuck some of dad s cash back where it came from i d feel better if i could it seems tough for people to be held up for a soggy thing like bread one wouldn t mind standing a rise in broiled lobsters or deviled crabs get to work and think ken i want to pay back all that money i can there are plenty of charities said kenwitz mechanically easy enough said dan in a cloud of smoke i suppose i could give the city a park or endow an asparagus bed in a hospital but i don t want paul to get away with the proceeds of the gold brick we sold peter it s the bread shorts i want to cover ken the thin fingers of kenwitz moved rapidly do you know how much money it would take to pay back the losses of consumers during that corner in flour he asked i do not said dan stoutly my lawyer tells me that i have two millions if you had a hundred millions said kenwitz vehemently you couldn t repair a thousandth part of the damage that has been done you cannot conceive of the accumulated evils produced by misapplied wealth each penny that was wrung from the lean purses of the poor reacted a thousandfold to their harm you do not understand you do not see how hopeless is your desire to make restitution not in a single instance can it be done back up philosopher said dan the penny has no sorrow that the dollar cannot heal not in one instance repeated kenwitz i will give you one and let us see thomas boyne had a little bakery over there in varick street he sold bread to the poorest people when the price of flour went up he had to raise the price of bread his customers were too poor to pay it boyne s business failed and he lost his capital all he had in the world dan kinsolving struck the park bench a mighty blow with his fist i accept the instance he cried take me to boyne i will repay his thousand dollars and buy him a new bakery write your check said kenwitz without moving and then begin to write checks in payment of the train of consequences draw the next one for boyne went insane after his failure and set fire to the building from which he was about to be evicted the loss amounted to that much boyne died in an asylum stick to the instance said dan i haven t noticed any insurance companies on my charity list draw your next check for went on kenwitz boyne s son fell into bad way after the bakery closed and was accused of murder he was acquitted last week after a three years legal battle and the state draws upon taxpayers for that much expense back to the bakery exclaimed dan impatiently the government doesn t need to stand in the bread line the last item of the instance is come and i will show you said kenwitz rising the socialistic watchmaker was happy he was a millionaire baiter by nature and a pessimist by trade kenwitz would assure you in one breath that money was but evil and corruption and that your brand new watch needed cleaning and a new ratchet wheel he conducted kinsolving southward out of the square and into ragged poverty haunted varick street up the narrow stairway of a squalid brick tenement he led the penitent offspring of the octupus he knocked on a door and a clear voice called to them to enter in that almost bare room a young woman sat sewing at a machine she nodded to kenwitz as to a familiar acquaintance one little stream of sunlight through the dingy window burnished her heavy hair to the color of an ancient tuscan s shield she flashed a rippling smile at kenwitz and a look of somewhat flustered inquiry kinsolving stood regarding her clear and pathetic beauty in heart throbbing silence thus they came into the presence of the last item of the instance how many this week miss mary asked the watchmaker a mountain of coarse gray shirts lay upon the floor nearly thirty dozen said the young woman cheerfully i ve made almost i m improving mr kenwitz i hardly know what to do with so much money her eyes turned brightly soft in the direction of dan a little pink spot came out on her round pale cheek kenwitz chuckled like a diabolic raven miss boyne he said let me present mr kinsolving the son of the man who put bread up five years ago he thinks he would like to do something to aid those who where inconvenienced by that act the smile left the young woman s face she rose and pointed her forefinger toward the door this time she looked kinsolving straight in the eye but it was not a look that gave delight the two men went down varick street kenwitz letting all his pessimism and rancor and hatred of the octopus come to the surface gibed at the moneyed side of his friend in an acrid torrent of words dan appeared to be listening and then turned to kenwitz and shook hands with him warmly i m obliged to you ken old man he said vaguely a thousand times obliged mein gott you are crazy cried the watchmaker dropping his spectacles for the first time in years two months afterward kenwitz went into a large bakery on lower broadway with a pair of gold rimmed eyeglasses that he had mended for the proprietor a lady was giving an order to a clerk as kenwitz passed her these loaves are ten cents said the clerk i always get them at eight cents uptown said the lady you need not fill the order i will drive by there on my way home the voice was familiar the watchmaker paused mr kenwitz cried the lady heartily how do you do kenwitz was trying to train his socialistic and economic comprehension on her wonderful fur boa and the carriage waiting outside why miss boyne he began mrs kinsolving she corrected dan and i were married a month ago the thing s the play being acquainted with a newspaper reporter who had a couple of free passes i got to see the performance a few nights ago at one of the popular vaudeville houses one of the numbers was a violin solo by a striking looking man not much past forty but with very gray thick hair not being afflicted with a taste for music i let the system of noises drift past my ears while i regarded the man there was a story about that chap a month or two ago said the reporter they gave me the assignment it was to run a column and was to be on the extremely light and joking order the old man seems to like the funny touch i give to local happenings oh yes i m working on a farce comedy now well i went down to the house and got all the details but i certainly fell down on that job i went back and turned in a comic write up of an east side funeral instead why oh i couldn t seem to get hold of it with my funny hooks somehow maybe you could make a one act tragedy out of it for a curtain raiser i ll give you the details after the performance my friend the reporter recited to me the facts over w urzburger i see no reason said i when he had concluded why that shouldn t make a rattling good funny story those three people couldn t have acted in a more absurd and preposterous manner if they had been real actors in a real theatre i m really afraid that all the stage is a world anyhow and all the players men and women the thing s the play is the way i quote mr shakespeare try it said the reporter i will said i and i did to show him how he could have made a humorous column of it for his paper there stands a house near abingdon square on the ground floor there has been for twenty five years a little store where toys and notions and stationery are sold one night twenty years ago there was a wedding in the rooms above the store the widow mayo owned the house and store her daughter helen was married to frank barry john delaney was best man helen was eighteen and her picture had been printed in a morning paper next to the headlines of a wholesale female murderess story from butte mont but after your eye and intelligence had rejected the connection you seized your magnifying glass and read beneath the portrait her description as one of a series of prominent beauties and belles of the lower west side frank barry and john delaney were prominent young beaux of the same side and bosom friends whom you expected to turn upon each other every time the curtain went up one who pays his money for orchestra seats and fiction expects this that is the first funny idea that has turned up in the story yet both had made a great race for helen s hand when frank won john shook his hand and congratulated him honestly he did after the ceremony helen ran upstairs to put on her hat she was getting married in a traveling dress she and frank were going to old point comfort for a week downstairs the usual horde of gibbering cave dwellers were waiting with their hands full of old congress gaiters and paper bags of hominy then there was a rattle of the fire escape and into her room jumps the mad and infatuated john delaney with a damp curl drooping upon his forehead and made violent and reprehensible love to his lost one entreating her to flee or fly with him to the riviera or the bronx or any old place where there are italian skies and dolce far niente it would have carried blaney off his feet to see helen repulse him with blazing and scornful eyes she fairly withered him by demanding whatever he meant by speaking to respectable people that way in a few moments she had him going the manliness that had possessed him departed he bowed low and said something about irresistible impulse and forever carry in his heart the memory of and she suggested that he catch the first fire escape going down i will away said john delaney to the furthermost parts of the earth i cannot remain near you and know that you are another s i will to africa and there amid other scenes strive to for for goodness sake get out said helen somebody might come in he knelt upon one knee and she extended him one white hand that he might give it a farewell kiss girls was this choice boon of the great little god cupid ever vouchsafed you to have the fellow you want hard and fast and have the one you don t want come with a damp curl on his forehead and kneel to you and babble of africa and love which in spite of everything shall forever bloom an amaranth in his heart to know your power and to feel the sweet security of your own happy state to send the unlucky one broken hearted to foreign climes while you congratulate yourself as he presses his last kiss upon your knuckles that your nails are well manicured say girls it s galluptious don t ever let it get by you and then of course how did you guess it the door opened and in stalked the bridegroom jealous of slow tying bonnet strings the farewell kiss was imprinted upon helen s hand and out of the window and down the fire escape sprang john delaney africa bound a little slow music if you please faint violin just a breath in the clarinet and a touch of the cello imagine the scene frank white hot with the cry of a man wounded to death bursting from him helen rushing and clinging to him trying to explain he catches her wrists and tears them from his shoulders once twice thrice he sways her this way and that the stage manager will show you how and throws her from him to the floor a huddled crushed moaning thing never he cries will he look upon her face again and rushes from the house through the staring groups of astonished guests and now because it is the thing instead of the play the audience must stroll out into the real lobby of the world and marry die grow gray rich poor happy or sad during the intermission of twenty years which must precede the rising of the curtain again mrs barry inherited the shop and the house at thirty eight she could have bested many an eighteen year old at a beauty show on points and general results only a few people remembered her wedding comedy but she made of it no secret she did not pack it in lavender or moth balls nor did she sell it to a magazine one day a middle aged money making lawyer who bought his legal cap and ink of her asked her across the counter to marry him i m really much obliged to you said helen cheerfully but i married another man twenty years ago he was more a goose than a man but i think i love him yet i have never seen him since about half an hour after the ceremony was it copying ink that you wanted or just writing fluid the lawyer bowed over the counter with old time grace and left a respectful kiss on the back of her hand helen sighed parting salutes however romantic may be overdone here she was at thirty eight beautiful and admired and all that she seemed to have got from her lovers were approaches and adieus worse still in the last one she had lost a customer too business languished and she hung out a room to let card two large rooms on the third floor were prepared for desirable tenants roomers came and went regretfully for the house of mrs barry was the abode of neatness comfort and taste one day came ramonti the violinist and engaged the front room above the discord and clatter uptown offended his nice ear so a friend had sent him to this oasis in the desert of noise ramonti with his still youthful face his dark eyebrows his short pointed foreign brown beard his distinguished head of gray hair and his artist s temperament revealed in his light gay and sympathetic manner was a welcome tenant in the old house near abingdon square helen lived on the floor above the store the architecture of it was singular and quaint the hall was large and almost square up one side of it and then across the end of it ascended an open stairway to the floor above this hall space she had furnished as a sitting room and office combined there she kept her desk and wrote her business letters and there she sat of evenings by a warm fire and a bright red light and sewed or read ramonti found the atmosphere so agreeable that he spent much time there describing to mrs barry the wonders of paris where he had studied with a particularly notorious and noisy fiddler next comes lodger no a handsome melancholy man in the early s with a brown mysterious beard and strangely pleading haunting eyes he too found the society of helen a desirable thing with the eyes of romeo and othello s tongue he charmed her with tales of distant climes and wooed her by respectful innuendo from the first helen felt a marvelous and compelling thrill in the presence of this man his voice somehow took her swiftly back to the days of her youth s romance this feeling grew and she gave way to it and it led her to an instinctive belief that he had been a factor in that romance and then with a woman s reasoning oh yes they do sometimes she leaped over common syllogism and theory and logic and was sure that her husband had come back to her for she saw in his eyes love which no woman can mistake and a thousand tons of regret and remorse which aroused pity which is perilously near to love requited which is the sine qua non in the house that jack built but she made no sign a husband who steps around the corner for twenty years and then drops in again should not expect to find his slippers laid out too conveniently near nor a match ready lighted for his cigar there must be expiation explanation and possibly execration a little purgatory and then maybe if he were properly humble he might be trusted with a harp and crown and so she made no sign that she knew or suspected and my friend the reporter could see nothing funny in this sent out on an assignment to write up a roaring hilarious brilliant joshing story of but i will not knock a brother let us go on with the story one evening ramonti

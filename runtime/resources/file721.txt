blossom she s on all right i asked her in a sarcastic vein if she thought den man thompson would make any kind of a show in the part oh no says she i don t want him or john drew or jim corbett or any

highsmith took the train the next day for cran berry corners he remained in that forsaken and inanimate village three days he found the boggs family and corkscrewed their history unto the third and fourth generation he amassed the facts and the local color of cranberry corners the village had not grown as rapidly as had miss carrington the actor estimated that it had suffered as few actual changes since the departure of its solitary follower of thespis as had a stage upon which four years is supposed to have elapsed he absorbed cran berry corners and returned to the city of chameleon changes it was in the rathskeller that highsmith made the hit of his histrionic career there is no need to name the place there is but one rathskeller where you could hope to find miss posie carrington after a performance of the king s bath robe there was a jolly small party at one of the tables that drew many eyes miss carrington petite mar vellous bubbling electric fame drunken shall be

journals and gold on the back of a supper check these sat at a table while the musicians played while waiters moved in the mazy performance of their duties with their backs toward all who desired their service and all was bizarre and merry because it was nine feet below the level of the sidewalk at a being entered the rathskeller the first violin perceptibly flatted a c that should have been natural the clarionet blew a bubble instead of a grace note miss carrington giggled and the youth with parted hair swallowed an olive seed exquisitely and irreproachably rural was the new entry a lank disconcerted hesitating young man it was flaxen haired gaping of mouth awkward stricken to misery by the lights and company his clothing was butternut with bright blue tie showing four inches of bony wrist and white socked ankle he upset a chair sat in another one curled a foot around a table leg and cringed at the approach of a waiter you may fetch me a glass of lager beer he said in response to the discreet questioning of the servitor the eyes of the rathskeller were upon him he was as fresh as a collard and as ingenuous as a hay rake he let his eye rove about the place as one who re gards big eyed hogs in the potato patch his gaze rested at length upon miss carrington he rose and went to her table with a lateral shining smile and a blush of pleased trepidation how re ye miss posie he said in accents not to be doubted don t ye remember me bill sum mers the summerses that lived back of the black smith shop i reckon i ve growed up some since ye left cranberry corners liza perry lowed

glasses and enjoyed the comedy that posie carrington was treat ing them to after her regular performance a few cynical ones whispered press agent and smiled wisely posie carrington laid her dimpled and desirable chin upon her hands and forgot her audience a faculty that had won her laurels for her i don t seem to recollect any bill summers she said thoughtfully gazing straight into the innocent

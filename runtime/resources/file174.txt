and had to back away from a furniture van that had no business to be there he tried to back out but dropped his reins and swore dutifully he was blockaded in a tangled mess of vehicles and horses one of those street blockades had occurred that sometimes tie up commerce and movement quite suddenly in the big city why don t you drive on said miss lantry impatiently we ll be late richard stood up in the cab and looked around he saw a congested flood of wagons trucks cabs vans and street cars filling the vast space where broadway sixth avenue and thirly fourth street cross one another as a twenty six inch maiden fills her twenty two inch girdle and still from all the cross streets they were hurrying and rattling toward the converging point at full speed and hurling thcmselves into the struggling mass locking wheels and adding their drivers imprecations to the clamour the entire traffic of manhattan seemed to have jammed itself around them the oldest new yorker among the thousands of spectators that lined the sidewalks had not witnessed a street blockade of the proportions of this one i m very sorry said richard as he resumed his seat but it looks as if we are stuck they won t get this jumble loosened up in an hour it was my fault if i hadn t dropped the ring we let me see the ring said miss lantry now that it can t be helped i don t care i think theatres are stupid anyway at o clock that night somebody tapped lightly on anthony rockwall s door come in shouted anthony who was in a red dressing gown reading a book of piratical adventures somebody was aunt ellen looking like a grey haired angel that had been left on earth by mistake they re engaged anthony she said softly she has promised to marry our richard on their way to the theatre there was a street blockade and it was two hours before their cab could get out of it and oh brother anthony don t ever boast of the power of money again a little emblem of true love a little ring that symbolised unending and unmercenary affection was the cause of our richard finding his happiness he dropped it in the street and got out to recover it and before they could continue the blockade occurred he spoke to his love and won her there while the cab was hemmed in money is dross compared with true love anthony all right said old anthony i m glad the boy has got what he wanted i told him i wouldn t spare any expense in the matter if but brother anthony what good could your money have done sister said anthony rockwall i ve got my pirate in a devil of a scrape his ship has just been scuttled and he s too good a judge of the value of money to let drown i wish you would let me go on with this chapter the story should end here i wish it would as heartily as you who read it wish it did but we must go to the bottom of the well for truth the next day a person with red hands and a blue polka dot necktie who called himself kelly called at anthony rockwall s house and was at once received in the library well said anthony reaching for his chequebook it was a good bilin of soap let s see you had in cash i paid out oo more of my own said kelly i had to go a little above the estimate i got the express wagons and cabs mostly for but the trucks and two horse teams mostly raised me to the motormen wanted and some of the loaded teams the cops struck me hardest i paid two and the rest and but didn t it work beautiful mr rockwall i m glad william a brady wasn t onto that little outdoor vehicle mob scene i wouldn t want william to break his heart with jealousy and never a rehearsal either the boys was on time to the fraction of a second it was two hours before a snake could get below greeley s statue thirteen hundred there you are kelly said anthony tearing off a check your thousand and the you were out you don t despise money do you kelly me said kelly i can lick the man that invented poverty anthony called kelly when he was at the door you didn t notice said he anywhere in the tie up a kind of a fat boy without any clothes on shooting arrows around with a bow did you why no said kelly mystified i didn t if he was like you say maybe the cops pinched him before i got there i thought the little rascal wouldn t be on hand chuckled anthony good by kelly springtime a la carte it was a day in march never never begin a story this way when you write one no opening could possibly be worse it is unimaginative flat dry and likely to consist of mere wind but in this instance it is allowable for the following paragraph which should have inaugurated the narrative is too wildly extravagant and preposterous to be flaunted in the face of the reader without preparation sarah was crying over her bill of fare think of a new york girl shedding tears on the menu card to account for this you will be allowed to guess that the lobsters were all out or that she had sworn ice cream off during lent or that she had ordered onions or that she had just come from a hackett matinee and then all these

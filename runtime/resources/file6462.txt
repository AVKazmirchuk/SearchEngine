i don t mean because they don t resist i ll tell you later on why they can t do that but it makes a man feel sorry for them the way they lose their heads big burly drummers and farmers and ex soldiers and high collared dudes and sports that a few moments before were filling the car with noise and bragging get so scared that their ears flop there were very few people in the day coaches at that time of night so we made a slim haul until we got to the sleeper the pullman conductor met me at one door while jim was going round to the other one he very politely informed me that i could not go into that car as it did not belong to the railroad company and besides the passengers had already been greatly disturbed by the shouting and firing never in all my life have i met with a finer instance of official dignity and reliance upon the power of mr pull man s great name i jabbed my six shooter so hard against mr conductor s front that i afterward found one of his vest buttons so firmly wedged in the end of the barrel that i had to shoot it out he just shut up like a weak springed knife and rolled down the car steps i opened the door of the sleeper and stepped inside a big fat old man came wabbling up to me puffing and blowing he had one coat sleeve on and was trying to put his vest on over that i don t know who he thought i was young man young man says he you must keep cool and not get excited above everything keep cool i can t says i excitement s just eating me up and then i let out a yell and turned loose my forty five through the skylight that old man tried to dive into one of the lower berths but a screech came out of it and a bare foot that took him in the bread basket and landed him on the floor i saw jim coming in the other door and i hollered for everybody to climb out and line up they commenced to scramble down and for a while we had a three ringed circus the men looked as frightened and tame as a lot of rabbits in a deep snow they had on on an average about a quarter of a suit of clothes and one shoe apiece one chap was sitting on the floor of the aisle looking as if he were working a hard sum in arithmetic he was trying very solemn to pull a lady s number two shoe on his number nine foot the ladies didn t stop to dress they were so curious to see a real live train robber bless em that they just wrapped blankets and sheets around themselves and came out squeaky and fidgety looking they always show more curiosity and sand than the men do we got them all lined up and pretty quiet and i went through the bunch i found very little on them i mean in the way of valuables one man in the line was a sight he was one of those big overgrown solemn snoozers that sit on the platform at lectures and look wise before crawling out he had managed to put on his long frock tailed coat and his high silk hat the rest of him was nothing but pajamas and bunions when i dug into that prince albert i expected to drag out at least a block of gold mine stock or an armful of government bonds but all i found was a little boy s french harp about four inches long what it was there for i don t know i felt a little mad because he had fooled me so i stuck the harp up against his mouth if you can t pay play i says i can t play says he then learn right off quick says i letting him smell the end of my gun barrel he caught hold of the harp turned red as a beet and commenced to blow he blew a dinky little tune i remembered hearing when i was a kid prettiest little gal in the country oh mammy and daddy told me so i made him keep on playing it all the time we were in the car now and then he d get weak and off the key and i d turn my gun on him and ask what was the matter with that little gal and whether he had any intention of going back on her which would make him start up again like sixty i think that old boy standing there in his silk hat and bare feet playing his little french harp was the funniest sight i ever saw one little red headed woman in the line broke out laughing at him you could have heard her in the next car then jim held them steady while i searched the berths i grappled around in those beds and filled a pillow case with the strangest assortment of stuff you ever saw now and then i d come across a little pop gun pistol just about right for plugging teeth with which i d throw out the window when i finished with the collection i dumped the pillow case load in the middle of the aisle there were a good many watches bracelets rings and pocket books with a sprinkling of false teeth whiskey flasks fa ce powder boxes chocolate caramels and heads of hair of various colours and lengths there were also about a dozen ladies stockings into which jewellery watches and rolls of bills had been stuffed and then wadded up tight and stuck under the mattresses i offered to return what i called the scalps saying that we were not indians on the war path but none of the ladies seemed to know to whom the hair belonged one of the women and a good looker she was wrapped in a striped blanket saw me pick up one of the stockings that was pretty chunky and heavy about the toe and she snapped out that s mine sir you re not in the business of robbing women are you now as this was our first hold up we hadn t agreed upon any code of ethics so i hardly knew what to answer but anyway i replied well not as a specialty if this contains your personal property you can have it back it just does she declared eagerly and reached out her hand for it you ll excuse my taking a look at the contents i said holding the stocking up by the toe out dumped a big gent s gold watch worth two hundred a gent s leather pocket book that we afterward found to contain six hundred dollars a calibre revolver and the only thing of the lot that could have been a lady s personal property was a silver bracelet worth about fifty cents i said madame here s your property and handed her the bracelet now i went on how can you expect us to act square with you when you try to deceive us in this manner i m surprised at such conduct the young woman flushed up as if she had been caught doing something dishonest some other woman down the line called out the mean thing i never knew whether she meant the other lady or me when we finished our job we ordered everybody back to bed told em good night very politely at the door and left we rode forty miles before daylight and then divided the stuff each one of us got in money we lumped the jewellery around then we scattered each man for himself that was my first train robbery and it was about as easily done as any of the ones that followed but that was the last and only time i ever went through the passengers i don t like that part of the business afterward i stuck strictly to the express car during the next eight years i handled a good deal of money the best haul i made was just seven years after the first one we found out about a train that was going to bring out a lot of money to pay off the soldiers at a government post we stuck that train up in broad daylight five of us lay in the sand hills near a little station ten soldiers were guarding the money on the train but they might just as well have been at home on a furlough we didn t even allow them to stick their heads out the windows to see the fun we had no trouble at all in getting the money which was all in gold of course a big howl was raised at the time about the robbery it was government stuff and the government got sarcastic and wanted to know what the convoy of soldiers went along for the only excuse given was that nobody was expecting an attack among those bare sand hills in daytime i don t know what the government thought about the excuse but i know that it was a good one the surprise that is the keynote of the train robbing business the papers published all k inds of stories about the loss finally agreeing that it was between nine thousand and ten thousand dollars the government sawed wood here are the correct figures printed for the first time forty eight thousand dollars if anybody will take the trouble to look over uncle sam s private accounts for that little debit to profit and loss he will find that i am right to a cent by that time we were expert enough to know what to do we rode due west twenty miles making a trail that a broadway policeman could have followed and then we doubled back hiding our tracks on the second night after the hold up while posses were scouring the country in every direction jim and i were eating supper in the second story of a friend s house in the town where the alarm started from our friend pointed out to us in an office across the street a printing press at work striking off handbills offering a reward for our capture i have been asked what we do with the money we get well i never could account for a tenth part of it after it was spent it goes fast and freely an outlaw has to have a good many friends a highly respected citizen may and often does get along with very few but a man on the dodge has got to have sidekickers with angry posses and reward hungry officers cutting out a hot trail for him he must have a few places scattered about the country where he can stop and feed himself and his horse and get a few hours sleep without having to keep both eyes open when he makes a haul he feels like dropping some of the coin with these friends and he does it liberally sometimes i have at the end of a hasty visit at one of these havens of refuge flung a handful of gold and bills into the laps of the kids playing on the floor without knowing whether my contribution was a hundred dollars or a thousand when old timers make a big haul they generally go far away to one of the big cities to spend their money green hands however successful a hold up they make nearly always give themselves away by showing too much money near the place where they got it i was in a job in where we got twenty thousand dollars we followed our favourite plan for a get away that is doubled on our trail and laid low for a time near the scene of the train s bad luck one morning i picked up a newspaper and read an article with big headlines stating that the marshal with eight deputies and a posse of thirty armed citizens had the train robbers surrounded in a mesquite thicket on the cimarron and that it was a question of only a few hours when they would be dead men or prisoners while i was reading that article i was sitting at breakfast in one of the most elegant private residences in washington city with a flunky in knee pants standing behind my chair jim was sitting across the table talking to his half uncle a retired naval officer whose name you have often seen in the accounts of doings in the capital we had gone there and bought rattling outfits of good clothes and were resting from our labours among the nabobs we must have been killed in that mesquite thicket for i can make an affidavit that we didn t surrender now i propose to tell why it is easy to hold up a train and then why no one should ever do it in the first place the attacking party has all the advantage that is of course supposing that they are old timers with the necessary experience and courage they have the outside and are protected by the darkness while the others are in the light hemmed into a small space and exposed the moment they show a head at a window or door to the aim of a man who is a dead shot and who won t hesitate to shoot but in my opinion the main condition that makes train robbing easy is the element of surprise in connection with the imagination of the passengers if you have ever seen a horse that has eaten loco weed you will understand what i mean when i say that the passengers get locoed that horse gets the awfullest imagination on him in the world you can t coax him to cross a little branch stream two feet wide it looks as big to him as the mississippi river that s just the way with the passenger he thinks there are a hundred men yelling and shooting outside when maybe there are only two or three and the muzzle of a forty five looks like the entrance to a tunnel the passenger is all right although he may do mean little tricks like hiding a wad of money in his shoe and forgetting to dig up until you jostle his ribs some with the end of your six shooter but there s no harm in him as to the train crew we never had any more trouble with them than if they had been so many sheep i don t mean that they are cowards i mean that they have got sense they know they re not up against a bluff it s the same way with the officers i ve seen secret service men marshals and railroad detectives fork over their change as meek as moses i saw one of the bravest marshals i ever knew hide his gun under his seat and dig up along with the rest while i was taking toll he wasn t afraid he simply knew that we had the drop on the whole outfit besides many of those officers have families and they feel that they oughtn t to take chances whereas death has no terrors for the man who holds up a train he expects to get killed some day and he generally does my advice to you if you should ever be in a hold up is to line up with the cowards and save your bravery for an occasion when it may be of some benefit to you another reason why officers are backward about mixing things with a train robber is a financial one every time there is a scrimmage and somebody gets killed the officers lose money if the train robber gets away they swear out a warrant against john doe et al and travel hundreds of miles and sign vouchers for thousands on the trail of the fugitives and the government foots the bills so with them it is a question of mileage rather than courage i will give one instance to support my statement that the surprise is the best card in playing for a hold up along in the daltons were cutting out a hot trail for the officers down in the cherokee nation those were their lucky days and they got so reckless and sandy that they used to announce before hand what job they were going to undertake once they gave it out that they were going to hold up the m k t flyer on a certain night at the station of pryor creek in indian territory that night the railroad company got fifteen deputy marshals in muscogee and put them on the train beside them they had fifty armed men hid in the depot at pryor creek when the katy flyer pulled in not a dalton showed up the next station was adair six miles away when the train reached there and the deputies were having a good time explaining what they would have done to the dalton gang if they had turned up all at once it sounded like an army firing outside the conductor and brakeman came running into the car yelling train robbers some of those deputies lit out of the door hit the ground and kept on running some of them hid their winchesters under the seats two of them made a fight and were both killed it took the daltons just ten minutes to capture the train and whip the escort in twenty minutes more they robbed the express car of twenty seven thousand dollars and made a clean get away my opinion is that those deputies would have put up a stiff fight at pryor creek where they were expecting trouble but they were taken by surprise and locoed at adair just as the daltons who knew their business expected they would i don t think i ought to close without giving some deductions from my experience of eight years on the dodge it doesn t pay to rob trains leaving out the question of right and morals which i don t think i ought to tackle there is very little to envy in the life of an outlaw after a while money ceases to have any value in his eyes he gets to looking upon the railroads and express companies as his bankers and his six shooter as a cheque book good for any amount he throws away money right and left most of the time he is on the jump riding day and night and he lives so hard between times that he doesn t enjoy the taste of high life when he gets it he knows that his time is bound to come to lose his life or liberty and that the accuracy of his aim the speed of his horse and the fidelity of his sider are all that postpone the inevitable it isn t that he loses any sleep over danger from the officers of the law in all my experience i never knew officers to attack a band of outlaws unless they outnumbered them at least three to one but the outlaw carries one thought constantly in his mind and that is what makes him so sore against life more than anything else he knows where the marshals get their recruits of deputies he knows that the majority of these upholders of the law were once lawbreakers horse thieves rustlers highwaymen and outlaws like himself and that they gamed their positions and immunity by turning state s evidence by turning traitor and delivering up their comrades to imprisonment and death he knows that some day unless he is shot first his judas will set to work the trap will be laid and he will be the surprised instead of a surpriser at a stick up that is why the man who holds up trains picks his company with a thousand times the care with which a careful girl chooses a sweetheart that is why he raises himself from his blanket of nights and listens to the tread of every horse s hoofs on the distant road that is why he broods suspiciously for days upon a jesting remark or an unusual movement of a tried comrade or the broken mutterings of his closest friend sleeping by his side and it is one of the reasons why the train robbing profession is not so pleasant a one as either of its collateral branches politics or cornering the market ulysses and the dogman do you know the time of the dogmen when the forefinger of twilight begins to smudge the clear drawn lines of the big city there is inaugurated an hour devoted to one of the most melancholy sights of urban life out from the towering flat crags and apartment peaks of the cliff dwellers of new york steals an army of beings that were once men even yet they go upright upon two limbs and retain human form and speech but you will observe that they are behind animals in progress each of these beings follows a dog to which he is fastened by an artificial ligament these men are all victims to circe not willingly do they become flunkeys to fido bell boys to bull terriers and toddlers after towzer modern circe instead of turning them into animals has kindly left the difference of a six foot leash between them every one of those dogmen has been either cajoled bribed or commanded by his own particular circe to take the dear household pet out for an airing by their faces and manner you can tell that the dogmen are bound in a hopeless enchantment never will there come even a dog catcher ulysses to remove the spell the faces of some are stonily set they are past the commiseration the curiosity or the jeers of their fellow beings years of matrimony of continuous compulsory canine constitutionals have made them callous they unwind their beasts from lamp posts or the ensnared legs of profane pedestrians with the stolidity of mandarins manipulating the strings of their kites others more recently reduced to the ranks of rover s retinue take their medicine sulkily and fiercely they play the dog on the end of their line with the pleasure felt by the girl out fishing when she catches a sea robin on her hook they glare at you threateningly if you look at them as if it would be their delight to let slip the dogs of war these are half mutinous dogmen not quite circe ized and you will do well not to kick their charges should they sniff around your ankles others of the tribe do not seem to feel so keenly they are mostly unfresh youths with gold caps and drooping cigarettes who do not harmonize with their dogs the animals they attend wear satin bows in their collars and the young men steer them so assiduously that you are tempted to the theory that some personal advantage contingent upon satisfactory service waits upon the execution of their duties the dogs thus personally conducted are of many varieties but they are one in fatness in pampered diseased vileness of temper in insolent snarling capriciousness of behaviour they tug at the leash fractiously they make leisurely nasal inventory of every door step railing and post they sit down to rest when they choose they wheeze like the winner of a third avenue beefsteak eating contest they blunder clumsily into open cellars and coal holes they lead the dogmen a merry dance these unfortunate dry nurses of dogdom the cur cuddlers mongrel managers spitz stalkers poodle pullers skye scrapers dachshund dandlers terrier trailers and pomeranian pushers of the cliff dwelling circes follow their charges meekly the doggies neither fear nor respect them masters of the house these men whom they hold in leash may be but they are not masters of them from cosey corner to fire escape from divan to dumbwaiter doggy s snarl easily drives this two legged being who is commissioned to walk at the other end of his string during his outing one twilight the dogmen came forth as usual at their circes pleading guerdon or crack of the whip one among them was a strong man apparently of too solid virtues for this airy vocation his expression was melancholic his manner depressed he was leashed to a vile white dog loathsomely fat fiendishly ill natured gloatingly intractable toward his despised conductor at a corner nearest to his apartment house the dogman turned down a side street hoping for fewer witnesses to his ignominy the surfeited beast waddled before him panting with spleen and the labour of motion suddenly the dog stopped a tall brown long coated wide brimmed man stood like a colossus blocking the sidewalk and declaring well i m a son of a gun jim berry breathed the dogman with exclamation points in his voice sam telfair cried wide brim again you ding basted old willy walloo give us your hoof their hands clasped in the brief tight greeting of the west that is death to the hand shake microbe you old fat rascal continued wide brim with a wrinkled brown smile it s been five years since i seen you i been

his trousers with a yeasty growl get to work said jim and explain this yard wide hydrophobia yearling you ve throwed your lasso over are you the pound master of this burg do you call that a dog or what i need a drink said the dogman dejected at the reminder of his old dog of the sea come on hard by was a cafe tis ever so in the big city they sat at a table and the bloated monster yelped and scrambled at the end of his leash to get at the cafe cat whiskey said jim to the waiter make it two said the dogman you re fatter said jim and you look subjugated i don t know about the east agreeing

for home this evening on the like to stay longer but i can t i ll walk down to the ferry with you said the dogman the dog had bound a leg each of jim and the chair together and had sunk into a comatose slumber jim stumbled and the leash was slightly wrenched the shrieks of the awakened beast rang for a block around if that s your dog said jim when they were on the street again what s to hinder you from running that habeas corpus you ve got around his neck over a limb and walking off and forgetting him i d never dare to said the dogman awed at the bold proposition he sleeps in the bed i sleep on a lounge he runs howling to marcella if i look at him some night jim i m going to get even with that dog i ve made up my mind to do it i m going to creep over with a knife and cut a hole in his mosquito bar so they can get in to him see if i don t do it you ain t yourself sam telfair you ain t what you was once i don t know about these cities and flats over here with my own eyes i seen you stand off both the tillotson boys in prairie view with the brass faucet out of a molasses barrel and i seen you rope and tie the wildest steer on little powder in i did didn t i said the other with a temporary gleam in his eye but that was before i was dogmatized does misses telfair began jim hush said the dogman here s another cafe they lined up at the bar the dog fell asleep at their feet whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman i thought about you said jim when i bought that wild land i wished you was out there to help me with the stock last tuesday said the dogman he bit me on the ankle because i asked for cream in my coffee he always gets the cream you d like prairie view now said jim the boys from the round ups for fifty miles around ride in there one corner of my pasture is in sixteen miles of the town there s a straight forty miles of wire on one side of it you pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom said the dogman and you pass through the parlour to get to the bath room and you back out through the dining room to get into the bedroom so you can turn around and leave by the kitchen and he snores and barks in his sleep and i have to smoke in the park on account of his asthma don t missis telfair began jim oh shut up said the dogman what is it this time whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman well i ll be racking along down toward the ferry said the other come on there you mangy turtle backed snake headed bench legged ton and a half of soap grease shouted the dogman with a new note in his voice and a new hand on the leash the dog scrambled after them with an angry whine at such unusual language from his guardian at the foot of twenty third street the dogman led the way through swinging doors last chance said he speak up whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman i don t know said the ranchman where i ll find the man i want to take charge of the little powder outfit i want somebody i know something about finest stretch of prairie and timber you ever squinted your eye over sam now if you was speaking of hydrophobia said the dogman the other night he chewed a piece out of my leg because i knocked a fly off of marcella s arm it ought to be cauterized says marcella and i was thinking so myself i telephones for the doctor and when he comes marcella says to me help me hold the poor dear while the doctor fixes his mouth oh i hope he got no virus on any of his toofies when he bit you now what do you think of that does missis telfair began jim oh drop it said the dogman come again whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman they walked on to the ferry the ranchman stepped to the ticket window suddenly the swift landing of three or four heavy kicks was heard the air was rent by piercing canine shrieks and a pained outraged lubberly bow legged pudding of a dog ran frenziedly up the street alone ticket to denver said jim make it two shouted the ex dogman reaching for his inside pocket the champion of the weather if you should speak of the kiowa reservation to the average new yorker he probably wouldn t know whether you were referring to a new political dodge at albany or a leitmotif from parsifal but out in the kiowa reservation advices have been received concerning the existence of new york a party of us were on a hunting trip in the reservation bud kingsbury our guide philosopher and friend was broiling antelope steaks in camp one night one of the party a pinkish haired young man in a correct hunting costume sauntered over to the fire to light a cigarette and remarked carelessly to bud nice night why yes said bud as nice as any night could be that ain t received the broadway stamp of approval now the young man was from new york but the rest of us wondered how bud guessed it so when the steaks were done we besought him to lay bare his system of ratiocination and as bud was something of a territorial talking machine he made oration as follows how did i know he was from new york well i figured it out as soon as he sprung them two words on me i was in new york myself a couple of years ago and i noticed some of the earmarks and hoof tracks of the rancho manhattan found new york rather different from the panhandle didn t you bud asked one of the hunters can t say that i did answered bud anyways not more than some the main trail in that town which they call broadway is plenty travelled but they re about the same brand of bipeds that tramp around in cheyenne and amarillo at first i was sort of rattled by the crowds but i soon says to myself here now bud they re just plain folks like you and geronimo and grover cleveland and the watson boys so don t get all flustered up with consternation under your saddle blanket and then i feels calm and peaceful like i was back in the nation again at a ghost dance or a green corn pow wow i d been saving up for a year to give this new york a whirl i knew a man named summers that lived there but i couldn t find him so i played a lone hand at enjoying the intoxicating pleasures of the corn fed metropolis for a while i was so frivolous and locoed by the electric lights and the noises of the phonographs and the second story railroads that i forgot one of the crying needs of my western system of natural requirements i never was no hand to deny myself the pleasures of sociable vocal intercourse with friends and strangers out in the territories when i meet a man i never saw before inside of nine minutes i know his income religion size of collar and his wife s temper and how much he pays for clothes al imony and chewing tobacco it s a gift with me not to be penurious with my conversation but this here new york was inaugurated on the idea of abstemiousness in regard to the parts of speech at the end of three weeks nobody in the city had fired even a blank syllable in my direction except the waiter in the grub emporium where i fed and as his outpourings of syntax wasn t nothing but plagiarisms from the bill of fare he never satisfied my yearnings which was to have somebody hit if i stood next to a man at a bar he d edge off and give a baldwin ziegler look as if he suspected me of having the north pole concealed on my person i began to wish that i d gone to abilene or waco for my paseado for the mayor of them places will drink with you and the first citizen you meet will tell you his middle name and ask you to take a chance in a raffle for a music box well one day when i was particular hankering for to be gregarious with something more loquacious than a lamp post a fellow in a caffy says to me says he nice day he was a kind of a manager of the place and i reckon he d seen me in there a good many times he had a face like a fish and an eye like judas but i got up and put one arm around his neck pardner i says sure it s a nice day you re the first gentleman in all new york to observe that the intricacies of human speech might not be altogether wasted on william kingsbury but don t you think says i that twas a little cool early in the morning and ain t there a feeling of rain in the air to night but along about noon it sure was gallupsious weather how s all up to the house you doing right well with the caffy now well sir that galoot just turns his back and walks off stiff without a word after all my trying to be agreeable i didn t know what to make of it that night i finds a note from summers who d been away from town giving the address of his camp i goes up to his house and has a good old time talk with his folks and i tells summers about the actions of this coyote in the caffy and desires interpretation oh says summers he wasn t intending to strike up a conversation with you that s just the new york style he d seen you was a regular customer and he spoke a word or two just to show you he appreciated your custom you oughtn t to have followed it up that s about as far as we care to go with a stranger a word or so about the weather may be ventured but we don t generally make it the basis of an acquaintance billy says i the weather and its ramifications is a solemn subject with me meteorology is one of my sore points no man can open up the question of temperature or humidity or the glad sunshine with me and then turn tail on it without its leading to a falling barometer i m going down to see that man again and give him a lesson in the art of continuous conversation you say new york etiquette allows him two words and no answer well he s going to turn himself into a weather bureau and finish what he begun with me besides indulging in neighbourly remarks on other subjects summers talked agin it but i was irritated some and i went on the street car back to that caffy the same fellow was there yet walking round in a sort of back corral where there was tables and chairs a few people was sitting around having drinks and sneering at one another i called that man to one side and herded him into a corner i unbuttoned enough to show him a thirty eight i carried stuck under my vest pardner i says a brief space ago i was in here and you seized the opportunity to say it was a nice day when i attempted to corroborate your weather signal you turned your back and walked off now says i you frog hearted language shy stiff necked cross between a spitzbergen sea cook and a muzzled oyster you resume where you left off in your discourse on the weather the fellow looks at me and tries to grin but he sees i don t and he comes around serious well says he eyeing the handle of my gun it was rather a nice day some warmish though particulars you mealy mouthed snoozer i says let s have the specifications expatiate fill in the outlines when you start anything with me in short hand it s bound to turn out a storm signal looked like rain yesterday says the man but it cleared off fine in the forenoon i hear the farmers are needing rain right badly up state that s the kind of a canter says i shake the new york dust off your hoofs and be a real agreeable kind of a centaur you broke the ice you know and we re getting better acquainted every minute seems to me i asked you about your family they re all well thanks says he we we have a new piano now you re coming it i says this cold reserve is breaking up at last that little touch about the piano almost makes us brothers what s the youngest kid s name i asks him thomas says he he s just getting well from the measles i feel like i d known you always says i now there was just one more are you doing right well with the caffy now pretty well he says i m putting away a little money glad to hear it says i now go back to your work and get civilized keep your hands off the weather unless you re ready to follow it up in a personal manner it s a subject that naturally belongs to sociability and the forming of new ties and i hate to see it handed out in small change in a town like this so the next day i rolls up my blankets and hits the trail away from new york city for many minutes after bud ceased talking we lingered around the fire and then all hands began to disperse for bed as i was unrolling my bedding i heard the pinkish haired young man saying to bud with something like anxiety in his voice as i say mr kingsbury there is something really beautiful about this night the delightful breeze and the bright stars and the clear air unite in making it wonderfully attractive yes said bud it s a nice night makes the whole world kin the burglar stepped inside the window quickly and then he took his time a burglar who respects his art always takes his time before taking anything else the house was a private residence by its boarded front door and untrimmed boston ivy the burglar knew that the mistress of it was sitting on some oceanside piazza telling a sympathetic man in a yachting cap that no one had ever understood her sensitive lonely heart he knew by the light in the third story front windows and by the lateness of the season that the master of the house had come home and would soon extinguish his light and retire for it was september of the year and of the soul in which season the house s good man comes to consider roof gardens and stenographers as vanities and to desire the return of his mate and the more durable blessings of decorum and the moral excellencies the burglar lighted a cigarette the guarded glow of the match illuminated his salient points for a moment he belonged to the third type of burglars this third type has not yet been recognized and accepted the police have made us familiar with the first and second their classification is simple the collar is the distinguishing mark when a burglar is caught who does not wear a collar he is described as a degenerate of the lowest type singularly vicious and depraved and is suspected of being the desperate criminal who stole the handcuffs out of patrolman hennessy s pocket in and walked away to escape arrest the other well known type is the burglar who wears a collar he is always referred to as a raffles in real life he is invariably a gentleman by daylight breakfasting in a dress suit and posing as a paperhanger while after dark he plies his nefarious occupation of burglary his mother is an extremely wealthy and respected resident of ocean grove and when he is conducted to his cell he asks at once for a nail file and the police gazette he always has a wife in every state in the union and fiancees in all the territories and the newspapers print his matrimonial gallery out of their stock of cuts of the ladies who were cured by only one bottle after having been given up by five doctors experiencing great relief after the first dose the burglar wore a blue sweater he was neither a raffles nor one of the chefs from hell s kitchen the police would have been baffled had they attempted to classify him they have not yet heard of the respectable unassuming burglar who is neither above nor below his station this burglar of the third class began to prowl he wore no masks dark lanterns or gum shoes he carried a calibre revolver in his pocket and he chewed peppermint gum thoughtfully the furniture of the house was swathed in its summer dust protectors the silver was far away in safe deposit vaults the burglar expected no remarkable haul his objective point was that dimly lighted room where the master of the house should be sleeping heavily after whatever solace he had sought to lighten the burden of his loneliness a touch might be made there to the extent of legitimate fair professional profits loose money a watch a jewelled stick pin nothing exorbitant or beyond rea son he had seen the window left open and had taken the chance the burglar softly opened the door of the lighted room the gas was turned low a man lay in the bed asleep on the dresser lay many things in confusion a crumpled roll of bills a watch keys three poker chips crushed cigars a pink silk hair bow and an unopened bottle of bromo seltzer for a bulwark in the morning the burglar took three steps toward the dresser the man in the bed suddenly uttered a squeaky groan and opened his eyes his right hand slid under his pillow but remained there lay still said the burglar in conversational tone burglars of the third type do not hiss the citizen in the bed looked at the round end of the burglar s pistol and lay still now hold up both your hands commanded the burglar the citizen had a little pointed brown and gray beard like that of a painless dentist he looked solid esteemed irritable and disgusted he sat up in bed and raised his right hand above his head up with the other one ordered the burglar you might be amphibious and shoot with your left you can count two can t you hurry up now can t raise the other one said the citizen with a contortion of his lineaments what s the matter with it rheumatism in the shoulder inflammatory was the inflammation has gone down the burglar stood for a moment or two holding his gun on the afflicted one he glanced at the plunder on the dresser and then with a half embarrassed air back at the man in the bed then he too made a sudden grimace don t stand there making faces snapped the citizen bad humouredly if you ve come to burgle why don t you do it there s some stuff lying around scuse me said the burglar with a grin but it just socked me one too it s good for you that

toothache it s undiluted hades said the burglar you re dead right said the citizen the burglar looked down at his pistol and thrust it into his pocket with an awkward attempt at ease say old man he said constrainedly ever try opodeldoc slop said the citizen angrily might as well rub on restaurant butter sure concurred the burglar it s a salve suitable for little minnie when the kitty scratches her finger i ll tell you what we re up against it i only find one thing that eases her up hey little old sanitary ameliorating lest we forget booze say this job s off scuse me get on your clothes and

the burglar i ll help you get into your duds the conventional returned as a tidal wave and flooded the citizen he stroked his brown and gray beard it s very unusual he began here s your shirt said the burglar fall out i knew a man who said omberry s ointment fixed him in two weeks so he could use both hands in tying his four in hand as they were going out the door the citizen turned and started back liked to forgot my money he explained laid it on the dresser last night the burglar caught him by the right sleeve come on he said bluffly i ask you leave it alone i ve got the price ever try witch hazel and oil of wintergreen at arms with morpheus i never could quite understand how tom hopkins came to make that blunder for he had been through a whole term at a medical college before he inherited his aunt s fortune and had been considered strong in therapeutics we had been making a call together that evening and afterward tom ran up to my rooms for a pipe and a chat before going on to his own luxurious apartments i had stepped into the other room for a moment when i heard tom sing out oh billy i m going to take about four grains of quinine if you don t mind i m feeling all blue and shivery guess i m taking cold all right i called back the bottle is on the second shelf take it in a spoonful of that elixir of eucalyptus it knocks the bitter out after i came back we sat by the fire and got our briars going in about eight minutes tom sank back into a gentle collapse i went straight to the medicine cabinet and looked you unmitigated hayseed i growled see what money will do for a man s brains there stood the morphine bottle with the stopple out just as tom had left it i routed out another young m d who roomed on the floor above and sent him for old doctor gales two squares away tom hopkins has too much money to be attended by rising young practitioners alone when gales came we put tom through as expensive a course of treatment as the resources of the profession permit after the more drastic remedies we gave him citrate of caffeine in frequent doses and strong coffee and walked him up and down the floor between two of us old gales pinched him and slapped his face and worked hard for the big check he could see in the distance the young m d from the next floor gave tom a most hearty rousing kick and then apologized to me couldn t help it he said i never kicked a millionaire before in my life i may never have another opportunity now said doctor gales after a couple of hours he ll do but keep him awake for another hour you can do that by talking to him and shaking him up occasionally when his pulse and respiration are normal then let him sleep i ll leave him with you now i was left alone with tom whom we had laid on a couch he lay very still and his eyes were half closed i began my work of keeping him awake well old man i said you ve had a narrow squeak but we ve pulled you through when you were attending lectures tom didn t any of the professors ever casually remark that m o r p h i a never spells quinia especially in four grain doses but i won t pile it up on you until you get on your feet but you ought to have been a druggist tom you re splendidly qualified to fill prescriptions tom looked at me with a faint and foolish smile b ly he murmured i feel jus like a hum n bird flyin around a jolly lot of most shpensive roses don bozzer me goin sleep now and he went to sleep in two seconds i shook him by the shoulder now tom i said severely this won t do the big doctor said you must stay awake for at least an hour open your eyes you re not entirely safe yet you know wake up tom hopkins weighs one hundred and ninety eight he gave me another somnolent grin and fell into deeper slumber i would have made him move about but i might as well have tried to make cleopatra s needle waltz around the room with me tom s breathing became stertorous and that in connection with morphia poisoning means danger then i began to think i could not rouse his body i must strive to excite his mind make him angry was an idea that suggested itself good i thought but how there was not a joint in tom s armour dear old fellow he was good nature itself and a gallant gentleman fine and true and clean as sunlight he came from somewhere down south where they still have ideals and a code new york had charmed but had not spoiled him he had that old fashioned chivalrous reverence for women that eur eka there was my idea i worked the thing up for a minute or two in my imagination i chuckled to myself at the thought of springing a thing like that on old tom hopkins then i took him by the shoulder and shook him till his ears flopped he opened his eyes lazily i assumed an expression of scorn and contempt and pointed my finger within two inches of his nose listen to me hopkins i said in cutting and distinct tones you and i have been good friends but i want you to understand that in the future my doors are closed against any man who acts as much like a scoundrel as you have tom looked the least bit interested what s the matter billy he muttered composedly don t your clothes fit you if i were in your place i went on which thank god i am not i think i would be afraid to close my eyes how about that girl you left waiting for you down among those lonesome southern pines the girl that you ve forgotten since you came into your confounded money oh i know what i m talking about while you were a poor medical student she was good enough for you but now since you are a millionaire it s different i wonder what she thinks of the performances of that peculiar class of people which she has been taught to worship the southern gentlemen i m sorry hopkins that i was forced to speak about these matters but you ve covered it up so well and played your part so nicely that i would have sworn you were above such unmanly tricks poor tom i could scarcely keep from laughing outright to see him struggling against the effects of the opiate he was distinctly angry and i didn t blame him tom had a southern temper his eyes were open now and they showed a gleam or two of fire but the drug still clouded his mind and bound his tongue c c confound you he stammered i ll s smash you he tried to rise from the couch with all his size he was very weak now i thrust him back with one arm he lay there glaring like a lion in a trap that will hold you for a while you old loony i said to myself i got up and lit my pipe for i was needing a smoke i walked around a bit congratulating myself on my brilliant idea i heard a snore i looked around tom was asleep again i walked over and punched him on the jaw he looked at me as pleasant and ungrudging as an idiot i chewed my pipe and gave it to him hard i want you to recover yourself and get out of my rooms as soon as you can i

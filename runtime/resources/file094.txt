gregg who sits in vain wagging his redundant beard waiting to enrich his derelict audience with his moving tale of trepanning and jealousy but prosperously to the lucidity of these loose pages smith shall flutter among them again in the nick of time he shall come to tell us why he strewed so many anxious cigar stumps around the coconut palm that night this he must do for when he sailed away before the dawn in his yacht rambler he carried with him the answer to a riddle so big and preposterous that few in anchuria had ventured even to propound it iv caught the plans for the detention of the flying president miraflores and his companion at the coast line seemed hardly likely to fail doctor zavalla himself had gone to the port of alazan to establish a guard at that point at solitas the liberal patriot varras could be depended upon to keep close watch goodwin held himself responsible for the district about coralio the news of the president s flight had been disclosed to no one in the coast towns save trusted members of the ambitious political party that was desirous of succeeding to power the telegraph wire running from san mateo to the coast had been cut far up on the mountain trail by an emissary of zavalla s long before this could be repaired and word received along it from the capital the fugitives would have reached the coast and the question of escape or capture been solved goodwin had stationed armed sentinels at frequent intervals along the shore for a mile in each direction from coralio they were instructed to keep a vigilant lookout during the night to prevent miraflores from attempting to embark stealthily by means of some boat or sloop found by chance at the water s edge a dozen patrols walked the streets of coralio unsuspected ready to intercept the truant official should he show himself there goodwin was very well convinced that no precautions had been overlooked he strolled about the streets that bore such high sounding names and were but narrow grass covered lanes lending his own aid to the vigil that had been intrusted to him by bob englehart the town had begun the tepid round of its nightly diversions a few leisurely dandies cald in white duck with flowing neckties and swinging slim bamboo canes threaded the grassy by ways toward the houses of their favored senoritas those who wooed the art of music dragged tirelessly at whining concertinas or fingered lugubrious guitars at doors and windows an occasional soldier from the cuartel with flapping straw hat without coat or shoes hurried by balancing his long gun like a lance in one hand from every density of the foliage the giant tree frogs sounded their loud and irritating clatter further out the guttural cries of marauding baboons and the coughing of the alligators in the black estuaries fractured the vain silence of the wood by ten o clock the streets were deserted the oil lamps that had burned a sickly yellow at random corners had been extinguished by some economical civic agent coralio lay sleeping calmly between toppling mountains and encroaching sea like a stolen babe in the arms of its abductors somewhere over in that tropical darkness perhaps already threading the profundities of the alluvial lowlands the high adventurer and his mate were moving toward land s end the game of fox in the morning should be coming soon to its close goodwin at his deliberate gait passed the long low cuartel where coralio s contingent of anchuria s military force slumbered with its bare toes pointed heavenward there was a law that no civilian might come so near the headquarters of that citadel of war after nine o clock but goodwin was always forgetting the minor statutes quien vive shrieked the sentinel wrestling prodigiously with his lengthy musket americano growled goodwin without turning his head and passed on unhalted to the right he turned and to the left up the street that ultimately reached the plaza nacional when within the toss of a cigar stump from the intersecting street of the holy sepulchre he stopped suddenly in the pathway he saw the form of a tall man clothed in black and carrying a large valise hurry down the cross street in the direction of the beach and goodwin s second glance made him aware of a woman at the man s elbow on the farther side who seemed to urge forward if not even to assist her companion in their swift but silent progress they were no coralians those two goodwin followed at increased speed but without any of the artful tactics that are so dear to the heart of the sleuth the american was too broad to feel the instinct of the detective he stood as an agent for the people of anchuria and but for political reasons he would have demanded then and there the money it was the design of his party to secure the imperilled fund to restore it to the treasury of the country and to declare itself in power without bloodshed or resistance the couple halted at the door of the hotel de los extranjeros and the man struck upon the wood with the impatience of one unused to his entry being stayed madama was long in response but after a time her light showed the door was opened and the guests housed goodwin stoodin the quiet street lighting another cigar in two minutes a faint gleam began to show between the slats of the jalousies in the upper story of the hotel they have engaged rooms said goodwin to himself so then their arrangements for sailing have yet to be made at the moment there came along one esteban delgado a barber an enemy to existing government a jovial plotter against stagnation in

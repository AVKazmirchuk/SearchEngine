s house of the magazine that day he had lunched an arctic explorer a short story writer and the famous conductor of a slaughter house expose consequently his mind was in a whirl of icebergs maupassant and trichinosis but there was a surcease and a recourse there was bohemia he would seek distraction there and let s see he would call by for mary adrian half an hour later he threaded his way like a brazilian orchid hunter through the palm forest in the tiled entrance hall of the idealia apartment house one day the christeners of apartment houses and the cognominators of sleeping cars will meet and there will be some jealous and sanguinary knifing the clerk breathed grainger s name so languidly into the house telephone that it seemed it must surely drop from sheer inertia down to the janitor s regions but at length it soared dilatorily up to miss adrian s ear certainly mr grainger was to come up immediately a colored maid with an eliza crossing the ice expression opened the door of the apartment for him grainger walked sideways down the narrow hall a bunch of burnt umber hair and a sea green eye appeared in the crack of a door a long white undraped arm came out barring the way so glad you came ricky instead of any of the others said the eye light a cigarette and give it to me going to take me to dinner fine go into the front room till i finish dressing but don t sit in your usual chair there s pie in it meringue kappelman threw it at reeves last evening while he was reciting sophy has just come to straighten up is it lit thanks there s scotch on the mantel oh no it isn t that s chartreuse ask sophy to find you some i won t be long grainger escaped the meringue as he waited his spirits sank still lower the atmosphere of the room was as vapid as a zephyr wandering over a vesuvian lava bed relics of some feast lay about the room scattered in places where even a prowling cat would have been surprised to find them a straggling cluster of deep red roses in a marmalade

restaurant in town it may be well to follow them andre began his professional career as a waiter in a bowery ten cent eating house had you seen him there you would have called him tough to yourself not aloud for he would have soaked you as quickly as he would have soaked his thumb in your coffee he saved money and started a basement table d hote in eighth or ninth street one afternoon andre drank too much absinthe he announced to his startled family that he was the grand llama of thibet therefore requiring an empty audience hall in which to be worshiped he moved all the tables and chairs

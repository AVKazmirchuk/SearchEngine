me a job remsen he said i ve just handed a barber my last shilling no trouble at all said remsen i know a lot of men who have banks and stores and things downtown any particular line you fancy yes said o roon with a look of interest i took a walk in your central park this morning i d like to be one of those bobbies on horseback that would be about the ticket besides it s the only thing i could do i can ride a little and the fresh air suits me think you could land that for me remsen was sure that he could and in a very short time he did and they who were not above looking at mounted policemen might have seen a well set up affable cool young man on a prancing chestnut steed attending to his duties along the driveways of the park and now at the extreme risk of wearying old gentlemen who carry leather fob chains and elderly ladies who but no grandmother herself yet thrills at foolish immortal romeo there must be a hint of love at first sight it came just as remsen was strolling into fifth avenue from his club a few doors away a motor car was creeping along foot by foot impeded by a freshet of vehicles that filled the street in the car was a chauffeur and an old gentleman with snowy side whiskers and a scotch plaid cap which could not be worn while automobiling except by a personage not even a wine agent would dare do it but these two were of no consequence except perhaps for the guiding of the machine and the paying for it at the old gentleman s side sat a young lady more beautiful than pomegranate blossoms more exquisite than the first quarter moon viewed at twilight through the tops of oleanders remsen saw her and knew his fate he could have flunk himself under the very wheels that conveyed her but he knew that would be the last means of attracting the attention of those who ride in motor cars slowly the auto passed and if we place the poets above the autoists carried the heart of remsen with it here was a large city of millions and many women who at a certain distance appear to resemble pomegranate blossoms yet he hoped to see her again for each one fancies that his romance has its own tutelary guardian and divinity luckily for remsen s peace of mind there came a diversion in the guise of a reunion of the gentle riders of the city there were not many of them perhaps a score and there was wassail and things to eat and speeches and the spaniard was bearded again in recapitulation and when daylight threatened them the survivors prepared to depart but some remained upon the battlefield one of these was trooper o roon who was not seasoned to potent liquids his legs declined to fulfil the obligations they had sworn to the police department i m stewed remsen said o roon to his friend why do they build hotels that go round and round like catherine wheels they ll take away my shield and break me i can think and talk con con consec sec secutively but i s s stammer with my feet i ve got to go on duty in three hours the jig is up remsen the jig is up i tell you look at me said remsen who was his smiling self pointing to his own face whom do you see here goo fellow said o roon dizzily goo old remsen not so said remsen you see mounted policeman o roon look at your face no you can t do that without a glass but look at mine and think of yours how much alike are we as two french table d hote dinners with your badge on your horse in your uniform will i charm nurse maids and prevent the grass from growing under people s feet in the park this day i will have your badge and your honor besides having the jolliest lark i ve been blessed with since we licked spain promptly on time the counterfeit presentment of mounted policeman o roon single footed into the park on his chestnut steed in a uniform two men who are unlike will look alike two who somewhat resemble each other in feature and figure will appear as twin brothers so remsen trotted down the bridle paths enjoying himself hugely so few real pleasures do ten millionaires have along the driveway in the early morning spun a victoria drawn by a pair of fiery bays there was something foreign about the affair for the park is rarely used in the morning except by unimportant people who love to be healthy poor and wise in the vehicle sat an old gentleman with snowy side whiskers and a scotch plaid cap which could not be worn while driving except by a personage at his side sat the lady of remsen s heart the lady who looked like pomegranate blossoms and the gibbous moon remsen met them coming at the instant of their passing her eyes looked into his and but for the ever coward s heart of a true lover he could have sworn that she flushed a faint pink he trotted on for twenty yards and then wheeled his horse at the sound of runaway hoofs the bays had bolted remsen sent his chestnut after the victoria like a shot there was work cut out for the impersonator of policeman o roon the chestnut ranged alongside the off bay thirty seconds after the chase began rolled his eye back at remsen and said in the only manner open to policemen s horses well you duffer are you going to do your share you re not o roon but it seems to me

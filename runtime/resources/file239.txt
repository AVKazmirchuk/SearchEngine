drove colonel rockingham over the mountain and up the side of it as far as the buggy could go then we tied the horse and took our prisoner on foot up to the camp now colonel i says to him we re after the ransom me and my partner and no harm will come to you if the king of mor if your friends send up the dust in the mean time we are gentlemen the same as you and if you give us your word not to try to escape the freedom of the camp is yours i give you my word says the colonel all right says i and now it s eleven o clock and me and mr polk will proceed to inculcate the occasion with a few well timed trivialities in the way of grub thank you says the colonel i believe i could relish a slice of bacon and a plate of hominy but you won t says i emphatic not in this camp we soar in higher regions than them occupied by your celebrated but repulsive dish while the colonel read his paper me and caligula took off our coats and went in for a little luncheon de luxe just to show him caligula was a fine cook of the western brand he could toast a buffalo or fricassee a couple of steers as easy as a woman could make a cup of tea he was gifted in the way of knocking together edibles when haste and muscle and quantity was to be considered he held the record west of the arkansas river for frying pancakes with his left hand broiling venison cutlets with his right and skinning a rabbit with his teeth at the same time but i could do things en casserole and la creole and handle the oil and tobasco as gently and nicely as a french chef so at twelve o clock we had a hot lunch ready that looked like a banquet on a mississippi river steamboat we spread it on the tops of two or three big boxes opened two quarts of the red wine set the olives and a canned oyster cocktail and a ready made martini by the colonel s plate and called him to grub colonel rockingham drew up his campstool wiped off his specs and looked at the things on the table then i thought he was swearing and i felt mean because i hadn t taken more pains with the victuals but he wasn t he was asking a blessing and me and caligula hung our heads and i saw a tear drop from the colonel s eye into his cocktail i never saw a man eat with so much earnestness and application not hastily like a grammarian or one of the canal but slow and appreciative like a anaconda or a real vive bonjour in an hour and a half the colonel leaned back i brought him a pony of brandy and his black coffee and set the box of havana regalias on the table gentlemen says he blowing out the smoke and trying to breathe it back again when we view the eternal hills and the smiling and beneficent landscape and reflect upon the goodness of the creator who excuse me colonel says i but there s some business to attend to now and i brought out paper and pen and ink and laid em before him who do you want to send to for the money i asks i reckon says he after thinking a bit to the vice president of our railroad at the general offices of the company in edenville how far is it to edenville from here i asked about ten miles says he then i dictated these lines and colonel rockingham wrote them out i am kidnapped and held a prisoner by two desperate outlaws in a place which is useless to attempt to find they demand ten thousand dollars at once for my release the amount must be raised immediately and these directions followed come alone with the money to stony creek which runs out of blacktop mountains follow the bed of the creek till you come to a big flat rock on the left bank on which is marked a cross in red chalk stand on the rock and wave a white flag a guide will come to you and conduct you to where i am held lose no time after the colonel had finished this he asked permission to take on a postscript about how he was being treated so the railroad wouldn t feel uneasy in its bosom about him we agreed to that he wrote down that he had just had lunch with the two desperate ruffians and then he set down the whole bill of fare from cocktails to coffee he wound up with the remark that dinner would be ready about six and would probably be a more licentious and intemperate affair than lunch me and caligula read it and decided to let it go for we being cooks were amenable to praise though it sounded out of place on a sight draft for ten thousand dollars i took the letter over to the mountain valley road and watched for a messenger by and by a colored equestrian came along on horseback riding toward edenville i gave him a dollar to take the letter to the railroad offices and then i went back to camp iv about four o clock in the afternoon caligula who was acting as lookout calls to me i have to report a white shirt signalling on the starboard bow sir i went down the mountain and brought back a fat red man in an alpaca coat and no collar gentlemen says colonel rockingham allow me to introduce my brother captain duval c rockingham vice president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad otherwise the king of morocco says i i reckon you don t mind

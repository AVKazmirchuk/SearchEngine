and see what they want i m feeling too rocky to move keogh acclimated beyond all possibility of ill humor drew his chair to the table with smiling compliance on his rose pink countenance and began to slit open the letters four of them were from citizens in various parts of the united states who seemed to regard the consul at coralio as a cyclopedia of information they asked long lists of questions numerically arranged about the climate products possibilities laws business chances and statistics of the country in which the consul had the honor of representing his own government write em please billy said that inert official just a line referring them to the latest consular report tell em the state department will be delighted to furnish the literary gems sign my name don t let your pen scratch billy it ll keep me awake don t snore said keogh amiably and i ll do your work for you you need a corps of assistants anyhow don t see how you ever get out a report wake up a minute here s one more letter it s from your own town too dalesburg that so murmured johnny showing a mild and obligatory interest what s it about postmaster writes explained keogh says a citizen of the town wants some facts and advice from you says the citizen has an idea in his head of coming down where you are and opening a shoe store wants to know if you think the business would pay says he s heard of the boom along this coast and wants to get in on the ground floor in spite of the heat and his bad temper johnny s hammock swayed with his laughter keogh laughed too and the pet monkey on the top shelf of the bookcase chattered in shrill sympathy with the ironical reception of the letter from dalesburg great bunions exclaimed the consul shoe store what ll they ask about next i wonder overcoat factory i reckon say billy of our citizens how many do you suppose ever had on a pair of shoes keogh reflected judicially let s see there s you and me and not me said johnny promptly and incorrectly holding up a foot encased in a disreputable deerskin zapato i haven t been a victim to shoes in months but you ve got em though went on keogh and there s goodwin and blanchard and geddie and old lutz and doc gregg and that italian that s agent for the banana company and there s old delgado no he wears sandals and oh yes there s madama ortiz what kapes the hotel she had on a pair of red kid slippers at the baile the other night and miss pasa her daughter that went to school in the states she brought back some civilized notions in the way of footgear and there s the comandante s sister that dresses up her feet on feast days and mrs geddie who wears a two with a castilian instep and that s about all the ladies let s see don t some of the soldiers at the cuartel no that s so they re allowed shoes only when on the march in barracks they turn their little toeses out to grass bout right agreed the consul not over twenty out of the three thousand ever felt leather on their walking arrangements oh yes coralio is just the town for an enterprising shoe store that doesn t want to part with its goods wonder if old patterson is trying to jolly me he always was full of things he called jokes write him a letter billy i ll dictate it we ll jolly him back a few keogh dipped his pen and wrote at johnny s dictation with many pauses filled in with smoke and sundry travellings of the bottle and glasses the following reply to the dalesburg communication was perpetrated mr obadiah patterson dalesburg ala dear sir in reply to your favor of july d i have the honor to inform you that according to my opinion there is no place on the habitable globe that presents to the eye stronger evidence of the need of a first class shoe store than does the town of coralio there are inhabitants in the place and not a single shoe store the situation speaks for itself this coast is rapidly becoming the goal of enterprising business men but the shoe business is one that has been sadly overlooked or neglected in fact there are a considerable number of our citizens actually without shoes at present besides the want above mentioned there is also a crying need for a brewery a college of higher mathematics a coal yard and a clean and intellectual punch and judy show i have the honor to be your obt servant john de graffenreid atwood u s consul at coralio p s hello uncle obadiah how s the old burg racking along what would the government do without you and me look out for a green headed parrot and a bunch of bananas soon from your old friend johnny i throw in that postscript explained the consul so uncle obadiah won t take offense at the official tone of the letter now billy you get that correspondence fixed up and send pancho to the post office with it the ariadne takes the mail out tomorrow if they make up that load of fruit today the night programme in coralio never varied the recreations of the people were soporific and flat they wandered about barefoot and aimless speaking lowly and smoking cigar or cigarette looking down on the dimly lighted ways one seemed to see a threading maze of brunette ghosts tangled with a procession of insane fireflies in some houses the thrumming of lugubrious guitars added to the depression of the triste night giant tree frogs rattled in the foliage as loudly as the end man s bones

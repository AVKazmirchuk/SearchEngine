years you do not look older yourself when was it that the deceased government exerted its foreign policy in your behalf four months ago said o keefe promptly the infamous foreign power i alluded to is still staggering from the official blow dealt it by mr davis s contraband aggregation of states that s why you see me cake walking with the ex rebs to the illegitimate tune about simmon seeds and cotton i vote for the great father in washington but i am not going back on mars jeff you say the confederacy has been dead forty years well if it hadn t been for it i d have been breathing to day with soul so dead i couldn t have whispered a single cuss word about my native land the o keefes are not overburdened with ingratitude i must have looked bewildered the war was over i said vacantly in o keefe laughed loudly scattering my thoughts ask old doc millikin if the war is over he shouted hugely diverted oh no doc hasn t surrendered yet and the confederate states well i just told you they bucked officially and solidly and nationally against a foreign government four months ago and kept me from being shot old jeff s country stepped in and brought me off under its wing while roosevelt was having a gunboat repainted and waiting for the national campaign committee to look up whether i had ever scratched the ticket isn t there a story in this barney i asked no said o keefe but i ll give you the facts you know i went down to panama when this irritation about a canal began i thought i d get in on the ground floor i did and had to sleep on it and drink water with little zoos in it so of course i got the chagres fever that was in a little town called san juan on the coast after i got the fever hard enough to kill a port au prince nigger i had a relapse in the shape of doc millikin there was a doctor to attend a sick man if doc millikin had your case he made the terrors of death seem like an invitation to a donkey party he had the bedside manners of a piute medicine man and the soothing presence of a dray loaded with iron bridge girders when he laid his hand on your fevered brow you felt like cap john smith just before pocahontas went his bail well this old medical outrage floated down to my shack when i sent for him he was build like a shad and his eyebrows was black and his white whiskers trickled down from his chin like milk coming out of a sprinkling pot he had a nigger boy along carrying an old tomato can full of calomel and a saw doc felt my pulse and then he began to mess up some calomel with an agricultural implement that belonged to the trowel class i don t want any death mask made yet doc i says nor my liver put in a plaster of paris cast i m sick and it s medicine i need not frescoing you re a blame yankee ain t you asked doc going on mixing up his portland cement i m from the north says i but i m a plain man and don t care for mural decorations when you get the isthmus all asphalted over with that boll weevil prescription would you mind giving me a dose of pain killer or a little strychnine on toast to ease up this feeling of unhealthiness that i have got they was all sassy just like you says old doc but we lowered their temperature considerable yes sir i reckon we sent a good many of ye over to old mortuis nisi bonum look at antietam and bull run and seven pines and around nashville there never was a battle where we didn t lick ye unless you was ten to our one i knew you were a blame yankee the minute i laid eyes on you don t reopen the chasm doc i begs him any yankeeness i may have is geographical and as far as i am concerned a southerner is as good as a filipino any day i m feeling to bad too argue let s have secession without misrepresentation if you say so but what i need is more laudanum and less lundy s lane if you re mixing that compound gefloxide of gefloxicum for me please fill my ears with it before you get around to the battle of gettysburg for there is a subject full of talk by this time doc millikin had thrown up a line of fortifications on square pieces of paper and he says to me yank take one of these powders every two hours they won t kill you i ll be around again about sundown to see if you re alive old doc s powders knocked the chagres i stayed in san juan and got to knowing him better he was from mississippi and the red hottest southerner that ever smelled mint he made stonewall jackson and r e lee look like abolitionists he had a family somewhere down near yazoo city but he stayed away from the states on account of an uncontrollable liking he had for the absence of a yankee government him and me got as thick personally as the emperor of russia and the dove of peace but sectionally we didn t amalgamate twas a beautiful system of medical practice introduced by old doc into that isthmus of land he d take that bracket saw and the mild chloride and his hypodermic and treat anything from yellow fever to a personal friend besides his other liabilities doc could play a flute for a minute or two he was guilty of two tunes dixie and another one that was mighty close

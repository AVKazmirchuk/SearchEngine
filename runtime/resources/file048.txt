that anxious look in her eye that a woman has only when she has missed a meal or feels her skirt coming unfastened in the back it was about eleven o clock or so on the second night when we sat gloomy in our shipwrecked cabin i kept jerking my mind away from the subject of food but it kept flopping back again before i could fasten it i thought of everything good to eat i had ever heard of i went away back to my kidhood and remembered the hot biscuit sopped in sorghum and bacon gravy with partiality and respect then i trailed along up the years pausing at green apples and salt flapjacks and maple lye hominy fried chicken old virginia style corn on the cob spareribs and sweet potato pie and wound up with georgia brunswick stew which is the top notch of good things to eat because it comprises em all they say a drowning man sees a panorama of his whole life pass before him well when a man s starving he sees the ghost of every meal he ever ate set out before him and he invents new dishes that would make the fortune of a chef if somebody would collect the last words of men who starved to death they d have to sift em mighty fine to discover the sentiment but they d compile into a cook book that would sell into the millions i guess i must have had my conscience pretty well inflicted with culinary meditations for without intending to do so i says out loud to the imaginary waiter cut it thick and have it rare with the french fried and six soft scrambled on toast mame turned her head quick as a wing her eyes were sparkling and she smiled sudden medium for me she rattles out with the juliennes and three straight up draw one and brown the wheats double order to come oh jeff wouldn t it be glorious and then i d like to have a half fry and a little chicken curried with rice and a cup custard with ice cream and go easy i interrupts where s the chicken liver pie and the kidney saute on toast and the roast lamb and oh cuts in mame all excited with mint sauce and the turkey salad and stuffed olives and raspberry tarts and keep it going says i hurry up with the fried squash and the hot corn pone with sweet milk and don t forget the apple dumpling with hard sauce and the cross barred dew berry pie yes for ten minutes we kept up that kind of restaurant repartee we ranges up and down and backward and forward over the main trunk lines and the branches of the victual subject and mame leads the game for she is apprised in the ramifications of grub and the dishes she nominates aggravates my yearnings it seems that there is a feeling that mame will line up friendly again with food it seems that she looks upon the obnoxious science of eating with less contempt than before the next morning we find that the flood has subsided i geared up the bays and we splashed out through the mud some precarious until we found the road again we were only a few miles wrong and in two hours we were in oklahoma city the first thing we saw was a big restaurant sign and we piled into there in a hurry here i finds myself sitting with mame at table with knives and forks and plates between us and she not scornful but smiling with starvation and sweetness twas a new restaurant and well stocked i designated a list of quotations from the bill of fare that made the waiter look out toward the wagon to see how many more might be coming there we were and there was the order being served twas a banquet for a dozen but we felt like a dozen i looked across the table at mame and smiled for i had recollections mame was looking at the table like a boy looks at his first stem winder then she looked at me straight in the face and two big tears came in her eyes the waiter was gone after more grub jeff she says soft like i ve been a foolish girl i ve looked at things from the wrong side i never felt this way before men get hungry every day like this don t they they re big and strong and they do the hard work of the world and they don t eat just to spite silly waiter girls in restaurants do they jeff you said once that is you asked me you wanted me to well jeff if you still care i d be glad and willing to have you always sitting across the table from me now give me something to eat quick please so as i ve said a woman needs to change her point of view now and then they get tired of the same old sights the same old dinner table washtub and sewing machine give em a touch of the various a little travel and a little rest a little tomfoolery along with the tragedies of keeping house a little petting after the blowing up a little upsetting and a little jostling around and everybody in the game will have chips added to their stack by the play the caballero s way the cisco kid had killed six men in more or less fair scrimmages had murdered twice as many mostly mexicans and had winged a larger number whom he modestly forbore to count therefore a woman loved him the kid was twenty five looked twenty and a careful insurance company would have estimated the

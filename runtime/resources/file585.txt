biggest sir stood in the adytum to form the baldachin over the ark but the wings of thim sculptures was intindid for horns and the faces was the faces of goats ten thousand goats there was in and about the temple and your cher rubs was billy goats in the days of king solomon but the painters misconstrued the horns into wings and i knew tamerlane the lame timour sir very well i saw him at keghut and at zaranj he was a little man no larger than yerself with hair the colour of an amber pipe stem they buried him at samarkand i was at the wake sir oh he was a fine built man in his coffin six feet long with black whiskers to his face and i see em throw turnips at the imperor vispacian in africa all over the world i have tramped sir without the body of me findin any rest twas so commanded i saw jerusalem destroyed and pompeii go up in the fireworks and i was at the coronation of charlemagne and the lynchin of joan of arc and everywhere i go there comes storms and revolutions and plagues and fires twas so commanded ye have heard of the wandering jew tis all so except that divil a bit am i a jew but history lies as i have told ye are ye quite sure sir that ye haven t a drop of whiskey convenient ye well know that i have many miles of walking before me i have none said i and if you please i am about to leave for my supper i pushed my chair back creakingly this ancient landlubber was becoming as great an affliction as any cross bowed mariner he shook a musty effluvium from his piebald clothes overturned my inkstand and went on with his insufferable nonsense i wouldn t mind it so much he complained if it wasn t for the work i must do on good fridays ye know about pontius pilate sir of course his body whin he killed himself was pitched into a lake on the alps mountains now listen to the job that tis mine to perform on the night of ivery good friday the ould divil goes down in the pool and drags up pontius and the water is bilin and spewin like a wash pot and the ould divil sets the body on top of a throne on the rocks and thin comes me share of the job oh sir ye would pity me thin ye would pray for the poor wandering jew that niver was a jew if ye could see the horror of the thing that i must do tis i that must fetch a bowl of water and kneel down before it till it washes its hands i declare to ye that pontius pilate a man dead two hundred years dragged up with the lake slime coverin him and fishes wrigglin inside of him widout eyes and in the discomposition of the body sits there sir and washes his hands in the bowl i hold for him on good fridays twas so commanded clearly the matter had progressed far beyond the scope of the bugle s local column there might have been employment here for the alienist or for those who circulate the pledge but i had had enough of it i got up and repeated that i must go at this he seized my coat grovelled upon my desk and burst again into distressful weeping whatever it was about i said to myself that his grief was genuine come now mr ader i said soothingly what is the matter the answer came brokenly through his racking sobs because i would not let the poor christ rest upon the step his hallucination seemed beyond all reasonable answer yet the effect of it upon him scarcely merited disrespect but i knew nothing that might assuage it and i told him once more that both of us should be leaving the office at once obedient at last he raised himself from my dishevelled desk and permitted me to half lift him to the floor the gale of his grief had blown away his words his freshet of tears had soaked away the crust of his grief reminiscence died in him at least the coherent part of it twas me that did it he muttered as i led him toward the door me the shoemaker of jerusalem i got him to the sidewalk and in the augmented light i saw that his face was seared and lined and warped by a sadness almost incredibly the product of a single lifetime and then high up in the firmamental darkness we heard the clamant cries of some great passing birds my wandering jew lifted his hand with side tilted head the seven whistlers he said as one introduces well known friends wild geese said i but i confess that their number is beyond me they follow me everywhere he said twas so commanded what ye hear is the souls of the seven jews that helped with the crucifixion sometimes they re plovers and sometimes geese but ye ll find them always flyin where i go i stood uncertain how to take my leave i looked down the street shuffled my feet looked back again and felt my hair rise the old man had disappeared and then my capillaries relaxed for i dimly saw him footing it away through the darkness but he walked so swiftly and silently and contrary to the gait promised by his age that my

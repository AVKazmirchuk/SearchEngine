fled from her forever with an affinity who understands the need of my artistic soul as she never did when she reads it we will observe her actions and hear her words then we will know which theory is the correct one yours or mine oh never exclaimed the editor shaking his head that would be inexcusably cruel i could not consent to have mrs dawe s feelings played upon in such a manner brace up said the writer i guess i think as much of her as you do it s for her benefit as well as mine i ve got to get a market for my stories in some way it won t hurt louise she s healthy and sound her heart goes as strong as a ninety eight cent watch it ll last for only a minute and then i ll step out and explain to her you really owe it to me to give me the chance westbrook editor westbrook at length yielded though but half willingly and in the half of him that consented lurked the vivisectionist that is in all of us let him who has not used the scalpel rise and stand in his place pity tis that there are not enough rabbits and guinea pigs to go around the two experimenters in art left the square and hurried eastward and then to that south until they arrived in the gramercy neighborhood within its high iron railings the little park had put on its smart coat of vernal green and was admiring itself in its fountain mirror outside the railings the hollow square of crumbling houses shells of a bygone gentry leaned as if in ghostly gossip over the forgotten doings of the vanished quality sic transit gloria urbis a block or two north of the park dawe steered the editor again eastward then after covering a short distance into a lofty but narrow flathouse burdened with a floridly over decorated fa cade to the fifth story they toiled and dawe panting pushed his latch key into the door of one of the front flats when the door opened editor westbrook saw with feelings of pity how meanly and meagerly the rooms were furnished get a chair if you can find one said dawe while i hunt up pen and ink hello what s this here s a note from louise she must have left it there when she went out this morning he picked up an envelope that lay on the centre table and tore it open he began to read the letter that he drew out of it and once having begun it aloud he so read it through to the end these are the words that editor westbrook heard dear shackleford by the time you get this i will be about a hundred miles away and still a going i ve got a place in the chorus of the occidental opera co and we start on the road to day at twelve o clock i didn t want to starve to death and so i decided to make my own living i m not coming back mrs westbrook is going with me she said she was tired of living with a combination phonograph iceberg and dictionary and she s not coming back either we ve been practising the songs and dances for two months on the quiet i hope you will be successful and get along all right good bye louise dawe dropped the letter covered his face with his trembling hands and cried out in a deep vibrating voice my god why hast thou given me this cup to drink since she is false then let thy heaven s fairest gifts faith and love become the jesting by words of traitors and fiends editor westbrook s glasses fell to the floor the fingers of one hand fumbled with a button on his coat as he blurted between his pale lips say shack ain t that a hell of a note wouldn t that knock you off your perch shack ain t it hell now shack ain t it past one at rooney s only on the lower east side of new york do the houses of capulet and montagu survive there they do not fight by the book of arithmetic if you but bite your thumb at an upholder of your opposing house you have work cut out for your steel on broadway you may drag your man along a dozen blocks by his nose and he will only bawl for the watch but in the domain of the east side tybalts and mercutios you must observe the niceties of deportment to the wink of any eyelash and to an inch of elbow room at the bar when its patrons include foes of your house and kin so when eddie mcmanus known to the capulets as cork mcmanus drifted into dutch mike s for a stein of beer and came upon a bunch of montagus making merry with the suds he began to observe the strictest parliamentary rules courtesy forbade his leaving the saloon with his thirst unslaked caution steered him to a place at the bar where the mirror supplied the cognizance of the enemy s movements that his indifferent gaze seemed to disdain experience whispered to him that the finger of trouble would be busy among the chattering steins at dutch mike s that night close by his side drew brick cleary his mercutio companion of his perambulations thus they stood four of the mulberry hill gang and two fo the dry dock gang minding their p s and q s so solicitously that dutch mike kept one eye on his customers and the other on an open space beneath his bar in which it was his custom to seek safety whenever the ominous politeness of the rival associations congealed into the shapes of bullets and cold steel but we have not to do with the wars of the mulberry hills and the dry docks we must to rooney s where on the most blighted dead branch of the tree of life a little pale orchid shall bloom overstrained etiquette at last gave way it is not known who first overstepped the bounds of punctilio but the consequences were immediate buck malone of the mulberry hills with a dewey like swiftness got an eight inch gun swung round from his hurricane deck but mcmanus s simile must be the torpedo he glided in under the guns and slipped a scant three inches of knife blade between the ribs of the mulberry hill cruiser meanwhile brick cleary a devotee to strategy had skimmed across the lunch counter and thrown the switch of the electrics leaving the combat to be waged by the light of gunfire alone dutch mike crawled from his haven and ran into the street crying for the watch instead of for a shakespeare to immortalize the cimmerian shindy the cop came and found a prostrate bleeding montagu supported by three distrait and reticent followers of the house faithful to the ethics of the gangs no one knew whence the hurt came there was no capulet to be seen raus mit der interrogatories said buck malone to the officer sure i know who done it i always manages to get a bird s eye view of any guy that comes up an makes a show case for a hardware store out of me no i m not telling you his name i ll settle with um meself wow ouch easy boys yes i ll attend to his case meself i m not making any complaint at midnight mcmanus strolled around a pile of lumber near an east side dock and lingered in the vicinity of a certain water plug brick cleary drifted casually to the trysting place ten minutes later he ll maybe not croak said brick and he won t tell of course but dutch mike did he told the police he was tired of having his place shot up it s unhandy just now because tim corrigan s in europe for a week s end with kings he ll be back on the kaiser williams next friday you ll have to duck out of sight till then tim ll fix it up all right for us when he comes back this goes to explain why cork mcmanus went into rooney s one night and there looked upon the bright stranger face of romance for the first time in his precarious career until tim corrigan should return from his jaunt among kings and princes and hold up his big white finger in private offices it was unsafe for cork in any of the old haunts of his gang so he lay perdu in the high rear room of a capulet reading pink sporting sheets and cursing the slow paddle wheels of the kaiser wilhelm it was on thursday evening that cork s seclusion became intolerable to him never a hart panted for water fountain as he did for the cool touch of a drifting stein for the firm security of a foot rail in the hollow of his shoe and the quiet hearty challenges of friendship and repartee along and across the shining bars but he must avoid the district where he was known the cops were looking for him everywhere for news was scarce and the newspapers were harping again on the failure of the police to suppress the gangs if they got him before corrigan came back the big white finger could not be uplifted it would be too late then but corrigan would be home the next day so he felt sure there would be small danger in a little excursion that night among the crass pleasures that represented life to him at half past twelve mcmanus stood in a darkish cross town street looking up at the name rooney s picked out by incandescent lights against a signboard over a second story window he had heard of the place as a tough hang out with its frequenters and its locality he was unfamiliar guided by certain unerring indications common to all such resorts he ascended the stairs and entered the large room over the caf e here were some twenty or thirty tables at this time about half filled with rooney s guests waiters served drinks at one end a human pianola with drugged eyes hammered the keys with automatic and furious unprecision at merciful intervals a waiter would roar or squeak a song songs full of mr jonsons and babes and coons historical word guaranties of the genuineness of african melodies composed by red waistcoated young gentlemen natives of the cotton fields and rice swamps of west twenty eighth street for one brief moment you must admire rooney with me as he receives seats manipulates and chaffs his guests he is twenty nine he has wellington s nose dante s chin the cheek bones of an iroquois the smile of talleyrand corbett s foot work and the pose of an eleven year old east side central park queen of the may he is assisted by a lieutenant known as frank a pudgy easy chap swell dressed who goes among the tables seeing that dull care does not intrude now what is there about rooney s to inspire all this pother it is more respectable by daylight stout ladies with children and mittens and bundles and unpedigreed dogs drop up of afternoons for a stein and a chat even by gaslight the diversions are melancholy i the mouth drink and rag time and an occasional surprise when the waiter swabs the suds from under your sticky glass there is an answer transmigration the soul of sir walter raleigh has traveled from beneath his slashed doublet to a kindred home under rooney s visible plaid waistcoat rooney s is twenty years ahead of the times rooney has removed the embargo rooney has spread his cloak upon the soggy crossing of public opinion and any elizabeth who treads upon it is as much a queen as another attend to the revelation of the secret in rooney s ladies may smoke mcmanus sat down at a vacant table he paid for the glass of beer that he ordered tilted his narrow brimmed derby to the back of his brick dust head twined his feet among the rungs of his chair and heaved a sigh of contentment from the breathing spaces of his innermost soul for this mud honey was clarified sweetness to his taste the sham gaiety the hectic glow of counterfeit hospitality the self conscious joyless laughter the wine born warmth the loud music retrieving the hour from frequent whiles of awful and corroding silence the presence of well clothed and frank eyed beneficiaries of rooney s removal of the restrictions laid upon the weed the familiar blended odors of soaked lemon peel flat beer and peau d espagne all these were manna to cork mcmanus hungry for his week in the desert of the capulet s high rear room a girl alone entered rooney s glanced around with leisurely swiftness and sat opposite mcmanus at his table her eyes rested upon him for two seconds in the look with which woman reconnoitres all men whom she for the first time confronts in that space of time she will decide upon one of two things either to scream for the police or that she may marry him later on her brief inspection concluded the girl laid on the table a worn red morocco shopping bag with the inevitable top gallant sail of frayed lace handkerchief flying from a corner of it after she had ordered a small beer from the immediate waiter she took from her bag a box of cigarettes and lighted one with slightly exaggerated ease of manner then she looked again in the eyes of cork mcmanus and smiled instantly the doom of each was sealed the unqualified desire of a man to buy clothes and build fires for a woman for a whole lifetime at first sight of her is not uncommon among that humble portion of humanity that does not care for bradstreet or coats of arms or shaw s plays love at first sight has occurred a time or two in high life but as a rule the extempore mania is to be found among unsophisticated cratures such as the dove the blue tailed dingbat and the ten dollar a week clerk poets subscribers to all fiction magazines and schatchens take notice with the exchange of the mysterious magnetic current came to each of them the instant desire to lie pretend dazzle and deceive which is the worst thing about the hypocritical disorder known as love have another beer suggested cork in his circle the phrase was considered to be a card accompanied by a letter of introduction and references no thanks said the girl raising her eyebrows and choosing her conventional words carefully i merely dropped in for a slight refreshment the cigarette between her fingers seemed to require explanation my aunt is a russian lady she concluded and we often have a post perannual cigarette after dinner at home cheese it said cork whom society airs oppressed your fingers are as yellow as mine say said the girl blazing upon him with low voiced indignation what do you think i am say who do you think you are talking to what she was pretty to look at her eyes were big brown intrepid and bright uner her flat sailor hat planted jauntily on one side her crinkly tawny hair parted and was drawn back low and massy in a thick pendant knot behind the roundness of girlhood still lingered in her chin and neck but her cheeks and fingers were thinning slightly she looked upon the world with defiance suspicion and sullen wonder her smart short tan coat was soiled and expensive two inches below her black dress dropped the lowest flounce of a heliotrope silk underskirt beg your pardon said cork looking at her admiringly i didn t mean anything sure it s no harm to smoke maudy rooney s said the girl softened at once by his amends is the only place i know where a lady can smoke maybe it ain t a nice habit but aunty lets us at home and my name ain t maudy if you please it s ruby delamere that s a swell handle said cork approvingly mine s mcmanus cor er eddie mcmanus oh you can t help that laughed ruby don t apologize cork looked seriously at the big clock on rooney s wall the girl s ubiquitous eyes took in the movement i know it s late she said reaching for her bag but you know how you want a smoke when you want one ain t rooney s all right i never saw anything wrong here this is twice i ve been in i work in a bookbindery on third avenue a lot of us girls have been working overtime three nights a week they won t let you smoke there of course i just dropped in here on my way home for a puff ain t it all right in here if it ain t i won t come any more it s a little bit late for you to be out alone anywhere said cork i m not wise to this particular joint but anyhow you don t want to have your picture taken in it for a present to your sunday school teacher have one more beer and then say i take you home but i don t know you said the girl with fine scrupulosity i don t accept the company of gentlemen i ain t acquainted with my aunt never would allow that why said cork mcmanus pulling his ear i m the latest thing in suitings with side vents and bell skirt when it comes to escortin a lady you bet you ll find me all right ruby and i ll give you a tip as to who i am my governor is one of the hottest cross buns of the wall street push morgan s cab horse casts a shoe every time the old man sticks his head out the window me well i m in trainin down the street the old man s goin to put a seat on the stock exchange in my stockin my next birthday but it all sounds like a lemon to me what i like is golf and yachtin and er well say a corkin fast ten round bout between welter weights with walkin gloves i guess you can walk to the door with me said the girl hesitatingly but with a certain pleased flutter still i never heard anything extra good about wall street brokers or sport who go to prize fights either ain t you got any other recommendations i think you re the swellest looker i ve had my lamps on in little old new york said cork impressively that ll be about enough of that now ain t you the kidder she modified her chiding words by a deep long beaming smile embellished look at her cavalier we ll drink our beer before we go ha a waiter sang the tobacco smoke grew denser drifting and rising in spirals waves tilted layers cumulus clouds cataracts and suspended fogs like some fifth element created from the ribs of the ancient four laughter and chat grew louder stimulated by rooney s liquids and rooney s gallant hospitality to lady nicotine one o clock struck down stairs there was a sound of closing and locking doors frank pulled down the green shades of the front windows carefully rooney went below in the dark hall and stood at the front door his cigarette cached in the hollow of his hand thenceforth whoever might seek admittance must present a countenance familiar to rooney s hawk s eye the countenance of a true sport cork mcmanus and the bookbindery girl conversed absorbedly with their elbows on the table their glasses of beer were pushed to one side scarcely touched with the foam on them sunken to a thin white scum since the stroke of one the stale pleasures of rooney s had become renovated and spiced not by any addition to the list of distractions but because from that moment the sweets became stolen ones the flattest glass of beer acquired the tang of illegality the mildest claret punch struck a knockout blow at law and order the harmless and genial company became outlaws defying authority and rule for after the stroke of one in such places as rooney s where neither bed nor board is to be had drink may not be set before the thirsty of the city of the four million it is the law say said cork mcmanus almost covering the table with his eloquent chest and elbows was that dead straight about you workin in the bookbindery and livin at home and just happenin in here and and all that spiel you gave me sure it was answered the girl with spirit why what do you think do you suppose i d lie to you go down to the shop and ask em i handed it to you on the level on the dead level said cork that s the way i want it because because what i throw up my hands said cork you ve got me goin you re the girl i ve been lookin for will you keep company with me ruby would you like me to eddie surest thing but i wanted a straight story about about yourself you know when a fellow had a girl a steady girl she s got to be all right you know she s got to be straight goods you ll find i ll be straight goods eddie of course you will i believe what you told me but you can t blame me for wantin to find out you don t see many girls smokin cigarettes in places like rooney s after midnight that are like you the girl flushed a little and lowered her eyes i see that now she said meekly i didn t know how bad it looked but i won t do it any more and i ll go straight home every night and stay there and i ll give up cigarettes if you say so eddie i ll cut em out from this minute on cork s air became judicial proprietary condemnatory yet sympathetic a lady can smoke he decided slowly at times and places why because it s bein a lady that helps her pull it off i m going to quit there s nothing to it said the girl she flicked the stub of her cigarette to the floor at times and places repeated cork when i call round for you of evenin s we ll hunt out a dark bench in stuyvesant square and have a puff or two but no more rooney s at one o clock see eddie do you really like me the girl searchd his hard but frank features eagerly with anxious eyes on the dead level when are you coming to see me where i live thursday day after to morrow evenin that suit you fine i ll be ready for you come about seven walk to the door with me to night and i ll show you where i live don t forget now and don t you go to see any other girls before then mister i bet you will though on the dead level said cork you make em all look like rag dolls to me honest you do i know when i m suited on the dead level i do against the front door down stairs repeated heavy blows were delivered the loud crashes resounded in the room above only a trip hammer or a policeman s foot could have been the author of those sounds rooney jumped like a bullfrog to a corner of the room turned off the electric lights and hurried swiftly below the room was left utterly dark except for the winking red glow of cigars and cigarettes a second volley of crashes came up from the assaulted door a little rustling murmuring panic moved among the besieged guests frank cool smooth reassuring could be seen in the rosy glow of the burning tobacco going from table to table all keep still was his caution don t talk or make any noise everything will be all right now don t feel the slightest alarm we ll take care of you all ruby felt across the table until cork s firm hand closed upon hers are you afraid eddie she whispered are you afraid you ll get a free ride nothin doin in the teeth chatterin line said cork i guess rooney s been slow with his envelope don t you worry girly i ll look out for you all right yet mr mcmanus s ease was only skin and muscle deep with the police looking everywhere for buck malone s assailant and with corrigan still on the ocean wave he felt that to be caught in a police raid would mean an ended career for him he wished he had remained in the high rear room of the true capulet reading the pink extras rooney seemed to have opened the front door below and engaged the police in conference in the dark hall the wordless low growl of their voices came up the stairway frank made a wireless news station of himself at the upper door suddenly he closed the door hurried to the extreme rear of the room and lighted a dim gas jet this way everybody he called sharply in a hurry but no noise please the guests crowded in confusion to the rear rooney s lieutenant swung open a panel in the wall overlooking the back yard revealing a ladder already placed for the escape down and out everybody he commanded ladies first less talking please don t crowd there s no danger among the last cork and ruby waited their turn at the open panel suddenly she swept him aside and clung to his arm fiercely before we go out she whispered in his ear before anything happens tell me again eddie do you l do you really like me on the dead level said cork holding her close with one arm when it comes to you i m all in when they turned they found they were lost and in darkness the last of the fleeing customers had descended half way across the yard they bore the ladder stumbling giggling hurrying to place it against adjoining low building over the roof of which their only route to safety we may as well sit down said cork grimly maybe rooney will stand the cops off anyhow they sat at a table and their hands came together again a number of men then entered the dark room feeling their way about one of them rooney himself found the switch and turned on the electric light the other man was a cop of the old regime a big cop a thick cop a fuming abrupt cop not a pretty cop he went up to the pair at the table and sneered familiarly at the girl what are youse doin in here he asked dropped in for a smoke said cork mildly had any drinks not later than one o clock get out quick ordered the cop then sit down he countermanded he took off cork s hat roughly and scrutinized him shrewdly your name s mcmanus bad guess said cork it s peterson cork mcmanus or something like that said the cop you put a knife into a man in dutch mike s saloon a week ago aw forget it said cork who perceived a shade of doubt in the officer s tones you ve got my mug mixed with somebody else s have i well you ll come to the station with me anyhow and be looked over the description fits you all right the cop twisted his fingers under cork s collar come on he ordered roughly cork glanced at ruby she was pale and her thin nostrils quivered her quick eye danced from one man s face to the other as they spoke or moved what hard luck cork was thinking corrigan on the briny and ruby met and lost almost within an hour somebody at the police station would recognize him without a doubt hard luck but suddenly the girl sprang up and hurled herself with both arms extended against the cop his hold on cork s collar was loosened and he stumbled back two or three paces don t go so fast maguire she cried in shrill fury keep your hands off my man you know me and you know i m givin you good advice don t you touch him again he s not the guy you are lookin for i ll stand for that see here fanny said the cop red and angry i ll take you too if you don t look out how do you know this ain t the man i want what are you doing in here with him how do i know said the girl flaming red and white by turns because i ve known him a year he s mine oughtn t i to know and what am i doin here with him that s easy she stooped low and reached down somewhere into a swirl of flirted draperies heliotrope and black an elastic snapped she threw on the table toward cork a folded wad of bills the money slowly straightened itself with little leisurely jerks take that jimmy and let s go said the girl i m declarin the usual dividends maguire she said to the officer you had your usual five dollar graft at the usual corner at ten a lie said the cop turning purple you go on my beat again and i ll arrest you every time i see you no you won t said the girl and i ll tell you why witnesses saw me give you the money to night and last week too i ve been getting fixed for you cork put the wad of money carefuly into his pocket and said come on fanny let s have some chop suey before we go home clear out quick both of you or i ll the cop s bluster trailed away into inconsequentiality at the corner of the street the two halted cork handed back the money without a word the girl took it and slipped it slowly into her hand bag her expression was the same she had worn when she entered rooney s that night she looked upon the world with defiance suspicion and sullen wonder i guess i might as well say good bye here she said dully you won t want to see me again of course will you shake hands mr mcmanus i mightn t have got wise if you hadn t give the snap away said cork why did you do it you d have been pinched if i hadn t that s why ain t that reason enough then she began to cry honest eddie i was goin to be the best girl in the world i hated to be what i am i hated men i was ready almost to die when i saw you and you seemed different from everybody else and when i found you liked me too why i thought i d make you believe i was good and i was goin to be good when you asked to come to my house and see me why i d have died rather than do anything wrong after that but what s the use of talking about it i ll say good by if you will mr mcmanus cork was pulling at his ear i knifed malone said he i was the one the cop wanted oh that s all right said the girl listlessly it didn t make any difference about that that was all hot air about wall street i don t do nothin but hang out with a tough gang on the east side that was all right too repeated the girl it didn t make any difference cork straightened himself and pulled his hat down low i could get a job at o brien s he said aloud but to himself good by said the girl come on said cork taking her arm i know a place two blocks away he turned with her up the steps of a red brick house facing a little park what house is this she asked drawing back why are you going in there a street lamp shone brightly in front there was a brass nameplate at one side of the closed front doors cork drew her firmly up the steps read that said he she looked at the name on the plate and gave a cry between a moan and a scream no no no eddie oh my god no i won t let you do that not now let me go you shan t do that you can t you mus n t not after you know no no come away quick oh my god please eddie come half fainting she reeled and was caught in the bend of his arm cork s right hand felt for the electric button and pressed it long another cop how quickly they scent trouble when trouble is on the wing came along saw them and ran up the steps here what are you doing with that girl he called gruffly she ll be all right in a minute said cork it s a straight deal reverend jeremiah jones read the cop from the door plate with true detective cunning correct said cork on the dead level we re goin to get married the venturers let the story wreck itself on the spreading rails of the non sequitur limited if it will first you must take your seat in the observation car raison d tre for one moment it is for no longer than to consider a brief essay on the subject let us call it what s around the corner omne mundus in duas partes divisum est men who wear rubbers and pay poll taxes and men who discover new continents there are no more continents to discover but by the time overshoes are out of date and the poll has developed into an income tax the other half will be paralleling the canals of mars with radium railways fortune chance and adventure are given as synonymous in the dictionaries to the knowing each has a different meaning fortune is a prize to be won adventure is the road to it chance is what may lurk in the shadows at the roadside the face of fortune is radiant and alluring that of adventure is flushed and heroic the face of chance is the beautiful countenance perfect because vague and dream born that we see in our tea cups at breakfast while we growl over our chops and toast the venturer is one who keeps his eye on the hedgerows and wayside groves and meadows while he travels the road to fortune that is the difference between him and the adventurer eating the forbidden fruit was the best record ever made by a venturer trying to prove that it happened is the highest work of the adventuresome to be either is disturbing to the cosmogony of creation so as bracket sawed and city directoried citizens let us light our pipes chide the children and the cat arrange ourselves in the willow rocker under the flickering gas jet at the coolest window and scan this little tale of two modern followers of chance did you ever hear that story about the man from the west asked billinger in the little dark oak room to your left as you penetrate the interior of the powhatan club doubtless said john reginald forster rising and leaving the room forster got his straw hat straws will be in and maybe out again long before this is printed from the checkroom boy and walked out of the air as hamlet says billinger was used to having his stories insulted and would not mind forster was in his favorite mood and wanted to go away from anywhere a man in order to get on good terms with himself must have his opinions corroborated and his moods matched by some one else i had written that somebody but an a d t boy who once took a telegram for me pointed out that i could save money by using the compound word this is a vice versa case forster s favorite mood was that of greatly desiring to be a follower of chance he was a venturer by nature but convention birth tradition and the narrowing influences of the tribe of manhattan had denied him full privilege he had trodden all the main traveled thoroughfares and many of the side roads that are supposed to relieve the tedium of life but none had sufficed the reason was that he knew what was to be found at the end of every street he knew from experience and logic almost precisely to what end each digression from routine must lead he found a depressing monotony in all the variations that the music of his sphere had grafted upon the tune of life he had not learned that although the world was made round the circle has been squared and that it s true interest is to be in what s around the corner forster walked abroad aimlessly from the powhatan trying not to tax either his judgment or his desire as to what streets he traveled he would have been glad to lose his way if it were possible but he had no hope of that adventure and fortune move at your beck and call in the greater city but chance is oriental she is a veiled lady in a sedan chair protected by a special traffic squad of dragonians crosstown uptown and downtown you may move without seeing her at the end of an hour s stroll forster stood on a corner of a broad smooth avenue looking disconsolately across it at a picturesque old hotel softly but brilliantly lit disconsolately because he knew that he must dine and dining in that hotel was no venture it was one of his favorite caravansaries and so silent and swift would be the service and so delicately choice the food that he regretted the hunger that must be appeased by the dead perfection of the place s cuisine even the music there seemed to be always playing da capo fancy came to him that he would dine at some cheap even dubious restaurant lower down in the city where the erratic chefs from all countries of the world spread their national cookery for the omnivorous american something might happen there out of the routine he might come upon a subject without a predicate a road without an end a question without an answer a cause without an effect a gulf stream in life s salt ocean he had not dressed for evening he wore a dark business suit that would not be questioned even where the waiters served the spaghetti in their shirt sleeves so john reginald forster began to search his clothes for money because the more cheaply you dine the more surely must you pay all of the thirteen pockets large and small of his business suit he explored carefully and found not a penny his bank book showed a balance of five figures to his credit in the old ironsides trust company but forster became aware of a man nearby at his left hand who was really regarding him with some amusement he looked like any business man of thirty or so neatly dressed and standing in the attitude of one waiting for a street car but there was no car line on that avenue so his proximity and unconcealed curiosity seemed to forster to partake of the nature of a personal intrusion but as he was a consistent seeker after what s around the corner instead of manifesting resentment he only turned a half embarrassed smile upon the other s grin of amusement all in asked the intruder drawing nearer seems so said forster now i thought there was a dollar in oh i know said the other man with a laugh but there wasn t i ve just been through the same process myself as i was coming around the corner i found in an upper vest pocket i don t know how they got there exactly two pennies you know what kind of a dinner exactly two pennies will buy you haven t dined then asked forster i have not but i would like to now i ll make you a proposition you look like a man who would take up one your clothes look neat and respectable excuse personalities i think mine will pass the scrutiny of a head waiter also suppose we go over to that hotel and dine together we will choose from the menu like millionaires or if you prefer like gentlemen in moderate circumstances dining extravagantly for once when we have finished we will match with my two pennies to see which of us will stand the brunt of the house s displeasure and vengeance my name is ives i think we have lived in the same station of life before our money took wings you re on said forster joyfully here was a venture at least within the borders of the mysterious country of change anyhow it promised something better than the stale infestivity of a table d h ote the two were soon seated at a corner table in the hotel dining room ives chucked one of his pennies across the table to forster match for which of us gives the order he said forster lost ives laughed and began to name liquids and viands to the waiter with the absorbed but calm deliberation of one who was to the menu born forster listening gave his admiring approval of the order i am a man said ives during the oysters who has made a lifetime search after the to be continued in our next i am not like the ordinary adventurer who strikes for a coveted prize nor yet am i like a gambler who knows he is either to win or lose a certain set stake what i want is to encounter an adventure to which i can predict no conclusion it is the breath of existence to me to dare fate in its blindest manifestations the world has come to run so much by rote and gravitation that you can enter upon hardly any footpath of chance in which you do not find signboards informing you of what you may expect at its end i am like the clerk in the circumlocution office who always complained bitterly when any one came in to ask information he wanted to know you know was the kick he made to his fellow clerks well i don t want to know i don t want to reason i don t want to guess i want to bet my hand without seeing it i understand said forster delightedly i ve often wanted the way i feel put into words you ve done it i want to take chances on what s coming suppose we have a bottle of moselle with the next course agreed said ives i m glad you catch my idea it will increase the animosity of the house toward the loser if it does not weary you we will pursue the theme only a few times have i met a true venturer one who does not ask a schedule and map from fate when he begins a journey but as the world becomes more civilized and wiser the more difficult it is to come upon an adventure the end of which you cannot foresee in the elizabethan days you could assault the watch wring knockers from doors and have a jolly set to with the blades in any convenient angle of a wall and get away with it nowadays if you speak disrespectfully to a policeman all that is left to the most romantic fancy is to conjecture in what particular police station he will land you i know i know said forster nodding approval i returned to new york to day continued ives from a three years ramble around the globe things are not much better abroad than they are at home the whole world seems to be overrun by conclusions the only thing that interests me greatly is a premise i ve tried shooting big game in africa i know what an express rifle will do at so many yards and when an elephant or a rhinoceros falls to the bullet i enjoy it about as much as i did when i was kept in after school to do a sum in long division on the blackboard i know i know said forster there might be something in aeroplanes went on ives reflectively i ve tried ballooning but it seems to be merely a cut and dried affair of wind and ballast women suggested forster with a smile three months ago said ives i was pottering around in one of the bazaars in constantinople i noticed a lady veiled of course but with a pair of especially fine eyes visible who was examining some amber and pearl ornaments at one of the booths with her was an attendant a big nubian as black as coal after a while the attendant drew nearer to me by degrees and slipped a scrap of paper into my hand i looked at it when i got a chance on it was scrawled hastily in pencil the arched gate of the nghtingale garden at nine to night does that appear to you to be an interesting premise mr forster i made inquiries and learned that the nightingale garden was the property of an old turk a grand vizier or something of the sort of course i prospected for the arched gate and was there at nine the same nubian attendant opened the gate promptly on time and i went inside and sat on a bench by a perfumed fountain with the veiled lady we had quite an extended chat she was myrtle thompson a lady journalist who was writing up the turkish harems for a chicago newspaper she said she noticed the new york cut of my clothes in the bazaar and wondered if i couldn t work something into the metropolitan papers about it i see said forster i see i ve canoed through canada said ives down many rapids and over many falls but i didn t seem to get what i wanted out of it because i knew there were only two possible outcomes i would either go to the bottom or arrive at the sea level i ve played all games at cards but the mathematicians have spoiled that sport by computing the percentages i ve made acquaintances on trains i ve answered advertisements i ve rung strange door bells i ve taken every chance that presented itself but there has always been the conventional ending the logical conclusion to the premise i know repeated forster i ve felt it all but i ve had few chances to take my chance at chances is there any life so devoid of impossibilities as life in this city there seems to be a myriad of opportunities for testing the undeterminable but not one in a thousand fails to land you where you expected it to stop i wish the subways and street cars disappointed one as seldom the sun has risen said ives on the arabian nights there are no more caliphs the fisherman s vase is turned to a vacuum bottle warranted to keep any genie boiling or frozen for forty eight hours life moves by rote science has killed adventure there are no more opportunities such as columbus and the man who ate the first oyster had the only certain thing is that there is nothing uncertain well said forster my experience has been the limited one of a city man i haven t seen the world as you have but it seems that we view it with the same opinion but i tell you i am grateful for even this little venture of ours into the borders of the haphazard there may be at least one breathless moment when the bill for the dinner is presented perhaps after all the pilgrims who traveled without scrip or purse found a keener taste to life than did the knights of the round table who rode abroad with a retinue and king arthur s certified checks in the lining of their helmets and now if you ve finished your coffee suppose we match one of your insufficient coins for the impending blow of fate what have i up heads called ives heads it is said forster lifting his hand i lose we forgot to agree upon a plan for the winner to escape i suggest that when the waiter comes you make a remark about telephoning to a friend i will hold the fort and the dinner check long enough for you to get your hat and be off i thank you for an evening out of the ordinary mr ives and wish we might have others if my memory is not at fault said ives laughing the nearest police station is in macdougal street i have enjoyed the dinner too let me assure you forster crooked his finger for the waiter victor with a locomotive effort that seemed to owe more to pneumatics than to pedestrianism glided to the table and laid the card face downward by the loser s cup forster took it up and added the figures with deliberate care ives leaned back comfortably in his chair escuse me said forster but i though you were going to ring grimes about that theatre party for thursday night had you forgotten about it oh said ives settling himself more comfortably i can do that later on get me a glass of water waiter want to be in at the death do you asked forster i hope you don t object said ives pleadingly never in my life have i seen a gentleman arrested in a public restaurant for swindling it out of a dinner all right said forster calmly you are entitled to see a christian die in the arena as your pousse caf victor came with the glass of water and remained with the disengaged air of an inexorable collector forster hesitated for fifteen seconds and then took a pencil from his pocket and scribbled his name on the dinner check the waiter bowed and took it away the fact is said forster with a little embarrassed laugh i doubt whether i m what they call a game sport which means the same as a soldier of fortune i ll have to make a confession i ve been dining at this hotel two or three times a week for more than a year i always sign my checks and then with a note of appreciation in his voice it was first rate of you to stay to see me through with it when you knew i had no money and that you might be scooped in too i guess i ll confess too said ives with a grin i own the hotel i don t run it of course but i always keep a suite on the third floor for my use when i happen to stray into town he called a waiter and said i s mr gilmore still behind the desk all right tell him that mr ives is here and ask him to have my rooms made ready and aired another venture cut short by the inevitable said forster is there a conundrum without an answer in the next number but let s hold to our subject just for a minute or two if you will it isn t often that i meet a man who understands the flaws i pick in existence i am engaged to be married a month from to day i reserve comment said ives right i am going to add to the assertion i am devotedly fond of the lady but i can t decide whether to show up at the church or make a sneak for alaska it s the same idea you know that we were discussing it does for a fellow as far as possibilities are concerned everybody knows the routine you get a kiss flavored with ceylon tea after breakfast you go to the office you come back home and dress for dinner theatre twice a week bills moping around most evenings trying to make conversation a little quarrel occasionally maybe sometimes a big one and a separation or else a settling down into a middle aged contentment which is worst of all i know said ives nodding wisely it s the dead certainty of the thing went on forster that keeps me in doubt there ll nevermore be anything around the corner nothing after the little church said ives i know understand said forster that i am in no doubt as to my feelings toward the lady i may say that i love her truly and deeply but there is something in the current that runs through my veins that cries out against any form of the calculable i do not know what i want but i know that i want it i m talking like an idiot i suppose but i m sure of what i mean i understand you said ives with a slow smile well i think i will be going up to my rooms now if you would dine with me here one evening soon mr forster i d be glad thursday suggested forster at seven if it s convenient answered ives seven goes assented forster at halft past eight ives got into a cab and was driven to a number in one of the correct west seventies his card admitted him to the reception room of an old fashioned house into which the spirits of fortune chance and adventure had never dared to enter on the walls were the whistler etchings the steel engravings by oh what s his name the still life paintings of the grapes and garden truck with the watermelon seeds spilled on the table as natural as life and the greuze head it was a household there was even brass andirons on a table was an album half morocco with oxidized silver protections on the corners of the lids a clock on the mantel ticked loudly with a warning click at five minutes to nine ives looked at it curiously remembering a time piece in his grandmother s home that gave such a warning and then down the stairs and into the room came mary marsden she was twenty four and i leave her to your imagination but i must say this much youth and health and simplicity and courage and greenish violet eyes are beautiful and she had all these she gave ives her hand with the sweet cordiality of an old friendship you can t think what a pleasure it is she said to have you drop in once every three years or so for half an hour they talked i confess that i cannot repeat the conversation you will find it in books in the circulating library when that part of it was over mary said and did you find what you wanted while you were abroad what i wanted said ives yes you know you were always queer even as a boy you wouldn t play marbles or baseball or any game with rules you wanted to dive in water where you didn t know whether it was ten inches or ten feet deep and when you grew up you were just the same we ve often talked about your peculiar ways i suppose i am an incorrigible said ives i am opposed to the doctrine of predestination to the rule of three gravitation taxation and everything of the kind life has always seemed to me something like a serial story would be if they printed above each instalment a synopsis of succeeding chapters mary laughed merrily bob ames told us once she said of a funny thing you did it was when you and he were on a train in the south and you got off at a town where you hadn t intended to stop just because the brakeman hung up a sign in the end of the car with the name of the next station on it i remember said ives that next station has been the thing i ve always tried to get away from i know it said mary and you ve been very foolish i hope you didn t find what you wanted not to find or get off at the station where there wasn t any or whatever it was you expected wouldn t happen to you during the three years you ve been away there was something i wanted before i went away said ives mary looked in his eyes clearly with a slight but perfectly sweet smile there was she said you wanted me and you could have had me as you very well know without replying ives let his gaze wander slowly about the room there had been no change in it since last he had been in it three years before he vividly recalled the thoughts that had been in his mind then the contents of that room were as fixed in their way as the everlasting hills no change would ever come there except the inevitable ones wrought by time and decay that silver mounted album would occupy that corner of that table those pictures would hang on the walls those chairs be found in their same places every morn and noon and night while the household hung together the brass andirons were monuments to order and stability herre and there were relics of a hundred years ago which were still living mementos and would be for many years to come one going from and coming back to that house would never need to forecast or doubt he would find what he left and leave what he found the veiled lady chance would never lift her hand to the knocker on the outer door and before him sat the lady who belonged in the room cool and sweet and unchangeable she was she offered no surprises if one should pass his life with her though she might grow white haired and wrinkled he would never perceive the change three years he had been away from her and she was still waiting for him as established and constant as the house itself he was sure that she had once cared for him it was the knowledge that she would always do so that had driven him away thus his thoughts ran i am going to be married soon said mary on the next thursday afternoon forster came hurriedly to ive s hotel old man said he we ll have to put that dinner off for

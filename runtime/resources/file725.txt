the filth and scandal that you make your living by good by old boy sorry i haven t time to call on you i d feel perfectly safe in your sanctum asinorum tra la he s as mad as a cat that s lost a mouse said kernan hanging up the receiver and coming out and now barney my boy we ll go to a show and enjoy ourselves until a reasonable bedtime four hours sleep for me and then the west bound the two dined

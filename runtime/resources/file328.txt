me out of that hotel bonton at nine the next morning we went to a rooming house on the lower west side she rented one room that had water on the floor below and light on the floor above after we got moved all you could see in the room was about worth of new swell dresses and a one burner gas stove aunt maggie had had a sudden attack of the hedges i guess everybody has got to go on a spree once in their life a man spends his on highballs and a woman gets woozy on clothes but with forty million dollars say i d like to have a picture of but speaking of pictures did you ever run across a newspaper artist named lathrop a tall oh i asked you that before didn t i he was mighty nice to me at the dinner his voice just suited me i guess he must have thought i was to inherit some of aunt maggie s money well mr man three days of that light housekeeping was plenty for me aunt maggie was affectionate as ever she d hardly let me get out of her sight but let me tell you she was a hedger from hedgersville hedger county seventy five cents a day was the limit she set we cooked our own meals in the room there i was with a thousand dollars worth of the latest things in clothes doing stunts over a one burner gas stove as i say on the third day i flew the coop i couldn t stand for throwing together a fifteen cent kidney stew while wearing at the same time a house dress with valenciennes lace insertion so i goes into the closet and puts on the cheapest dress mrs brown had bought for me it s the one i ve got on now not so bad for is it i d left all my own clothes in my sister s flat in brooklyn mrs brown formerly aunt maggie says i to her i m going to extend my feet alternately one after the other in such a manner and direction that this tenement will recede from me in the quickest possible time i am no worshipper of money says i but there are some things i can t stand i can stand the fabulous monster that i ve read about that blows hot birds and cold bottles with the same breath but i can t stand a quitter says i they say you ve got forty million dollars well you ll never have any less and i was beginning to like you too says i well the late aunt maggie kicks till the tears flow she offers to move into a swell room with a two burner stove and running water i ve spent an awful lot of money child says she we ll have to economize for a while you re the most beautiful creature i ever laid eyes on she says and i don t want you to leave me well you see me don t you i walked straight to the acropolis and asked for my job back and i got it how did you say your writings were getting along i know you ve lost out some by not having me to type em do you ever have em illustrated and by the way did you ever happen to know a newspaper artist oh shut up i know i asked you before i wonder what paper he works on it s funny but i couldn t help thinking that he wasn t thinking about the money he might have been thinking i was thinking i d get from old maggie brown if i only knew some of the newspaper editors i d the sound of an easy footstep came from the doorway ida bates saw who it was with her back hair comb i saw her turn pink perfect statue that she was a miracle that i share with pygmalion only am i excusable she said to me adorable petitioner that she became it s it s mr lathrop i wonder if it really wasn t the money i wonder if after all he of course i was invited to the wedding after the ceremony i dragged lathrop aside you are an artist said i and haven t figured out why maggie brown conceived such a strong liking for miss bates that was let me show you the bride wore a simple white dress as beautifully draped as the costumes of the ancient greeks i took some leaves from one of the decorative wreaths in the little parlour and made a chaplet of them and placed them on nee bates shining chestnut hair and made her turn her profile to her husband by jingo said he isn t ida a dead ringer for the lady s head on the silver dollar next to reading matter he compelled my interest as he stepped from the ferry at desbrosses street he had the air of being familiar with hemispheres and worlds and of entering new york as the lord of a demesne who revisited it in after years of absence but i thought that with all his air he had never before set foot on the slippery cobblestones of the city of too many caliphs he wore loose clothes of a strange bluish drab colour and a conservative round panama hat without the cock a loop indentations and cants with which northern fanciers disfigure the tropic head gear moreover he was the homeliest man i have ever seen his ugliness was less repellent than startling arising from a sort of lincolnian ruggedness and irregularity of feature that spellbound you with wonder and dismay so may have looked afrites or the shapes metamorphosed from the vapour of the fisherman s vase as he afterward told me his name was judson tate and he may as well be called

reflectively at the neat toe of one of her dull kid pumps i had a proposal made to me she said if the proposal sticks it cuts out the proposition let s have that settled first well as far as began blue tie excuse me cousin interrupted black tie if you don t mind my cutting in and then he turned with a good natured air toward the lady now let s recapitulate a bit he said cheerfully all three of us besides other mutual acquaintances have been out on a good many larks together i m afraid i ll have to call the birds by another name said miss de ormond all right responded black tie with unimpaired cheerfulness suppose we say squabs when we talk about the proposal and larks when we discuss the proposition you have a quick mind miss de ormond two months ago some half dozen of us went in a motor car for day s run into the country we stopped at a road house for dinner my cousin proposed marriage to you then and there he was influenced to do so of course by the beauty and charm which no one can deny that you possess i wish i had you for a press agent mr carteret said the beauty with a dazzling smile you are on the stage miss de ormond went on black tie you have had doubtless many admirers and perhaps other proposals you must remember too that we were a party of merrymakers on that occasion there were a good many corks pulled that the proposal of marriage was made to you by my cousin we cannot deny but hasn t it been your experience that by common consent such things lose their seriousness when viewed in the next day s sunlight isn t there something of a code among good sports i use the word in its best sense that wipes out each day the follies of the evening previous oh yes said miss de ormond i know that very well and i ve always played up to it but as you seem to be conducting the case with the silent consent of the defendant i ll tell you something more i ve got letters from him repeating the proposal and they re signed too i understand said black tie gravely what s your price for the letters i m not a cheap one said miss de ormond but i had decided to make you a rate you both belong to a swell family well if i am on the stage nobody can say a word against me truthfully and the money is only a secondary consideration it isn t the money i was after i i believed him and and i liked him she cast a soft entrancing glance at blue tie from under her long eyelashes and the price went on black tie inexorably ten thousand dollars said the lady sweetly or or the fulfillment of the engagement to marry i think it is time interrupted blue tie for me to be allowed to say a word or two you and i cousin belong to a family that has held its head pretty high you have been brought up in a section of the country very different from the one where our branch of the family lived yet both of us are carterets even if some of our ways and theories differ you remember it is a tradition of the family that no carteret ever failed in chivalry to a lady or failed to keep his word when it was given then blue tie with frank decision showing on his countenance turned to miss de ormond olivia said he on what date will you marry me before she could answer black tie again interposed it is a long journey said he from plymouth rock to norfolk bay between the two points we find the changes that nearly three centuries have brought in that time the old order has changed we no longer burn witches or torture slaves and to day we neither spread our cloaks on the mud for ladies to walk over nor treat them to the ducking stool it is the age of common sense adjustment and proportion all of us ladies gentlemen women men northerners southerners lords caitiffs actors hardware drummers senators hodcarriers and politicians are coming to a better understanding chivalry is one of our words that changes its meaning every day family pride is a thing of many constructions it may show itself by maintaining a moth eaten arrogance in cobwebbed colonial mansion or by the prompt paying of one s debts now i suppose you ve had enough of my monologue i ve learned something of business and a little of life and i somehow believe cousin that our great great grandfathers the original carterets would indorse my view of this matter black tie wheeled around to his desk wrote in a check book and tore out the check the sharp rasp of the perforated leaf making the only sound in the room he laid the check within easy reach of miss de ormond s hand business is business said he we live in a business age there is my personal check for what do you say miss de ormond will it he orange blossoms or cash miss de ormond picked up the cheek carelessly folded it indifferently and stuffed it into her glove oh this do she said calmly i just thought i d call and put it up to you i guess you people are all right but a girl has feelings you know i ve heard one of you was a southerner i wonder which one of you it is she arose smiled sweetly and walked to the door there with a flash of white teeth and a dip of the heavy plume she disappeared both of the cousins had forgotten uncle jake for the time but

years old tiger reached over the hand of a champion and swept the small mcquirk from his chair i feel fine said he beyond a touch of the i don t know wbat you call its i feel like there was going to be earthquakes or music or a trifle of chills and fever or maybe a picnic i don t know how i feel i feel like knocking the face off a policeman or else maybe like playing coney island straight across the board from pop corn to the elephant boudabs it s the spring in yer bones said mrs mcquirk it s the sap risin time was when i couldn t keep me feet still nor me head cool when the earthworms began to crawl out in the dew of the mornin tis a bit of tea will do ye good made from pipsissewa and gentian bark at the druggist s back up said mr mcquirk impatiently there s no spring in sight there s snow yet on the shed in donovan s backyard and yesterday they puts open cars on the sixth avenue lines and the janitors have quit ordering coal and that means six weeks more of winter by all the signs that be after breakfast mr mcquirk spent fifteen minutes before the corrugated mirror subjugating his hair and arranging his green and purple ascot with its amethyst tombstone pin eloquent of his chosen calling since the strike had been called it was this par ticular striker s habit to hie himself each morning to the corner saloon of flaherty brothers and there establish himself upon the sidewalk with one foot resting on the bootblack s stand observing the panorama of the street until the pace of time brought twelve o clock and the dinner hour and mr tiger mcquirk with his athletic seventy inches well trained in sport and battle his smooth pale solid amiable face blue where the razor had trav elled his carefully considered clothes and air of capa bility was himself a spectacle not displeasing to the eye but on this morning mr mcquirk did not hasten immediately to his post of leisure and observation something unusual that he could not quite grasp was in the air something disturbed his thoughts ruffled his senses made him at once languid irritable elated dissastisfied and sportive he was no diagnostician and he did not know that lent was breaking up physiologically in his system mrs mcquirk had spoken of spring sceptically tiger looked about him for signs few they were the organ grinders were at work but they were always precocious harbingers it was near enough spring for them to go penny hunting when the skating ball dropped at the park in the milliners windows easter hats grave gay and jubilant blos somed there were green patches among the side walk debris of the grocers on a third story window sill the first elbow cushion of the season old gold stripes on a crimson ground supported the kimo noed arms of a pensive brunette the wind blew cold from the east river but the sparrows were fly ing to the eaves with straws a second hand store combining foresight with faith had set out an ice chest and baseball goods and then tiger s eye discrediting these signs fell upon one that bore a bud of promise from a bright new lithograph the head of capricornus con fronted him betokening the forward and heady brew mr mcquirk entered the saloon and called for his glass of bock he threw his nickel on the bar raised the glass set it down without tasting it and strolled toward the door wot s the matter lord bolinbroke inquired the sarcastic bartender want a chiny vase or a gold lined epergne to drink it out of hey say said mr mcquirk wheeling and shooting out a horizontal hand and a forty five degree chin you know your place only when it comes for givin titles i ve changed me mind about drinkin see you got your money ain t you wait till you get stung before you get the droop to your lip will you thus mr quirk added mutability of desires to the strange humors that had taken possession of him leaving the saloon he walked away twenty steps and leaned in the open doorway of lutz the barber he and lutz were friends masking their sentiments behind abuse and bludgeons of repartee irish loafer roared lutz how do you do so not yet haf der bolicemans or der catcher of dogs done deir duty hello dutch said mr mcquirk can t get your mind off of frankfurters can you bah exclaimed the german coming and lean ing in the door i haf a soul above frankfurters to day dere is springtime in der air i can feel it coming in ofer der mud of der streets and das ice in der river soon will dere be bienics in der islands mit kegs of beer under der trees say said mr mcquirk setting his bat on one side is everybody kiddin me about gentle spring there ain

cold und in der city we haf not many of der signs but dere are dree kinds of beoble dot should always feel der approach of spring first dey are boets lovers and poor vidows mr mcquirk went on his way still possessed by the strange perturbation that he did not understand something was lacking to his comfort and it made him half angry

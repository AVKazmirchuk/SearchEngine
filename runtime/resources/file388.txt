night the compania are lying drunk with mescal they have brought back sacks of silver dollars from a ride and they drink to celebrate in the night you file the chain in two and go down the mountain you walk for miles hundreds of them by and by the mountains are all gone and you come to the prairies they do not dance at night they are merciful and you sleep then you come to the river and it says things to you you follow it down down but you can t find what you are looking for mr jack leaned back in his chair and his eyes slowly closed the food and wine had steeped him in a deep calm the tense strain had been smoothed from his face the languor of repletion was claiming him drowsily he spoke again it s bad manners i know to go to sleep at table but that was such a good dinner grande old fellow grande the owner of the name started and set down his glass how should this wretched tatterdemalion whom he had invited caliph like to sit at his feet know his name not at first but soon little by little the suspicion wild and unreasonable as it was stole into his brain he drew out his watch with hands that almost balked him by their trembling and opened the back case there was a picture there a photograph fixed to the inner side rising grandemont shook mr jack by the shoulder the weary guest opened his eyes grandemont held the watch look at this picture mr jack have you ever my sister adele the vagrant s voice rang loud and sudden through the room he started to his feet but grandemont s arms were about him and grandemont was calling him victor victor fauquier merci merci mon dieu too far overcome by sleep and fatigue was the lost one to talk that night days afterward when the tropic calentura had cooled in his veins the disordered fragments he had spoken were completed in

not and keeping apart two loving hearts what a thing is love you may say and if i grant it you shall say with me what a thing is pride on a couch in the reception chamber victor lay with a dawning

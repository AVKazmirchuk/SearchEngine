not always mean what it sounded like mr william was a milder man correct in deportment and absorbed in business the weymouths formed the family of weymouthville and were looked up to as was their right of heritage uncle bushrod was the bank s trusted porter messenger vassal and guardian he carried a key to the vault just as mr robert and mr williams did sometimes there was ten fifteen or twenty thousand dollars in sacked silver stacked on the vault floor it was safe with uncle bushrod he was a weymouth in heart honesty and pride of late uncle bushrod had not been without worry it was on account of marse robert for nearly a year mr robert had been known to indulge in too much drink not enough understand to become tipsy but the habit was getting a hold upon him and every one was beginning to notice it half a dozen times a day he would leave the bank and step around to the merchants and planters hotel to take a drink mr roberts usual keen judgment and business capacity became a little impaired mr william a weymouth but not so rich in experience tried to dam the inevitable backflow of the tide but with incomplete success the deposits in the weymouth bank dropped from six figures to five past due paper began to accumulate owing to injudicious loans no one cared to address mr robert on the subject of temperance many of his friends said that the cause of it had been the death of his wife some two years before others hesitated on account of mr robert s quick temper which was extremely apt to resent personal interference of such a nature miss letty and the children noticed the change and grieved about it uncle bushrod also worried but he was one of those who would not have dared to remonstrate although he and marse robert had been raised almost as companions but there was a heavier shock coming to uncle bushrod than that caused by the bank president s toddies and juleps mr robert had a passion for fishing which he usually indulged whenever the season and business permitted one day when reports had been coming in relating to the bass and perch he announced his intention of making a two or three days visit to the lakes he was going down he said to reedy lake with judge archinard an old friend now uncle bushrod was treasurer of the sons and daughters of the burning bush every association he belonged to made him treasurer without hesitation he stood aa in coloured circles he was understood among them to be mr bushrod weymouth of the weymouth bank the night following the day on which mr robert mentioned his intended fishing trip the old man woke up and rose from his bed at twelve o clock declaring he must go down to the bank and fetch the pass book of the sons and daughters which he had forgotten to bring home the bookkeeper had balanced it for him that day put the cancelled checks in it and snapped two elastic bands around it he put but one band around other pass books aunt malindy objected to the mission at so late an hour denouncing it as foolish and unnecessary but uncle bushrod was not to be deflected from duty i done told sister adaline hoskins he said to come by here for dat book to morrer mawnin at sebin o clock for to kyar it to de meetin of de bo d of rangements and dat book gwine to be here when she come so uncle bushrod put on his old brown suit got his thick hickory stick and meandered through the almost deserted streets of weymouthville he entered the bank unlocking the side door and found the pass book where he had left it in the little back room used for consultations where he always hung his coat looking about casually he saw that everything was as he had left it and was about to start for home when he was brought to a standstill by the sudden rattle of a key in the front door some one came quickly in closed the door softly and entered the counting room through the door in the iron railing that division of the bank s space was connected with the back room by a narrow passageway now in deep darkness uncle bushrod firmly gripping his hickory stick tiptoed gently up this passage until he could see the midnight intruder into the sacred precincts of the weymouth bank one dim gas jet burned there but even in its nebulous light he perceived at once that the prowler was the bank s president wondering fearful undecided what to do the old coloured man stood motionless in the gloomy strip of hallway and waited developments the vault with its big iron door was opposite him inside that was the safe holding the papers of value the gold and currency of the bank on the floor of the vault was perhaps eighteen thousand dollars in silver the president took his key from his pocket opened the vault and went inside nearly closing the door behind him uncle bushrod saw through the narrow aperture the flicker of a candle in a minute or two it seemed an hour to the watcher mr robert came out bringing with him a large hand satchel handling it in a careful but hurried manner as if fearful that he might be observed with one hand he closed and locked the vault door with a reluctant theory forming itself beneath his wool uncle bushrod waited and watched shaking in his concealing shadow mr robert set the satchel softly upon a desk and turned his coat collar up about his neck and ears he was dressed in a rough suit of gray as if for travelling he glanced with frowning intentness at the big office clock above

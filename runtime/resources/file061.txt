a few waltzes and jigs with somebody about your size sitting on the piano stool and rounding up the notes oh hush about that says marilla and go on in the house dad hasn t rode out to day he s not feeling well old cal was inside lying on a cot he had a pretty bad cold and cough i stayed to supper going to get marilla a piano i hear says i to him why yes something of the kind rush says he she s been hankering for music for a long spell and i allow to fix her up with something in that line right away the sheep sheared six pounds all round this fall and i m going to get marilla an instrument if it takes the price of the whole clip to do it star wayno says i the little girl deserves it i m going to san antone on the last load of wool says uncle cal and select an instrument for her myself wouldn t it be better i suggests to take marilla along and let her pick out one that she likes i might have known that would set uncle cal going of course a man like him that knew everything about everything would look at that as a reflection on his attainments no sir it wouldn t says he pulling at his white whiskers there ain t a better judge of musical instruments in the whole world than what i am i had an uncle says he that was a partner in a piano factory and i ve seen thousands of em put together i know all about musical instruments from a pipe organ to a corn stalk fiddle there ain t a man lives sir that can tell me any news about any instrument that has to be pounded blowed scraped grinded picked or wound with a key you get me what you like dad says marilla who couldn t keep her feet on the floor from joy of course you know what to select i d just as lief it was a piano or a organ or what i see in st louis once what they call a orchestrion says uncle cal that i judged was about the finest thing in the way of music ever invented but there ain t room in this house for one anyway i imagine they d cost a thousand dollars i reckon something in the piano line would suit marilla the best she took lessons in that respect for two years over at birdstail i wouldn t trust the buying of an instrument to anybody else but myself i reckon if i hadn t took up sheep raising i d have been one of the finest composers or piano and organ manufacturers in the world that was uncle cal s style but i never lost any patience with him on account of his thinking so much of marilla and she thought just as much of him he sent her to the academy over at birdstail for two years when it took nearly every pound of wool to pay the expenses along about tuesday uncle cal put out for san antone on the last wagonload of wool marilla s uncle ben who lived in birdstail come over and stayed at the ranch while uncle cal was gone it was ninety miles to san antone and forty to the nearest railroad station so uncle cal was gone about four days i was over at the double elm when he came rolling back one evening about sundown and up there in the wagon sure enough was a piano or a organ we couldn t tell which all wrapped up in woolsacks with a wagon sheet tied over it in case of rain and out skips marilla hollering oh oh with her eyes shining and her hair a flying dad dad she sings out have you brought it have you brought it and it right there before her eyes as women will do finest piano in san antone says uncle cal waving his hand proud genuine rosewood and the finest loudest tone you ever listened to i heard the storekeeper play it and i took it on the spot and paid cash down me and ben and uncle cal and a mexican lifted it out of the wagon and carried it in the house and set it in a corner it was one of them upright instruments and not very heavy or very big and then all of a sudden uncle cal flops over and says he s mighty sick he s got a high fever and he complains of his lungs he gets into bed while me and ben goes out to unhitch and put the horses in the pasture and marilla flies around to get uncle cal something hot to drink but first she puts both arms on that piano and hugs it with a soft kind of a smile like you see kids doing with their christmas toys when i came in from the pasture marilla was in the room where the piano was i could see by the strings and woolsacks on the floor that she had had it unwrapped but now she was tying the wagon sheet over it again and there was a kind of solemn whitish look on her face ain t wrapping up the music again are you marilla i asks what s the matter with just a couple of tunes for to see how she goes under the saddle not to night rush says she i don t want to play any to night dad s too sick just think rush he paid three hundred dollars for it nearly a third of what the wool clip brought well it ain t anyways in the neighbourhood of a third of what you are worth i told her and i don t think uncle cal is too sick to hear

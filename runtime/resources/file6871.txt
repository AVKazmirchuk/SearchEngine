to be the suitable sort for me besides i ain t a marrying man by all means all right said i i ll do the best i can in the case so i bought a new outfit of clothes and a book on etiquette and made a dead set for mrs de clinton she was a fine looking woman cheerful and gay at first i almost had to hobble her to keep her from loping around at george s heels but finally i got her so she seemed glad to go riding with me and sailing on the lake and she seemed real hurt on the mornings when i forgot to send her a bunch of flowers still i didn t like the way she looked at george sometimes out of the corner of her eye george was having a fine time now going with the whole bunch just as he pleased yes m continued bell she certainly was a fine looking woman at that time she s changed some since as you might have noticed at the supper table what i exclaimed i married mrs de clinton went on bell one evening while we were up at the lake when i told george about it he opened his mouth and i thought be was going to break our traditions and say something grateful but he swallowed it back all right says he playing with his dog i hope you won t have too much trouble myself i m not never going to marry that was three years ago said bell we came here to live for a year we got along medium fine and then everything changed for two years i ve been having something that rhymes first class with my name you heard the row upstairs this evening that was a merry welcome compared to the usual average she s tired of me and of this little town life and she rages all day like a panther in a cage i stood it until two weeks ago and then i had to send out the call i located george in sacramento he started the day he got my wire mrs bell came out of the house swiftly toward us some strong excitement or anxiety seemed to possess her but she smiled a faint hostess smile and tried to keep her voice calm the dew is falling she said and it s growing rather late wouldn t you gentlemen rather come into the house bell took some cigars from his pocket and answered it s most too fine a night to turn in yet i think mr ames and i will walk out along the road a mile or so and have another smoke i want to talk with him about some goods that i want to buy up the road or down the road asked mrs bell down said bell i thought she breathed a sigh of relief when we had gone a hundred yards and the house became concealed by trees bell guided me into the thick grove that lined the road and back through them toward the house again we stopped within twenty yards of the house concealed by the dark shadows i wondered at this maneuver and then i heard in the distance coming down the road beyond the house the regular hoofbeats of a team of horses bell held his watch in a ray of moonlight on time within a minute he said that s george s way the team slowed up as it drew near the house and stopped in a patch of black shadows we saw the figure of a woman carrying a heavy valise move swiftly from the other side of the house and hurry to the waiting vehicle then it rolled away briskly in the direction from which it had come i looked at bell inquiringly i suppose i certainly asked him no question she s running away with george said bell simply he s kept me posted about the progress of the scheme all along she ll get a divorce in six months and then george will marry her he never helps anybody halfway it s all arranged between them i began to wonder what friendship was after all when we went into the house bell began to talk easily on other subjects and i took his cue by and by the big chance to buy out the business in mountain city came back to my mind and i began to urge it upon him now that he was free it would be easier for him to make the move and he was sure of a splendid bargain bell was silent for some minutes but when i looked at him i fancied that he was thinking of something else that he was not considering the project why no mr ames he said after a while i can t make that deal i m awful thankful to you though for telling me about it but i ve got to stay here i can t go to mountain city why i asked missis bell he replied won t live in mountain city she hates the place and wouldn t go there i ve got to keep right on here in saltillo mrs bell i exclaimed too puzzled to conjecture what he meant i ought to explain said bell i know george and i know mrs bell he s impatient in his ways he can t stand things that fret him long like i can six months i give them six months of married life and there ll be another disunion mrs bell will come back to me there s no other place for her to go i ve got to stay here and wait at the end of six months i ll have to grab a satchel and catch the first train for george will be sending out the call a dinner at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the story referred to in this skit appears in the trimmed lamp under the same title the badge of policeman o roon the adventures of an author with his own hero all that day in fact from the moment of his creation van sweller had conducted himself fairly well in my eyes of course i had had to make many concessions but in return he had been no less considerate once or twice we had had sharp brief contentions over certain points of behavior but prevailingly give and take had been our rule his morning toilet provoked our first tilt van sweller went about it confidently the usual thing i suppose old chap he said with a smile and a yawn i ring for a b and s and then i have my tub i splash a good deal in the water of course you are aware that there are two ways in which i can receive tommy carmichael when he looks in to have a chat about polo i can talk to him through the bathroom door or i can be picking at a grilled bone which my man has brought in which would you prefer i smiled with diabolic satisfaction at his coming discomfiture neither i said you will make your appearance on the scene when a gentleman should after you are fully dressed which indubitably private function shall take place behind closed doors and i will feel indebted to you if after you do appear your deportment and manners are such that it will not be necessary to inform the public in order to appease its apprehension that you have taken a bath van sweller slightly elevated his brows oh very well he said a trifle piqued i rather imagine it concerns you more than it does me cut the tub by all means if you think best but it has been the usual thing you know this was my victory but after van sweller emerged from his apartments in the beaujolie i was vanquished in a dozen small but well contested skirmishes i allowed him a cigar but routed him on the question of naming its brand but he worsted me when i objected to giving him a coat unmistakably english in its cut i allowed him to stroll down broadway and even permitted passers by god knows there s nowhere to pass but by to turn their heads and gaze with evident admiration at his erect figure i demeaned myself and as a barber gave him a smooth dark face with its keen frank eye and firm jaw later on he looked in at the club and saw freddy vavasour polo team captain dawdling over grilled bone no dear old boy began van sweller but in an instant i had seized him by the collar and dragged him aside with the scantiest courtesy for heaven s sake talk like a man i said sternly do you think it is manly to use those mushy and inane forms of address that man is neither dear nor old nor a boy to my surprise van sweller turned upon me a look of frank pleasure i am glad to hear you say that he said heartily i used those words because i have been forced to say them so often they really are contemptible thanks for correcting me dear old boy still i must admit that van sweller s conduct in the park that morning was almost without flaw the courage the dash the modesty the skill and fidelity that he displayed atoned for everything this is the way the story runs van sweller has been a gentleman member of the rugged riders the company that made a war with a foreign country famous among his comrades was lawrence o roon a man whom van sweller liked a strange thing and a hazardous one in fiction was that van sweller and o roon resembled each other mightily in face form and general appearance after the war van sweller pulled wires and o roon was made a mounted policeman now one night in new york there are commemorations and libations by old comrades and in the morning mounted policeman o roon unused to potent liquids another premise hazardous in fiction finds the earth bucking and bounding like a bronco with no stirrup into which he may insert foot and save his honor and his badge noblesse oblige surely so out along the driveways and bridle paths trots hudson van sweller in the uniform of his incapacitated comrade as like unto him as one french pea is unto a petit pois it is of course jolly larks for van sweller who has wealth and social position enough for him to masquerade safely even as a police commissioner doing his duty if he wished to do so but society not given to scanning the countenances of mounted policemen sees nothing unusual in the officer on the beat and then comes the runaway that is a fine scene the swaying victoria the impetuous daft horses plunging through the line of scattering vehicles the driver stupidly holding his broken reins and the ivory white face of amy ffolliott as she clings desperately with each slender hand fear has come and gone it has left her expression pensive and just a little pleading for life is not so bitter and then the clatter and swoop of mounted policeman van sweller oh it was but the story has not yet been printed when it is you shall learn bow he sent his bay like a bullet after the imperilled victoria a crichton a croesus and a centaur in one he hurls the invincible combination into the chase when the story is printed you will admire the breathless scene where van sweller checks the headlong team and then he looks into amy ffolliott s eyes and sees two things the possibilities of a happiness he has long sought and a nascent promise of it he is unknown to her but he stands in her sight illuminated by the hero s potent glory she his and he hers by all the golden fond unreasonable laws of love and light literature ay that is a rich moment and it will stir you to find van sweller in that fruitful nick of time thinking of his comrade o roon who is cursing his gyrating bed and incapable legs in an unsteady room in a west side hotel while van sweller holds his badge and his honor van sweller hears miss ffolliott s voice thrillingly asking the name of her preserver if hudson van sweller in policeman s uniform has saved the life of palpitating beauty in the park where is mounted policeman o roon in whose territory the deed is done how quickly by a word can the hero reveal himself thus discarding his masquerade of ineligibility and doubling the romance but there is his friend van sweller touches his cap it s nothing miss he says sturdily that s what we are paid for to do our duty and away he rides but the story does not end there as i have said van sweller carried off the park scene to my decided satisfaction even to me he was a hero when he foreswore for the sake of his friend the romantic promise of his adventure it was later in the day amongst the more exacting conventions that encompass the society hero when we had our liveliest disagreement at noon he went to o roon s room and found him far enough recovered to return to his post which he at once did at about six o clock in the afternoon van sweller fingered his watch and flashed at me a brief look full of such shrewd cunning that i suspected him at once time to dress for dinner old man he said with exaggerated carelessness very well i answered without giving him a clew to my suspicions i will go with you to your rooms and see that you do the thing properly i suppose that every author must be a valet to his own hero he affected cheerful acceptance of my somewhat officious proposal to accompany him i could see that he was annoyed by it and that fact fastened deeper in my mind the conviction that he was meditating some act of treachery when he had reached his apartments he said to me with a too patronizing air there are as you perhaps know quite a number of little distinguishing touches to be had out of the dressing process some writers rely almost wholly upon them i suppose that i am to ring for my man and that he is to enter noiselessly with an expressionless countenance he may enter i said with decision and only enter valets do not usually enter a room shouting college songs or with st vitus s dance in their faces so the contrary may be assumed without fatuous or gratuitous asseveration i must ask you to pardon me continued van sweller gracefully for annoying you with questions but some of your methods are a little new to me shall i don a full dress suit with an immaculate white tie or is there another tradition to be upset you will wear i replied evening dress such as a gentleman wears if it is full your tailor should be responsible for its bagginess and i will leave it to whatever erudition you are supposed to possess whether a white tie is rendered any whiter by being immaculate and i will leave it to the consciences of you and your man whether a tie that is not white and therefore not immaculate could possibly form any part of a gentleman s evening dress if not then the perfect tie is included and understood in the term dress and its expressed addition predicates either a redundancy of speech or the spectacle of a man wearing two ties at once with this mild but deserved rebuke i left van sweller in his dressing room and waited for him in his library about an hour later his valet came out and i heard him telephone for an electric cab then out came van sweller smiling but with that sly secretive design in his eye that was puzzling me i believe he said easily as he smoothed a glove that i will drop in at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers for dinner i sprang up angrily at his words this then was the paltry trick he had been scheming to play upon me i faced him with a look so grim that even his patrician poise was flustered you will never do so i exclaimed with my permission what kind of a return is this i continued hotly for the favors i have granted you i gave you a van to your name when i might have called you perkins or simpson i have humbled myself so far as to brag of your polo ponies your automobiles and the iron muscles that you acquired when you were stroke oar of your varsity eight or eleven whichever it is i created you for the hero of this story and i will not submit to having you queer it i have tried to make you a typical young new york gentleman of the highest social station and breeding you have no reason to complain of my treatment to you amy ffolliott the girl you are to win is a prize for any man to be thankful for and cannot be equalled for beauty provided the story is illustrated by the right artist i do not understand why you should try to spoil everything i had thought you were a gentleman what it is you are objecting to old man asked van sweller in a surprised tone to your dining at i answered see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the pleasure would be yours no doubt but the responsibility would fall upon me you intend deliberately to make me out a tout for a restaurant where you dine tonight has not the slightest connection with the thread of our story you know very well that the plot requires that you be in front of the alhambra opera house at where you are to rescue miss ffolliott a second time as the fire engine crashes into her cab until that time your movements are immaterial to the reader why can t you dine out of sight somewhere as many a hero does instead of insisting upon an inapposite and vulgar exhibition of yourself my dear fellow said van sweller politely but with a stubborn tightening of his lips i m sorry it doesn t please you but there s no help for it even a character in a story has rights that an author cannot ignore the hero of a story of new york social life must dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers at least once during its action must i echoed disdainfully why must who demands it the magazine editors answered van sweller giving me a glance of significant warning but why i persisted to please subscribers around kankakee ill said van sweller without hesitation how do you know these things i inquired with sudden suspicion you never came into existence until this morning you are only a character in fiction anyway i myself created you how is it possible for you to know anything pardon me for referring to it said van sweller with a sympathetic smile but i have been the hero of hundreds of stories of this kind i felt a slow flush creeping into my face i thought i stammered i was hoping that is oh well of course an absolutely original conception in fiction is impossible in these days metropolitan types continued van sweller kindly do not offer a hold for much originality i ve sauntered through every story in pretty much the same way now and then the women writers have made me cut some rather strange capers for a gentleman but the men generally pass me along from one to another without much change but never yet in any story have i failed to dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers you will fail this time i said emphatically perhaps so admitted van sweller looking out of the window into the street below but if so it will be for the first time the authors all send me there i fancy that many of them would have liked to accompany me but for the little matter of the expense i say i will be touting for no restaurant i repeated loudly you are subject to my will and i declare that you shall not appear of record this evening until the time arrives for you to rescue miss ffolliott again if the reading public cannot conceive that you have dined during that interval at some one of the thousands of establishments provided for that purpose that do not receive literary advertisement it may suppose for aught i care that you have gone fasting thank you said van sweller rather coolly you are hardly courteous but take care it is at your own risk that you attempt to disregard a fundamental principle in metropolitan fiction one that is dear alike to author and reader i shall of course attend to my duty when it comes time to rescue your heroine but i warn you that it will be your loss if you fail to send me to night to dine at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i will take the consequences if there are to be any i replied i am not yet come to be sandwich man for an eating house i walked over to a table where i had left my cane and gloves i heard the whirr of the alarm in the cab below and i turned quickly van sweller was gone i rushed down the stairs and out to the curb an empty hansom was just passing i hailed the driver excitedly see that auto cab halfway down the block i shouted follow it don t lose sight of it for an instant and i will give you two dollars if i only had been one of the characters in my story instead of myself i could easily have offered or or even but was all i felt justified in expending with fiction at its present rates the cab driver instead of lashing his animal into a foam proceeded at a deliberate trot that suggested a by the hour arrangement but i suspected van sweller s design and when we lost sight of his cab i ordered my driver to proceed at once to see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i found van sweller at a table under a palm just glancing over the menu with a hopeful waiter hovering at his elbow come with me i said inexorably you will not give me the slip again under my eye you shall remain until van sweller countermanded the order for his dinner and arose to accompany me he could scarcely do less a fictitious character is but poorly equipped for resisting a hungry but live author who comes to drag him forth from a restaurant all he said was you were just in time but i think you are making a mistake you cannot afford to ignore the wishes of the great reading public i took van sweller to my own rooms to my room he had never seen anything like it before sit on that trunk i said to him while i observe whether the landlady is stalking us if she is not i will get things at a delicatessen store below and cook something for you in a pan over the gas jet it will not be so bad of course nothing of this will appear in the story jove old man said van sweller looking about him with interest this is a jolly little closet you live in where the devil do you sleep oh that pulls down and i say what is this under the corner of the carpet oh a frying pan i see clever idea fancy cooking over the gas what larks it will be think of anything you could eat i asked try a chop or what anything said van sweller enthusiastically except a grilled bone two weeks afterward the postman brought me a large fat envelope i opened it and took out something that i had seen before and this typewritten letter from a magazine that encourages society fiction your short story the badge of policeman o roon is herewith returned we are sorry that it has been unfavorably passed upon but it seems to lack in some of the essential requirements of our publication the story is splendidly constructed its style is strong and inimitable and its action and character drawing deserve the highest praise as a story per se it has merit beyond anything that we have read for some time but as we have said it fails to come up to some of the standards we have set could you not re write the story and inject into it the social atmosphere and return it to us for further consideration it is suggested to you that you have the hero van sweller drop in for luncheon or dinner once or twice at or at the see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers which will be in line with the changes desired very truly yours the editors sound and fury o henry wrote this for ainslee s

sighs and tears of the previous night miss lore oh mr penne dictates to cortland the chief charm of this girl was her look of innocence and unworldiness never had nun miss lore how about changing that

discovered after a fond farewell she turned and sped lightly away cortland s gaze followed her he watched her rise miss lore excuse me mr penne but how could he watch her eyes while her back was turned toward him mr penne with extreme politeness possibly you would gather my meaning more intelligently if you would wait for the conclusion of the sentence dictates watched her rise as gracefully as a fawn as she mounted the eastern terrace miss lore oh mr penne dictates and yet cortland s position was so far above that of this rustic maiden that he dreaded to consider the social upheaval that would ensue should he marry her in no uncertain tones the traditional voices of his caste and world cried out loudly to him to let her go what should follow miss lore looking up with a start i m sure i can t say mr penne unless with a giggle you would want to add gallegher mr penne coldly pardon me i was not seeking to impose upon you the task of a collaborator kindly consider the question a part

known that tictocq the famous french detective was in austin last week he registered at the avenue hotel under an assumed name and his quiet and reserved manners singled him out at once for one not to be singled out no one knows why he came to austin but to one or two he vouchsafed the information that his mission was an important one from the french government one report is that the french minister of state has discovered an old statute among the laws of the empire resulting from a treaty between the emperor charlemagne and governor roberts which expressly provides for the north gate of the capital grounds being kept open but this is merely a conjecture last wednesday afternoon a well dressed gentleman knocked at the door of tictocq s room in the hotel the detective opened the door

carry a populist s socks in his pocket without wrapping them up he would not want to do so in the hotel he would want a paper where would he get one at the statesman office of course i went there a young man with his hair combed down on his forehead sat behind the desk i knew he was writing society items for a young lady s slipper a piece of cake a fan a half emptied bottle of cocktail a bunch of roses and a police whistle lay on the desk before him can you tell me if a man purchased a paper here in the last three months i said yes he replied we sold one last night can you describe the man accurately he had blue whiskers a wart between his shoulder blades a touch of colic and an occupation tax on his breath which way did he go out i then went wait a minute said the populist candidate rising i don t see why in the h once more i must beg that you will be silent said tictocq rather sharply you should not interrupt me in the midst of my report i made one false arrest continued tictocq i was passing two finely dressed gentlemen on the street when one of them remarked that he had stole his socks i handcuffed him and dragged him to a lighted store when his companion explained to me that he was somewhat intoxicated and his tongue was not entirely manageable he had been speaking of some business transaction and what he intended to say was that he had sold his stocks i then released him an hour afterward i passed a saloon and saw this professor von bum drinking beer at a table i knew him in paris i said here is my man he worshipped wagner lived on limburger cheese beer and credit and would have stolen anybody s socks i shadowed him to the reception at colonel st vitus s and in an opportune moment i seized him and tore the socks from his feet there they are with a dramatic gesture tictocq threw a pair of dingy socks upon the table folded his arms and threw back his head with a loud cry of rage the populist candidate sprang once more to his feet gol darn it i will say what i want to i the two other populists in the room gazed at him coldly and sternly is this tale true they demanded of the candidate no by gosh it ain t he replied pointing a trembling finger at the democratic chairman there stands the man who has concocted the whole scheme it is an infernal unfair political trick to lose votes for our party how far has thing gone he added turning savagely to the detective all the newspapers have my written report on the matter and the statesman will have it in plate matter next week said tictocq complacently all is lost said the populists turning toward the door for god s sake my friends pleaded the candidate following them listen to me i swear before high heaven that i never wore a pair of socks in my life it is all a devilish campaign lie the populists turn their backs the damage is already done they said the people have heard the story you have yet time to withdraw decently before the race all left the room except tictocq and the democrats let s all go down and open a bottle of fizz on the finance committee said the chairman of the executive committee platform no tracked to doom or the mystery of the rue de peychaud tis midnight in paris a myriad of lamps that line the champs elysees and the rouge et noir cast their reflection in the dark waters of the seine as it flows gloomily past the place vendome and the black walls of the convent notadam the great french capital is astir it is the hour when crime and vice and wickedness reign hundreds of fiacres drive madly through the streets conveying women flashing with jewels and as beautiful as dreams from opera and concert and the little bijou supper rooms of the cafe tout le temps are filled with laughing groups while bon mots persiflage and repartee fly upon the air the jewels of thought and conversation luxury and poverty brush each other in the streets the homeless gamin begging a sou with which to purchase a bed and the spendthrift roue scattering golden louis d or tread the same pavement when other cities sleep paris has just begun her wild revelry the first scene of our story is a cellar beneath the rue de peychaud the room is filled with smoke of pipes and is stifling with the reeking breath of its inmates a single flaring gas jet dimly lights the scene which is one rembrandt or moreland and keisel would have loved to paint a garcon is selling absinthe to such of the motley crowd as have a few sous dealing it out in niggardly portions in broken teacups leaning against the bar is carnaignole cusheau generally known as the gray wolf he is the worst man in paris he is more than four feet ten in height and his sharp ferocious looking face and the mass of long tangled gray hair that covers his face and head have earned for him the name he bears his striped blouse is wide open at the neck and falls outside of his dingy leather trousers the handle of a deadly looking knife protrudes from his belt one stroke of its blade would open a box of the finest french sardines voila gray wolf cries couteau the bartender how many victims to day there is no blood upon your hands has the gray wolf forgotten how to bite sacre bleu mille tonnerre by george hisses the gray wolf monsieur couteau you are bold indeed to speak to me thus by ventre st gris i have not even dined to day spoils indeed there is no living in paris now but one rich american have i garroted in a fortnight bah those democrats they have ruined the country with their income tax and their free trade they have destroyed the millionaire business carrambo diable d n it hist suddenly says chamounix the rag picker who is worth francs some one comes the cellar door opened and a man crept softly down the rickety steps the crowd watches him with silent awe he went to the bar laid his card on the counter bought a drink of absinthe and then drawing from his pocket a little mirror set it up on the counter and proceeded to don a false beard and hair and paint his face into wrinkles until he closely resembled an old man seventy one years of age he then went into a dark corner and watched the crowd of people with sharp ferret like eyes gray wolf slipped cautiously to the bar and examined the card left by the newcomer holy saint bridget he exclaims it is tictocq the detective ten minutes later a beautiful woman enters the cellar tenderly nurtured and accustomed to every luxury that money could procure she had when a young vivandiere at the convent of saint susan de la montarde run away with the gray wolf fascinated by his many crimes and the knowledge that his business never allowed him to scrape his feet in the hall or snore parbleu marie snarls the gray wolf que voulez vous avez vous le beau cheval de mon frere oule joli chien de votre pere no no gray wolf shouts the motley group of assassins rogues and pickpockets even their hardened hearts appalled at his fearful words mon dieu you cannot be so cruel tiens shouts the gray wolf now maddened to desperation and drawing his gleaming knife voila canaille tout le monde carte blanche enbonpoint sauve que peut entre nous revenez nous a nous moutons the horrifed sans culottes shrink back in terror as the gray wolf seizes maria by the hair and cuts her into twenty nine pieces each exactly the same size as he stands with reeking hands above the corpse amid a deep silence the old gray bearded man who has been watching the scene springs forward tears off his false beard and locks and tictocq the famous french detective stands before them spellbound and immovable the denizens of the cellar gaze at the greatest modern detective as he goes about the customary duties of his office he first measures the distance from the murdered woman to a point on the wall then he takes down the name of the bartender and the day of the month and the year then drawing from his pocket a powerful microscope he examines a little of the blood that stands upon the floor in little pools mon dieu he mutters it is as i feared human blood he then enters rapidly in a memorandum book the result of his investigations and leaves the cellar tictocq bends his rapid steps in the direction of the headquarters of the paris gendarmerie but suddenly pausing he strikes his hand upon his brow with a gesture of impatience mille tonnerre he mutters i should have asked the name of that man with the knife in his hand it is reception night at the palace of the duchess valerie du bellairs the apartments are flooded with a mellow light from paraffine candles in solid silver candelabra the company is the most aristocratic and wealthy in paris three or four brass bands are playing behind a portiere between the coal shed and also behind time footmen in gay laced livery bring in beer noiselessly and carry out apple peelings dropped by the guests valerie seventh duchess du bellairs leans back on a solid gold ottoman on eiderdown cushions surrounded by the wittiest the bravest and the handsomest courtiers in the capital ah madame said the prince champvilliers of palms royale corner of seventy third street as montesquiaux says rien de plus bon tutti frutti youth seems your inheritance you are to night the most beautiful the wittiest in your own salon i can scarce believe my own senses when i remember that thirty one years ago you saw it off says the duchess peremptorily the prince bows low and drawing a jewelled dagger stabs himself to the heart the displeasure of your grace is worse than death he says as he takes his overcoat and hat from a corner of the mantelpiece and leaves the room voila says beebe francillon fanning herself languidly that is the way with men flatter them and they kiss your hand loose but a moment the silken leash that holds them captive through their vanity and self opinionativeness and the son of a gun gets on his ear at once the devil go with him i say ah mon princesse sighs the count pumpernickel stooping and whispering with eloquent eyes into her ear you are too hard upon us balzac says all women are not to themselves what no one else is to another do you not agree with him cheese it says the princess philosophy palls upon me i ll shake you hosses says the count arm and arm they go out to the salon au beurre armande de fleury the young pianissimo danseuse from the folies bergere is about to sing she slightly clears her throat and lays a voluptuous cud of chewing gum upon the piano as the first notes of the accompaniment ring through the salon as she prepares to sing the duchess du bellairs grasps the arm of her ottoman in a vice like grip and she watches with an expression of almost anguished suspense she scarcely breathes then as armande de fleury before uttering a note reels wavers turns white as snow and falls dead upon the floor the duchess breathes a sigh of relief the duchess had poisoned her then the guests crowd about the piano gazing with bated breath and shuddering as they look upon the music rack and observe that the song that armande came so near singing is sweet marie twenty minutes later a dark and muffled figure was seen to emerge from a recess in the mullioned wall of the arc de triomphe and pass rapidly northward it was no other than tictocq the detective the network of evidence was fast being drawn about the murderer of marie cusheau it is midnight on the steeple of the cathedral of notadam it is also the same time at other given points in the vicinity the spire of the cathedral is feet above the pavement and a casual observer by making a rapid mathematical calculation would have readily perceived that this cathedral is at least double the height of others that measure only feet at the summit of the spire there is a little wooden platform on which there is room for but one man to stand crouching on this precarious footing which swayed dizzily with every breeze that blew was a man closely muffled and disguised as a wholesale grocer old francois beongfallong the great astronomer who is studying the sidereal spheres from his attic window in the rue de bologny shudders as he turns his telescope upon the solitary figure upon the spire sacre bleu he hisses between his new celluloid teeth it is tictocq the detective i wonder whom he is following now while tictocq is watching with lynx like eyes the hill of montmartre he suddenly hears a heavy breathing beside him and turning gazes into the ferocious eyes of the gray wolf carnaignole cusheau had put on his w u tel co climbers and climbed the steeple parbleu monsieur says tictocq to whom am i indebted for the honor of this visit the gray wolf smiled softly and depreciatingly you are tictocq the detective he said i am then listen i am the murderer of marie cusheau she was my wife and she had cold feet and ate onions what was i to do yet life is sweet to me i do not wish to be guillotined i have heard that you are on my track is it true that the case is in your hands it is thank le bon dieu then i am saved the gray wolf carefully adjusts the climbers on his feet and descends the spire tictocq takes out his notebook and writes in it at last he says i have a clue monsieur le compte carnaignole cusheau once known as the gray wolf stands in the magnificent drawing room of his palace on east th street three days after his confession to tictocq he happened to look in the pockets of a discarded pair of pants and found twenty million francs in gold suddenly the door opens and tictocq the detective with a dozen gensd arme enters the room you are my prisoner says the detective on what charge the murder of marie cusheau on the night of august th your proofs i saw you do it and your own confession on the spire of notadam the count laughed and took a paper from his pocket read this he said here is proof that marie cusheau died of heart failure tictocq looked at the paper it was a check for francs tictocq dismissed the gensd arme with a wave of his hand we have made a mistake monsieurs he said but as he turns to leave the room count carnaignole stops him one moment monsieur the count carnaignole tears from his own face a false beard and reveals the

aldermen to the armory but he stuck to his company and marched at the head of it up sam houston avenue the buildings on both sides was covered with flags and audiences and everybody hollered robbins or hello willie as we marched up in files of fours i never saw a illustriouser looking human in my life than willie was he had at least seven or eight medals and diplomas and decorations on the breast of his khaki coat he was sunburnt the color of a saddle and he certainly done himself proud they told us at the depot that the courthouse was to be illuminated at half past seven and there would be speeches and chili con came at the palace hotel miss delphine thompson was to read an original poem by james whitcomb ryan and constable hooker had promised us a salute of nine guns from chicago that he had arrested that day after we had disbanded in the armory willie says to me want to walk out a piece with me why yes says i if it ain t so far that we can t hear the tumult and the shouting die away i m hungry myself says i and i m pining for some home grub but i ll go with you willie steered me down some side streets till we came to a little white cottage in a new lot with a twenty by thirty foot lawn decorated with brickbats and old barrel staves halt and give the countersign says i to willie don t you know this dugout it s the bird s nest that joe granberry built before he married myra allison what you going there for but willie already had the gate open he walked up the brick walk to the steps and i went with him myra was sitting in a rocking chair on the porch sewing her hair was smoothed back kind of hasty and tied in a knot i never noticed till then that she had freckles joe was at one side of the porch in his shirtsleeves with no collar on and no signs of a shave trying to scrape out a hole among the brickbats and tin cans to plant a little fruit tree in he looked up but never said a word and neither did myra willie was sure dandy looking in his uniform with medals strung on his breast and his new gold handled sword you d never have taken him for the little white headed snipe that the girls used to order about and make fun of he just stood there for a minute looking at myra with a peculiar little smile on his face and then he says to her slow and kind of holding on to his words with his teeth oh i don t know maybe i could if i tried that was all that was said willie raised his hat and we walked away and somehow when he said that i remembered all of a sudden the night of that dance and willie brushing his hair before the looking glass and myra sticking her head in the door to guy him when we got back to sam houston avenue willie says well so long ben i m going down home and get off my shoes and take a rest you says i what s the matter with you ain t the court house jammed with everybody in town waiting to honor the hero and two brass bands and recitations and flags and jags and grub to follow waiting for you willie sighs all right ben says he darned if i didn t forget all about that and that s why i say concluded ben granger that you can t tell where ambition begins any more than you can where it is going to wind up the head hunter

that brought me back i pondered much upon the strange things i had sensed in the weird archipelago of the yellow brown people the manoeuvres and skirmishings of the petty war interested me not i was spellbound by the outlandish and unreadable countenance of that race that had turned its expressionless gaze upon us out of an unguessable past particularly during my stay in mindanao had i been fascinated and attracted by that delightfully original tribe of heathen known as the head hunters those grim flinty relentless little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed presence paralleling the trail of their prey through unmapped forests across perilous mountain tops adown bottomless chasms into uninhabitable jungles always near with the invisible hand of death uplifted betraying their pursuit only by such signs as a beast or a bird or a gliding serpent might make a twig crackling in the awful sweat soaked night a drench of dew showering from the screening foliage of a giant tree a whisper at even from the rushes of a water level a hint of death for every mile and every hour they amused me greatly those little fellows of one

speak to him except to reply to his own questions or remarks and they spoke with absolute and unfailing politeness they played tricks on one another they pounded one another hurtfully and affectionately they heaped upon one another s heads friendly curses and obloquy but they were polite to curly he saw it and it stung him as much as ranse hoped it would then came a night that brought a cold wet norther wilson the youngest of the outfit had lain in camp two days ill with fever when joe got up at daylight to begin breakfast he found curly sitting asleep against a wheel of the grub wagon with only a saddle blanket around him while curly s blankets were stretched over wilson to protect him from the rain and wind three nights after that curly rolled himself in his blanket and went to sleep then the other punchers rose up softly and began to make preparations ranse saw long collins tie a rope to the horn of a saddle others were getting out their six shooters boys said ranse i m much obliged i was hoping you would but i didn t like to ask half a dozen six shooters began to pop awful yells rent the air long collins galloped wildly across curly s bed dragging the saddle after him that was merely their way of gently awaking their victim then they hazed him for an hour carefully and ridiculously after the code of cow camps whenever he uttered protest they held him stretched over a roll of blankets and thrashed him woefully with a pair of leather leggings and all this meant that curly had won his spurs that he was receiving the puncher s accolade nevermore would they be polite to him but he would be their pardner and stirrup brother foot to foot when the fooling was ended all hands made a raid on joe s big coffee pot by the fire for a java nightcap ranse watched the new knight carefully to see if he understood and was worthy curly limped with his cup of coffee to a log and sat upon it long collins followed and sat by his side buck rabb went and sat at the other curly grinned and then ranse furnished curly with mounts and saddle and equipment and turned him over to buck rabb instructing him to finish the job three weeks later ranse rode from the ranch into rabb s camp which was then in snake valley the boys were saddling for the day s ride he sought out long collins among them how about that bronco he asked long collins grinned reach out your hand ranse truesdell he said and you ll touch him and you can shake his n too if you like for he s plumb white and there s none better in no camp ranse looked again at the clear faced bronzed smiling cowpuncher who stood at collins s side could that be curly he held out his hand and curly grasped it with the muscles of a bronco buster i want you at the ranch said ranse all right sport said curly heartily but i want to come back again say pal this is a dandy farm and i don t want any better fun than hustlin cows with this bunch of guys they re all to the merry merry at the cibolo ranch house they dismounted ranse bade curly wait at the door of the living room he walked inside old kiowa truesdell was reading at a table good morning mr truesdell said ranse the old man turned his white head quickly how is this he began why do you call me mr when he looked at ranse s face he stopped and the hand that held his newspaper shook slightly boy he said slowly how did you find it out it s all right said ranse with a smile i made tia juana tell me it was kind of by accident but it s all right you ve been like a son to me said old kiowa trembling tia juana told me all about it said ranse she told me how you adopted me when i was knee high to a puddle duck out of a wagon train of prospectors that was bound west and she told me how the kid your own kid you know got lost or was run away with and she said it was the same day that the sheep shearers got on a bender and left the ranch our boy strayed from the house when he was two years old said the old man and then along came those emigrant wagons with a youngster they didn t want and we took you i never intended you to know ranse we never heard of our boy again he s right outside unless i m mighty mistaken said ranse opening the door and beckoning curly walked in no one could have doubted the old man and the young had the same sweep of hair the same nose chin line of face and prominent light blue eyes old kiowa rose eagerly curly looked about the room curiously a puzzled expression came over his face he pointed to the wall opposite where s the tick tock he asked absent mindedly the clock cried old kiowa loudly the eight day clock used to stand there why he turned to ranse but ranse was not there already a hundred yards away vaminos the good flea bitten dun was bearing him eastward like a racer through dust and chaparral

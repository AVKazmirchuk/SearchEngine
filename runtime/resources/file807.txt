to him in two years he had been a borrower and a sponge and it seemed that if he fell no lower it would be from lack of opportunity one more chance he was saying to himself if he had one more stake at the game he thought he could win but he had nothing left to sell and his credit was more than exhausted he could not help smiling even in his misery as he thought of the man to whom six months before he had sold the old goree homestead there had come from back yan in the mountains two of the strangest creatures a man named pike garvey and his wife back yan with a wave of the hand toward the hills was understood among the mountaineers to designate the remotest fastnesses the unplumbed gorges the haunts of lawbreakers the wolf s den and the boudoir of the bear in the cabin far up on blackjack s shoulder in the wildest part of these retreats this odd couple had lived for twenty years they had neither dog nor children to mitigate the heavy silence of the hills pike garvey was little known in the settlements but all who had dealt with him pronounced him crazy as a loon he acknowledged no occupation save that of a squirrel hunter but he moonshined occasionally by way of diversion once the revenues had dragged him from his lair fighting silently and desperately like a terrier and he had been sent to state s prison for two years released he popped back into his hole like an angry weasel fortune passing over many anxious wooers made a freakish flight into blackjack s bosky pockets to smile upon pike and his faithful partner one day a party of spectacled knickerbockered and altogether absurd prospectors invaded the vicinity of the garvey s cabin pike lifted his squirrel rifle off the hooks and took a shot at them at long range on the chance of their being revenues happily he missed and the unconscious agents of good luck drew nearer disclosing their innocence of anything resembling law or justice later on they offered the garveys an enormous quantity of ready green crisp money for their thirty acre patch of cleared land mentioning as an excuse for such a mad action some irrelevant and inadequate nonsense about a bed of mica underlying the said property when the garveys became possessed of so many dol lars that they faltered in computing them the deficiencies of life on blackjack began to grow prominent pike began to talk of new shoes a hogshead of tobacco to set in the corner a new lock to his rifle and leading martella to a certain spot on the mountain side he pointed out to her how a small cannon doubtless a thing not beyond the scope of their fortune in price might be planted so as to command and defend the sole accessible trail to the cabin to the confusion of revenues and meddling strangers forever but adam reckoned without his eve these things represented to him the applied power of wealth but there slumbered in his dingy cabin an ambition that soared far above his primitive wants somewhere in mrs garvey s bosom still survived a spot of femininity unstarved by twenty years of blackjack for so long a time the sounds in her ears had been the scaly barks dropping in the woods at noon and the wolves singing among the rocks at night and it was enough to have purged her of vanities she had grown fat and sad and yellow and dull but when the means came she felt a rekindled desire to assume the perquisites of her sex to sit at tea tables to buy futile things to whitewash the hideous veracity of life with a little form and ceremony so she coldly vetoed pike s proposed system of fortifica tions and announced that thev would descend upon the world and gyrate socially and thus at length it was decided and the thing done the village of laurel was their compromise between mrs garvey s preference for one of the large valley towns and pike s hankering for primeval solitudes laurel yielded a halting round of feeble social distractions omportable with martella s ambitions and was not entirely without recommendation to pike its contiguity to the mountains presenting advantages for sudden retreat in case fashionable society should make it advisable their descent upon laurel had been coincident with yancey goree s feverish desire to convert property into cash and they bought the old goree homestead paying four thousand dollars ready money into the spendthrift s shaking hands thus it happened that while the disreputable last of the gorees sprawled in his disreputable office at the end of his row spurned by the cronies whom he had gorged strangers dwelt in the halls of his fathers a cloud of dust was rolling slowly up the parched street with something travelling in the midst of it a little breeze wafted the cloud to one side and a new brightly painted carryall drawn by a slothful gray horse became visible the vehicle deflected from the middle of the street as it neared goree s office and stopped in the gutter directly in front of his door on the front seat sat a gaunt tall man dressed in black broadcloth his rigid hands incarcerated in yellow kid gloves on the back seat was a lady who triumphed over the june heat her stout form was armoured in a skintight silk dress of the description known as change able being a gorgeous combination of shifting hues she sat erect waving a much omamented fan with her eyes fixed stonily far down the street however martella garvey s heart might be rejoicing at the pleasures of her new life blackjack had done his work with her exterior he had carved her countenance to the image of emptiness and inanity had imbued her

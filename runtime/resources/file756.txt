house well doctor said knight unable to repress a note of triumph in his voice have you seen it is wonderful wonderful i could not help exclaiming as our cab started on its return trip but how did you do it by what process of induction my dear doctor interrupted the great murderer the inductive theory is what the detectives use my process is more modern i call it the saltatorial theory without bothering with the tedious mental phenomena necessary to the solution of a mystery from slight clues i jump at once to a conclusion i will explain to you the method i employed in this case in the first place i argued that as the crime was committed in new york city in broad daylight in a public place and under peculiarly atrocious circumstances and that as the most skilful sleuth available was let loose upon the case the perpetrator would never be discovered do you not think my postulation justified by precedent perhaps so i replied doggedly but if big bill dev stop that interrupted knight with a smile i ve heard that several times it s too late now i will proceed if homicides in new york went undiscovered i reasoned although the best detective talent was employed to ferret them out it must be true that the detectives went about their work in the wrong way and not only in the wrong way but exactly opposite from the right way that was my clue i slew the man in central park now let me describe myself to you i am tall with a black beard and i hate publicity i have no money to speak of i do not like oatmeal and it is the one ambition of my life to die rich i am of a cold and heartless disposition i do not care for my fellowmen and i never give a cent to beggars or charity now my dear doctor that is the true description of myself the man whom that shrewd detective was to hunt down you who are familiar with the history of crime in new york of late should be able to foretell the result when i promised you to exhibit to your incredulous gaze the sleuth who was set upon me you laughed at me because you said that detectives and murderers never met in new york i have demonstrated to you that the theory is possible but how did you do it i asked again it was very simple replied the distinguished murderer i assumed that the detective would go exactly opposite to the clues he had i have given you a description of myself therefore he must necessarily set to work and trail a short man with a white beard who likes to be in the papers who is very wealthy is fond of oatmeal wants to die poor and is of an extremely generous and philanthropic disposition when thus far is reached the mind hesitates no longer i conveyed you at once to the spot where shamrock jolnes was piping off andrew carnegie s residence knight said i you re a wonder if there was no danger of your reforming what a rounds man you d make for the nineteenth precinct the dog and the playlet this story has been rewritten and published in strictly business under the title the proof of the pudding usually it is a cold day in july when you can stroll up broadway in that month and get a story out of the drama i found one a few breathless parboiling days ago and it seems to decide a serious question in art there was not a soul left in the city except hollis and me and two or three million sunworshippers who remained at desks and counters the elect had fled to seashore lake and mountain and had already begun to draw for additional funds every evening hollis and i prowled about the deserted town searching for coolness in empty cafes dining rooms and roofgardens we knew to the tenth part of a revolution the speed of every electric fan in gotham and we followed the swiftest as they varied hollis s fiancee miss loris sherman had been in the adirondacks at lower saranac lake for a month in another week he would join her party there in the meantime he cursed the city cheerfully and optimistically and sought my society because i suffered him to show me her photograph during the black coffee every time we dined together my revenge was to read to him my one act play it was one insufferable evening when the overplus of the day s heat was being hurled quiveringly back to the heavens by every surcharged brick and stone and inch of iron in the panting town but with the cunning of the two legged beasts we had found an oasis where the hoofs of apollo s steed had not been allowed to strike our seats were on an ocean of cool polished oak the white linen of fifty deserted tables flapped like seagulls in the artificial breeze a mile away a waiter lingered for a heliographic signal we might have roared songs there or fought a duel without molestation out came miss loris s photo with the coffee and i once more praised the elegant poise of the neck the extremely low coiled mass of heavy hair and the eyes that followed one like those in an oil painting she s the greatest ever said hollis with enthusiasm good as great northern preferred and a disposition built like a watch one week more and i ll be happy jonny on the spot old tom tolliver my best college chum went up there two weeks ago he writes me that loris doesn t talk about anything but me oh i guess rip van winkle didn t have all the good luck yes yes said i hurriedly pulling out my typewritten play she

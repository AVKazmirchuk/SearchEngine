cormick reapers and oysters all of this was a part of the rolling stone which flourished or at least wavered in austin during the years and years before porter s strong instinct to write had been gratified in letters he wrote in his twenties long imaginative letters occasionally stuffed with execrable puns but more than often buoyant truly humorous keenly incisive into the unreal especially in fiction i have included a number of these letters to doctor beall of greensboro n c and to his early friend in texas mr david harrell in porter went to houston texas to work on the houston post there he conducted a column which he called postscripts some of the contents of the pages that follow have been taken from these old files in the fair hope that admirers of the matured o henry will find in them pleasurable marks of the later genius before the days of the rolling stone there are eleven years in texas over which with the exception of the letters mentioned there are few traces of literary performance but there are some very interesting drawings some of which are reproduced in this volume a story is back of them they were the illustrations to a book joe dixon prospector and inveterate fortune seeker came to austin from the rockies in at the constant urging of his old pal mr john maddox joe kept writing mr maddox your fortune s in your pen not your pick come to austin and write an account of your adventures it was hard to woo dixon from the gold that wasn t there but finally maddox wrote him he must come and try the scheme there s a boy here from north carolina wrote maddox his name is will porter and he can make the pictures he s all right dixon came the plan was that after author and artist had done their work patron would step in carry the manuscript to new york bestow it on a deserving publisher and then return to await with the other two the avalanche of royalties this version of the story comes from mr maddox there were forty pictures in all and they were very true to the life of the rockies in the seventies of course the young artist had no technique no anything except what was native but wait as the months went by dixon worked hard but he began to have doubts perhaps the book was no good perhaps john would only lose his money he was a miner not a writer and he ought not to let john go to any expense the result of this line of thought was the colorado river for the manuscript and the high road for the author the pictures fortunately were saved most of them porter gave later to mrs hagelstein of san angelo texas mr maddox by the way finding a note from joe that explained all hastened to the river and recovered a few scraps of the great book that had lodged against a sandbar but there was no putting them together again so much for the title it is a real o henry title contents of this last volume are drawn not only from letters old newspaper files and the rolling stone but from magazines and unpublished manuscripts of the short stories several were written at the very height of his powers and popularity and were lost inexplicably but lost of the poems there are a few whose authorship might have been in doubt if the compiler of this collection had not secured external evidence that made them certainly the work of o henry without this very strong evidence they might have been rejected because they were not entirely the kind of poems the readers of o henry would expect from him most of them however were found in his own indubitable manuscript or over his own signature there is extant a mass of o henry correspondence that has not been included in this collection during the better part of a decade in new york city he wrote constantly to editors and in many instances intimately this is very important material and permission has been secured to use nearly all of it in a biographical volume that will be issued within the next two or three years the letters in this volume have been chosen as an exihibit as early specimens of his writing and for their particularly characteristic turns of thought and phrase the collection is not complete in any historical sense h p s this record of births and deaths is copied from the

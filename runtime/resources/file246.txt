briskly i m a practical magazine man myself and a circulation booster as good as any if i do say it i ll guarantee an increase of anywhere from ten thousand to a hundred thousand a year for any publication that isn t printed in a dead language i ve had my eye on the rose of dixie ever since it started i know every end of the business from editing to setting up the classified ads now i ve come down here to put a good bunch of money in the magazine if i can see my way clear it ought to be made to pay the secretary tells me it s losing money i don t see why a magazine in the south if it s properly handled shouldn t get a good circulation in the north too colonel telfair leaned back in his chair and polished his gold rimmed glasses mr thacker said he courteously but firmly the rose of dixie is a publication devoted to the fostering and the voicing of southern genius its watchword which you may have seen on the cover is of for and by the south but you wouldn t object to a northern circulation would you asked thacker i suppose said the editor colonel that it is customary to open the circulation lists to all i do not know i have nothing to do with the business affairs of the magazine i was called upon to assume editorial control of it and i have devoted to its conduct such poor literary talents as i may possess and whatever store of erudition i may have acquired sure said thacker but a dollar is a dollar anywhere north south or west whether you re buying codfish goober peas or rocky ford cantaloupes now i ve been looking over your november number i see one here on your desk you don t mind running over it with me well your leading article is all right a good write up of the cotton belt with plenty of photographs is a winner any time new york is always interested in the cotton crop and this sensational account of hatfield mccoy feud by a schoolmate of a niece of the governor of kentucky isn t such a bad idea it happened so long ago that most people have forgotten it now here s a poem three pages long called the tyrant s foot by lorella lascelles i ve pawed around a good deal over manuscripts but i never saw her name on a rejection slip miss lascelles said the editor is one of our most widely recognized southern poetesses she is closely related to the alabama lascelles family and made with her own hands the silken confederate banner that was presented to the governor of that state at his inauguration but why persisted thacker is the poem illustrated with a view of the m railroad freight depot at tuscaloosa the illustration said the colonel with dignity shows a corner of the fence surrounding the old homestead where miss lascelles was born all right said thacker i read the poem but i couldn t tell whether it was about the depot of the battle of bull run now here s a short story called rosies temptation by fosdyke piggott it s rotten what is a piggott anyway mr piggott said the editor is a brother of the principal stockholder of the magazine all s right with the world piggott passes said thacker well this article on arctic exploration and the one on tarpon fishing might go but how about this write up of the atlanta new orleans nashville and savannah breweries it seems to consist mainly of statistics about their output and the quality of their beer what s the chip over the bug if i understand your figurative language answered colonel telfair it is this the article you refer to was handed to me by the owners of the magazine with instructions to publish it the literary quality of it did not appeal to me but in a measure i feel impelled to conform in certain matters to the wishes of the gentlemen who are interested in the financial side of the rose i see said thacker next we have two pages of selections from lalla rookh by thomas moore now what federal prison did moore escape from or what s the name of the f f v family that he carries as a handicap moore was an irish poet who died in said colonel telfair pityingly he is a classic i have been thinking of reprinting his translation of anacreon serially in the magazine look out for the copyright laws said thacker flippantly who s bessie belleclair who contributes the essay on the newly completed water works plant in milledgeville the name sir said colonel telfair is the nom de guerre of miss elvira simpkins i have not the honor of knowing the lady but her contribution was sent to us by congressman brower of her native state congressman brower s mother was related to the polks of tennessee now see here colonel said thacker throwing down the magazine this won t do you can t successfully run a magazine for one particular section of the country you ve got to make a universal appeal look how the northern publications have catered to the south and encouraged the southern writers and you ve got to go far and wide for your contributors you ve got to buy stuff according to its quality without any regard to the pedigree of the author now i ll bet a quart of ink that this southern parlor organ you ve been running has never played a note that originated about mason hamlin s line am i right i have carefully and conscientiously rejected all contributions from that section of the country if i understand your figurative language aright replied the colonel all right now i ll show you something thacker

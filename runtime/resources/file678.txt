a letter from mr otter offering to do anything he could to help his faithful old employee the old cutter regarded this letter as a valuable legacy to his daughter and he put it into her hands with pride as the shears of the dread cleaner and repairer snipped off his thread of life that was the landlord s cue and forth he came and did his part in the great eviction scene there was no snowstorm ready for elsie to steal out into drawing her little red woollen shawl about her shoulders but she went out regardless of the unities and as for the red shawl back to blaney with it elsie s fall tan coat was cheap but it had the style and fit of the best at fox otter s and her lucky stars had given her good looks and eyes as blue and innocent as the new shade of note paper and she had left of the and the letter from mr otter keep your eye on the letter from mr otter that is the clue i desire that everything be made plain as we go detective stories are so plentiful now that they do not sell and so we find elsie thus equipped starting out in the world to seek her fortune one trouble about the letter from mr otter was that it did not bear the new address of the firm which had moved about a month before but elsie thought she could find it she had heard that policemen when politely addressed or thumbscrewed by an investigation committee will give up information and addresses so she boarded a downtown car at one hundred and seventy seventh street and rode south to forty second which she thought must surely be the end of the island there she stood against the wall undecided for the city s roar and dash was new to her up where she had lived was rural new york so far out that the milkmen awaken you in the morning by the squeaking of pumps instead of the rattling of cans a kind faced sunburned young man in a soft brimmed hat went past elsie into the grand central depot that was hank ross of the sunflower ranch in idaho on his way home from a visit to the east hank s heart was heavy for the sunflower ranch was a lonesome place lacking the presence of a woman he had hoped to find one during his visit who would congenially share his prosperity and home but the girls of gotham had not pleased his fancy but as he passed in he noted with a jumping of his pulses the sweet ingenuous face of elsie and her pose of doubt and loneliness with true and honest western impulse he said to himself that here was his mate he could love her he knew and he would surround her with so much comfort and cherish her so carefully that she would be happy and make two sunflowers grow on the ranch where there grew but one before hank turned and went back to her backed by his never before questioned honesty of purpose he approached the girl and removed his soft brimmed hat elsie had but time to sum up his handsome frank face with one shy look of modest admiration when a burly cop hurled himself upon the ranchman seized him by the collar and backed him against the wall two blocks away a burglar was coming out of an apartment house with a bag of silverware on his shoulder but that is neither here nor there carry on yez mashin tricks right before me eyes will yez shouted the cop i ll teach yez to speak to ladies on me beat that ye re not acquainted with come along elsie turned away with a sigh as the ranchman was dragged away she had liked the effect of his light blue eyes against his tanned complexion she walked southward thinking herself already in the district where her father used to work and hoping to find some one who could direct her to the firm of fox otter but did she want to find mr otter she had inherited much of the old cutter s independence how much better it would be if she could find work and support herself without calling on him for aid elsie saw a sign employment agency and went in many girls were sitting against the wall in chairs several well dressed ladies were looking them over one white haired kind faced old lady in rustling black silk

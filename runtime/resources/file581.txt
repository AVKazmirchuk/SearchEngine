kinsolving was there mrs bellmore ran her prohibitive pencil lightly through the name too shy she murmured sweetly in explanation jimmy hayes and muriel i supper was over and there had fallen upon the camp the silence that accompanies the rolling of corn husk cigarettes the water hole shone from the dark earth like a patch of fallen sky coyotes yelped dull thumps indicated the rocking horse movements of the hobbled ponies as they moved to fresh grass a half troop of the frontier battalion of texas rangers were distributed about the fire a well known sound the fluttering and scraping of chaparral against wooden stirrups came from the thick brush above the camp the rangers listened cautiously they heard a loud and cheerful voice call out reassuringly brace up muriel old girl we re most there now been a long ride for ye ain t it ye old antediluvian handful of animated carpet tacks hey now quit a tryin to kiss me don t hold on to my neck so tight this here paint hoss ain t any

the saddle of the muriel whom he had been addressing nothing was to be seen hi fellows shouted the rider cheerfully this here s a letter fer lieutenant manning he dismounted unsaddled dropped the coils of his stake rope and got his hobbles from the saddle horn while lieutenant manning in command was reading the letter the newcomer rubbed solicitously at some dried mud in the loops of the hobbles showing a consideration for the forelegs of his mount boys said the lieutenant waving his hand to the rangers this is mr james hayes he s a new member of the company captain mclean sends him

lank youth with tow coloured sun burned hair and a berry brown ingenuous face that wore a quizzical good natured smile fellows said the new ranger i m goin to interduce to you a lady friend of mine

poor now i hail says i from the pacific slope ever put up there too draughty says ogden but if you ve ever in the middle west just mention my name and you ll get foot warmers and dripped coffee well says i i wasn t exactly fishing for your private telephone number and the middle name of your aunt that carried off the cumberland presbyterian minister it don t matter i just want you to know you are safe in the hands of your shepherd now don t play hearts on spades and don t get nervous still harping says ogden laughing again don t you suppose that if i was black bill and thought you suspected me i d put a winchester bullet into you and stop my nervousness if i had any not any says i a man who s got the nerve to hold up a train single handed wouldn t do a trick like that i ve knocked about enough to know that them are the kind of men who put a value on a friend not that i can claim being a friend of yours mr ogden says i being only your sheep herder but under more expeditious circumstances we might have been forget the sheep temporarily i beg says ogden and cut for deal about four days afterward while my muttons was nooning on the water hole and i deep in the interstices of making a pot of coffee up rides softly on the grass a mysterious person in the garb of the being he wished to represent he was dressed somewhere between a kansas city detective buffalo bill and the town dog catcher of baton rouge his chin and eye wasn t molded on fighting lines so i knew he was only a scout herdin sheep he asks me well says i to a man of your evident gumptional endowments i wouldn t have the nerve to state that i am engaged in decorating old bronzes or oiling bicycle sprockets you don t talk or look like a sheep herder to me says he but you talk like what you look like to me says i and then he asks me who i was working for and i shows him rancho chiquito two miles away in the shadow of a low hill and he tells me he s a deputy sheriff there s a train robber called black bill supposed to be somewhere in these parts says the scout he s been traced as far as san antonio and maybe farther have you seen or heard of any strangers around here during the past month i have not says i except a report of one over at the mexican quarters of loomis ranch on the frio what do you know about him asks the deputy he s three days old says i what kind of a looking man is the man you work for he asks does old george ramey own this place yet he s run sheep here for the last ten years but never had no success the old man has sold out and gone west i tells him another sheep fancier bought him out about a month ago what kind of a looking man is he asks the deputy again oh says i a big fat kind of a dutchman with long whiskers and blue specs i don t think he knows a sheep from a ground squirrel i guess old george soaked him pretty well on the deal says i after indulging himself in a lot more non communicative information and two thirds of my dinner the deputy rides away that night i mentions the matter to ogden they re drawing the tendrils of the octopus around black bill says i and then i told him about the deputy sheriff and how i d described him to the deputy and what the deputy said about the matter oh well says ogden let s don t borrow any of black bill s troubles we ve a few of our own get the bourbon out of the cupboard and we ll drink to his health unless says he with his little cackling laugh you re prejudiced against train robbers i ll drink says i to any man who s a friend to a friend and i believe that black bill i goes on would be that so here s to black bill and may he have good luck and both of us drank about two weeks later comes shearing time the sheep had to be driven up to the ranch and a lot of frowzy headed mexicans would snip the fur off of them with back action scissors so the afternoon before the barbers were to come i hustled my underdone muttons over the hill across the dell down by the winding brook and up to the ranch house where i penned em in a corral and bade em my nightly adieus i went from there to the ranch house i find h ogden esquire lying asleep on his little cot bed i guess he had been overcome by anti insomnia or diswakefulness or some of the diseases peculiar to the sheep business his mouth and vest were open and he breathed like a second hand bicycle pump i looked at him and gave vent to just a few musings imperial caesar says i asleep in such a way might shut his mouth and keep the wind away a man asleep is certainly a sight to make angels weep what good is all his brain muscle backing nerve influence and family connections he s at the mercy of his enemies and more so of his friends and he s about as beautiful as a cab horse leaning against the metropolitan opera house at a m dreaming of the plains of arabia now a woman asleep you regard as different no matter how she looks you know it s better for

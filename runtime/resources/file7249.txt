praised the stuff we turned out of a skillet and called bread at the end of three weeks idaho makes this kind of a edict to me says he i never exactly heard sour milk dropping out of a balloon on the bottom of a tin pan but i have an idea it would be music of the spears compared to this attenuated stream of asphyxiated thought that emanates out of your organs of conversation the kind of half masticated noises that you emit every day puts me in mind of a cow s cud only she s lady enough to keep hers to herself and you ain t mr green says i you having been a friend of mine once i have some hesitations in confessing to you that if i had my choice for society between you and a common yellow three legged cur pup one of the inmates of this here cabin would be wagging a tail just at present this way we goes on for two or three days and then we quits speaking to one another we divides up the cooking implements and idaho cooks his grub on one side of the fireplace and me on the other the snow is up to the windows and we have to keep a fire all day you see me and idaho never had any education beyond reading and doing if john had three apples and james five on a slate we never felt any special need for a university degree though we had acquired a species of intrinsic intelligence in knocking around the world that we could use in emergencies but snowbound in that cabin in the bitter roots we felt for the first time that if we had studied homer or greek and fractions and the higher branches of information we d have had some resources in the line of meditation and private thought i ve seen them eastern college fellows working in camps all through the west and i never noticed but what education was less of a drawback to em than you would think why once over on snake river when andrew mcwilliams saddle horse got the botts he sent a buckboard ten miles for one of these strangers that claimed to be a botanist but that horse died one morning idaho was poking around with a stick on top of a little shelf that was too high to reach two books fell down to the floor i started toward em but caught idaho s eye he speaks for the first time in a week don t burn your fingers says he in spite of the fact that you re only fit to be the companion of a sleeping mud turtle i ll give you a square deal and that s more than your parents did when they turned you loose in the world with the sociability of a rattle snake and the bedside manner of a frozen turnip i ll play you a game of seven up the winner to pick up his choice of the book the loser to take the other we played and idaho won he picked up his book and i took mine then each of us got on his side of the house and went to reading i never was as glad to see a ten ounce nugget as i was that book and idaho took at his like a kid looks at a stick of candy mine was a little book about five by six inches called herkimer s handbook of indispensable information i may be wrong but i think that was the greatest book that ever was written i ve got it to day and i can stump you or any man fifty times in five minutes with the information in it talk about solomon or the new york tribune herkimer had cases on both of em that man must have put in fifty years and travelled a million miles to find out all that stuff there was the population of all cities in it and the way to tell a girl s age and the number of teeth a camel has it told you the longest tunnel in the world the number of the stars how long it takes for chicken pox to break out what a lady s neck ought to measure the veto powers of governors the dates of the roman aqueducts how many pounds of rice going without three beers a day would buy the average annual temperature of augusta maine the quantity of seed required to plant an acre of carrots in drills antidotes for poisons the number of hairs on a blond lady s head how to preserve eggs the height of all the mountains in the world and the dates of all wars and battles and how to restore drowned persons and sunstroke and the number of tacks in a pound and how to make dynamite and flowers and beds and what to do before the doctor comes and a hundred times as many things besides if there was anything herkimer didn t know i didn t miss it out of the book i sat and read that book for four hours all the wonders of education was compressed in it i forgot the snow and i forgot that me and old idaho was on the outs he was sitting still on a stool reading away with a kind of partly soft and partly mysterious look shining through his tan bark whiskers idaho says i what kind of a book is yours idaho must have forgot too for he answered moderate without any slander or malignity why says he this here seems to be a volume by homer k m homer k m what i asks why just homer k m says he you re a liar says i a little riled that idaho should try to put me up a tree no man is going round signing books with his initials if it s homer k m spoopendyke or homer k m mcsweeney or homer k m jones why don t you say so like a man instead of biting off the end of it like a calf chewing off the tail of a shirt on a clothes line i put it to you straight sandy says idaho quiet it s a poem book says he by homer k m i couldn t get colour out of it at first but there s a vein if you follow it up i wouldn t have missed this book for a pair of red blankets you re welcome to it says i what i want is a disinterested statement of facts for the mind to work on and that s what i seem to find in the book i ve drawn what you ve got says idaho is statistics the lowest grade of information that exists they ll poison your mind give me old k m s system of surmises he seems to be a kind of a wine agent his regular toast is nothing doing and he seems to have a grouch but he keeps it so well lubricated with booze that his worst kicks sound like an invitation to split a quart but it s poetry says idaho and i have sensations of scorn for that truck of yours that tries to convey sense in feet and inches when it comes to explaining the instinct of philosophy through the art of nature old k m has got your man beat by drills rows paragraphs chest measurement and average annual rainfall so that s the way me and idaho had it day and night all the excitement we got was studying our books that snowstorm sure fixed us with a fine lot of attainments apiece by the time the snow melted if you had stepped up to me suddenly and said sanderson pratt what would it cost per square foot to lay a roof with twenty by twenty eight tin at nine dollars and fifty cents per box i d have told you as quick as light could travel the length of a spade handle at the rate of one hundred and ninety two thousand miles per second how many can do it you wake up most any man you know in the middle of the night and ask him quick to tell you the number of bones in the human skeleton exclusive of the teeth or what percentage of the vote of the nebraska legislature overrules a veto will he tell you try him and see about what benefit idaho got out of his poetry book i didn t exactly know idaho boosted the wine agent every time he opened his mouth but i wasn t so sure this homer k m from what leaked out of his libretto through idaho seemed to me to be a kind of a dog who looked at life like it was a tin can tied to his tail after running himself half to death he sits down hangs his tongue out and looks at the can and says oh well since we can t shake the growler let s get it filled at the corner and all have a drink on me besides that it seems he was a persian and i never hear of persia producing anything worth mentioning unless it was turkish rugs and maltese cats that spring me and idaho struck pay ore it was a habit of ours to sell out quick and keep moving we unloaded our grubstaker for eight thousand dollars apiece and then we drifted down to this little town of rosa on the salmon river to rest up and get some human grub and have our whiskers harvested rosa was no mining camp it laid in the valley and was as free of uproar and pestilence as one of them rural towns in the country there was a three mile trolley line champing its bit in the environs and me and idaho spent a week riding on one of the cars dropping off at nights at the sunset view hotel being now well read as well as travelled we was soon pro re nata with the best society in rosa and was invited out to the most dressed up and high toned entertainments it was at a piano recital and quail eating contest in the city hall for the benefit of the fire company that me and idaho first met mrs de ormond sampson the queen of rosa society mrs sampson was a widow and owned the only two story house in town it was painted yellow and whichever way you looked from you could see it as plain as egg on the chin of an o grady on a friday twenty two men in rosa besides me and idaho was trying to stake a claim on that yellow house there was a dance after the song books and quail bones had been raked out of the hall twenty three of the bunch galloped over to mrs sampson and asked for a dance i side stepped the two step and asked permission to escort her home that s where i made a hit on the way home says she ain t the stars lovely and bright to night mr pratt for the chance they ve got says i they re humping themselves in a mighty creditable way that big one you see is sixty six million miles distant it took thirty six years for its light to reach us with an eighteen foot telescope you can see forty three millions of em including them of the thirteenth magnitude which if one was to go out now you would keep on seeing it for twenty seven hundred years my says mrs sampson i never knew that before how warm it is i m as damp as i can be from dancing so much that s easy to account for says i when you happen to know that you ve got two million sweat glands working all at once if every one of your perspiratory ducts which are a quarter of an inch long was placed end to end they would reach a distance of seven miles lawsy says mrs sampson it sounds like an irrigation ditch you was describing mr pratt how do you get all this knowledge of information from observation mrs sampson i tells her i keep my eyes open when i go about the world mr pratt says she i always did admire a man of education there are so few scholars among the sap headed plug uglies of this town that it is a real pleasure to converse with a gentleman of culture i d be gratified to have you call at my house whenever you feel so inclined and that was the way i got the goodwill of the lady in the yellow house every tuesday and friday evening i used to go there and tell her about the wonders of the universe as discovered tabulated and compiled from nature by herkimer idaho and the other gay lutherans of the town got every minute of the rest of the week that they could i never imagined that idaho was trying to work on mrs sampson with old k m s rules of courtship till one afternoon when i was on my way over to take her a basket of wild hog plums i met the lady coming down the lane that led to her house her eyes was snapping and her hat made a dangerous dip over one eye mr pratt she opens up this mr green is a friend of yours i believe for nine years says i cut him out says she he s no gentleman why ma am says i he s a plain incumbent of the mountains with asperities and the usual failings of a spendthrift and a liar but i never on the most momentous occasion had the heart to deny that he was a gentleman it may be that in haberdashery and the sense of arrogance and display idaho offends the eye but inside ma am i ve found him impervious to the lower grades of crime and obesity after nine years of idaho s society mrs sampson i winds up i should hate to impute him and i should hate to see him imputed it s right plausible of you mr pratt says mrs sampson to take up the curmudgeons in your friend s behalf but it don t alter the fact that he has made proposals to me sufficiently obnoxious to ruffle the ignominy of any lady why now now now says i old idaho do that i could believe it of myself sooner i never knew but one thing to deride in him and a blizzard was responsible for that once while we was snow bound in the mountains he became a prey to a kind of spurious and uneven poetry which may have corrupted his demeanour it has says mrs sampson ever since i knew him he has been reciting to me a lot of irreligious rhymes by some person he calls ruby ott and who is no better than she should be if you judge by her poetry then idaho has struck a new book says i for the one he had was by a man who writes under the nom de plume of k m he d better have stuck to it says mrs sampson whatever it was and to day he caps the vortex i get a bunch of flowers from him and on em is pinned a note now mr pratt you know a lady when you see her and you know how i stand in rosa society do you think for a moment that i d skip out to the woods with a man along with a jug of wine and a loaf of bread and go singing and cavorting up and down under the trees with him i take a little claret with my meals but i m not in the habit of packing a jug of it into the brush and raising cain in any such style as that and of course he d bring his book of verses along too he said so let him go on his scandalous picnics alone or let him take his ruby ott with him i reckon she wouldn t kick unless it was on account of there being too much bread along and what do you think of your gentleman friend now mr pratt well m says i it may be that idaho s invitation was a kind of poetry and meant no harm may be it belonged to the class of rhymes they call figurative they offend law and order but they get sent through the mails on the grounds that they mean something that they don t say i d be glad on idaho s account if you d overlook it says i and let us extricate our minds from the low regions of poetry to the higher planes of fact and fancy on a beautiful afternoon like this mrs sampson i goes on we should let our thoughts dwell accordingly though it is warm here we should remember that at the equator the line of perpetual frost is at an altitude of fifteen thousand feet between the latitudes of forty degrees and forty nine degrees it is from four thousand to nine thousand feet oh mr pratt says mrs sampson it s such a comfort to hear you say them beautiful facts after getting such a jar from that minx of a ruby s poetry let us sit on this log at the roadside says i and forget the inhumanity and ribaldry of the poets it is in the glorious columns of ascertained facts and legalised measures that beauty is to be found in this very log we sit upon mrs sampson says i is statistics more wonderful than any poem the rings show it was sixty years old at the depth of two thousand feet it would become coal in three thousand years the deepest coal mine in the world is at killingworth near newcastle a box four feet long three feet wide and two feet eight inches deep will hold one ton of coal if an artery is cut compress it above the wound a man s leg contains thirty bones the tower of london was burned in go on mr pratt says mrs sampson them ideas is so original and soothing i think statistics are just as lovely as they can be but it wasn t till two weeks later that i got all that was coming to me out of herkimer one night i was waked up by folks hollering fire all around i jumped up and dressed and went out of the hotel to enjoy the scene when i see it was mrs sampson s house i gave forth a kind of yell and i was there in two minutes the whole lower story of the yellow house was in flames and every masculine feminine and canine in rosa was there screeching and barking and getting in the way of the firemen i saw idaho trying to get away from six firemen who were holding him they was telling him the whole place was on fire down stairs and no man could go in it and come out alive where s mrs sampson i asks she hasn t been seen says one of the firemen she sleeps up stairs we ve tried to get in but we can t and our company hasn t got any ladders yet i runs around to the light of the big blaze and pulls the handbook out of my inside pocket i kind of laughed when i felt it in my hands i reckon i was some daffy with the sensation of excitement herky old boy i says to it as i flipped over the pages you ain t ever lied to me yet and you ain t ever throwed me down at a scratch yet tell me what old boy tell me what says i i turned to what to do in case of accidents on page i run my finger down the page and struck it good old herkimer he never overlooked anything it said suffocation from inhaling smoke or gas there is nothing better than flaxseed place a few seed in the outer corner of the eye i shoved the handbook back in my pocket and grabbed a boy that was running by here says i giving him some money run to the drug store and bring a dollar s worth of flaxseed hurry and you ll get another one for yourself now i sings out to the crowd we ll have mrs sampson and i throws away my coat and hat four of the firemen and citizens grabs hold of me it s sure death they say to go in the house for the floors was beginning to fall through how in blazes i sings out kind of laughing yet but not feeling like it do you expect me to put flaxseed in a eye without the eye i jabbed each elbow in a fireman s face kicked the bark off of one citizen s shin and tripped the other one with a side hold and then i busted into the house if i die first i ll write you a letter and tell you if it s any worse down there than the inside of that yellow house was but don t believe it yet i was a heap more cooked than the hurry up orders of broiled chicken that you get in restaurants the fire and smoke had me down on the floor twice and was about to shame herkimer but the firemen helped me with their little stream of water and i got to mrs sampson s room she d lost conscientiousness from the smoke so i wrapped her in the bed clothes and got her on my shoulder well the floors wasn t as bad as they said or i never could have done it not by no means i carried her out fifty yards from the house and laid her on the grass then of course every one of them other twenty two plaintiff s to the lady s hand crowded around with tin dippers of water ready to save her and up runs the boy with the flaxseed i unwrapped the covers from mrs sampson s head she opened her eyes and says is that you mr pratt s s sh says i don t talk till you ve had the remedy i runs my arm around her neck and raises her head gentle and breaks the bag of flaxseed with the other hand and as easy as i could i bends over and slips three or four of the seeds in the outer corner of her eye up gallops the village doc by this time and snorts around and grabs at mrs sampson s pulse and wants to know what i mean by any such sandblasted nonsense well old jalap and jerusalem oakseed says i i m no regular practitioner but i ll show you my authority anyway they fetched my coat and i gets out the handbook look on page says i at the remedy for suffocation by smoke or gas flaxseed in the outer corner of the eye it says i don t know whether it works as a smoke consumer or whether it hikes the compound gastro hippopotamus nerve into action but herkimer says it and he was called to the case first if you want to make it a consultation there s no objection old doc takes the book and looks at it by means of his specs and a fireman s lantern well mr pratt says he you evidently got on the wrong line in reading your diagnosis the recipe for suffocation says get the patient into fresh air as quickly as possible and place in a reclining position the flaxseed remedy is for dust and cinders in the eye on the line above but after all see here interrupts mrs sampson i reckon i ve got something to say in this consultation that flaxseed done me more good than anything i ever tried and then she raises up her head and lays it back on my arm again and says put some in the other eye sandy dear and so if you was to stop off at rosa to morrow or any other day you d see a fine new yellow house with mrs pratt that was mrs sampson embellishing and adorning it and if you was to step inside you d see on the marble top centre table in the parlour herkimer s handbook of indispensable information all rebound in red morocco and ready to be consulted on any subject pertaining to human happiness and wisdom the pimienta pancakes while we were rounding up a bunch of the triangle o cattle in the frio bottoms a projecting branch of a dead mesquite caught my wooden stirrup and gave my ankle a wrench that laid me up in camp for a week on the third day of my compulsory idleness i crawled out near the grub wagon and reclined helpless under the conversational fire of judson odom the camp cook jud was a monologist by nature whom destiny with customary blundering had set in a profession wherein he was bereaved for the greater portion of his time of an audience therefore i was manna in the desert of jud s obmutescence betimes i was stirred by invalid longings for something to eat that did not come under the caption of grub i had visions of the maternal pantry deep as first love and wild with all regret and then i asked jud can you make pancakes jud laid down his six shooter with which he was preparing to pound an antelope steak and stood over me in what i felt to be a menacing attitude he further endorsed my impression that his pose was resentful by fixing upon me with his light blue eyes a look of cold suspicion say you he said with candid though not excessive choler did you mean that straight or was you trying to throw the gaff into me some of the boys been telling you about me and that pancake racket no jud i said sincerely i meant it it seems to me i d swap my pony and saddle for a stack of buttered brown pancakes with some first crop open kettle new orleans sweetening was there a story about pancakes jud was mollified at once when he saw that i had not been dealing in allusions he brought some mysterious bags and tin boxes from the grub wagon and set them in the shade of the hackberry where i lay reclined i watched him as he began to arrange them leisurely and untie their many strings no not a story said jud as he worked but just the logical disclosures in the case of me and that pink eyed snoozer from mired mule canada and miss willella learight i don t mind telling you i was punching then for old bill toomey on the san miguel one day i gets all ensnared up in aspirations for to eat some canned grub that hasn t ever mooed or baaed or grunted or been in peck measures so i gets on my bronc and pushes the wind for uncle emsley telfair s store at the pimienta crossing on the nueces about three in the afternoon i throwed my bridle rein over a mesquite limb and walked the last twenty yards into uncle emsley s store i got up on the counter and told uncle emsley that the signs pointed to the devastation of the fruit crop of the world in a minute i had a bag of crackers and a long handled spoon with an open can each of apricots and pineapples and cherries and greengages beside of me with uncle emsley busy chopping away with the hatchet at the yellow clings i was feeling like adam before the apple stampede and was digging my spurs into the side of the counter and working with my twenty four inch spoon when i happened to look out of the window into the yard of uncle emsley s house which was next to the store there was a girl standing there an imported girl with fixings on philandering with a croquet maul and amusing herself by watching my style of encouraging the fruit canning industry i slid off the counter and delivered up my shovel to uncle emsley that s my niece says he miss willella learight down from palestine on a visit do you want that i should make you acquainted the holy land i says to myself my thoughts milling some as i tried to run em into the corral why not there was sure angels in pales why yes uncle emsley i says out loud i d be awful edified to meet miss learight so uncle emsley took me out in the yard and gave us each other s entitlements i never was shy about women i never could understand why some men who can break a mustang before breakfast and shave in the dark get all left handed and full of perspiration and excuses when they see a bold of calico draped around what belongs to it inside of eight minutes me and miss willella was aggravating the croquet balls around as amiable as second cousins she gave me a dig about the quantity of canned fruit i had eaten and i got back at her flat footed about how a certain lady named eve started the fruit trouble in the first free grass pasture over in palestine wasn t it says i as easy and pat as roping a one year old that was how i acquired cordiality for the proximities of miss willella learight and the disposition grew larger as time passed she was stopping at pimienta crossing for her health which was very good and for the climate which was forty per cent hotter than palestine i rode over to see her once every week for a while and then i figured it out that if i doubled the number of trips i would see her twice as often one week i slipped in a third trip and that s where the pancakes and the pink eyed snoozer busted into the game that evening while i set on the counter with a peach and two damsons in my mouth i asked uncle emsley how miss willella was why says uncle emsley she s gone riding with jackson bird the sheep man from over at mired mule canada i swallowed the peach seed and the two damson seeds i guess somebody held the counter by the bridle while i got off and then i walked out straight ahead till i butted against the mesquite where my roan was tied she s gone riding i whisper in my bronc s ear with birdstone jack the hired mule from sheep man s canada did you get that old leather and gallops that bronc of mine wept in his way he d been raised a cow pony and he didn t care for snoozers i went back and said to uncle emsley did you say a sheep man i said a sheep man says uncle emsley again you must have heard tell of jackson bird he s got eight sections of grazing and four thousand head of the finest merinos south of the arctic circle i went out and sat on the ground in the shade of the store and leaned against a prickly pear i sifted sand into my boots with unthinking hands while i soliloquised a quantity about this bird with the jackson plumage to his name i never had believed in harming sheep men i see one one day reading a latin grammar on hossback and i never touched him they never irritated me like they do most cowmen you wouldn t go to work now and impair and disfigure snoozers would you that eat on tables and wear little shoes and speak to you on subjects i had always let em pass just as you would a jack rabbit with a polite word and a guess about the weather but no stopping to swap canteens i never thought it was worth while to be hostile with a snoozer and because i d been lenient and let em live here was one going around riding with miss willella learight an hour by sun they come loping back and stopped at uncle emsley s gate the sheep person helped her off and they stood throwing each other sentences all sprightful and sagacious for a while and then this feathered jackson flies up in his saddle and raises his little stewpot of a hat and trots off in the direction of his mutton ranch by this time i had turned the sand out of my boots and unpinned myself from the prickly pear and by the time he gets half a mile out of pimienta i singlefoots up beside him on my bronc i said that snoozer was pink eyed but he wasn t his seeing arrangement was grey enough but his eye lashes was pink and his hair was sandy and that gave you the idea sheep man he wasn t more than a lamb man anyhow a little thing with his neck involved in a yellow silk handkerchief and shoes tied up in bowknots afternoon says i to him you now ride with a equestrian who is commonly called dead moral certainty judson on account of the way i shoot when i want a stranger to know me i always introduce myself before the draw for i never did like to shake hands with ghosts ah says he just like that ah i m glad to know you mr judson i m jackson bird from over at mired mule ranch just then one of my eyes saw a roadrunner skipping down the hill with a young tarantula in his bill and the other eye noticed a rabbit hawk sitting on a dead limb in a water elm i popped over one after the other with my forty five just to show him two out of three says i birds just naturally seem to draw my fire wherever i go nice shooting says the sheep man without a flutter but don t you sometimes ever miss the third shot elegant fine rain that was last week for the young grass mr judson says he willie says i riding over close to his palfrey your infatuated parents may have denounced you by the name of jackson but you sure moulted into a twittering willie let us slough off this here analysis of rain and the elements and get down to talk that is outside the vocabulary of parrots that is a bad habit you have got of riding with young ladies over at pimienta i ve known birds says i to be served on toast for less than that miss willella says i don t ever want any nest made out of sheep s wool by a tomtit of the jacksonian branch of ornithology now are you going to quit or do you wish for to gallop up against this dead moral certainty attachment to my name which is good for two hyphens and at least one set of funeral obsequies jackson bird flushed up some and then he laughed why mr judson says he you ve got the wrong idea i ve called on miss learight a few times but not for the purpose you imagine my object is purely a gastronomical one i reached for my gun any coyote says i that would boast of dishonourable wait a minute says this bird till i explain what would i do with a wife if you ever saw that ranch of mine i do my own cooking and mending eating that s all the pleasure i get out of sheep raising mr judson did you ever taste the pancakes that miss learight makes me no i told him i never was advised that she was up to any culinary manoeuvres they re golden sunshine says he honey browned by the ambrosial fires of epicurus i d give two years of my life to get the recipe for making them pancakes that s what i went to see miss learight for says jackson bird but i haven t been able to get it from her it s an old recipe that s been in the family for seventy five years they hand it down from one generation to another but they don t give it away to outsiders if i could get that recipe so i could make them pancakes for myself on my ranch i d be a happy man says bird are you sure i says to him that it ain t the hand that mixes the pancakes that you re after sure says jackson miss learight is a mighty nice girl but i can assure you my intentions go no further than the gastro but he seen my hand going down to my holster and he changed his similitude than the desire to procure a copy of the pancake recipe he finishes you ain t such a bad little man says i trying to be fair i was thinking some of making orphans of your sheep but i ll let you fly away this time but you stick to pancakes says i as close as the middle one of a stack and don t go and mistake sentiments for syrup or there ll be singing at your ranch and you won t hear it to convince you that i am sincere says the sheep man i ll ask you to help me miss learight and you being closer friends maybe she would do for you what she wouldn t for me if you will get me a copy of that pancake recipe i give you my word that i ll never call upon her again that s fair i says and i shook hands with jackson bird i ll get it for you if i can and glad to oblige and he turned off down the big pear flat on the piedra in the direction of mired mule and i steered northwest for old bill toomey s ranch it was five days afterward when i got another chance to ride over to pimienta miss willella and me passed a gratifying evening at uncle emsley s she sang some and exasperated the piano quite a lot with quotations from the operas i gave imitations of a rattlesnake and told her about snaky mcfee s new way of skinning cows and described the trip i made to saint louis once we was getting along in one another s estimations fine thinks i if jackson bird can now be persuaded to migrate i win i recollect his promise about the pancake receipt and i thinks i will persuade it from miss willella and give it to him and then if i catches birdie off of mired mule again i ll make him hop the twig so along about ten o clock i put on a wheedling smile and says to miss willella now if there s anything i do like better than the sight of a red steer on green grass it s the taste of a nice hot pancake smothered in sugar house molasses miss willella gives a little jump on the piano stool and looked at me curious yes says she they re real nice what did you say was the name of that street in saint louis mr odom where you lost your hat pancake avenue says i with a wink to show her that i was on about the family receipt and couldn t be side corralled off of the subject come now miss willella i says let s hear how you make em pancakes is just whirling in my head like wagon wheels start her off now pound of flour eight dozen eggs and so on how does the catalogue of constituents run excuse me for a moment please says miss willella and she gives me a quick kind of sideways look and slides off the stool she ambled out into the other room and directly uncle emsley comes in in his shirt sleeves with a pitcher of water he turns around to get a glass on the table and i see a forty five in his hip pocket great post holes thinks i but here s a family thinks a heap of cooking receipts protecting it with firearms i ve known outfits that wouldn t do that much by a family feud drink this here down says uncle emsley handing me the glass of water you ve rid too far to day jud and got yourself over excited try to think about something else now do you know how to make them pancakes uncle emsley i asked well i m not as apprised in the anatomy of them as some says uncle emsley but i reckon you take a sifter of plaster of paris and a little dough and saleratus and corn meal and mix em with eggs and buttermilk as usual is old bill going to ship beeves to kansas city again this spring jud that was all the pancake specifications i could get that night i didn t wonder that jackson bird found it uphill work so i dropped the subject and talked with uncle emsley for a while about hollow horn and cyclones and then miss willella came and said good night and i hit the breeze for the ranch about a week afterward i met jackson bird riding out of pimienta as i rode in and we stopped on the road for a few frivolous remarks got the bill of particulars for them flapjacks yet i asked him well no says jackson i don t seem to have any success in getting hold of it did you try i did says i and twas like trying to dig a prairie dog out of his hole with a peanut hull that pancake receipt must be a jookalorum the way they hold on to it i m most ready to give it up says jackson so discouraged in his pronunciations that i felt sorry for him but i did want to know how to make them pancakes to eat on my lonely ranch says he i lie awake at nights thinking how good they are you keep on trying for it i tells him and i ll do the same one of us is bound to get a rope over its horns before long well so long jacksy you see by this time we were on the peacefullest of terms when i saw that he wasn t after miss willella i had more endurable contemplations of that sandy haired snoozer in order to help out the ambitions of his appetite i kept on trying to get that receipt from miss willella but every time i would say pancakes she would get sort of remote and fidgety about the eye and try to change the subject if i held her to it she would slide out and round up uncle emsley with his pitcher of water and hip pocket howitzer one day i galloped over to the store with a fine bunch of blue verbenas that i cut out of a herd of wild flowers over on poisoned dog prairie uncle emsley looked at em with one eye shut and says haven t ye heard the news cattle up i asks willella and jackson bird was married in palestine yesterday says he just got a letter this morning i dropped them flowers in a cracker barrel and let the news trickle in my ears and down toward my upper left hand shirt pocket until it got to my feet would you mind saying that over again once more uncle emsley says i maybe my hearing has got wrong and you only said that prime heifers was on the hoof or something like that married yesterday says uncle emsley and gone to waco and niagara falls on a wedding tour why didn t you see none of the signs all along jackson bird has been courting willella ever since that day he took her out riding then says i in a kind of yell what was all this zizzaparoola he gives me about pancakes tell me that when i said pancakes uncle emsley sort of dodged and stepped back somebody s been dealing me pancakes from the bottom of the deck i says and i ll find out i believe you know talk up says i or we ll mix a panful of batter right here i slid over the counter after uncle emsley he grabbed at his gun but it was in a drawer and he missed it two inches i got him by the front of his shirt and shoved him in a corner talk pancakes says i or be made into one does miss willella make em she never made one in her life and i never saw one says uncle emsley soothing calm down now jud calm down you ve got excited and that wound in your head is contaminating your sense of intelligence try not to think about pancakes uncle emsley says i i m not wounded in the head except so far as my natural cognitive instincts run to runts jackson bird told me he was calling on miss willella for the purpose of finding out her system of producing pancakes and he asked me to help him get the bill of lading of the ingredients i done so with the results as you see have i been sodded down with johnson grass by a pink eyed snoozer or what slack up your grip in my dress shirt says uncle emsley and i ll tell you yes it looks like jackson bird has gone and humbugged you some the day after he went riding with willella he came back and told me and her to watch out for you whenever you got to talking about pancakes he said you was in camp once where they was cooking flapjacks and one of the fellows cut you over the head with a frying pan jackson said that whenever you got overhot or excited that wound hurt you and made you kind of crazy and you went raving about pancakes he told us to just get you worked off of the subject and soothed down and you wouldn t be dangerous so me and willella done the best by you we knew how well well says uncle emsley that jackson bird is sure a seldom kind of a snoozer during the progress of jud s story he had been slowly but deftly combining certain portions of the contents of his sacks and cans toward the close of it he set before me the finished product a pair of red hot rich hued pancakes on a tin plate from some secret hoarding he also brought a lump of excellent butter and a bottle of golden syrup how long ago did these things happen i asked him three years said jud they re living on the mired mule ranch now but i haven t seen either of em since they say jackson bird was fixing his ranch up fine with rocking chairs and window curtains all the time he was putting me up the pancake tree oh i got over it after a while but the boys kept the racket up did you make these cakes by the famous recipe i asked didn t i tell you there wasn t no receipt said jud the boys hollered pancakes till they got pancake hungry and i cut this recipe out of a newspaper how does the truck taste they re delicious i answered why don t you have some too jud i was sure i heard a sigh me said jud i don t ever eat em seats of the haughty golden by day and silver by night a new trail now leads to us across the indian ocean dusky kings and princes have found our bombay of the west and few be their trails that do not lead down to broadway on their journey for to admire and for to see if chance should ever lead you near a hotel that transiently shelters some one of these splendid touring grandees i counsel you to seek lucullus polk among the republican tuft hunters that besiege its entrances he will be there you will know him by his red alert wellington nosed face by his manner of nervous caution mingled with determination by his assumed promoter s or broker s air of busy impatience and by his bright red necktie gallantly redressing the wrongs of his maltreated blue serge suit like a battle standard still waving above a lost cause i found him profitable and so may you when you do look for him look among the light horse troop of bedouins that besiege the picket line of the travelling potentate s guards and secretaries among the wild eyed genii of arabian afternoons that gather to make astounding and egregrious demands upon the prince s coffers i first saw mr polk coming down the steps of the hotel at which sojourned his highness the gaekwar of baroda most enlightened of the mahratta princes who of late ate bread and salt in our metropolis of the occident lucullus moved rapidly as though propelled by some potent moral force that imminently threatened to become physical behind him closely followed the impetus a hotel detective if ever white alpine hat hawk s nose implacable watch chain and loud refinement of manner spoke the truth a brace of uniformed porters at his heels preserved the smooth decorum of the hotel repudiating by their air of disengagement any suspicion that they formed a reserve squad of ejectment safe on the sidewalk lucullus polk turned and shook a freckled fist at the caravansary and to my joy he began to breathe deep invective in strange words rides in howdays does he he cried loudly and sneeringly rides on elephants in howdahs and calls himself a prince kings yah comes over here and talks horse till you would think he was a president and then goes home and rides in a private dining room strapped onto an elephant well well well the ejecting committee quietly retired the scorner of princes turned to me and snapped his fingers what do you think of that he shouted derisively the gaekwar of baroda rides in an elephant in a howdah and there s old bikram shamsher jang scorching up and down the pig paths of khatmandu on a motor cycle wouldn t that maharajah you and the shah of persia that ought to have been muley on the spot for at least three he s got the palanquin habit and that funny hat prince from korea wouldn t you think he could afford to amble around on a milk white palfrey once in a dynasty or two nothing doing his idea of a balaklava charge is to tuck his skirts under him and do his mile in six days over the hog wallows of seoul in a bull cart that s the kind of visiting potentates that come to this country now it s a hard deal friend i murmured a few words of sympathy but it was uncomprehending for i did not know his grievance against the rulers who flash meteor like now and then upon our shores the last one i sold continued the displeased one was to that three horse tailed turkish pasha that came over a year ago five hundred dollars he paid for it easy i says to his executioner or secretary he was a kind of a jew or a chinaman his turkey gibbets is fond of horses then him says the secretary well no he s got a big fat wife in the harem named bad dora that he don t like i believe he intends to saddle her up and ride her up and down the board walk in the bulbul gardens a few times every day you haven t got a pair of extra long spurs you could throw in on the deal have you yes sir there s mighty few real rough riders among the royal sports these days as soon as lucullus polk got cool enough i picked him up and with no greater effort than you would employ in persuading a drowning man to clutch a straw i inveigled him into accompanying me to a cool corner in a dim cafe and it came to pass that man servants set before us brewage and lucullus polk spake unto me relating the wherefores of his beleaguering the antechambers of the princes of the earth did you ever hear of the s a a p railroad in texas well that don t stand for samaritan actor s aid philanthropy i was down that way managing a summer bunch of the gum and syntax chewers that play the idlewild parks in the western hamlets of course we went to pieces when the soubrette ran away with a prominent barber of beeville i don t know what became of the rest of the company i believe there were some salaries due and the last i saw of the troupe was when i told them that forty three cents was all the treasury contained i say i never saw any of them after that but i heard them for about twenty minutes i didn t have time to look back but after dark i came out of the woods and struck the s a a p agent for means of transportation he at once extended to me the courtesies of the entire railroad kindly warning me however not to get aboard any of the rolling stock about ten the next morning i steps off the ties into a village that calls itself atascosa city i bought a thirty cent breakfast and a ten cent cigar and stood on the main street jingling the three pennies in my pocket dead broke a man in texas with only three cents in his pocket is no better off than a man that has no money and owes two cents one of luck s favourite tricks is to soak a man for his last dollar so quick that he don t have time to look it there i was in a swell st louis tailor made blue and green plaid suit and an eighteen carat sulphate of copper scarf pin with no hope in sight except the two great texas industries the cotton fields and grading new railroads i never picked cotton and i never cottoned to a pick so the outlook had ultramarine edges all of a sudden while i was standing on the edge of the wooden sidewalk down out of the sky falls two fine gold watches in the middle of the street one hits a chunk of mud and sticks the other falls hard and flies open making a fine drizzle of little springs and screws and wheels i looks up for a balloon or an airship but not seeing any i steps off the sidewalk to investigate but i hear a couple of yells and see two men running up the street in leather overalls and high heeled boots and cartwheel hats one man is six or eight feet high with open plumbed joints and a heartbroken cast of countenance he picks up the watch that has stuck in the mud the other man who is little with pink hair and white eyes goes for the empty case and says i win then the elevated pessimist goes down under his leather leg holsters and hands a handful of twenty dollar gold pieces to his albino friend i don t know how much money it was it looked as big as an earthquake relief fund to me i ll have this here case filled up with works says shorty and throw you again for five hundred i m your company says the high man i ll meet you at the smoked dog saloon an hour from now the little man hustles away with a kind of swiss movement toward a jewelry store the heartbroken person stoops over and takes a telescopic view of my haberdashery them s a mighty slick outfit of habiliments you have got on mr man says he i ll bet a hoss you never acquired the right title and interest in and to them clothes in atascosa city why no says i being ready enough to exchange personalities with this moneyed monument of melancholy i had this suit tailored from a special line of coatericks vestures and pantings in st louis would you mind putting me sane says i on this watch throwing contest i ve been used to seeing time pieces treated with more politeness and esteem except women s watches of course which by nature they abuse by cracking walnuts with em and having em taken showing in tintype pictures me and george he explains are up from the ranch having a spell of fun up to last month we owned four sections of watered grazing down on the san miguel but along comes one of these oil prospectors and begins to bore he strikes a gusher that flows out twenty thousand or maybe it was twenty million barrels of oil a day and me and george gets one hundred and fifty thousand dollars seventy five thousand dollars apiece for the land so now and then we saddles up and hits the breeze for atascosa city for a few days of excitement and damage here s a little bunch of the dinero that i drawed out of the bank this morning says he and shows a roll of twenties and fifties as big around as a sleeping car pillow the yellowbacks glowed like a sunset on the gable end of john d s barn my knees got weak and i sat down on the edge of the board sidewalk you must have knocked around a right smart goes on this oil grease us i shouldn t be surprised if you have saw towns more livelier than what atascosa city is sometimes it seems to me that there ought to be some more ways of having a good time than there is here specially when you ve got plenty of money and don t mind spending it then this mother cary s chick of the desert sits down by me and we hold a conversationfest it seems that he was money poor he d lived in ranch camps all his life and he confessed to me that his supreme idea of luxury was to ride into camp tired out from a round up eat a peck of mexican beans hobble his brains with a pint of raw whisky and go to sleep with his boots for a pillow when this barge load of unexpected money came to him and his pink but perky partner george and they hied themselves to this clump of outhouses called atascosa city you know what

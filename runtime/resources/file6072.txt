licked you into shape like a leopard cat licks its cubs you don t belong to yourself you ve got to be a truesdell first now is there to be any more nonsense about this curtis girl i ll tell you once more said ranse slowly as i am a truesdell and as you are my father i ll never marry a curtis good boy said old kiowa you d better go get some supper ranse went to the kitchen at the rear of the house pedro the mexican cook sprang up to bring the food he was keeping warm in the stove just a cup of coffee pedro he said and drank it standing and then there s a tramp on a cot in the wagon shed take him something to eat better make it enough for two ranse walked out toward the jacals a boy came running manuel can you catch vaminos in the little pasture for me why not senor i saw him near the puerta but two hours past he bears a drag rope get him and saddle him as quick as you can prontito senor soon mounted on vaminos ranse leaned in the saddle pressed with his knees and galloped eastward past the store where sat sam trying his guitar in the moonlight vaminos shall have a word vaminos the good dun horse the mexicans who have a hundred names for the colours of a horse called him gruyo he was a mouse coloured slate coloured flea bitten roan dun if you can conceive it down his back from his mane to his tail went a line of black he would live forever and surveyors have not laid off as many miles in the world as he could travel in a day eight miles east of the cibolo ranch house ranse loosened the pressure of his knees and vaminos stopped under a big ratama tree the yellow ratama blossoms showered fragrance that would have undone the roses of france the moon made the earth a great concave bowl with a crystal sky for a lid in a glade five jack rabbits leaped and played together like kittens eight miles farther east shone a faint star that appeared to have dropped below the horizon night riders who often steered their course by it knew it to be the light in the rancho de los olmos in ten minutes yenna curtis galloped to the tree on her sorrel pony dancer the two leaned and clasped hands heartily i ought to have ridden nearer your home said ranse but you never will let me yenna laughed and in the soft light you could see her strong white teeth and fearless eyes no sentimentality there in spite of the moonlight the odour of the ratamas and the admirable figure of ranse truesdell the lover but she was there eight miles from her home to meet him how often have i told you ranse she said that i am your half way girl always half way well said ranse with a question in his tones i did said yenna with almost a sigh i told him after dinner when i thought he would be in a good humour did you ever wake up a lion ranse with the mistaken idea that he would be a kitten he almost tore the ranch to pieces it s all up i love my daddy ranse and i m afraid i m afraid of him too he ordered me to promise that i d never marry a truesdell i promised that s all what luck did you have the same said ranse slowly i promised him that his son would never marry a curtis somehow i couldn t go against him he s mighty old i m sorry yenna the girl leaned in her saddle and laid one hand on ranse s on the horn of his saddle i never thought i d like you better for giving me up she said ardently but i do i must ride back now ranse i slipped out of the house and saddled dancer myself good night neighbour good night said ranse ride carefully over them badger holes they wheeled and rode away in opposite directions yenna turned in her saddle and called clearly don t forget i m your half way girl ranse damn all family feuds and inherited scraps muttered ranse vindictively to the breeze as he rode back to the cibolo ranse turned his horse into the small pasture and went to his own room he opened the lowest drawer of an old bureau to get out the packet of letters that yenna had written him one summer when she had gone to mississippi for a visit the drawer stuck and he yanked at it savagely as a man will it came out of the bureau and bruised both his shins as a drawer will an old folded yellow letter without an envelope fell from somewhere probably from where it had lodged in one of the upper drawers ranse took it to the lamp and read it curiously then he took his hat and walked to one of the mexican jacals tia juana he said i would like to talk with you a while an old old mexican woman white haired and wonderfully wrinkled rose from a stool sit down said ranse removing his hat and taking the one chair in the jacal who am i tia juana he asked speaking spanish don ransom our good friend and employer why do you ask answered the old woman wonderingly tia juana who am i he repeated with his stern eyes looking into hers a frightened look came in the old woman s face she fumbled with her black shawl who am i tia juana said ranse once more thirty two years i have lived on the rancho cibolo said tia juana i thought to be buried under the coma mott beyond the garden before these things should be known close the door don ransom and i will speak i see in your face that you know an hour ranse spent behind tia juana s closed door as he was on his way back to the house curly called to him from the wagon shed the tramp sat on his cot swinging his feet and smoking say sport he grumbled this is no way to treat a man after kidnappin him i went up to the store and borrowed a razor from that fresh guy and had a shave but that ain t all a man needs say can t you loosen up for about three fingers more of that booze i never asked you to bring me to your d d farm stand up out here in the light said ranse looking at him closely curly got up sullenly and took a step or two his face now shaven smooth seemed transformed his hair had been combed and it fell back from the right side of his forehead with a peculiar wave the moonlight charitably softened the ravages of drink and his aquiline well shaped nose and small square cleft chin almost gave distinction to his looks ranse sat on the foot of the cot and looked at him curiously where did you come from have you got any home or folks anywhere me why i m a dook said curly i m sir reginald oh cheese it no i don t know anything about my ancestors i ve been a tramp ever since i can remember say old pal are you going to set em up again to night or not you answer my questions and maybe i will how did you come to be a tramp me answered curly why i adopted that profession when i was an infant case of had to first thing i can remember i belonged to a big lazy hobo called beefsteak charley he sent me around to houses to beg i wasn t hardly big enough to reach the latch of a gate did he ever tell you how he got you asked ranse once when he was sober he said he bought me for an old six shooter and six bits from a band of drunken mexican sheep shearers but what s the diff that s all i know all right said ranse i reckon you re a maverick for certain i m going to put the rancho cibolo brand on you i ll start you to work in one of the camps to morrow work sniffed curly disdainfully what do you take me for do you think i d chase cows and hop skip and jump around after crazy sheep like that pink and yellow guy at the store says these reubs do forget it oh you ll like it when you get used to it said ranse yes i ll send you up one more drink by pedro i think you ll make a first class cowpuncher before i get through with you me said curly i pity the cows you set me to chaperon they can go chase themselves don t forget my nightcap please boss ranse paid a visit to the store before going to the house sam rivell was taking off his tan shoes regretting and preparing for bed any of the boys from the san gabriel camp riding in early in the morning asked ranse long collins said sam briefly for the mail tell him said ranse to take that tramp out to camp with him and keep him till i get there curly was sitting on his blankets in the san gabriel camp cursing talentedly when ranse truesdell rode up and dismounted on the next afternoon the cowpunchers were ignoring the stray he was grimy with dust and black dirt his clothes were making their last stand in favour of the conventions ranse went up to buck rabb the camp boss and spoke briefly he s a plumb buzzard said buck he won t work and he s the low downest passel of inhumanity i ever see i didn t know what you wanted done with him ranse so i just let him set that seems to suit him he s been condemned to death by the boys a dozen times but i told em maybe you was savin him for the torture ranse took off his coat i ve got a hard job before me buck i reckon but it has to be done i ve got to make a man out of that thing that s what i ve come to camp for he went up to curly brother he said don t you think if you had a bath it would allow you to take a seat in the company of your fellow man with less injustice to the atmosphere run away farmer said curly sardonically willie will send for nursey when he feels like having his tub the charco or water hole was twelve yards away ranse took one of curly s ankles and dragged him like a sack of potatoes to the brink then with the strength and sleight of a hammer throw he hurled the offending member of society far into the lake curly crawled out and up the bank spluttering like a porpoise ranse met him with a piece of soap and a coarse towel in his hands go to the other end of the lake and use this he said buck will give you some dry clothes at the wagon the tramp obeyed without protest by the time supper was ready he had returned to camp he was hardly to be recognised in his new shirt and brown duck clothes ranse observed him out of the corner of his eye lordy i hope he ain t a coward he was saying to himself i hope he won t turn out to be a coward his doubts were soon allayed curly walked straight to where he stood his light blue eyes were blazing now i m clean he said meaningly maybe you ll talk to me think you ve got a picnic here do you you clodhoppers think you can run over a man because you know he can t get away all right now what do you think of that curly planted a stinging slap against ranse s left cheek the print of his hand stood out a dull red against the tan ranse smiled happily the cowpunchers talk to this day of the battle that followed somewhere in his restless tour of the cities curly had acquired the art of self defence the ranchman was equipped only with the splendid strength and equilibrium of perfect health and the endurance conferred by decent living the two attributes nearly matched there were no formal rounds at last the fibre of the clean liver prevailed the last time curly went down from one of the ranchman s awkward but powerful blows he remained on the grass but looking up with an unquenched eye ranse went to the water barrel and washed the red from a cut on his chin in the stream from the faucet on his face was a grin of satisfaction much benefit might accrue to educators and moralists if they could know the details of the curriculum of reclamation through which ranse put his waif during the month that he spent in the san gabriel camp the ranchman had no fine theories to work out perhaps his whole stock of pedagogy embraced only a knowledge of horse breaking and a belief in heredity the cowpunchers saw that their boss was trying to make a man out of the strange animal that he had sent among them and they tacitly organised themselves into a faculty of assistants but their system was their own curly s first lesson stuck he became on friendly and then on intimate terms with soap and water and the thing that pleased ranse most was that his subject held his ground at each successive higher step but the steps were sometimes far apart once he got at the quart bottle of whisky kept sacredly in the grub tent for rattlesnake bites and spent sixteen hours on the grass magnificently drunk but when he staggered to his feet his first move was to find his soap and towel and start for the charco and once when a treat came from the ranch in the form of a basket of fresh tomatoes and young onions curly devoured the entire consignment before the punchers reached the camp at supper time and then the punchers punished him in their own way for three days they did not speak to him except to reply to his own questions or remarks and they spoke with absolute and unfailing politeness they played tricks on one another they pounded one another hurtfully and affectionately they heaped upon one another s heads friendly curses and obloquy but they were polite to curly he saw it and it stung him as much as ranse hoped it would then came a night that brought a cold wet norther wilson the youngest of the outfit had lain in camp two days ill with fever when joe got up at daylight to begin breakfast he found curly sitting asleep against a wheel of the grub wagon with only a saddle blanket around him while curly s blankets were stretched over wilson to protect him from the rain and wind three nights after that curly rolled himself in his blanket and went to sleep then the other punchers rose up softly and began to make preparations ranse saw long collins tie a rope to the horn of a saddle others were getting out their six shooters boys said ranse i m much obliged i was hoping you would but i didn t like to ask half a dozen six shooters began to pop awful yells rent the air long collins galloped wildly across curly s bed dragging the saddle after him that was merely their way of gently awaking their victim then they hazed him for an hour carefully and ridiculously after the code of cow camps whenever he uttered protest they held him stretched over a roll of blankets and thrashed him woefully with a pair of leather leggings and all this meant that curly had won his spurs that he was receiving the puncher s accolade nevermore would they be polite to him but he would be their pardner and stirrup brother foot to foot when the fooling was ended all hands made a raid on joe s big coffee pot by the fire for a java nightcap ranse watched the new knight carefully to see if he understood and was worthy curly limped with his cup of coffee to a log and sat upon it long collins followed and sat by his side buck rabb went and sat at the other curly grinned and then ranse furnished curly with mounts and saddle and equipment and turned him over to buck rabb instructing him to finish the job three weeks later ranse rode from the ranch into rabb s camp which was then in snake valley the boys were saddling for the day s ride he sought out long collins among them how about that bronco he asked long collins grinned reach out your hand ranse truesdell he said and you ll touch him and you can shake his n too if you like for he s plumb white and there s none better in no camp ranse looked again at the clear faced bronzed smiling cowpuncher who stood at collins s side could that be curly he held out his hand and curly grasped it with the muscles of a bronco buster i want you at the ranch said ranse all right sport said curly heartily but i want to come back again say pal this is a dandy farm and i don t want any better fun than hustlin cows with this bunch of guys they re all to the merry merry at the cibolo ranch house they dismounted ranse bade curly wait at the door of the living room he walked inside old kiowa truesdell was reading at a table good morning mr truesdell said ranse the old man turned his white head quickly how is this he began why do you call me mr when he looked at ranse s face he stopped and the hand that held his newspaper shook slightly boy he said slowly how did you find it out it s all right said ranse with a smile i made tia juana tell me it was kind of by accident but it s all right you ve been like a son to me said old kiowa trembling tia juana told me all about it said ranse she told me how you adopted me when i was knee high to a puddle duck out of a wagon train of prospectors that was bound west and she told me how the kid your own kid you know got lost or was run away with and she said it was the same day that the sheep shearers got on a bender and left the ranch our boy strayed from the house when he was two years old said the old man and then along came those emigrant wagons with a youngster they didn t want and we took you i never intended you to know ranse we never heard of our boy again he s right outside unless i m mighty mistaken said ranse opening the door and beckoning curly walked in no one could have doubted the old man and the young had the same sweep of hair the same nose chin line of face and prominent light blue eyes old kiowa rose eagerly curly looked about the room curiously a puzzled expression came over his face he pointed to the wall opposite where s the tick tock he asked absent mindedly the clock cried old kiowa loudly the eight day clock used to stand there why he turned to ranse but ranse was not there already a hundred yards away vaminos the good flea bitten dun was bearing him eastward like a racer through dust and chaparral towards the rancho de los olmos cupid a la carte the dispositions of woman said jeff peters after various opinions on the subject had been advanced run regular to diversions what a woman wants is what you re out of she wants more of a thing when it s scarce she likes to have souvenirs of things that never happened she likes to be reminded of things she never heard of a one sided view of objects is disjointing to the female composition tis a misfortune of mine begotten by nature and travel continued jeff looking thoughtfully between his elevated feet at the grocery stove to look deeper into some subjects than most people do i ve breathed gasoline smoke talking to street crowds in nearly every town in the united states i ve held em spellbound with music oratory sleight of hand and prevarications while i ve sold em jewelry medicine soap hair tonic and junk of other nominations and during my travels as a matter of recreation and expiation i ve taken cognisance some of women it takes a man a lifetime to find out about one particular woman but if he puts in say ten years industrious and curious he can acquire the general rudiments of the sex one lesson i picked up was when i was working the west with a line of brazilian diamonds and a patent fire kindler just after my trip from savannah down through the cotton belt with dalby s anti explosive lamp oil powder twas when the oklahoma country was in first bloom guthrie was rising in the middle of it like a lump of self raising dough it was a boom town of the regular kind you stood in line to get a chance to wash your face if you ate over ten minutes you had a lodging bill added on if you slept on a plank at night they charged it to you as board the next morning by nature and doctrines i am addicted to the habit of discovering choice places wherein to feed so i looked around and found a proposition that exactly cut the mustard i found a restaurant tent just opened up by an outfit that had drifted in on the tail of the boom they had knocked together a box house where they lived and did the cooking and served the meals in a tent pitched against the side that tent was joyful with placards on it calculated to redeem the world worn pilgrim from the sinfulness of boarding houses and pick me up hotels try mother s home made biscuits what s the matter with our apple dumplings and hard sauce hot cakes and maple syrup like you ate when a boy our fried chicken never was heard to crow there was literature doomed to please the digestions of man i said to myself that mother s wandering boy should munch there that night and so it came to pass and there is where i contracted my case of mame dugan old man dugan was six feet by one of indiana loafer and he spent his time sitting on his shoulder blades in a rocking chair in the shanty memorialising the great corn crop failure of ma dugan did the cooking and mame waited on the table as soon as i saw mame i knew there was a mistake in the census reports there wasn t but one girl in the united states when you come to specifications it isn t easy she was about the size of an angel and she had eyes and ways about her when you come to the kind of a girl she was you ll find a belt of em reaching from the brooklyn bridge west as far as the courthouse in council bluffs ia they earn their own living in stores restaurants factories and offices they re chummy and honest and free and tender and sassy and they look life straight in the eye they ve met man face to face and discovered that he s a poor creature they ve dropped to it that the reports in the seaside library about his being a fairy prince lack confirmation mame was that sort she was full of life and fun and breezy she passed the repartee with the boarders quick as a wink you d have smothered laughing i am disinclined to make excavations into the insides of a personal affection i am glued to the theory that the diversions and discrepancies of the indisposition known as love should be as private a sentiment as a toothbrush tis my opinion that the biographies of the heart should be confined with the historical romances of the liver to the advertising pages of the magazines so you ll excuse the lack of an itemised bill of my feelings toward mame pretty soon i got a regular habit of dropping into the tent to eat at irregular times when there wasn t so many around mame would sail in with a smile in a black dress and white apron and say hello jeff why don t you come at mealtime want to see how much trouble you can be of course friedchickenbeefsteakporkchopshamandeggspotpie and so on she called me jeff but there was no significations attached designations was all she meant the front names of any of us she used as they came to hand i d eat about two meals before i left and string em out like a society spread where they changed plates and wives and josh one another festively between bites mame stood for it pleasant for it wasn t up to her to take any canvas off the tent by declining dollars just because they were whipped in after meal times it wasn t long until there was another fellow named ed collier got the between meals affliction and him and me put in bridges between breakfast and dinner and dinner and supper that made a three ringed circus of that tent and mame s turn as waiter a continuous performance that collier man was saturated with designs and contrivings he was in well boring or insurance or claim jumping or something i ve forgotten which he was a man well lubricated with gentility and his words were such as recommended you to his point of view so collier and me infested the grub tent with care and activity mame was level full of impartiality twas like a casino hand the way she dealt out her favours one to collier and one to me and one to the board and not a card up her sleeve me and collier naturally got acquainted and gravitated together some on the outside divested of his stratagems he seemed to be a pleasant chap full of an amiable sort of hostility i notice you have an affinity for grubbing in the banquet hall after the guests have fled says i to him one day to draw his conclusions well yes says collier reflecting the tumult of a crowded board seems to harass my sensitive nerves it exasperates mine some too says i nice little girl don t you think i see says collier laughing well now that you mention it i have noticed that she doesn t seem to displease the optic nerve she s a joy to mine says i and i m going after her notice is hereby served i ll be as candid as you admits collier and if the drug stores don t run out of pepsin i ll give you a run for your money that ll leave you a dyspeptic at the wind up so collier and me begins the race the grub department lays in new supplies mame waits on us jolly and kind and agreeable and it looks like an even break with cupid and the cook working overtime in dugan s restaurant twas one night in september when i got mame to take a walk after supper when the things were all cleared away we strolled out a distance and sat on a pile of lumber at the edge of town such opportunities was seldom so i spoke my piece explaining how the brazilian diamonds and the fire kindler were laying up sufficient treasure to guarantee the happiness of two and that both of em together couldn t equal the light from somebody s eyes and that the name of dugan should be changed to peters or reasons why not would be in order mame didn t say anything right away directly she gave a kind of shudder and i began to learn something jeff she says i m sorry you spoke i like you as well as any of them but there isn t a man in the world i d ever marry and there never will be do you know what a man is in my eye he s a tomb he s a sarcophagus for the interment of beafsteakporkchopsliver nbaconham andeggs he s that and nothing more for two years i ve watched men eat eat eat until they represent nothing on earth to me but ruminant bipeds they re absolutely nothing but something that goes in front of a knife and fork and plate at the table they re fixed that way in my mind and memory i ve tried to overcome it but i can t i ve heard girls rave about their sweethearts but i never could understand it a man and a sausage grinder and a pantry awake in me exactly the same sentiments i went to a matinee once to see an actor the girls were crazy about i got interested enough to wonder whether he liked his steak rare medium or well done and his eggs over or straight up that was all no jeff i ll marry no man and see him sit at the breakfast table and eat and come back to dinner and eat and happen in again at supper to eat eat eat but mame says i it ll wear off you ve had too much of it you ll marry some time of course men don t eat always as far as my observation goes they do no i ll tell you what i m going to do mame turns sudden to animation and bright eyes there s a girl named susie foster in terre haute a chum of mine she waits in the railroad eating house there i worked two years in a restaurant in that town susie has it worse than i do because the men who eat at railroad stations gobble they try to flirt and gobble at the same time whew susie and i have it all planned out we re saving our money and when we get enough we re going to buy a little cottage and five acres we know of and live together and grow violets for the eastern market a man better not bring his appetite within a mile of that ranch don t girls ever i commenced but mame heads me off sharp no they don t they nibble a little bit sometimes that s all i thought the confect for goodness sake change the subject says mame as i said before that experience puts me wise that the feminine arrangement ever struggles after deceptions and illusions take england beef made her wieners elevated germany uncle sam owes his greatness to fried chicken and pie but the young ladies of the shetalkyou schools they ll never believe it shakespeare they allow and rubinstein and the rough riders is what did the trick twas a situation calculated to disturb i couldn t bear to give up mame and yet it pained me to think of abandoning the practice of eating i had acquired the habit too early for twenty seven years i had been blindly rushing upon my fate yielding to the insidious lures of that deadly monster food it was too late i was a ruminant biped for keeps it was lobster salad to a doughnut that my life was going to be blighted by it i continued to board at the dugan tent hoping that mame would relent i had sufficient faith in true love to believe that since it has often outlived the absence of a square meal it might in time overcome the presence of one i went on ministering to my fatal vice although i felt that each time i shoved a potato into my mouth in mame s presence i might be burying my fondest hopes i think collier must have spoken to mame and got the same answer for one day he orders a cup of coffee and a cracker and sits nibbling the corner of it like a girl in the parlour that s filled up in the kitchen previous on cold roast and fried cabbage i caught on and did the same and maybe we thought we d made a hit the next day we tried it again and out comes old man dugan fetching in his hands the fairy viands kinder off yer feed ain t ye gents he asks fatherly and some sardonic thought i d spell mame a bit seein the work was light and my rheumatiz can stand the strain so back me and collier had to drop to the heavy grub again i noticed about that time that i was seized by a most uncommon and devastating appetite i ate until mame must have hated to see me darken the door afterward i found out that i had been made the victim of the first dark and irreligious trick played on me by ed collier him and me had been taking drinks together uptown regular trying to drown our thirst for food that man had bribed about ten bartenders to always put a big slug of appletree s anaconda appetite bitters in every one of my drinks but the last trick he played me was hardest to forget one day collier failed to show up at the tent a man told me he left town that morning my only rival now was the bill of fare a few days before he left collier had presented me with a two gallon jug of fine whisky which he said a cousin had sent him from kentucky i now have reason to believe that it contained appletree s anaconda appetite bitters almost exclusively i continued to devour tons of provisions in mame s eyes i remained a mere biped more ruminant than ever about a week after collier pulled his freight there came a kind of side show to town and hoisted a tent near the railroad i judged it was a sort of fake museum and curiosity business i called to see mame one night and ma dugan said that she and thomas her younger brother had gone to the show that same thing happened for three nights that week saturday night i caught her on the way coming back and got to sit on the steps a while and talk to her i noticed she looked different her eyes were softer and shiny like instead of a mame dugan to fly from the voracity of man and raise violets she seemed to be a mame more in line as god intended her approachable and suited to bask in the light of the brazilians and the kindler you seem to be right smart inveigled says i with the unparalleled exhibition of the world s living curiosities and wonders it s a change says mame you ll need another says i if you keep on going every night don t be cross jeff says she it takes my mind off business don t the curiosities eat i ask not all of them some of them are wax look out then that you don t get stuck says i kind of flip and foolish mame blushed i didn t know what to think about her my hopes raised some that perhaps my attentions had palliated man s awful crime of visibly introducing nourishment into his system she talked some about the stars referring to them with respect and politeness and i drivelled a quantity about united hearts homes made bright by true affection and the kindler mame listened without scorn and i says to myself jeff old man you re removing the hoodoo that has clung to the consumer of victuals you re setting your heel upon the serpent that lurks in the gravy bowl monday night i drop around mame is at the unparalleled exhibition with thomas now may the curse of the forty one seven sided sea cooks says i and the bad luck of the nine impenitent grasshoppers rest upon this self same sideshow at once and forever more amen i ll go to see it myself to morrow night and investigate its baleful charm shall man that was made to inherit the earth be bereft of his sweetheart first by a knife and fork and then by a ten cent circus the next night before starting out for the exhibition tent i inquire and find out that mame is not at home she is not at the circus with thomas this time for thomas waylays me in the grass outside of the grub tent with a scheme of his own before i had time to eat supper what ll you give me jeff says he if i tell you something the value of it son i says sis is stuck on a freak says thomas one of the side show freaks i don t like him she does i overheard em talking thought maybe you d like to know say jeff does it put you wise two dollars worth there s a target rifle up town that i frisked my pockets and commenced to dribble a stream of halves and quarters into thomas s hat the information was of the pile driver system of news and it telescoped my intellects for a while while i was leaking small change and smiling foolish on the outside and suffering disturbances internally i was saying idiotically and pleasantly thank you thomas thank you er a freak you said thomas now could you make out the monstrosity s entitlements a little clearer if you please thomas this is the fellow says thomas pulling out a yellow handbill from his pocket and shoving it under my nose he s the champion faster of the universe i guess that s why sis got soft on him he don t eat nothing he s going to fast forty nine days this is the sixth that s him i looked at the name thomas pointed out professor eduardo collieri ah says i in admiration that s not so bad ed collier i give you credit for the trick but i don t give you the girl until she s mrs freak i hit the sod in the direction of the show i came up to the rear of the tent and as i did so a man wiggled out like a snake from under the bottom of the canvas scrambled to his feet and ran into me like a locoed bronco i gathered him by the neck and investigated him by the light of the stars it is professor eduardo collieri in human habiliments with a desperate look in one eye and impatience in the other hello curiosity says i get still a minute and let s have a look at your freakship how do you like being the willopus wallopus or the bim bam from borneo or whatever name you are denounced by in the side show business jeff peters says collier in a weak voice turn me loose or i ll slug you one i m in the extremest kind of a large hurry hands off tut tut eddie i answers holding him hard let an old friend gaze on the exhibition of your curiousness it s an eminent graft you fell onto my son but don t speak of assaults and battery because you re not fit the best you ve got is a lot of nerve and a mighty empty stomach and so it was the man was as weak as a vegetarian cat i d argue this case with you jeff says he regretful in his style for an unlimited number of rounds if i had half an hour to train in and a slab of beefsteak two feet square to train with curse the man i say that invented the art of going foodless may his soul in eternity be chained up within two feet of a bottomless pit of red hot hash i m abandoning the conflict jeff i m deserting to the enemy you ll find miss dugan inside contemplating the only living mummy and the informed hog she s a fine girl jeff i d have beat you out if i could have kept up the grubless habit a little while longer you ll have to admit that the fasting dodge was aces up for a while i figured it out that way but say jeff it s said that love makes the world go around let me tell you the announcement lacks verification it s the wind from the dinner horn that does it i love that mame dugan i ve gone six days without food in order to coincide with her sentiments only one bite did i have that was when i knocked the tattooed man down with a war club and got a sandwich he was gobbling the manager fined me all my salary but salary wasn t what i was after twas that girl i d give my life for her but i d endanger my immortal soul for a beef stew hunger is a horrible thing jeff love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a man s starving in such language ed collier discoursed to me pathetic i gathered the diagnosis that his affections and his digestions had been implicated in a scramble and the commissary had won out i never disliked ed collier i searched my internal admonitions of suitable etiquette to see if i could find a remark of a consoling nature but there was none convenient i d be glad now says ed if you ll let me go i ve been hard hit but i ll hit the ration supply harder i m going to clean out every restaurant in town i m going to wade waist deep in sirloins and swim in ham and eggs it s an awful thing jeff peters for a man to come to this pass to give up his girl for something to eat it s worse than that man esau that swapped his copyright for a partridge but then hunger s a fierce thing you ll excuse me now jeff for i smell a pervasion of ham frying in the distance and my legs are crying out to stampede in that direction a hearty meal to you ed collier i says to him and no hard feelings for myself i am projected to be an unseldom eater and i have condolence for your predicaments there was a sudden big whiff of frying ham smell on the breeze and the champion faster gives a snort and gallops off in the dark toward fodder i wish some of the cultured outfit that are always advertising the extenuating circumstances of love and romance had been there to see there was ed collier a fine man full of contrivances and flirtations abandoning the girl of his heart and ripping out into the contiguous territory in the pursuit of sordid grub twas a rebuke to the poets and a slap at the best paying element of fiction an empty stomach is a sure antidote to an overfull heart i was naturally anxious to know how far mame was infatuated with collier and his stratagems i went inside the unparalleled exhibition and there she was she looked surprised to see me but unguilty it s an elegant evening outside says i the coolness is quite nice and gratifying and the stars are lined out first class up where they belong wouldn t you shake these by products of the animal kingdom long enough to take a walk with a common human who never was on a programme in his life mame gave a sort of sly glance around and i knew what that meant oh says i i hate to tell you but the curiosity that lives on wind has flew the coop he just crawled out under the tent by this time he has amalgamated himself with half the delicatessen truck in town you mean ed collier says mame i do i answers and a pity it is that he has gone back to crime again i met him outside the tent and he exposed his intentions of devastating the food crop of the world tis enormously sad when one s ideal descends from his pedestal to make a seventeen year locust of himself mame looked me straight in the eye until she had corkscrewed my reflections jeff says she it isn t quite like you to talk that way i don t care to hear ed collier ridiculed a man may do ridiculous things but they don t look ridiculous to the girl he does em for that was one man in a hundred he stopped eating just to please me i d be hard hearted and ungrateful if i didn t feel kindly toward him could you do what he did i know says i seeing the point i m condemned i can t help it the brand of the consumer is upon my brow mrs eve settled that business for me when she made the dicker with the snake i fell from the fire into the frying pan i guess i m the champion feaster of the universe i spoke humble and mame mollified herself a little ed collier and i are good friends she said the same as me and you i gave him the same answer i did you no marrying for me i liked to be with ed and talk with him there was something mighty pleasant to me in the thought that here was a man who never used a knife and fork and all for my sake wasn t you in love with him i asks all injudicious wasn t there a deal on for you to become mrs curiosity all of us do it sometimes all of us get jostled out of the line of profitable talk now and then mame put on that little lemon glace smile that runs between ice and sugar and says much too pleasant you re short on credentials for asking that question mr peters suppose you do a forty nine day fast just to give you ground to stand on and then maybe i ll answer it so even after collier was kidnapped out of the way by the revolt of his appetite my own prospects with mame didn t seem to be improved and then business played out in guthrie i had stayed too long there the brazilians i had sold commenced to show signs of wear and the kindler refused to light up right frequent on wet mornings there is always a time in my business when the star of success says move on to the next town i was travelling by wagon at that time so as not to miss any of the small towns so i hitched up a few days later and went down to tell mame good bye i wasn t abandoning the game i intended running over to oklahoma city and work it for a week or two then i was coming back to institute fresh proceedings against mame what do i find at the dugans but mame all conspicuous in a blue travelling dress with her little trunk at the door it seems that sister lottie bell who is a typewriter in terre haute is going to be married next thursday and mame is off for a week s visit to be an accomplice at the ceremony mame is waiting for a freight wagon that is going to take her to oklahoma but i condemns the freight wagon with promptness and scorn and offers to deliver the goods myself ma dugan sees no reason why not as mr freighter wants pay for the job so thirty minutes later mame and i pull out in my light spring wagon with white canvas cover and head due south that morning was of a praiseworthy sort the breeze was lively and smelled excellent of flowers and grass and the little cottontail rabbits entertained themselves with skylarking across the road my two kentucky bays went for the horizon until it come sailing in so fast you wanted to dodge it like a clothesline mame was full of talk and rattled on like a kid about her old home and her school pranks and the things she liked and the hateful ways of those johnson girls just across the street way up in indiana not a word was said about ed collier or victuals or such solemn subjects about noon mame looks and finds that the lunch she had put up in a basket had been left behind i could have managed quite a collation but mame didn t seem to be grieving over nothing to eat so i made no lamentations it was a sore subject with me and i ruled provender in all its branches out of my conversation i am minded to touch light on explanations how i came to lose the way the road was dim and well grown with grass and there was mame by my side confiscating my intellects and attention the excuses are good or they are not as they may appear to you but i lost it and at dusk that afternoon when we should have been in oklahoma city we were seesawing along the edge of nowhere in some undiscovered river bottom and the rain was falling in large wet bunches down there in the swamps we saw a little log house on a small knoll of high ground the bottom grass and the chaparral and the lonesome timber crowded all around it it seemed to be a melancholy little house and you felt sorry for it twas that house for the night the way i reasoned it i explained to mame and she leaves it to me to decide she doesn t become galvanic and prosecuting as most women would but she says it s all right she knows i didn t mean to do it we found the house was deserted it had two empty rooms there was a little shed in the yard where beasts had once been kept in a loft of it was a lot of old hay i put my horses in there and gave them some of it for which they looked at me sorrowful expecting apologies the rest of the hay i carried into the house by armfuls with a view to accommodations i also brought in the patent kindler and the brazilians neither of which are guaranteed against the action of water mame and i sat on the wagon seats on the floor and i lit a lot of the kindler on the hearth for the night was chilly if i was any judge that girl enjoyed it it was a change for her it gave her a different point of view she laughed and talked and the kindler made a dim light compared to her eyes i had a pocketful of cigars and as far as i was concerned there had never been any fall of man we were at the same old stand in the garden of eden out there somewhere in the rain and the dark was the river of zion and the angel with the flaming sword had not yet put up the keep off the grass sign i opened up a gross or two of the brazilians and made mame put them on rings brooches necklaces eardrops bracelets girdles and lockets she flashed and sparkled like a million dollar princess until she had pink spots in her cheeks and almost cried for a looking glass when it got late i made a fine bunk on the floor for mame with the hay and my lap robes and blankets out of the wagon and persuaded her to lie down i sat in the other room burning tobacco and listening to the pouring rain and meditating on the many vicissitudes that came to a man during the seventy years or so immediately preceding his funeral i must have dozed a little while before morning for my eyes were shut and when i opened them it was daylight and there stood mame with her hair all done up neat and correct and her eyes bright with admiration of existence gee whiz jeff she exclaims but i m hungry i could eat a i looked up and caught her eye her smile went back in and she gave me a cold look of suspicion then i laughed and laid down on the floor to laugh easier it seemed funny to me by nature and geniality i am a hearty laugher and i went the limit when i came to mame was sitting with her back to me all contaminated with dignity don t be angry mame i says for i couldn t help it it s the funny way you ve done up your hair if you could only see it you needn t tell stories sir said mame cool and advised my hair is all right i know what you were laughing about why jeff look outside she winds up peeping through a chink between the logs i opened the little wooden window and looked out the entire river bottom was flooded and the knob of land on which the house stood was an island in the middle of a rushing stream of yellow water a hundred yards wide and it was still raining hard all we could do was to stay there till the doves brought in the olive branch i am bound to admit that conversations and amusements languished during that day i was aware that mame was getting a too prolonged one sided view of things again but i had no way to change it personally i was wrapped up in the desire to eat i had hallucinations of hash and visions of ham and i kept saying to myself all the time what ll you have to eat jeff what ll you order now old man when the waiter comes i picks out to myself all sorts of favourites from the bill of fare and imagines them coming i guess it s that way with all hungry men they can t get their cogitations trained on anything but something to eat it shows that the little table with the broken legged caster and the imitation worcester sauce and the napkin covering up the coffee stains is the paramount issue after all instead of the question of immortality or peace between nations i sat there musing along arguing with myself quite heated as to how i d have my steak with mushrooms or a la creole mame was on the other seat pensive her head leaning on her hand let the potatoes come home fried i states in my mind and brown the hash in the pan with nine poached eggs on the side i felt careful in my own pockets to see if i could find a peanut or a grain or two of popcorn night came on again with the river still rising and the rain still falling i looked at mame and i noticed that desperate look on her face that a girl always wears when she passes an ice cream lair i knew that poor girl was hungry maybe for the first time in her life there was that anxious look in her eye that a woman has only when she has missed a meal or feels her skirt coming unfastened in the back it was about eleven o clock or so on the second night when we sat gloomy in our shipwrecked cabin i kept jerking my mind away from the subject of food but it kept flopping back again before i could fasten it i thought of everything good to eat i had ever heard of i went away back to my kidhood and remembered the hot biscuit sopped in sorghum and bacon gravy with partiality and respect then i trailed along up the years pausing at green apples and salt flapjacks and maple lye hominy fried chicken old virginia style corn on the cob spareribs and sweet potato pie and wound up with georgia brunswick stew which is the top notch of good things to eat because it comprises em all they say a drowning man sees a panorama of his whole life pass before him well when a man s starving he sees the ghost of every meal he ever ate set out before him and he invents new dishes that would make the fortune of a chef if somebody would collect the last words of men who starved to death they d have to sift em mighty fine to discover the sentiment but they d compile into a cook book that would sell into the millions i guess i must have had my conscience pretty well inflicted with culinary meditations for without intending to do so i says out loud to the imaginary waiter cut it thick and have it rare with the french fried and six soft scrambled on toast mame turned her head quick as a wing her eyes were sparkling and she smiled sudden medium for me she rattles out with the juliennes and three straight up draw one and brown the wheats double order to come oh jeff wouldn t it be glorious and then i d like to have a half fry and a little chicken curried with rice and a cup custard with ice cream and go easy i interrupts where s the chicken liver pie and the kidney saute on toast and the roast lamb and oh cuts in mame all excited with mint sauce and the turkey salad and stuffed olives and raspberry tarts and keep it going says i hurry up with the fried squash and the hot corn pone with sweet milk and don t forget the apple dumpling with hard sauce and the cross barred dew berry pie yes for ten minutes we kept up that kind of restaurant repartee we ranges up and down and backward and forward over the main trunk lines and the branches of the victual subject and mame leads the game for she is apprised in the ramifications of grub and the dishes she nominates aggravates my yearnings it seems that there is a feeling that mame will line up friendly again with food it seems that she looks upon the obnoxious science of eating with less contempt than before the next morning we find that the flood has subsided i geared up the bays and we splashed out through the

vuyning six months old in cut one inch too long and half an inch to much lapel your hat is plainly dated one year ago although there s only a sixteenth of an inch lacking in the brim to tell the story that english poke in your collar is too short by the distance between troy and london a plain gold link cuff button would take all the shine out of those pearl ones with dia mond settings those tan shoes would be exactly the articles to work into the heart of a brooklyn school ma am on a two weeks visit to lake ronkon koma i think i caught a glimpse of a blue silk sock embroidered with russet lilies of the valley when you improperly drew up your trousers as you sat down there are always plain ones to be had in the stores have i hurt your feelings emer son double the ante cried the criticised one greed ily give me more of it there s a way to tote the haberdashery and i want to get wise to it say you re the right kind of a swell anything else to the queer about me your tie said vuyning is tied with absolute precision and correctness thanks gratefully i spent over half an hour at it before i thereby interrupted vuyning completing your resemblance to a dummy in a broadway store window yours truly said emerson sitting down again it s bully of you to put me wise i knew there was something wrong but i couldn t just put my finger on it i guess it comes by nature to know how to wear clothes oh i suppose said vuyning with a laugh that my ancestors picked up the knack while they were peddling clothes from house to house a couple of hundred years ago i m told they did that and mine said emerson cheerfully were making their visits at night i guess and didn t have a chance to catch on to the correct styles i tell you what said vuyning whose ennui had taken wings i ll take you to my tailor he ll eliminate the mark of the beast from your exterior that is if you care to go any further in the way of expense play em to the ceiling said emerson with a boyish smile of joy i ve got a roll as big around as a barrel of black eyed peas and as loose as the wrapper of a two for fiver i don t mind telling you that i was not touring among the antipodes when the burglar proof safe of the farmers national bank of butterville ia flew open some moonless nights ago to the tune of aren t you afraid asked vuyning that i ll call a cop and hand you over you tell me said emerson coolly why i didn t keep them he laid vuyning s pocketbook and watch the vuyning year old family watch on the table man said vuyning revelling did you ever hear the tale kirk tells about the six pound trout and the old fisherman seems not said emerson politely i d like to but you won t said vuyning i ve heard it scores of times that s why i won t tell you i was just thinking how much better this is than a club now shall we go to my tailor boys and elderly gents said vuyning five days later at his club standing up against the window where his coterie was gathered and keeping out the breeze a friend of mine from the west will dine at our table this evening will he ask if we have heard the latest from denver said a member squirming in his chair will he mention the new twenty three story ma sonic temple in quincy ill inquired another dropping his nose glasses will he spring one of those western mississippi river catfish stories in which they use yearling calves for bait demanded kirk fiercely be comforted said vuyning he has none of the little vices he is a burglar and safe blower and a pal of mine oh mary ann said they must you always adorn every statement with your alleged humor it came to pass that at eight in the evening a calm smooth brilliant affable man sat at vuyning s right hand during dinner and when the ones who pass their lives in city streets spoke of skyscrapers or of the little czar on his far frozen throne or of insig nificant fish from inconsequential streams this big deep chested man faultlessly clothed and eyed like an emperor disposed of their lilliputian chatter with a wink of his eyelash and then he painted for them with hard broad strokes a marvellous lingual panorama of the west he stacked snow topped mountains on the table freezing the hot dishes of the waiting diners with a wave of his hand he swept the clubhouse into a pine crowned gorge turning the waiters into a grim posse and each listener into a blood stained fugitive climbing with torn fingers upon the ensanguined rocks he touched the table and spake and the five panted as they gazed on barren lava beds and each man took his tongue between his teeth and felt his mouth bake at the tale of a land empty of water and food as simply as homer sang while he dug a tine of his fork leisurely into the tablecloth he opened a new world to their view as does one who tells a child of the looking glass country as one of his listeners might have spoken of tea too strong at a madison square afternoon so he depicted the ravages of redeye in a border town when the caballeros of the lariat and forty five reduced ennui to a minimum and then with a sweep of his white unringed hands be dismissed melpomene and forthwith diana and amaryllis footed it before the mind s eyes of the clubmen the savannas of the continent spread before them the wind humming through a hundred leagues of sage brush and mesquite closed their ears to the city s staccato noises he told them of camps of ranches marooned in a sea of fragrant prairie blos soms of gallops in the stilly night that apollo would have forsaken his daytime steeds to enjoy he read them the great rough epic of the cattle and the hills that have not been spoiled by the band of man the mason his words were a telescope to the city men whose eyes had looked upon youngstown o and whose tongues had called it west in fact emerson had them going the next morning at ten he met vuyning by ap pointment at a forty second street cafe emerson was to leave for the west that day he wore a suit of dark cheviot that looked to have been draped upon him by an ancient grecian tailor who was a few thousand years ahead of the styles mr vuyning said he with the clear ingenuous smile of the successful crook it s up to me to go the limit for you any time i can do so you re the real thing and if i can ever return the favor you bet your life i ll do it what was that cow puncher s name asked vuyning who used to catch a mustang by the nose and mane and throw him till he put the bridle on bates said emerson thanks said vuyning i thought it was yates oh about that toggery business i d for gotten that i ve been looking for some guy to put me on the right track for years said emerson you re the goods duty free and half way to the warehouse in a red wagon bacon toasted on a green willow switch over red coals ought to put broiled lobsters out of business said vuyning and you say a horse at the end of a thirty foot rope can t pull a ten inch stake out of wet prairie well good bye old man if you must be off at one o clock vuyning had luncheon with miss allison by previous arrangement for thirty minutes be babbled to her unaccount ably of ranches horses cations cyclones round ups rocky mountains and beans and bacon she looked at him with wondering and half terrified eyes i was going to propose again to day said vuy ning cheerily but i won t i ve worried you often enough you know dad has a ranch in colorado what s the good of staying here jumping jon quils but it s great out there i m going to start next tuesday no you won t said miss allison what said vuyning not alone said miss allison dropping a tear upon her salad what do you think betty exclaimed vuyning what do you mean i ll go too said miss allison forcibly vuyning filled her glass with apollinaris here s to rowdy the dude he gave a toast mysterious don t know him said miss allison but if he s your friend jimmy here goes the memento miss lynnette d armande turned her back on broadway this was but tit for tat be cause broadway had often done the same thing to miss d armande still the tats seemed to have it for the ex leading lady of the reaping the whirlwind company had everything to ask of broadway while there was no vice versa so miss lynnette d armande turned the back of her chair to her window that overlooked broadway and sat down to stitch in time the lisle thread heel of a black silk stocking the tumult and glitter of the roaring broadway beneath her window had no charm for her what she greatly desired was the stifling air of a dressing room on that fairyland street and the roar of an audience gathered in that capricious quarter in the meantime those stock ings must not be neglected silk does wear out so but after all isn t it just the only goods there is the hotel thalia looks on broadway as marathon looks on the sea it stands like a gloomy cliff above the whirlpool where the tides of two great thorough fares clash here the player bands gather at the end of their wanderings to loosen the buskin and dust the sock thick in the streets around it are booking offices theatres agents schools and the lobster pal aces to which those thorny paths lead wandering through the eccentric halls of the dim and fusty thalia you seem to have found yourself in some great ark or caravan about to sail or fly or roll away on wheels about the house lingers a sense of unrest of expectation of transientness even of anxiety and apprehension the halls are a labyrinth without a guide you wander like a lost soul in a sam loyd puzzle turning any corner a dressing sack or a cul de sac may bring you up short you meet alarming tragedians stalking in bath robes in search of ru mored bathrooms from hundreds of rooms come the buzz of talk scraps of new and old songs and the ready laughter of the convened players summer has come their companies have disbanded and they take their rest in their favorite caravansary while they besiege the managers for engagements for the coming season at this hour of the afternoon the day s work of tramping the rounds of the agents offices is over past you as you ramble distractedly through the mossy halls flit audible visions of houris with veiled starry eyes flying tag ends of things and a swish of silk bequeathing to the dull hallways an odor of gaiety and a memory of frangipanni serious young comedians with versatile adam s apples gather in doorways and talk of booth far reaching from somewhere comes the smell of ham and red cabbage and the crash of dishes on the american plan the indeterminate hum of life in the thalia is enlivened by the discreet popping at reasonable and salubrious intervals of beer bottle corks thus punctuated life in the genial hostel scans easily the comma being the favorite mark semicolons frowned upon and periods barred miss d armannde s room was a small one there was room for her rocker between the dresser and the wash stand if it were placed longitudinally on the dresser were its usual accoutrements plus the ex lead ing lady s collected souvenirs of road engagements and photographs of her dearest and best professional friends at one of these photographs she looked twice or thrice as she darned and smiled friendlily i d like to know where lee is just this minute she said half aloud if you had been privileged to view the photograph thus flattered you would have thought at the first glance that you saw the picture of a many petalled white flower blown through the air by a storm but the floral kingdom was not responsible for that swirl of petalous whiteness you saw the filmy brief skirt of miss rosalie ray as she made a complete heels over head turn in her wistaria entwined swing far out from the stage high above the heads of the audience you saw the cam era s inadequate representation of the graceful strong kick with which she at this exciting moment sent flying high and far the yellow silk garter that each evening spun from her agile limb and descended upon the delighted audience below you saw too amid the black clothed mainly mas culine patrons of select vaudeville a hundred hands raised with the hope of staying the flight of the bril liant aerial token forty weeks of the best circuits this act had brought miss rosalie ray for each of two years she did other things during her twelve minutes a song and dance imitations of two or three actors who are but imitations of themselves and a balancing feat with a step ladder and feather duster but when the blossom decked swing was let down from the flies and miss rosalie sprang smiling into the seat with the golden circlet conspicuous in the place whence it was soon to slide and become a soaring and coveted guerdon then it was that the audience rose in its seat as a single man or presumably so and in dorsed the specialty that made miss ray s name a favorite in the booking offices at the end of the two years miss ray suddenly an nounced to her dear friend miss d armande that she was going to spend the summer at an antediluvian village on the north shore of long island and that the stage would see her no more seventeen minutes after miss lynnette d armande had expressed her wish to know the whereabouts of her old chum there were sharp raps at her door doubt not that it was rosalie ray at the shrill command to enter she did so with something of a tired flutter and dropped a heavy hand bag on the floor upon my word it was rosalie in a loose travel stained automobileless coat closely tied brown veil with yard long flying ends gray walking suit and tan oxfords with lavender overgaiters when she threw off her veil and hat you saw a pretty enough face now flushed and disturbed by some unusual emotion and restless large eyes with discontent marring their brightness a heavy pile of dull auburn hair hastily put up was escaping in crinkly waving strands and curling small locks from the confining combs and pins the meeting of the two was not marked by the effusion vocal gymnastical osculatory and catecheti cal that distinguishes the greetings of their unpro fessional sisters in society there was a brief clinch two simultaneous labial dabs and they stood on the same footing of the old days very much like the short salutations of soldiers or of travellers in for eign wilds are the welcomes between the strollers at the corners of their crisscross roads i ve got the hall room two flights up above yours said rosalie but i came straight to see you before going up i didn t know you were here till they told me i ve been in since the last of april said lyn nette and i m going on the road with a fatal inheritance company we open next week in eliz abeth i thought you d quit the stage lee tell me about yourself rosalie settled herself with a skilful wriggle on the top of miss d armande s wardrobe trunk and leaned her head against the papered wall from long habit thus can peripatetic leading ladies and their sisters make themselves as comfort able as though the deepest armchairs embraced them i m going to tell you lynn she said with a strangely sardonic and yet carelessly resigned look on her youthful face and then to morrow i ll strike the old broadway trail again and wear some more paint off the chairs in the agents offices if anybody had told me any time in the last three months up to four o clock this afternoon that i d ever listen to that leave your name and address rot of the booking bunch again i d have given em the real mrs fiske laugh loan me a handkerchief lynn gee but those long island trains are fierce i ve got enough soft coal cinders on my face to go on and play topsy without using the cork and speaking of corks got anything to drink lynn miss d armande opened a door of the wash stand and took out a bottle there s nearly a pint of manhattan there s a cluster of carnations in the drinking glass but oh pass the bottle save the glass for com pany thanks that hits the spot the same to you my first drink in three months yes lynn i quit the stage at the end of last season i quit it because i was sick of the life and especially because my heart and soul were sick of men of the kind of men we stage people have to be up against you know what the game is to us it s a fight against em all the way down the line from the manager who wants us to try his new motor car to the bill posters who want to call us by our front names and the men we have to meet after the show are the worst of all the stage door kind and the man ager s friends who take us to supper and show their diamonds and talk about seeing dan and dave and charlie for us they re beasts and i hate em i tell you lynn it s the girls like us on the stage that ought to be pitied it s girls from good homes that are honestly ambitious and work hard to rise in the profession but never do get there you bear a lot of sympathy sloshed around on chorus girls and their fifteen dollars a week piffle there ain t a sorrow in the chorus that a lobster cannot heal if there s any tears to shed let em fall for the actress that gets a salary of from thirty to forty five dollars a week for taking a leading part in a bum show she knows she ll never do any better but she hangs on for years hoping for the chance i that never comes and the fool plays we have to work in having another girl roll you around the stage by the hind legs in a wheelbarrow chorus in a musical comedy is dignified drama compared with the idiotic things i ve had to do in the thirty centers but what i hated most was the men the men leering and blathering at you across tables trying to buy you with wurzburger or extra dry accord ing to their estimate of your price and the men in the audiences clapping yelling snarling crowding writhing gloating like a lot of wild beasts with their eyes fixed on you ready to eat you up if you come in reach of their claws oh how i hate em well i m not telling you much about myself am i lynn i had two hundred dollars saved up and i cut the stage the first of the summer i went over on long island and found the sweetest little village that ever was called soundport right on the water i was going to spend the summer there and study up on elocution and try to get a class in the fall there was an old widow lady with a cottage near the beach who sometimes rented a room or two just for com pany and she took me in she had another boarder too the reverend arthur lyle yes he was the head liner you re on lynn i ll tell you all of it in a minute it s only a one act play the first time he walked on lynn i felt myself going the first lines he spoke he had me he was different from the men in audiences he was tall and slim and you never heard him come in the room but you felt him he had a face like a picture of a knight like one of that round table bunch and a voice like a cello solo and his manners lynn if you d take john drew in his best draw ing room scene and compare the two you d have john arrested for disturbing the peace i ll spare you the particulars but in less than a month arthur and i were engaged he preached at a little one night stand of a methodist church there was to be a parsonage the size of a lunch wagon and hens and honeysuckles when we were married ar thur used to preach to me a good deal about heaven but be never could get my mind quite off those honey suckles and hens no i didn t tell him i d been on the stage i hated the business and all that went with it i d cut it out forever and i didn t see any use of stirring things up i was a good girl and i didn t have any thing to confess except being an elocutionist and that was about all the strain my conscience would stand oh i tell you lynn i was happy i sang in the choir and attended the sewing society and re cited that annie laurie thing with the whistling stunt in it in a manner bordering upon the profes sional as the weekly village paper reported it and arthur and i went rowing and walking in the woods and clamming and that poky little village seemed to me the best place in the world i d have been happy to live there always too if but one morning old mrs gurley the widow lady got gossipy while i was helping her string beans on the back porch and began to gush information as folks who rent out their rooms usually do mr lyle was her idea of a saint on earth as he was mine too she went over all his virtues and graces and wound up by telling me that arthur had had an exremely romantic love affair not long before that had ended unhappily she didn t seem to be on to the details but she knew that he had been hit pretty hard he was paler and thinner she said and he had some kind of a remembrance or keepsake of the lady in a little rosewood box that he kept locked in his desk drawer in his study several times says she i ve seen him gloomerin over that box of evenings and he always locks it up right away if anybody comes into the room well you can imagine how long it was before i got arthur by the wrist and led him down stage and hissed in his ear that same afternoon we were lazying around in a boat among the water lilies at the edge of the bay arthur says i you never told me you d had another love affair but mrs gurley did i went on to let him know i knew i hate to bear a man lie before you came says he looking me frankly in the eye there was a previous affection a strong one since you know of it i will be perfectly candid with you i am waiting says i my dear ida says arthur of course i went by my real name while i was in soundport this former affection was a spiritual one in fact al though the lady aroused my deepest sentiments and was as i thought my ideal woman i never met her and never spoke to her it was an ideal love my love for you while no less ideal is different you wouldn t let that come between us was she pretty i asked she was very beautiful said arthur did you see her often i asked something like a dozen times says he always from a distance says i always from quite a distance says he and you loved her i asked she seemed my ideal of beauty and grace and soul says arthur and this keepsake that you keep under lock and key and moon over at times is that a remembrance from her a memento says arthur that i have treasured did she send it to you it came to me from her says be in a roundabout way i asked somewhat roundabout says he and yet rather direct why didn t you ever meet her i asked were your positions in life so different she was far above me says arthur now ida he goes on this is all of the past you re not going to be jealous are you jealous says i why man what are you talking about it makes me think ten times as much of you as i did before i knew about it and it did lynn if you can understand it that ideal love was a new one on me but it struck me as being the most beautiful and glorious thing i d ever heard of think of a man loving a woman he d never even spoken to and being faithful just to what his mind and heart pictured her oh it sounded great to me the men i d always known come at you with either diamonds knock out drops or a raise of salary and their ideals well we ll say no more yes it made me think more of arthur than i did before i couldn t be jealous of that far away divin ity that he used to worship for i was going to have him myself and i began to look upon him as a saint on earth just as old lady gurley did about four o clock this afternoon a man came to the house for arthur to go and see somebody that was sick among his church bunch old lady gurley was taking her afternoon snore on a couch so that left me pretty much alone in passing by arthur s study i looked in and saw his bunch of keys hanging in the drawer of his desk where he d forgotten em well i guess we re all to the mrs bluebeard now and then ain t we lynn i made up my mind i d have a look at that memento he kept so secret not that i cared what it was it was just curiosity while i was opening the drawer i imagined one or two things it might be i thought it might be a dried rosebud she d dropped down to him from a balcony or maybe a picture of her he d cut out of a magazine she being so high up in the world i opened the drawer and there was the rosewood casket about the size of a gent s collar box i found the little key in the bunch that fitted it and unlocked it and raised the lid i took one look at that memento and then i went to my room and packed my trunk i threw a few things into my grip gave my hair a flirt or two with a side comb put on my hat and went in and gave the old lady s foot a kick i d tried awfully hard to use proper and correct language while i was there for arthur s sake and i had the habit down pat but it left me then stop sawing gourds says i and sit up and take notice the ghost s about to walk i m going away from here and i owe you eight dollars the expressman will call for my trunk i handed her the money dear me miss crosby says she is any thing wrong i thought you were pleased here dear me young women are so hard to understand and so different from what you expect em to be you re damn right says i some of em are but you can t say that about men when you know one man you know em all that settles the human race question and then i caught the four thirty eight soft coal unlimited and here i am you didn t tell me what was in the box lee said miss d armande anxiously one of those yellow silk garters that i used to kick off my leg into the audience during that old vaudeville swing act of mine is there any of the cocktail left lynn waifs and strays the red roses of tonia a trestle burned down on the international railroad the south bound from san antonio was cut off for the next forty eight hours on that train was tonia weaver s easter hat espirition the mexican who had been sent forty miles in a buckboard from the espinosa ranch to fetch it returned with a shrugging shoulder and hands empty except for a cigarette at the small station nopal he had learned of the delayed train and having no commands to wait turned his ponies toward the ranch again now if one supposes that easter the goddess of spring cares any more for the after church parade on fifth avenue than she does for her loyal outfit of subjects that assemble at the meeting house at cactus tex a mistake has been made the wives and daughters of the ranchmen of the frio country put forth easter blossoms of new hats and gowns as faithfully as is done anywhere and the southwest is for one day a mingling of prickly pear paris and paradise and now it was good friday and tonia weaver s easter hat blushed unseen in the desert air of an impotent express car beyond the burned trestle on saturday noon the rogers girls from the shoestring ranch and ella reeves from the anchor o and mrs bennet and ida from green valley would convene at the espinosa and pick up tonia with their easter hats and frocks carefully wrapped and bundled against the dust the fair aggregation would then merrily jog the ten miles to cactus where on the morrow they would array themselves subjugate man do homage to easter and cause jealous agitation among the lilies of the field tonia sat on the steps of the espinosa ranch house flicking gloomily with a quirt at a tuft of curly mesquite she displayed a frown and a contumelious lip and endeavored to radiate an aura of disagreeableness and tragedy i hate railroads she announced positively and men men pretend to run them can you give any excuse why a trestle should burn ida bennet s hat is to be trimmed with violets i shall not go one step toward cactus without a new hat if i were a man i would get one two men listened uneasily to this disparagement of their kind one was wells pearson foreman of the mucho calor cattle ranch the other was thompson burrows the prosperous sheepman from the quintana valley both thought tonia weaver adorable especially when she railed at railroads and menaced men either would have given up his epidermis to make for her an easter hat more cheerfully than the ostrich gives up his tip or the aigrette lays down its life neither possessed the ingenuity to conceive a means of supplying the sad deficiency against the coming sabbath pearson s deep brown face and sunburned light hair gave him the appearance of a schoolboy seized by one of youth s profound and insolvable melancholies tonia s plight grieved him through and through thompson burrows was the more skilled and pliable he hailed from somewhere in the east originally and he wore neckties and shoes and was made dumb by woman s presence the big water hole on sandy creek said pearson scarcely hoping to make a hit was filled up by that last rain oh was it said tonia sharply thank you for the information i suppose a new hat is nothing to you mr pearson i suppose you think a woman ought to wear an old stetson five years without a change as you do if your old water hole could have put out the fire on that trestle you might have some reason to talk about it i am deeply sorry said burrows warned by pearson s fate that you failed to receive your hat miss weaver deeply sorry indeed if there was anything i could do don t bother interrupted tonia with sweet sarcasm if there was anything you could do you d be doing it of course there isn t tonia paused a sudden sparkle of hope had come into her eye her frown smoothed away she had an inspiration there s a store over at lone elm crossing on the nueces she said that keeps hats eva rogers got hers there she said it was the latest style it might have some left but it s twenty eight miles to lone elm the spurs of two men who hastily arose jingled and tonia almost smiled the knights then were not all turned to dust nor were their rowels rust of course said tonia looking thoughtfully at a white gulf cloud sailing across the cerulean dome nobody could ride to lone elm and back by the time the girls call by for me to morrow so i reckon i ll have to stay at home this easter sunday and then she smiled well miss tonia said pearson reaching for his hat as guileful as a sleeping babe i reckon i ll be trotting along back to mucho calor there s some cutting out to be done on dry branch first thing in the morning and me and road runner has got to be on hand it s too bad your hat got sidetracked maybe they ll get that trestle mended yet in time for easter i must be riding too miss tonia announced burrows looking at his watch i declare it s nearly five o clock i must be out at my lambing camp in time to help pen those crazy ewes tonia s suitors seemed to have been smitten with a need for haste they bade her a ceremonious farewell and then shook each other s hands with the elaborate and solemn courtesy of the southwesterner hope i ll see you again soon mr pearson said burrows same here said the cowman with the serious face of one whose friend goes upon a whaling voyage be gratified to see you ride over to mucho calor any time you strike that section of the range pearson mounted road runner the soundest cow pony on the frio and let him pitch for a minute as he always did on being mounted even at the end of a day s travel what kind of a hat was that miss tonia he called that you ordered from san antone i can t help but be sorry about that hat a straw said tonia the latest shape of course trimmed with red roses that s what i like red roses there s no color more becoming to your complexion and hair said burrows admiringly it s what i like said tonia and of all the flowers give me red roses keep all the pinks and blues for yourself but what s the use when trestles burn and leave you without anything it ll be a dry old easter for me pearson took off his hat and drove road bunner at a gallop into the chaparral east of the espinosa ranch house as his stirrups rattled against the brush burrows s long legged sorrel struck out down the narrow stretch of open prairie to the southwest tonia hung up her quirt and went into the sitting room i m mighty sorry daughter that you didn t get your hat said her mother oh don t worry mother said tonia coolly i ll have a new hat all right in time to morrow when burrows reached the end of the strip of prairie he pulled his sorrel to the right and let him pick his way daintily across a sacuista flat through which ran the ragged dry bed of an arroyo then up a gravelly hill matted with bush the hoarse scrambled and at length emerged with a snort of satisfaction into a stretch of high level prairie grassy and dotted with the lighter green of mesquites in their fresh spring foliage always to the right burrows bore until in a little while he struck the old indian trail that followed the nueces southward and that passed twenty eight miles to the southeast through lone elm here burrows urged the sorrel into a steady lope as he settled himself in the saddle for a long ride he heard the drumming of hoofs the hollow thwack of chaparral against wooden stirrups the whoop of a comanche and wells pearson burst out of the brush at the right of the trail like a precocious yellow chick from a dark green easter egg except in the presence of awing femininity melancholy found no place in pearson s bosom in tonia s presence his voice was as soft as a summer bullfrog s in his reedy nest now at his gleesome yawp rabbits a mile away ducked their ears and sensitive plants closed their fearful fronds moved your lambing camp pretty far from the ranch haven t you neighbor asked pearson as road runner fell in at the sorrel s side twenty eight miles said burrows looking a little grim pearson s laugh woke an owl one hour too early in his water elm on the river bank half a mile away all right for you sheepman i like an open game myself we re two locoed he milliners hat hunting in the wilderness i notify you burr to mind your corrals we ve got an even start and the one that gets the headgear will stand some higher at the espinosa you ve got a good pony said burrows eyeing road runner s barrel like body and tapering legs that moved as regularly as the pistonrod of an engine it s a race of course but you re too much of a horseman to whoop it up this soon say we travel together till we get to the home stretch i m your company agreed pearson and i admire your sense if there s hats at lone elm one of em shall set on miss tonia s brow to morrow and you won t be at the crowning i ain t bragging burr but that sorrel of yours is weak in the fore legs my horse against yours offered burrows that miss tonia wears the hat i take her to cactus to morrow i ll take you up shouted pearson but oh it s just like horse stealing for me i can use that sorrel for a lady s animal when when somebody comes over to mucho calor and burrows dark face glowered so suddenly that the cowman broke off his sentence but pearson could never feel any pressure for long what s all this easter business about burr he asked cheerfully why do the women folks have to have new hats by the almanac or bust all cinches trying to get em it s a seasonable statute out of the testaments explained burrows it s ordered by the pope or somebody and it has something to do with the zodiac i don t know exactly but i think it was invented by the egyptians it s an all right jubilee if the heathens did put their brand on it said pearson or else tonia wouldn t have anything to do with it and they pull it off at church too suppose there ain t but one hat in the lone elm store burr then said burrows darkly the best man of us ll take it back to the espinosa oh man cried pearson throwing his hat high and catching it again there s nothing like you come off the sheep ranges before you talk good and collateral to the occasion and if there s more than one then said burrows we ll pick our choice and one of us ll get back first with his and the other won t there never was two souls proclaimed pearson to the stars that beat more like one heart than yourn and mine me and you might be riding on a unicorn and thinking out of the same piece of mind at a little past midnight the riders loped into lone elm the half a hundred houses of the big village were dark on its only street the big wooden store stood barred and shuttered in a few moments the horses were fastened and pearson was pounding cheerfully on the door of old sutton the storekeeper the barrel of a winchester came through a cranny of a solid window shutter followed by a short inquiry wells pearson of the mucho calor and burrows of green valley was the response we want to buy some goods in the store sorry to wake you up but we must have em come on out vncle tommy and get a move on you uncle tommy was slow but at length they got him behind his counter with a kerosene lamp lit and told him of their dire need easter hats said uncle tommy sleepily why yes i believe i have got just a couple left i only ordered a dozen this spring i ll show em to you now uncle tommy sutton was a merchant half asleep or awake in dusty pasteboard boxes under the counter he had two left over spring hats but alas for his commercial probity on that early saturday morn they were hats of two springs ago and a woman s eye would have detected the fraud at half a glance but to the unintelligent gaze of the cowpuncher and the sheepman they seemed fresh from the mint of contemporaneous april the hats were of a variety once known as cart wheels they were of stiff straw colored red and flat brimmed both were exactly alike and trimmed lavishly around their crowns with full blown immaculate artificial white roses that all you got uncle tommy said pearson all right not much choice here burr take your pick they re the latest styles lied uncle tommy you d see em on fifth avenue if you was in new york uncle tommy wrapped and tied each hat in two yards of dark calico for a protection one pearson tied carefully to his calfskin saddle thongs and the other became part of road runner s burden they shouted thanks and farewells to uncle tommy and cantered back into the night on the home stretch the horsemen jockeyed with all their skill they rode more slowly on their way back the few words they spoke were not unfriendly burrows had a winchester under his left leg slung over his saddle horn pearson had a six shooter belted around him thus men rode in the frio country at half past seven in the morning they rode to the top of a hill and saw the espinosa ranch a white spot under a dark patch of live oaks five miles away the sight roused pearson from his drooping pose in the saddle he knew what road runner could do the sorrel was lathered and stumbling frequently road runner was pegging away like a donkey engine pearson turned toward the sheepman and laughed good bye burr he cried with a wave of his hand it s a race now we re on the home stretch he pressed road runner with his knees and leaned toward the espinosa road runner struck into a gallop with tossing head and snorting nostrils as if he were fresh from a month in pasture pearson rode twenty yards and heard the unmistakable sound of a winchester lever throwing a cartridge into the barrel he dropped flat along his horse s back before the crack of the rifle reached his ears it is possible that burrows intended only to disable the horse he was a good enough shot to do that without endangering his rider but as pearson stooped the ball went through his shoulder and then through road runner s neck the horse fell and the cowman pitched over his head into the hard road and neither of them tried to move burrows rode on without stopping in two hours pearson opened his eyes and took inventory he managed to get to his feet and staggered back to where road runner was lying road runner was lying there but he appeared to be comfortable pearson examined him and found that the bullet had creased him he had been knocked out temporarily but not seriously hurt but he was tired and he lay there on miss tonia s hat and ate leaves from a mesquite branch that obligingly hung over the road pearson made the horse get up the easter hat loosed from the saddle thongs lay there in its calico wrappings a shapeless thing from its sojourn beneath the solid carcass of road runner then pearson fainted and fell head long upon the poor hat again crumpling it under his wounded shoulders it is hard to kill a cowpuncher in half an hour he revived long enough for a woman to have fainted twice and tried ice cream for a restorer he got up carefully and found road runner who was busy with the near by grass he tied the unfortunate hat to the saddle again and managed to get himself there too after many failures at noon a gay and fluttering company waited in front of the espinosa ranch the rogers girls were there in their new buckboard and the anchor o outfit and the green valley folks mostly women and each and every one wore her new easter hat even upon the lonely prairies for they greatly desired to shine forth and do honor to the coming festival at the gate stood tonia with undisguised tears upon her cheeks in her hand she held burrow s lone elm hat and it was at its white roses hated by her that she wept for her friends were telling her with the ecstatic joy of true friends that cart wheels could not be worn being three seasons passed into oblivion put on your old hat and come tonia they urged for easter sunday she answered i ll die first and wept again the hats of the fortunate ones were curved and twisted into the style of spring s latest proclamation a strange being rode out of the brush among them and there sat his horse languidly he was stained and disfigured with the green of the grass and the limestone of rocky roads hallo pearson said daddy weaver look like you ve been breaking a mustang what s that you ve got tied to your saddle a pig in a poke oh come on tonia if you re going said betty rogers we mustn t wait any longer we ve saved a seat in the buckboard for you never mind the hat that lovely muslin you ve got on looks sweet enough with any old hat pearson was slowly untying the queer thing on his saddle tonia looked at him with a sudden hope pearson was a man who created hope he got the thing loose and handed it to her her quick fingers tore at the strings best i could do said pearson slowly what road runner and me done to it will be about all it needs oh oh it s just the right shape shrieked tonia and red roses wait till i try it on she flew in to the glass and out again beaming radiating blossomed oh don t red become her chanted the girls in recitative hurry up tonia tonia stopped for a moment by the side of road runner thank you thank you wells she said happily it s just what i wanted won t you come over to cactus to morrow and go to church with me if i can said pearson he was looking curiously at her hat and then he grinned weakly tonia flew into the buckboard like a bird the vehicles sped away for cactus what have you been doing pearson asked daddy weaver you ain t looking so well as common me said pearson i ve been painting flowers them roses was white when i left lone elm help me down daddy weaver for i haven t got any more paint to spare round the circle this story is especially interesting as an early treatment of the theme afterward developed with a surer hand in the pendulum find yo shirt all right sam asked mrs webber from her chair under the live oak where she was comfortably seated with a paper back volume for company it balances perfeckly marthy answered sam with a suspicious pleasantness in his tone at first i was about ter be a little reckless and kick cause ther buttons was all off but since i diskiver that the button holes is all busted out why i wouldn t go so fur as to say the buttons is any loss to speak of oh well said his wife carelessly put on your necktie that ll keep it together sam webber s sheep ranch was situated in the loneliest part of the country between the nueces and the frio the ranch house a two room box structure was on the rise of a gently swelling hill in the midst of a wilderness of high chaparral in front of it was a small clearing where stood the sheep pens shearing shed and wool house only a few feet back of it began the thorny jungle sam was going to ride over to the chapman ranch to see about buying some more improved merino rams at length he came out ready for his ride this being a business trip of some importance and the chapman ranch being almost a small town in population and size sam had decided to dress up accordingly the result was that he had transformed himself from a graceful picturesque frontiersman into something much less pleasing to the sight the tight white collar awkwardly constricted his muscular mahogany colored neck the buttonless shirt bulged in stiff waves beneath his unbuttoned vest the suit of ready made effectually concealed the fine lines of his straight athletic figure his berry brown face was set to the melancholy dignity befitting a prisoner of state he gave randy his three year old son a pat on the head and hurried out to where mexico his favorite saddle horse was standing marthy leisurely rocking in her chair fixed her place in the book with her finger and turned her head smiling mischievously as she noted the havoc sam had wrought with his appearance in trying to fix up well ef i must say it sam she drawled you look jest like one of them hayseeds in the picture papers stead of a free and independent sheepman of the state o texas sam climbed awkwardly into the saddle you re the one ought to be shamed to say so he replied hotly stead of tendin to a man s clothes you re al ays setting around a readin them billy by dam yaller back novils oh shet up and ride along said mrs webber with a little jerk at the handles of her chair you always fussin bout my readin i do a plenty and i ll read when i wanter i live in the bresh here like a varmint never seein nor hearin nothin and what other musement kin i have not in listenin to you talk for it s complain complain one day after another oh go on sam and leave me in peace sam gave his pony a squeeze with his knees and shoved down the wagon trail that connected his ranch with the old open government road it was eight o clock and already beginning to be very warm he should have started three hours earlier chapman ranch was only eighteen miles away but there was a road for only three miles of the distance he had ridden over there once with one of the half moon cowpunchers and he had the direction well defined in his mind sam turned off the old government road at the split mesquite and struck down the arroyo of the quintanilla here was a narrow stretch of smiling valley upholstered with a rich mat of green curly mesquite grass and mexico consumed those few miles quickly with his long easy lope again upon reaching wild duck waterhole must he abandon well defined ways he turned now to his right up a little hill pebble covered upon which grew only the tenacious and thorny prickly pear and chaparral at the summit of this he paused to take his last general view of the landscape for from now on he must wind through brakes and thickets of chaparral pear and mesquite for the most part seeing scarcely farther than twenty yards in any direction choosing his way by the prairie dweller s instinct guided only by an occasional glimpse of a far distant hilltop a peculiarly shaped knot of trees or the position of the sun sam rode down the sloping hill and plunged into the great pear flat that lies between the quintanilla and the piedra in about two hours he discovered that he was lost then came the usual confusion of mind and the hurry to get somewhere mexico was anxious to redeem the situation twisting with alacrity along the tortuous labyrinths of the jungle at the moment his master s sureness of the route had failed his horse had divined the fact there were no hills now that they could climb to obtain a view of the country they came upon a few but so dense and interlaced was the brush that scarcely could a rabbit penetrate the mass they were in the great lonely thicket of the frio bottoms it was a mere nothing for a cattleman or a sheepman to be lost for a day or a night the thing often happened it was merely a matter of missing a meal or two and sleeping comfortably on your saddle blankets on a soft mattress of mesquite grass but in sam s case it was different he had never been away from his ranch at night marthy was afraid of the country afraid of mexicans of snakes of panthers even of sheep so he had never left her alone it must have been about four in the afternoon when sam s conscience awoke he was limp and drenched rather from anxiety than the heat or fatigue until now he had been hoping to strike the trail that led to the frio crossing and the chapman ranch he must have crossed it at some dim part of it and ridden beyond if so he was now something like fifty miles from home if he could strike a ranch a camp any place where he could get a fresh horse and inquire the road he would ride all night to get back to marthy and the kid so i have hinted sam was seized bv remorse there was a big lump in his throat as he thought of the cross words he had spoken to his wife surely it was hard enough for her to live in that horrible country witnout having to bear the burden of his abuse he cursed himself grimly and felt a sudden flush of shame that over glowed the summer heat as he remembered the many times he had flouted and railed at her because she had a liking for reading fiction ther only so ce ov amusement ther po gal s got said sam aloud with a sob which unaccustomed sound caused mexico to shy a bit a livin with a sore headed kiote like me a low down skunk that ought to be licked to death with a saddle cinch a cookin and a washin and a livin on mutton and beans and me abusin her fur takin a squint or two in a little book he thought of marthy as she had been when he first

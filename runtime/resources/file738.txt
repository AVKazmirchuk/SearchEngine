lit and told him of their dire need easter hats said uncle tommy sleepily why yes i believe i have got just a couple left i only ordered a dozen this spring i ll show em to you now uncle tommy sutton was a merchant half asleep or awake in dusty pasteboard boxes under the counter he had two left over spring hats but alas for his commercial probity on that early saturday morn they were hats of two springs ago and a woman s eye would have detected the fraud at half a glance but to the unintelligent gaze of the cowpuncher and the sheepman they seemed fresh from the mint of contemporaneous april the hats were of a variety once known as cart wheels they were of stiff straw colored red and flat brimmed both were exactly alike and trimmed lavishly around their crowns with full blown immaculate artificial white roses that all you got uncle tommy said pearson all right not much choice here burr take your pick they re the latest styles lied uncle tommy you d see em on fifth avenue if you was in new york uncle tommy wrapped and tied each hat in two yards of dark calico for a protection one pearson tied carefully to his calfskin saddle thongs and the other became part of road runner s burden they shouted thanks and farewells to uncle tommy and cantered back into the night on the home stretch the horsemen jockeyed with all their skill they rode more slowly on their way back the few words they spoke were not unfriendly burrows had a winchester under his left leg slung over his saddle horn pearson had a six shooter belted around him thus men rode in the frio country at half past seven in the morning they rode to the top of a hill and saw the espinosa ranch a white spot under a dark patch of live oaks five miles away the sight roused pearson from his drooping pose in the saddle he knew what road runner could do the sorrel was lathered and stumbling frequently road runner was pegging away like a donkey engine pearson turned toward the sheepman and laughed good bye burr he cried with a wave of his hand it s a race now we re on the home stretch he pressed road runner with his knees and leaned toward the espinosa road runner struck into a gallop with tossing head and snorting nostrils as if he were fresh from a month in pasture pearson rode twenty yards and heard the unmistakable sound of a winchester lever throwing a cartridge into the barrel he dropped flat along his horse s back before the crack of the rifle reached his ears it is possible that burrows intended only to disable the horse he was a good enough shot to do that without endangering his rider but as pearson stooped the ball went through his shoulder and then through road runner s neck the horse fell and the cowman pitched over his head into the hard road and neither of them tried to move burrows rode on without stopping in two hours pearson opened his eyes and took inventory he managed to get to his feet and staggered back to where road runner was lying road runner was lying there but he appeared to be comfortable pearson examined him and found that the bullet had creased him he had been knocked out temporarily but not seriously hurt but he was tired and he lay there on miss tonia s hat and ate leaves from a mesquite branch that obligingly hung over the road pearson made the horse get up the easter hat loosed from the saddle thongs lay there in its calico wrappings a shapeless thing from its sojourn beneath the solid carcass of road runner then pearson fainted and fell head long upon the poor hat again crumpling it under his wounded shoulders it is hard to kill a cowpuncher in half an hour he revived long enough for a woman to have fainted twice and tried ice cream for a restorer he got up carefully and found road runner who was busy with the near by grass he tied the unfortunate hat to the saddle again and managed to get himself there too after many failures at noon a gay and fluttering company waited in front of the espinosa ranch the rogers girls were there in their new buckboard and the anchor o outfit and the green valley folks mostly women and each and every one wore her new easter hat even upon the lonely prairies for they greatly desired to shine forth and do honor to the coming festival at the gate stood tonia with undisguised tears upon her cheeks in her hand she held burrow s lone elm hat and it was at its white roses hated by her that she wept for her friends were telling her with the ecstatic joy of true friends that cart wheels could not be worn being three seasons passed into oblivion put on your old hat and come tonia they urged for easter sunday she answered i ll die first and wept again the hats of the fortunate ones were curved and twisted into the style of spring s latest proclamation a strange being rode out of the brush among them and there sat his horse languidly he was stained and disfigured with the green of the grass and the limestone of rocky roads hallo pearson said daddy weaver look like you ve been breaking a mustang what s that you ve got tied to your saddle a pig in a poke oh come on tonia if you re going said betty rogers we mustn t wait any longer we ve saved a seat in the buckboard for you never mind the hat that lovely muslin you ve got on looks sweet enough with any old hat pearson was

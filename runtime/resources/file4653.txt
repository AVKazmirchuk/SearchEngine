to the left but a heavy express wagon cut him off he tried the right and had to back away from a furniture van that had no business to be there he tried to back out but dropped his reins and swore dutifully he was blockaded in a tangled mess of vehicles and horses one of those street blockades had occurred that sometimes tie up commerce and movement quite suddenly in the big city why don t you drive on said miss lantry impatiently we ll be late richard stood up in the cab and looked around he saw a congested flood of wagons trucks cabs vans and street cars filling the vast space where broadway sixth avenue and thirly fourth street cross one another as a twenty six inch maiden fills her twenty two inch girdle and still from all the cross streets they were hurrying and rattling toward the converging point at full speed and hurling thcmselves into the struggling mass locking wheels and adding their drivers imprecations to the clamour the entire traffic of manhattan seemed to have jammed itself around them the oldest new yorker among the thousands of spectators that lined the sidewalks had not witnessed a street blockade of the proportions of this one i m very sorry said richard as he resumed his seat but it looks as if we are stuck they won t get this jumble loosened up in an hour it was my fault if i hadn t dropped the ring we let me see the ring said miss lantry now that it can t be helped i don t care i think theatres are stupid anyway at o clock that night somebody tapped lightly on anthony rockwall s door come in shouted anthony who was in a red dressing gown reading a book of piratical adventures somebody was aunt ellen looking like a grey haired angel that had been left on earth by mistake they re engaged anthony she said softly she has promised to marry our richard on their way to the theatre there was a street blockade and it was two hours before their cab could get out of it and oh brother anthony don t ever boast of the power of money again a little emblem of true love a little ring that symbolised unending and unmercenary affection was the cause of our richard finding his happiness he dropped it in the street and got out to recover it and before they could continue the blockade occurred he spoke to his love and won her there while the cab was hemmed in money is dross compared with true love anthony all right said old anthony i m glad the boy has got what he wanted i told him i wouldn t spare any expense in the matter if but brother anthony what good could your money have done sister said anthony rockwall i ve got my pirate in a devil of a scrape his ship has just been scuttled and he s too good a judge of the value of money to let drown i wish you would let me go on with this chapter the story should end here i wish it would as heartily as you who read it wish it did but we must go to the bottom of the well for truth the next day a person with red hands and a blue polka dot necktie who called himself kelly called at anthony rockwall s house and was at once received in the library well said anthony reaching for his chequebook it was a good bilin of soap let s see you had in cash i paid out oo more of my own said kelly i had to go a little above the estimate i got the express wagons and cabs mostly for but the trucks and two horse teams mostly raised me to the motormen wanted and some of the loaded teams the cops struck me hardest i paid two and the rest and but didn t it work beautiful mr rockwall i m glad william a brady wasn t onto that little outdoor vehicle mob scene i wouldn t want william to break his heart with jealousy and never a rehearsal either the boys was on time to the fraction of a second it was two hours before a snake could get below greeley s statue thirteen hundred there you are kelly said anthony tearing off a check your thousand and the you were out you don t despise money do you kelly me said kelly i can lick the man that invented poverty anthony called kelly when he was at the door you didn t notice said he anywhere in the tie up a kind of a fat boy without any clothes on shooting arrows around with a bow did you why no said kelly mystified i didn t if he was like you say maybe the cops pinched him before i got there i thought the little rascal wouldn t be on hand chuckled anthony good by kelly springtime a la carte it was a day in march never never begin a story this way when you write one no opening could possibly be worse it is unimaginative flat dry and likely to consist of mere wind but in this instance it is allowable for the following paragraph which should have inaugurated the narrative is too wildly extravagant and preposterous to be flaunted in the face of the reader without preparation sarah was crying over her bill of fare think of a new york girl shedding tears on the menu card to account for this you will be allowed to guess that the lobsters were all out or that she had sworn ice cream off during lent or that she had ordered onions or that she had just come from a hackett matinee and then all these theories being wrong you will please let the story proceed the gentleman who announced that the world was an oyster which he with his sword would open made a larger hit than he deserved it is not difficult to open an oyster with a sword but did you ever notice any one try to open the terrestrial bivalve with a typewriter like to wait for a dozen raw opened that way sarah had managed to pry apart the shells with her unhandy weapon far enough to nibble a wee bit at the cold and clammy world within she knew no more shorthand than if she had been a graduate in stenography just let slip upon the world by a business college so not being able to stenog she could not enter that bright galaxy of office talent she was a free lance typewriter and canvassed for odd jobs of copying the most brilliant and crowning feat of sarah s battle with the world was the deal she made with schulenberg s home restaurant the restaurant was next door to the old red brick in which she ball roomed one evening after dining at schulenberg s cent five course table d hote served as fast as you throw the five baseballs at the coloured gentleman s head sarah took away with her the bill of fare it was written in an almost unreadable script neither english nor german and so arranged that if you were not careful you began with a toothpick and rice pudding and ended with soup and the day of the week the next day sarah showed schulenberg a neat card on which the menu was beautifully typewritten with the viands temptingly marshalled under their right and proper heads from hors d oeuvre to not responsible for overcoats and umbrellas schulenberg became a naturalised citizen on the spot before sarah left him she had him willingly committed to an agreement she was to furnish typewritten bills of fare for the twenty one tables in the restaurant a new bill for each day s dinner and new ones for breakfast and lunch as often as changes occurred in the food or as neatness required in return for this schulenberg was to send three meals per diem to sarah s hall room by a waiter an obsequious one if possible and furnish her each afternoon with a pencil draft of what fate had in store for schulenberg s customers on the morrow mutual satisfaction resulted from the agreement schulenberg s patrons now knew what the food they ate was called even if its nature sometimes puzzled them and sarah had food during a cold dull winter which was the main thing with her and then the almanac lied and said that spring had come spring comes when it comes the frozen snows of january still lay like adamant in the crosstown streets the hand organs still played in the good old summertime with their december vivacity and expression men began to make thirty day notes to buy easter dresses janitors shut off steam and when these things happen one may know that the city is still in the clutches of winter one afternoon sarah shivered in her elegant hall bedroom house heated scrupulously clean conveniences seen to be appreciated she had no work to do except schulenberg s menu cards sarah sat in her squeaky willow rocker and looked out the window the calendar on the wall kept crying to her springtime is here sarah springtime is here i tell you look at me sarah my figures show it you ve got a neat figure yourself sarah a nice springtime figure why do you look out the window so sadly sarah s room was at the back of the house looking out the window she could see the windowless rear brick wall of the box factory on the next street but the wall was clearest crystal and sarah was looking down a grassy lane shaded with cherry trees and elms and bordered with raspberry bushes and cherokee roses spring s real harbingers are too subtle for the eye and ear some must have the flowering crocus the wood starring dogwood the voice of bluebird even so gross a reminder as the farewell handshake of the retiring buckwheat and oyster before they can welcome the lady in green to their dull bosoms but to old earth s choicest kin there come straight sweet messages from his newest bride telling them they shall be no stepchildren unless they choose to be on the previous summer sarah had gone into the country and loved a farmer in writing your story never hark back thus it is bad art and cripples interest let it march march sarah stayed two weeks at sunnybrook farm there she learned to love old farmer franklin s son walter farmers have been loved and wedded and turned out to grass in less time but young walter franklin was a modern agriculturist he had a telephone in his cow house and he could figure up exactly what effect next year s canada wheat crop would have on potatoes planted in the dark of the moon it was in this shaded and raspberried lane that walter had wooed and won her and together they had sat and woven a crown of dandelions for her hair he had immoderately praised the effect of the yellow blossoms against her brown tresses and she had left the chaplet there and walked back to the house swinging her straw sailor in her hands they were to marry in the spring at the very first signs of spring walter said and sarah came back to the city to pound her typewriter a knock at the door dispelled sarah s visions of that happy day a waiter had brought the rough pencil draft of the home restaurant s next day fare in old schulenberg s angular hand sarah sat down to her typewriter and slipped a card between the rollers she was a nimble worker generally in an hour and a half the twenty one menu cards were written and ready to day there were more changes on the bill of fare than usual the soups were lighter pork was eliminated from the entrees figuring only with russian turnips among the roasts the gracious spirit of spring pervaded the entire menu lamb that lately capered on the greening hillsides was becoming exploited with the sauce that commemorated its gambols the song of the oyster though not silenced was diminuendo con amore the frying pan seemed to be held inactive behind the beneficent bars of the broiler the pie list swelled the richer puddings had vanished the sausage with his drapery wrapped about him barely lingered in a pleasant thanatopsis with the buckwheats and the sweet but doomed maple sarah s fingers danced like midgets above a summer stream down through the courses she worked giving each item its position according to its length with an accurate eye just above the desserts came the list of vegetables carrots and peas asparagus on toast the perennial tomatoes and corn and succotash lima beans cabbage and then sarah was crying over her bill of fare tears from the depths of some divine despair rose in her heart and gathered to her eyes down went her head on the little typewriter stand and the keyboard rattled a dry accompaniment to her moist sobs for she had received no letter from walter in two weeks and the next item on the bill of fare was dandelions dandelions with some kind of egg but bother the egg dandelions with whose golden blooms walter had crowned her his queen of love and future bride dandelions the harbingers of spring her sorrow s crown of sorrow reminder of her happiest days madam i dare you to smile until you suffer this test let the marechal niel roses that percy brought you on the night you gave him your heart be served as a salad with french dressing before your eyes at a schulenberg table d hote had juliet so seen her love tokens dishonoured the sooner would she have sought the lethean herbs of the good apothecary but what a witch is spring into the great cold city of stone and iron a message had to be sent there was none to convey it but the little hardy courier of the fields with his rough green coat and modest air he is a true soldier of fortune this dent de lion this lion s tooth as the french chefs call him flowered he will assist at love making wreathed in my lady s nut brown hair young and callow and unblossomed he goes into the boiling pot and delivers the word of his sovereign mistress by and by sarah forced back her tears the cards must be written but still in a faint golden glow from her dandeleonine dream she fingered the typewriter keys absently for a little while with her mind and heart in the meadow lane with her young farmer but soon she came swiftly back to the rock bound lanes of manhattan and the typewriter began to rattle and jump like a strike breaker s motor car at o clock the waiter brought her dinner and carried away the typewritten bill of fare when sarah ate she set aside with a sigh the dish of dandelions with its crowning ovarious accompaniment as this dark mass had been transformed from a bright and love indorsed flower to be an ignominious vegetable so had her summer hopes wilted and perished love may as shakespeare said feed on itself but sarah could not bring herself to eat the dandelions that had graced as ornaments the first spiritual banquet of her heart s true affection at the couple in the next room began to quarrel the man in the room above sought for a on his flute the gas went a little lower three coal wagons started to unload the only sound of which the phonograph is jealous cats on the back fences slowly retreated toward mukden by these signs sarah knew that it was time for her to read she got out the cloister and the hearth the best non selling book of the month settled her feet on her trunk and began to wander with gerard the front door bell rang the landlady answered it sarah left gerard and denys treed by a bear and listened oh yes you would just as she did and then a strong voice was heard in the hall below and sarah jumped for her door leaving the book on the floor and the first round easily the bear s you have guessed it she reached the top of the stairs just as her farmer came up three at a jump and reaped and garnered her with nothing left for the gleaners why haven t you written oh why cried sarah new york is a pretty large town said walter franklin i came in a week ago to your old address i found that you went away on a thursday that consoled some it eliminated the possible friday bad luck but it didn t prevent my hunting for you with police and otherwise ever since i wrote said sarah vehemently never got it then how did you find me the young farmer smiled a springtime smile i dropped into that home restaurant next door this evening said he i don t care who knows it i like a dish of some kind of greens at this time of the year i ran my eye down that nice typewritten bill of fare looking for something in that line when i got below cabbage i turned my chair over and hollered for the proprietor he told me where you lived i remember sighed sarah happily that was dandelions below cabbage i d know that cranky capital w way above the line that your typewriter makes anywhere in the world said franklin why there s no w in dandelions said sarah in surprise the young man drew the bill of fare from his pocket and pointed to a line sarah recognised the first card she had typewritten that afternoon there was still the rayed splotch in the upper right hand corner where a tear had fallen but over the spot where one should have read the name of the meadow plant the clinging memory of their golden blossoms had allowed her fingers to strike strange keys between the red cabbage and the stuffed green peppers was the item dearest walter with hard boiled egg the green door suppose you should be walking down broadway after dinner with ten minutes allotted to the consummation of your cigar while you are choosing between a diverting tragedy and something serious in the way of vaudeville suddenly a hand is laid upon your arm you turn to look into the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman wonderful in diamonds and russian sables she thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll flashes out a tiny pair of scissors snips off the second button of your overcoat meaningly ejaculates the one word parallelogram and swiftly flies down a cross street looking back fearfully over her shoulder that would be pure adventure would you accept it not you you would flush with embarrassment you would sheepishly drop the roll and continue down broadway fumbling feebly for the missing button this you would do unless you are one of the blessed few in whom the pure spirit of adventure is not dead true adventurers have never been plentiful they who are set down in print as such have been mostly business men with newly invented methods they have been out after the things they wanted golden fleeces holy grails lady loves treasure crowns and fame the true adventurer goes forth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate a fine example was the prodigal son when he started back home half adventurers brave and splendid figures have been numerous from the crusades to the palisades they have enriched the arts of history and fiction and the trade of historical fiction but each of them had a prize to win a goal to kick an axe to grind a race to run a new thrust in tierce to deliver a name to carve a crow to pick so they were not followers of true adventure in the big city the twin spirits romance and adventure are always abroad seeking worthy wooers as we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and challenge us in twenty different guises without knowing why we look up suddenly to see in a window a face that seems to belong to our gallery of intimate portraits in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry of agony and fear coming from an empty and shuttered house instead of at our familiar curb a cab driver deposits us before a strange door which one with a smile opens for us and bids us enter a slip of paper written upon flutters down to our feet from the high lattices of chance we exchange glances of instantaneous hate affection and fear with hurrying strangers in the passing crowds a sudden douse of rain and our umbrella may be sheltering the daughter of the full moon and first cousin of the sidereal system at every corner handkerchiefs drop fingers beckon eyes besiege and the lost the lonely the rapturous the mysterious the perilous changing clues of adventure are slipped into our fingers but few of us are willing to hold and follow them we are grown stiff with the ramrod of convention down our backs we pass on and some day we come at the end of a very dull life to reflect that our romance has been a pallid thing of a marriage or two a satin rosette kept in a safe deposit drawer and a lifelong feud with a steam radiator rudolf steiner was a true adventurer few were the evenings on which he did not go forth from his hall bedchamber in search of the unexpected and the egregious the most interesting thing in life seemed to him to be what might lie just around the next corner sometimes his willingness to tempt fate led him into strange paths twice he had spent the night in a station house again and again he had found himself the dupe of ingenious and mercenary tricksters his watch and money had been the price of one flattering allurement but with undiminished ardour he picked up every glove cast before him into the merry lists of adventure one evening rudolf was strolling along a crosstown street in the older central part of the city two streams of people filled the sidewalks the home hurrying and that restless contingent that abandons home for the specious welcome of the thousand candle power table d hote the young adventurer was of pleasing presence and moved serenely and watchfully by daylight he was a salesman in a piano store he wore his tie drawn through a topaz ring instead of fastened with a stick pin and once he had written to the editor of a magazine that junie s love test by miss libbey had been the book that had most influenced his life during his walk a violent chattering of teeth in a glass case on the sidewalk seemed at first to draw his attention with a qualm to a restaurant before which it was set but a second glance revealed the electric letters of a dentist s sign high above the next door a giant negro fantastically dressed in a red embroidered coat yellow trousers and a military cap discreetly distributed cards to those of the passing crowd who consented to take them this mode of dentistic advertising was a common sight to rudolf usually he passed the dispenser of the dentist s cards without reducing his store but tonight the african slipped one into his hand so deftly that he retained it there smiling a little at the successful feat when he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card indifferently surprised he turned it over and looked again with interest one side of the card was blank on the other was written in ink three words the green door and then rudolf saw three steps in front of him a man throw down the card the negro had given him as he passed rudolf picked it up it was printed with the dentist s name and address and the usual schedule of plate work and bridge work and specious promises of painless operations the adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered then he crossed the street walked down a block recrossed and joined the upward current of people again without seeming to notice the negro as he passed the second time he carelessly took the card that was handed him ten steps away he inspected it in the same handwriting that appeared on the first card the green door was inscribed upon it three or four cards were tossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following and leading him these fell blank side up rudolf turned them over every one bore the printed legend of the dental parlours rarely did the arch sprite adventure need to beckon twice to rudolf steiner his true follower but twice it had been done and the quest was on rudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of rattling teeth this time as he passed he received no card in spite of his gaudy and ridiculous garb the ethiopian displayed a natural barbaric dignity as he stood offering the cards suavely to some allowing others to pass unmolested every half minute he chanted a harsh unintelligible phrase akin to the jabber of car conductors and grand opera and not only did he withhold a card this time but it seemed to rudolf that he received from the shining and massive black countenance a look of cold almost contemptuous disdain the look stung the adventurer he read in it a silent accusation that he had been found wanting whatever the mysterious written words on the cards might mean the black had selected him twice from the throng for their recipient and now seemed to have condemned him as deficient in the wit and spirit to engage the enigma standing aside from the rush the young man made a rapid estimate of the building in which he conceived that his adventure must lie five stories high it rose a small restaurant occupied the basement the first floor now closed seemed to house millinery or furs the second floor by the winking electric letters was the dentist s above this a polyglot babel of signs struggled to indicate the abodes of palmists dressmakers musicians and doctors still higher up draped curtains and milk bottles white on the window sills proclaimed the regions of domesticity after concluding his survey rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of stone steps into the house up two flights of the carpeted stairway he continued and at its top paused the hallway there was dimly lighted by two pale jets of gas one far to his right the other nearer to his left he looked toward the nearer light and saw within its wan halo a green door for one moment he hesitated then he seemed to see the contumelious sneer of the african juggler of cards and then he walked straight to the green door and knocked against it moments like those that passed before his knock was answered measure the quick breath of true adventure what might not be behind those green panels gamesters at play cunning rogues baiting their traps with subtle skill beauty in love with courage and thus planning to be sought by it danger death love disappointment ridicule any of these might respond to that temerarious rap a faint rustle was heard inside and the door slowly opened a girl not yet twenty stood there white faced and tottering she loosed the knob and swayed weakly groping with one hand rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch that stood against the wall he closed the door and took a swift glance around the room by the light of a flickering gas jet neat but extreme poverty was the story that he read the girl lay still as if in a faint rudolf looked around the room excitedly for a barrel people must be rolled upon a barrel who no no that was for drowned persons he began to fan her with his hat that was successful for he struck her nose with the brim of his derby and she opened her eyes and then the young man saw that hers indeed was the one missing face from his heart s gallery of intimate portraits the frank grey eyes the little nose turning pertly outward the chestnut hair curling like the tendrils of a pea vine seemed the right end and reward of all his wonderful adventures but the face was wofully thin and pale the girl looked at him calmly and then smiled fainted didn t i she asked weakly well who wouldn t you try going without anything to eat for three days and see himmel exclaimed rudolf jumping up wait till i come back he dashed out the green door and down the stairs in twenty minutes he was back again kicking at the door with his toe for her to open it with both arms he hugged an array of wares from the grocery and the restaurant on the table he laid them bread and butter cold meats cakes pies pickles oysters a roasted chicken a bottle of milk and one of redhot tea this is ridiculous said rudolf blusteringly to go without eating you must quit making election bets of this kind supper is ready he helped her to a chair at the table and asked is there a cup for the tea on the shelf by the window she answered when he turned again with the cup he saw her with eyes shining rapturously beginning upon a huge dill pickle that she had rooted out from the paper bags with a woman s unerring instinct he took it from her laughingly and poured the cup full of milk drink that first he ordered and then you shall have some tea and then a chicken wing if you are very good you shall have a pickle to morrow and now if you ll allow me to be your guest we ll have supper he drew up the other chair the tea brightened the girl s eyes and brought back some of her colour she began to eat with a sort of dainty ferocity like some starved wild animal she seemcd to regard the young man s presence and the aid he had rendered her as a natural thing not as though she undervalued the conventions but as one whose great stress gave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human but gradually with the return of strength and comfort came also a sense of the little conventions that belong and she began to tell him her little story it was one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every day the shop girl s story of insufficient wages further reduced by fines that go to swell the store s profits of time lost through illness and then of lost positions lost hope and the knock of the adventurer upon the green door but to rudolf the history sounded as big as the iliad or the crisis in junie s love test to think of you going through all that he exclaimed it was something fierce said the girl solemnly and you have no relatives or friends in the city none whatever i am all alone in the world too said rudolf after a pause i am glad of that said the girl promptly and somehow it pleased the young man to hear that she approved of his bereft condition very suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply i m awfully sleepy she said and i feel so good then rudolf rose and took his hat i ll say good night a long night s sleep will be fine for you he held out his hand and she took it and said good night but her eyes asked a question so eloquently so frankly and pathetically that he answered it with words oh i m coming back to morrow to see how you are getting along you can t get rid of me so easily then at the door as though the way of his coming had been so much less important than the fact that he had come she asked how did you come to knock at my door he looked at her for a moment remembering the cards and felt a sudden jealous pain what if they had fallen into other hands as adventurous as his quickly he decided that she must never know the truth he would never let her know that he was aware of the strange expedient to which she had been driven by her great distress one of our piano tuners lives in this house he said i knocked at your door by mistake the last thing he saw in the room before the green door closed was her smile at the head of the stairway he paused and looked curiously about him and then he went along the hallway to its other end and coming back ascended to the floor above and continued his puzzled explorations every door that he found in the house was painted green wondering he descended to the sidewalk the fantastic african was still there rudolf confronted him with his two cards in his hand will you tell me why you gave me these cards and what they mean he asked in a broad good natured grin the negro exhibited a splendid advertisement of his master s profession dar it is boss he said pointing down the street but i spect you is a little late for de fust act looking the way he pointed rudolf saw above the entrance to a theatre the blazing electric sign of its new play the green door i m informed dat it s a fust rate show sah said the negro de agent what represents it pussented me with a dollar sah to distribute a few of his cards along with de doctah s may i offer you one of de doctah s cards sah at the corner of the block in which he lived rudolf stopped for a glass of beer and a cigar when he had come out with his lighted weed he buttoned his coat pushed back his hat and said stoutly to the lamp post on the corner all the same i believe it was the hand of fate that doped out the way for me to find her which conclusion under the circumstances certainly admits rudolf steiner to the ranks of the true followers of romance and adventure from the cabby s seat the cabby has his point of view it is more single minded perhaps than that of a follower of any other calling from the high swaying seat of his hansom he looks upon his fellow men as nomadic particles of no account except when possessed of migratory desires he is jehu and you are goods in transit be you president or vagabond to cabby you are only a fare he takes you up cracks his whip joggles your vertebrae and sets you down when time for payment arrives if you exhibit a familiarity with legal rates you come to know what contempt is if you find that you have left your pocketbook behind you are made to realise the mildness of dante s imagination it is not an extravagant theory that the cabby s singleness of purpose and concentrated view of life are the results of the hansom s peculiar construction the cock of the roost sits aloft like jupiter on an unsharable seat holding your fate between two thongs of inconstant leather helpless ridiculous confined bobbing like a toy mandarin you sit like a rat in a trap you before whom butlers cringe on solid land and must squeak upward through a slit in your peripatetic sarcophagus to make your feeble wishes known then in a cab you are not even an occupant you are contents you are a cargo at sea and the cherub that sits up aloft has davy jones s street and number by heart one night there were sounds of revelry in the big brick tenement house next door but one to mcgary s family cafe the sounds seemed to emanate from the apartments of the walsh family the sidewalk was obstructed by an assortment of interested neighbours who opened a lane from time to time for a hurrying messenger bearing from mcgary s goods pertinent to festivity and diversion the sidewalk contingent was engaged in comment and discussion from which it made no effort to eliminate the news that norah walsh was being married in the fulness of time there was an eruption of the merry makers to the sidewalk the uninvited guests enveloped and permeated them and upon the night air rose joyous cries congratulations laughter and unclassified noises born of mcgary s oblations to the hymeneal scene close to the curb stood jerry o donovan s cab night hawk was jerry called but no more lustrous or cleaner hansom than his ever closed its doors upon point lace and november violets and jerry s horse i am within bounds when i tell you that he was stuffed with oats until one of those old ladies who leave their dishes unwashed at home and go about having expressmen arrested would have smiled yes smiled to have seen him among the shifting sonorous pulsing crowd glimpses could be had of jerry s high hat battered by the winds and rains of many years of his nose like a carrot battered by the frolicsome athletic progeny of millionaires and by contumacious fares of his brass buttoned green coat admired in the vicinity of mcgary s it was plain that jerry had usurped the functions of his cab and was carrying a load indeed the figure may be extended and he be likened to a bread waggon if we admit the testimony of a youthful spectator who was heard to remark jerry has got a bun from somewhere among the throng in the street or else out of the thin stream of pedestrians a young woman tripped and stood by the cab the professional hawk s eye of jerry caught the movement he made a lurch for the cab overturning three or four onlookers and himself no he caught the cap of a water plug and kept his feet like a sailor shinning up the ratlins during a squall jerry mounted to his professional seat once he was there mcgary s liquids were baffled he seesawed on the mizzenmast of his craft as safe as a steeple jack rigged to the flagpole of a skyscraper step in lady said jerry gathering his lines the young woman stepped into the cab the doors shut with a bang jerry s whip cracked in the air the crowd in the gutter scattered and the fine hansom dashed away crosstown when the oat spry horse had hedged a little his first spurt of speed jerry broke the lid of his cab and called down through the aperture in the voice of a cracked megaphone trying to please where now will ye be drivin to anywhere you please came up the answer musical and contented tis drivin for pleasure she is thought jerry and then he suggested as a matter of course take a thrip around in the park lady twill be ilegant cool and fine just as you like answered the fare pleasantly the cab headed for fifth avenue and sped up that perfect street jerry bounced and swayed in his seat the potent fluids of mcgary were disquieted and they sent new fumes to his head he sang an ancient song of killisnook and brandished his whip like a baton inside the cab the fare sat up straight on the cushions looking to right and left at the lights and houses even in the shadowed hansom her eyes shone like stars at twilight when they reached fifty ninth street jerry s head was bobbing and his reins were slack but his horse turned in through the park gate and began the old familiar nocturnal round and then the fare leaned back entranced and breathed deep the clean wholesome odours of grass and leaf and bloom and the wise beast in the shafts knowing his ground struck into his by the hour gait and kept to the right of the road habit also struggled successfully against jerry s increasing torpor he raised the hatch of his storm tossed vessel and made the inquiry that cabbies do make in the park like shtop at the cas sino lady gezzer r freshm s n lish n the music ev body shtops i think that would be nice said the fare they reined up with a plunge at the casino entrance the cab doors flew open the fare stepped directly upon the floor at once she was caught in a web of ravishing music and dazzled by a panorama of lights and colours some one slipped a little square card into her hand on which was printed a number she looked around and saw her cab twenty yards away already lining up in its place among the waiting mass of carriages cabs and motor cars and then a man who seemed to be all shirt front danced backward before her and next she was seated at a little table by a railing over which climbed a jessamine vine there seemed to be a wordless invitation to purchase she consulted a collection of small coins in a thin purse and received from them license to order a glass of beer there she sat inhaling and absorbing it all the new coloured new shaped life in a fairy palace in an enchanted wood at fifty tables sat princes and queens clad in all the silks and gems of the world and now and then one of them would look curiously at jerry s fare they saw a plain figure dressed in a pink silk of the kind that is tempered by the word foulard and a plain face that wore a look of love of life that the queens envied twice the long hands of the clocks went round royalties thinned from their al fresco thrones and buzzed or clattered away in their vehicles of state the music retired into cases of wood and bags of leather and baize waiters removed cloths pointedly near the plain figure sitting almost alone jerry s fare rose and held out her numbered card simply is there anything coming on the ticket she asked a waiter told her it was her cab check and that she should give it to the man at the entrance this man took it and called the number only three hansoms stood in line the driver of one of them went and routed out jerry asleep in his cab he swore deeply climbed to the captain s bridge and steered his craft to the pier his fare entered and the cab whirled into the cool fastnesses of the park along the shortest homeward cuts at the gate a glimmer of reason in the form of sudden suspicion seized upon jerry s beclouded mind one or two things occurred to him he stopped his horse raised the trap and dropped his phonographic voice like a lead plummet through the aperture i want to see four dollars before goin any further on th thrip have ye got th dough four dollars laughed the fare softly dear me no i ve only got a few pennies and a dime or two jerry shut down the trap and slashed his oat fed horse the clatter of hoofs strangled but could not drown the sound of his profanity he shouted choking and gurgling curses at the starry heavens he cut viciously with his whip at passing vehicles he scattered fierce and ever changing oaths and imprecations along the streets so that a late truck driver crawling homeward heard and was abashed but he knew his recourse and made for it at a gallop at the house with the green lights beside the steps he pulled up he flung wide the cab doors and tumbled heavily to the ground come on you he said roughly his fare came forth with the casino dreamy smile still on her plain face jerry took her by the arm and led her into the police station a gray moustached sergeant looked keenly across the desk he and the cabby were no strangers sargeant began jerry in his old raucous martyred thunderous tones of complaint i ve got a fare here that jerry paused he drew a knotted red hand across his brow the fog set up by mcgary was beginning to clear away a fare sargeant he continued with a grin that i want to inthroduce to ye it s me wife that i married at ould man walsh s this avening and a divil of a time we had tis thrue shake hands wid th sargeant norah and we ll be off to home before stepping into the cab norah sighed profoundly i ve had such a nice time jerry said she an unfinished story we no longer groan and heap ashes upon our heads when the flames of tophet are mentioned for even the preachers have begun to tell us that god is radium or ether or some scientific compound and that the worst we wicked ones may expect is a chemical reaction this is a pleasing hypothesis but there lingers yet some of the old goodly terror of orthodoxy there are but two subjects upon which one may discourse with a free imagination and without the possibility of being controverted you may talk of your dreams and you may tell what you heard a parrot say both morpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses and your listener dare not attack your recital the baseless fabric of a vision then shall furnish my theme chosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more limited field of pretty polly s small talk i had a dream that was so far removed from the higher criticism that it had to do with the ancient respectable and lamented bar of judgment theory gabriel had played his trump and those of us who could not follow suit were arraigned for examination i noticed at one side a gathering of professional bondsmen in solemn black and collars that buttoned behind but it seemed there was some trouble about their real estate titles and they did not appear to be getting any of us out a fly cop an angel policeman flew over to me and took me by the left wing near at hand was a group of very prosperous looking spirits arraigned for judgment do you belong with that bunch the policeman asked who are they was my answer why said he they are but this irrelevant stuff is taking up space that the story should occupy dulcie worked in a department store she sold hamburg edging or stuffed peppers or automobiles or other little trinkets such as they keep in department stores of what she earned dulcie received six dollars per week the remainder was credited to her and debited to somebody else s account in the ledger kept by g oh primal energy you say reverend doctor well then in the ledger of primal energy during her first year in the store dulcie was paid five dollars per week it would be instructive to know how she lived on that amount don t care very well probably you are interested in larger amounts six dollars is a larger amount i will tell you how she lived on six dollars per week one afternoon at six when dulcie was sticking her hat pin within an eighth of an inch of her medulla oblongata she said to her chum sadie the girl that waits on you with her left side say sade i made a date for dinner this evening with piggy you never did exclaimed sadie admiringly well ain t you the lucky one piggy s an awful swell and he always takes a girl to swell places he took blanche up to the hoffman house one evening where they have swell music and you see a lot of swells you ll have a swell time dulce dulcie hurried homeward her eyes were shining and her cheeks showed the delicate pink of life s real life s approaching dawn it was friday and she had fifty cents left of her last week s wages the streets were filled with the rush hour floods of people the electric lights of broadway were glowing calling moths from miles from leagues from hundreds of leagues out of darkness around to come in and attend the singeing school men in accurate clothes with faces like those carved on cherry stones by the old salts in sailors homes turned and stared at dulcie as she sped unheeding past them manhattan the night blooming cereus was beginning to unfold its dead white heavy odoured petals dulcie stopped in a store where goods were cheap and bought an imitation lace collar with her fifty cents that money was to have been spent otherwise fifteen cents for supper ten cents for breakfast ten cents for lunch another dime was to be added to her small store of savings and five cents was to be squandered for licorice drops the kind that made your cheek look like the toothache and last as long the licorice was an extravagance almost a carouse but what is life without pleasures dulcie lived in a furnished room there is this difference between a furnished room and a boardinghouse in a furnished room other people do not know it when you go hungry dulcie went up to her room the third floor back in a west side brownstone front she lit the gas scientists tell us that the diamond is the hardest substance known their mistake landladies know of a compound beside which the diamond is as putty they pack it in the tips of gas burners and one may stand on a chair and dig at it in vain until one s fingers are pink and bruised a hairpin will not remove it therefore let us call it immovable so dulcie lit the gas in its one fourth candlepower glow we will observe the room couch bed dresser table washstand chair of this much the landlady was guilty the rest was dulcie s on the dresser were her treasures a gilt china vase presented to her by sadie a calendar issued by a pickle works a book on the divination of dreams some rice powder in a glass dish and a cluster of artificial cherries tied with a pink ribbon against the wrinkly mirror stood pictures of general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini against one wall was a plaster of paris plaque of an o callahan in a roman helmet near it was a violent oleograph of a lemon coloured child assaulting an inflammatory butterfly this was dulcie s final judgment in art but it had never been upset her rest had never been disturbed by whispers of stolen copes no critic had elevated his eyebrows at her infantile entomologist piggy was to call for her at seven while she swiftly makes ready let us discreetly face the other way and gossip for the room dulcie paid two dollars per week on week days her breakfast cost ten cents she made coffee and cooked an egg over the gaslight while she was dressing on sunday mornings she feasted royally on veal chops and pineapple fritters at billy s restaurant at a cost of twenty five cents and tipped the waitress ten cents new york presents so many temptations for one to run into extravagance she had her lunches in the department store restaurant at a cost of sixty cents for the week dinners were the evening papers show me a new yorker going without his daily paper came to six cents and two sunday papers one for the personal column and the other to read were ten cents the total amounts to now one has to buy clothes and i give it up i hear of wonderful bargains in fabrics and of miracles performed with needle and thread but i am in doubt i hold my pen poised in vain when i would add to dulcie s life some of those joys that belong to woman by virtue of all the unwritten sacred natural inactive ordinances of the equity of heaven twice she had been to coney island and had ridden the hobby horses tis a weary thing to count your pleasures by summers instead of by hours piggy needs but a word when the girls named him an undeserving stigma was cast upon the noble family of swine the words of three letters lesson in the old blue spelling book begins with piggy s biography he was fat he had the soul of a rat the habits of a bat and the magnanimity of a cat he wore expensive clothes and was a connoisseur in starvation he could look at a shop girl and tell you to an hour how long it had been since she had eaten anything more nourishing than marshmallows and tea he hung about the shopping districts and prowled around in department stores with his invitations to dinner men who escort dogs upon the streets at the end of a string look down upon him he is a type i can dwell upon him no longer my pen is not the kind intended for him i am no carpenter at ten minutes to seven dulcie was ready she looked at herself in the wrinkly mirror the reflection was satisfactory the dark blue dress fitting without a wrinkle the hat with its jaunty black feather the but slightly soiled gloves all representing self denial even of food itself were vastly becoming dulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was beautiful and that life was about to lift a corner of its mysterious veil for her to observe its wonders no gentleman had ever asked her out before now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and exalted show the girls said that piggy was a spender there would be a grand dinner and music and splendidly dressed ladies to look at and things to eat that strangely twisted the girls jaws when they tried to tell about them no doubt she would be asked out again there was a blue pongee suit in a window that she knew by saving twenty cents a week instead of ten in let s see oh it would run into years but there was a second hand store in seventh avenue where somebody knocked at the door dulcie opened it the landlady stood there with a spurious smile sniffing for cooking by stolen gas a gentleman s downstairs to see you she said name is mr wiggins by such epithet was piggy known to unfortunate ones who had to take him seriously dulcie turned to the dresser to get her handkerchief and then she stopped still and bit her underlip hard while looking in her mirror she had seen fairyland and herself a princess just awakening from a long slumber she had forgotten one that was watching her with sad beautiful stern eyes the only one there was to approve or condemn what she did straight and slender and tall with a look of sorrowful reproach on his handsome melancholy face general kitchener fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the dresser dulcie turned like an automatic doll to the landlady tell him i can t go she said dully tell him i m sick or something tell him i m not going out after the door was closed and locked dulcie fell upon her bed crushing her black tip and cried for ten minutes general kitchener was her only friend he was dulcie s ideal of a gallant knight he looked as if he might have a secret sorrow and his wonderful moustache was a dream and she was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes she used to have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime and ask for her with his sword clanking against his high boots once when a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a lamp post she had opened the window and looked out but there was no use she knew that general kitchener was away over in japan leading his army against the savage turks and he would never step out of his gilt frame for her yet one look from him had vanquished piggy that night yes for that night when her cry was over dulcie got up and took off her best dress and put on her old blue kimono she wanted no dinner she sang two verses of sammy then she became intensely interested in a little red speck on the side of her nose and after that was attended to she drew up a chair to the rickety table and told her fortune with an old deck of cards the horrid impudent thing she said aloud and i never gave him a word or a look to make him think it at nine o clock dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of raspberry jam out of her trunk and had a feast she offered general kitchener some jam on a cracker but he only looked at her as the sphinx would have looked at a butterfly if there are butterflies in the desert don t eat it if you don t want to said dulcie and don t put on so many airs and scold so with your eyes i wonder if you d he so superior and snippy if you had to live on six dollars a week it was not a good sign for dulcie to be rude to general kitchener and then she turned benvenuto cellini face downward with a severe gesture but that was not inexcusable for she had always thought he was henry viii and she did not approve of him at half past nine dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the dresser turned out the light and skipped into bed it s an awful thing to go to bed with a good night look at general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini this story really doesn t get anywhere at all the rest of it comes later sometime when piggy asks dulcie again to dine with him and she is feeling lonelier than usual and general kitchener happens to be looking the other way and then as i said before i dreamed that i was standing near a crowd of prosperous looking angels and a policeman took me by the wing and asked if i belonged with

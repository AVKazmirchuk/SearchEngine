james williams s face was recorded a little library of the world s best thoughts in three volumes volume no contained the belief that james williams was about the right sort of thing volume no was an essay on the world declaring it to be a very excellent place volume no disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest seat in a rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes all understanding james williams you would have guessed was about twenty four it will gratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate he was exactly twenty three years eleven months and twenty nine days old he was well built active strong jawed good natured and rising he was on his wedding trip dear kind fairy please cut out those orders for money and h p touring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of the boat club instead of any of them turn backward oh turn backward and give us just a teeny weeny bit of our wedding trip over again just an hour dear fairy so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees looked and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin even if it was the hatpins that did the work can t do it very well hurry up with that touring car and the oil stock then just in front of mrs james williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses only in dreams and milliners shops do we alas gather grapes and roses at one swipe this girl gazed with large blue eyes credulous when the megaphone man roared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should be concerned between blasts she resorted to epictetian philosophy in the form of pepsin chewing gum at this girl s right hand sat a young man about twenty four he was well built active strong jawed and good natured but if his description seems to follow that of james williams divest it of anything cloverdalian this man belonged to hard streets and sharp corners he looked keenly about him seeming to begrudge the asphalt under the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch while the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry let me whisper you through the low tuned cardiaphone to sit tight for now things are about to happen and the great city will close over them again as over a scrap of ticker tape floating down from the den of a broad street bear the girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the last seat the other passengers she had absorbed the seat behind her was her bluebeard s chamber her eyes met those of mrs james williams between two ticks of a watch they exchanged their life s experiences histories hopes and fancies and all mind you with the eye before two men could have decided whether to draw steel or borrow a match the bride leaned forward low she and the girl spoke rapidly together their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents a comparison that is not meant to go further two smiles and a dozen nods closed the conference and now in the broad quiet avenue in front of the rubberneck car a man in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand from the sidewalk another hurried to join him the girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm and whispered in his ear that young man exhibited proof of ability to act promptly crouching low he slid over the edge of the car hung lightly for an instant and then disappeared half a dozen of the top riders observed his feat wonderingly but made no comment deeming it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional manner of alighting in this bewildering city the truant passenger dodged a hansom and then floated past like a leaf on a stream between a furniture van and a florist s delivery wagon the girl in the tan jacket turned again and looked in the eyes of mrs james williams then she faced about and sat still while the rubberneck auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the plainclothes man what s eatin you demanded the megaphonist abandoning his professional discourse for pure english keep her at anchor for a minute ordered the officer there s a man on board we want a philadelphia burglar called pinky mcguire there he is on the back seat look out for the side donovan donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at james williams come down old sport he said pleasantly we ve got you back to sleepytown for yours it ain t a bad idea hidin on a rubberneck though i ll remember that softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor better step off sir and explain the car must proceed on its tour james williams belonged among the level heads with necessary slowness he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front of the car his wife followed but she first turned her eyes and saw the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind a tree on the edge of the little park not fifty feet away descended to the ground james williams faced his captors with a smile he was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in cloverdale about having been mistaken for a burglar the rubberneck coach lingered out of respect for its patrons what could be a more interesting sight than this my name is james williams of cloverdale missouri he said kindly so that they would not be too greatly mortified i have letters here that will show you ll come with us please announced the plainclothes man pinky

mr meeks in the theatres of course look at that piece of programme mr meeks observe the round impression in it it has been wrapped around a ring perhaps a ring of great value mrs snyder found the ring while at work in the theatre she hastily tore off a piece of a programme wrapped the ring carefully and thrust it into her bosom the next day she disposed of it and with her increased means looked about her for a more comfortable place in which to live when i reach thus far in the chain i see nothing impossible about no avenue c it is there we will find your sister mr meeks shamrock jolnes concluded his convincing speech with the smile of a successful artist meeks s admiration was too great for words together they went to no avenue c it was an old fashioned brownstone house in a prosperous and respectable neighbourhood they rang the bell and on inquiring were told that no mrs snyder was known there and that not within six months had a new occupant come to the house when they reached the sidewalk again meeks examined the clues which he had brought away from his sister s old room i am no detective he remarked to jolnes as he raised the piece of theatre programme to his nose but it seems to me that instead of a ring having been wrapped in this paper it was one of those round peppermint drops and this piece with the address on it looks to me like the end of a seat coupon no row c left aisle shamrock jolnes had a far away look in his eyes i think you would do well to consult juggins said he who is juggins asked meeks he is the leader said jolnes of a new modern school of detectives their methods are different from ours but it is said that juggins has solved some extremely puzzling cases i will take you to him they found the greater juggins in his office he was a small man with light hair deeply absorbed in reading one of the bourgeois works of nathaniel hawthorne the two great detectives of different schools shook hands with ceremony and meeks was introduced state the facts said juggins going on with his reading when meeks ceased the greater one closed his book and said do i understand that your sister is fifty two years of age with a large mole on the side of her nose and that she is a very poor widow making a scanty living by scrubbing and with a very homely face and figure that describes her exactly admitted meeks juggins rose and put on his hat in fifteen minutes he said i will return bringing you her present address shamrock jolnes turned pale but forced a smile within the specified time juggins returned and consulted a little slip of paper held in his hand your sister mary snyder he announced calmly will be found at no chilton street she is living in the back hall bedroom five flights up the house is only four blocks from here he continued addressing meeks suppose you go and verify the statement and then return here mr jolnes will await you i dare say meeks hurried away in twenty minutes he was back again with a beaming face she is there and well he cried name your fee two dollars said juggins when meeks had settled his bill and departed shamrock jolnes stood with his hat in his hand before juggins if it would not be asking too much he stammered if you would favour me so far would you object to certainly not said juggins pleasantly i will tell you how i did it you remember the description of mrs snyder did you ever know a woman like that who wasn t paying weekly instalments on an enlarged crayon portrait of herself the biggest factory of that kind in the country is just around the corner i went there and got her address off the books that s all witches loaves miss martha meacham kept the little bakery on the corner the one where you go up three steps and the bell tinkles when you open the door miss martha was forty her bank book showed a credit of two thousand dollars and she possessed two false teeth and a sympathetic heart many people have married whose chances to do so were much inferior to miss martha s two or three times a week a customer came in in whom she began to take an interest he was a middle aged man wearing spectacles and a brown beard trimmed to a careful point he spoke english with a strong german accent his clothes were worn and darned in places and wrinkled and baggy in others but he looked neat and had very good manners he always bought two loaves of stale bread fresh bread was five cents a loaf stale ones were two for five never did he call for anything but stale bread once miss martha saw a red and brown stain on his fingers she was sure then that he was an artist and very poor no doubt he lived in a garret where he painted pictures and ate stale bread and thought of the good things to eat in miss martha s bakery often when miss martha sat down to her chops and light rolls and jam and tea she would sigh and wish that the gentle mannered artist might share her tasty meal instead of eating his dry crust in that draughty attic miss martha s heart as you have been told was a sympathetic one in order to test her theory as to his occupation she brought from her room one day a painting that she had bought at a sale and set it against the shelves behind the bread counter it was a venetian scene a splendid

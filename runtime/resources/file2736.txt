as ready as ever grandemont told him of his plan and the old chef swayed with pride and delight with a sigh of relief knowing that he need have no further concern until the serving of that dinner was announced he placed in andre s hands a liberal sum for the cost of it giving carte blanche for its creation among the blacks were also a number of the old house servants absalom the former major domo and a half dozen of the younger men once waiters and attaches of the kitchen pantry and other domestic departments crowded around to greet m shi grande absalom guaranteed to marshal of these a corps of assistants that would perform with credit the serving of the dinner after distributing a liberal largesse among the faithful grandemont rode back to town well pleased there were many other smaller details to think of and provide for but eventually the scheme was complete and now there remained only the issuance of the invitations to his guests along the river within the scope of a score of miles dwelt some half dozen families with whose princely hospitality that of the charleses had been contemporaneous they were the proudest and most august of the old regime their small circle had been a brilliant one their social relations close and warm their houses full of rare welcome and discriminating bounty those friends said grandemont should once more if never again sit at charleroi on a nineteenth of january to celebrate the festal day of his house grandemont had his cards of invitation engraved they were expensive but beautiful in one particular their good taste might have been disputed but the creole allowed himself that one feather in the cap of his fugacious splendour might he not be allowed for the one day of the renaissance to be grandemont du puy charles of charleroi he sent the invitations out early in january so that the guests might not fail to receive due notice at eight o clock on the morning of the nineteenth the lower coast steamboat river belle gingerly approached the long unused landing at charleroi the bridge was lowered and a swarm of the plantation hands streamed along the rotting pier bearing ashore a strange assortment of freight great shapeless bundles and bales and packets swathed in cloth and bound with ropes tubs and urns of palms evergreens and tropical flowers tables mirrors chairs couches carpets and pictures all carefully bound and padded against the dangers of transit grandemont was among them the busiest there to the safe conveyance of certain large hampers eloquent with printed cautions to delicate handling he gave his superintendence for they contained the fragile china and glassware the dropping of one of those hampers would have cost him more than he could have saved in a year the last article unloaded the river belle backed off and continued her course down stream in less than an hour everything had been conveyed to the house and came then absalom s task directing the placing of the furniture and wares there was plenty of help for that day was always a holiday at charleroi and the negroes did not suffer the old traditions to lapse almost the entire population of the quarters volunteered their aid a score of piccaninnies were sweeping at the leaves in the yard in the big kitchen at the rear andre was lording it with his old time magnificence over his numerous sub cooks and scullions shutters were flung wide dust spun in clouds the house echoed to voices and the tread of busy feet the prince had come again and charleroi woke from its long sleep the full moon as she rose across the river that night and peeped above the levee saw a sight that had long been missing from her orbit the old plantation house shed a soft and alluring radiance from every window of its two score rooms only four had been refurnished the larger reception chamber the dining hall and two smaller rooms for the convenience of the expected guests but lighted wax candles were set in the windows of every room the dining hall was the chef d oeuvre the long table set with twenty five covers sparkled like a winter landscape with its snowy napery and china and the icy gleam of crystal the chaste beauty of the room had required small adornment the polished floor burned to a glowing ruby with the reflection of candle light the rich wainscoting reached half way to the ceiling along and above this had been set the relieving lightness of a few water colour sketches of fruit and flower the reception chamber was fitted in a simple but elegant style its arrangement suggested nothing of the fact that on the morrow the room would again be cleared and abandoned to the dust and the spider the entrance hall was imposing with palms and ferns and the light of an immense candelabrum at seven o clock grandemont in evening dress with pearls a family passion in his spotless linen emerged from somewhere the invitations had specified eight as the dining hour he drew an armchair upon the porch and sat there smoking cigarettes and half dreaming the moon was an hour high fifty years back from the gate stood the house under its noble grove the road ran in front and then came the grass grown levee and the insatiate river beyond just above the levee top a tiny red light was creeping down and a tiny green one was creeping up then the passing steamers saluted and the hoarse din startled the drowsy silence of the melancholy lowlands the stillness returned save for the little voices of the night the owl s recitative the capriccio of the crickets the concerto of the frogs in the grass the piccaninnies and the dawdlers from the quarters had been dismissed to their confines and the melee of the day was reduced to an orderly and intelligent silence the six coloured waiters in their white jackets paced cat footed about the table pretending to arrange where all was beyond betterment absalom in black and shining pumps posed superior here and there where the lights set off his grandeur and grandemont rested in his chair waiting for his guests he must have drifted into a dream and an extravagant one for he was master of charleroi and adele was his wife she was coming out to him now he could hear her steps he could feel her hand upon his shoulder pardon moi m shi grande it was absalom s hand touching him it was absalom s voice speaking the patois of the blacks but it is eight o clock eight o clock grandemont sprang up in the moonlight he could see the row of hitching posts outside the gate long ago the horses of the guests should have stood there they were vacant a chanted roar of indignation a just waxing bellow of affront and dishonoured genius came from andre s kitchen filling the house with rhythmic protest the beautiful dinner the pearl of a dinner the little excellent superb jewel of a dinner but one moment more of waiting and not even the thousand thunders of black pigs of the quarter would touch it they are a little late said grandemont calmly they will come soon tell andre to hold back dinner and ask him if by some chance a bull from the pastures has broken roaring into the house he seated himself again to his cigarettes though he had said it he scarcely believed charleroi would entertain company that night for the first time in history the invitation of a charles had been ignored so simple in courtesy and honour was grandemont and perhaps so serenely confident in the prestige of his name that the most likely reasons for the vacant board did not occur to him charleroi stood by a road travelled daily by people from those plantations whither his invitations had gone no doubt even on the day before the sudden reanimation of the old house they had driven past and observed the evidences of long desertion and decay they had looked at the corpse of charleroi and then at grandemont s invitations and though the puzzle or tasteless hoax or whatever the thing meant left them perplexed they would not seek its solution by the folly of a visit to that deserted house the moon was now above the grove and the yard was pied with deep shadows save where they lightened in the tender glow of outpouring candle light a crisp breeze from the river hinted at the possibility of frost when the night should have become older the grass at one side of the steps was specked with the white stubs of grandemont s cigarettes the cotton broker s clerk sat in his chair with the smoke spiralling above him i doubt that he once thought of the little fortune he had so impotently squandered perhaps it was compensation enough for him to sit thus at charleroi for a few retrieved hours idly his mind wandered in and out many fanciful paths of memory he smiled to himself as a paraphrased line of scripture strayed into his mind a certain poor man made a feast he heard the sound of absalom coughing a note of summons grandemont stirred this time he had not been asleep only drowsing nine o clock m shi grande said absalom in the uninflected voice of a good servant who states a fact unqualified by personal opinion grandemont rose to his feet in their time all the charleses had been proven and they were gallant losers serve dinner he said calmly and then he checked absalom s movement to obey for something clicked the gate latch and was coming down the walk toward the house something that shuffled its feet and muttered to itself as it came it stopped in the current of light at the foot of the steps and spake in the universal whine of the gadding mendicant kind sir could you spare a poor hungry man out of luck a little to eat and to sleep in the corner of a shed for the thing concluded irrelevantly i can sleep now there are no mountains to dance reels in the night and the copper kettles are all scoured bright the iron band is still round my ankle and a link if it is your desire i should be chained it set a foot upon the step and drew up the rags that hung upon the limb above the distorted shoe caked with the dust of a hundred leagues they saw the link and the iron band the clothes of the tramp were wreaked to piebald tatters by sun and rain and wear a mat of brown tangled hair and beard covered his head and face out of which his eyes stared distractedly grandemont noticed that he carried in one hand a white square card what is that he asked i picked it up sir at the side of the road the vagabond handed the card to grandemont just a little to eat sir a little parched corn a tortilla or a handful of beans goat s meat i cannot eat when i cut their throats they cry like children grandemont held up the card it was one of his own invitations to dinner no doubt some one had cast it away from a passing carriage after comparing it with the tenantless house of charleroi from the hedges and highways bid them come he said to himself softly smiling and then to absalom send louis to me louis once his own body servant came promptly in his white jacket this gentleman said grandemont will dine with me furnish him with bath and clothes in twenty minutes have him ready and dinner served louis approached the disreputable guest with the suavity due to a visitor to charleroi and spirited him away to inner regions promptly in twenty minutes absalom announced dinner and a moment later the guest was ushered into the dining hall where grandemont waited standing at the head of the table the attentions of louis had transformed the stranger into something resembling the polite animal clean linen and an old evening suit that had been sent down from town to clothe a waiter had worked a miracle with his exterior brush and comb had partially subdued the wild disorder of his hair now he might have passed for no more extravagant a thing than one of those poseurs in art and music who affect such oddity of guise the man s countenance and demeanour as he approached the table exhibited nothing of the awkwardness or confusion to be expected from his arabian nights change he allowed absalom to seat him at grandemont s right hand with the manner of one thus accustomed to be waited upon it grieves me said grandemont to be obliged to exchange names with a guest my own name is charles in the mountains said the wayfarer they call me gringo along the roads they call me jack i prefer the latter said grandemont a glass of wine with you mr jack course after course was served by the supernumerous waiters grandemont inspired by the results of andre s exquisite skill in cookery and his own in the selection of wines became the model host talkative witty and genial the guest was fitful in conversation his mind seemed to be sustaining a seccession of waves of dementia followed by intervals of comparative lucidity there was the glassy brightness of recent fever in his eyes a long course of it must have been the cause of his emaciation and weakness his distracted mind and the dull pallor that showed even through the tan of wind and sun charles he said to grandemont for thus he seemed to interpret his name you never saw the mountains dance did you no mr jack answered grandemont gravely the spectacle has been denied me but i assure you i can understand it must be a diverting sight the big ones you know white with snow on the tops waltzing decollete we may say you first scour the kettles said mr jack leaning toward him excitedly to cook the beans in the morning and you lie down on a blanket and keep quite still then they come out and dance for you you would go out and dance with them but you are chained every night to the centre pole of the hut you believe the mountains dance don t you charlie i contradict no traveller s tales said grandemont with a smile mr jack laughed loudly he dropped his voice to a confidential whisper you are a fool to believe it he went on they don t really advance it s the fever in your head it s the hard work and the bad water that does it you are sick for weeks and there is no medicine the fever comes on every evening and then you are as strong as two men one night the compania are lying drunk with mescal they have brought back sacks of silver dollars from a ride and they drink to celebrate in the night you file the chain in two and go down the mountain you walk for miles hundreds of them by and by the mountains are all gone and you come to the prairies they do not dance at night they are merciful and you sleep then you come to the river and it says things to you you follow it down down but you can t find what you are looking for mr jack leaned back in his chair and his eyes slowly closed the food and wine had steeped him in a deep calm the tense strain had been smoothed from his face the languor of repletion was claiming him drowsily he spoke again it s bad manners i know to go to sleep at table but that was such a good dinner grande old fellow grande the owner of the name started and set down his glass how should this wretched tatterdemalion whom he had invited caliph like to sit at his feet know his name not at first but soon little by little the suspicion wild and unreasonable as it was stole into his brain he drew out his watch with hands that almost balked him by their trembling and opened the back case there was a picture there a photograph fixed to the inner side rising grandemont shook mr jack by the shoulder the weary guest opened his eyes grandemont held the watch look at this picture mr jack have you ever my sister adele the vagrant s voice rang loud and sudden through the room he started to his feet but grandemont s arms were about him and grandemont was calling him victor victor fauquier merci merci mon dieu too far overcome by sleep and fatigue was the lost one to talk that night days afterward when the tropic calentura had cooled in his veins the disordered fragments he had spoken were completed in shape and sequence he told the story of his angry flight of toils and calamities on sea and shore of his ebbing and flowing fortune in southern lands and of his latest peril when held a captive he served menially in a stronghold of bandits in the sonora mountains of mexico and of the fever that seized him there and his escape and delirium during which he strayed perhaps led by some marvellous instinct back to the river on whose bank he had been born and of the proud and stubborn thing in his blood that had kept him silent through all those years clouding the honour of one though he knew it not and keeping apart two loving hearts what a thing is love you may say and if i grant it you shall say with me what a thing is pride on a couch in the reception chamber victor lay with a dawning understanding in his heavy eyes and peace in his softened countenance absalom was preparing a lounge for the transient master of charleroi who to morrow would be again the clerk of a cotton broker but also to morrow grandemont was saying as he stood by the couch of his guest speaking the words with his face shining as must have shone the face of elijah s charioteer when he announced the glories of that heavenly journey to morrow i will take you to her on behalf of the management this is the story of the man manager and how he held his own until the very last paragraph i had it from sully magoon viva voce the words are indeed his and if they do not constitute truthful fiction my memory should be taxed with the blame it is not deemed amiss to point out in the beginning the stress that is laid upon the masculinity of the manager for according to sully the term when applied to the feminine division of mankind has precisely an opposite meaning the woman manager he says economizes saves oppresses her household with bargains and contrivances and looks sourly upon any pence that are cast to the fiddler for even a single jig step on life s arid march wherefore her men folk call her blessed and praise her and then sneak out the backdoor to see the gilhooly sisters to a buck and wing dance now the man manager i still quote sully is a caesar without a brutus he is an autocrat without responsibility a player who imperils no stake of his own his office is to enact to reverberate to boom to expand to out coruscate profitably if he can bill paying and growing gray hairs over results belong to his principals it is his to guide the risk to be the apotheosis of front the three tailed bashaw of bluff the essential oil of razzle dazzle we sat at luncheon and sully magoon told me i asked for particulars my old friend denver galloway was a born manager said sully he first saw the light of day in new york at three years of age he was born in pittsburg but his parents moved east the third summer afterward when denver grew up he went into the managing business at the age of eight he managed a news stand for the dago that owned it after that he was manager at different times of a skating rink a livery stable a policy game a restaurant a dancing academy a walking match a burlesque company a dry goods store a dozen hotels and summer resorts an insurance company and a district leader s campaign that campaign when coughlin was elected on the east side gave denver a boost it got him a job as manager of a broadway hotel and for a while he managed senator o grady s campaign in the nineteenth denver was a new yorker all over i think he was out of the city just twice before the time i m going to tell you about once he went rabbit shooting in yonkers the other time i met him just landing from a north river ferry been out west on a big trip sully old boy says he gad sully i had no idea we had such a big country it s immense never conceived of the magnificence of the west before it s gorgeous and glorious and infinite makes the east seemed cramped and little it s a grand thing to travel and get an idea of the extent and resources of our country i d made several little runs out to california and down to mexico and up through alaska so i sits down with denver for a chat about the things he saw took in the yosemite out there of course i asks well no says denver i don t think so at least i don t recollect it you see i only had three days and i didn t get any farther west than youngstown ohio about two years ago i dropped into new york with a little fly paper proposition about a tennessee mica mine that i wanted to spread out in a nice sunny window in the hopes of catching a few i was coming out of a printing shop one afternoon with a batch of fine sticky prospectuses when i ran against denver coming round a corner i never saw him looking so much like a tiger lily he was as beautiful and new as a trellis of sweet peas and as rollicking as a clarinet solo we shook hands and he asked me what i was doing and i gave him the outlines of the scandal i was trying to create in mica pooh pooh for your mica says denver don t you know better sully than to bump up against the coffers of little old new york with anything as transparent as mica now you come with me over to the hotel brunswick you re just the man i was hoping for i ve got something there in sepia and curled hair that i want you to look at you putting up at the brunswick i asks not a cent says denver cheerful the syndicate that owns the hotel puts up i m manager the brunswick wasn t one of them broadway pot houses all full of palms and hyphens and flowers and costumes kind of a mixture of lawns and laundries it was on one of the east side avenues but it was a solid old time caravansary such as the mayor of skaneatelese or the governor of missouri might stop at eight stories high it stalked up with new striped awnings and the electrics had it as light as day i ve been manager here for a year says denver as we drew nigh when i took charge says he nobody nor nothing ever stopped at the brunswick the clock over the clerks desk used to run for weeks without winding a man fell dead with heart disease on the sidewalk in front of it one day and when they went to pick him up he was two blocks away i figured out a scheme to catch the west indies and south american trade i persuaded the owners to invest a few more thousands and i put every cent of it in electric lights cayenne papre gold leaf and garlic i got a spanish speaking force of employees and a string band and there was talk going round of a cockfight in the basement every sunday maybe i didn t catch the nut brown gang from havana to patagonia the don senors knew about the brunswick we get the highfliers from cuba and mexico and the couple of americas farther south and they ve simply got the boodle to bombard every bulfinch in the bush with when we got to the hotel denver stops me at the door there s a little liver coloured man says he sitting in a big leather chair to your right inside you sit down and watch him for a few minutes and then tell me what you think i took a chair while denver circulates around in the big rotunda the room was about full of curly headed cubans and south american brunettes of different shades and the atmosphere was international with cigarette smoke lit up by diamond rings and edged off with a whisper of garlic that denver galloway was sure a relief to the eye six feet two he was red headed and pink gilled as a sun perch and the air he had court of saint james chauncy olcott kentucky colonels count of monte cristo grand opera all these things he reminded you of when he was doing the honours when he raised his finger the hotel porters and bell boys skated across the floor like cockroaches and even the clerk behind the desk looked as meek and unimportant as andy carnegie denver passed around shaking hands with his guests and saying over the two or three spanish words he knew until it was like a coronation rehearsal or a bryan barbecue in texas i watched the little man he told me to twas a little foreign person in a double breasted frock coat trying to touch the floor with his toes he was the colour of vici kid and his whiskers was like excelsior made out of mahogany wood he breathed hard and he never once took his eyes off of denver there was a look of admiration and respect on his face like you see on a boy that s following a champion base ball team or the kaiser william looking at himself in a glass after denver goes his rounds he takes me into his private office what s your report on the dingy i told you to watch he asks well says i if you was as big a man as he takes you to be nine rooms and bath in the hall of fame rent free till october st would be about your size you ve caught the idea says denver i ve given him the wizard grip and the cabalistic eye the glamour that emanates from yours truly has enveloped him like a north river fog he seems to think that senor galloway is the man who i guess they don t raise inch sorrel tops with romping ways down in his precinct now sully goes on denver if you was asked what would you take the little man to be why says i the barber around the corner or if he s royal the king of the boot blacks never judge by looks says denver he s the dark horse candidate for president of a south american republic well says i he didn t look quite that bad to me then denver draws his chair up close and gives out his scheme sully says he with seriousness and levity i ve been a manager of one thing and another for over twenty years that s what i was cut out for to have somebody else to put up the money and look after the repairs and the police and taxes while i run the business i never had a dollar of my own invested in my life i wouldn t know how it felt to have the dealer rake in a coin of mine but i can handle other people s stuff and manage other people s enterprises i ve had an ambition to get hold of something big something higher than hotels and lumber yards and local politics i want to be manager of something way up like a railroad or a diamond trust or an automobile factory now here comes this little man from the tropics with just what i want and he s offered me the job what job i asks is he going to revive the georgia minstrels or open a cigar store he s no coon says denver he s general rompiro general josey alfonso sapolio jew ann rompiro he has his cards printed by a news ticker he s the real thing sully and he wants me to manage his campaign he wants denver c galloway for a president maker think of that sully old denver romping down to the tropics plucking lotus flowers and pineapples with one hand and making presidents with the other won t it make uncle mark hanna mad and i want you to go too sully you can help me more than any man i know i ve been herding that brown man for a month in the hotel so he wouldn t stray down fourteenth street and get roped in by that crowd of refugee tamale eaters down there and he s landed and d c g is manager of general j a s j rompiro s presidential campaign in the great republic of what s its name denver gets down an atlas from a shelf and we have a look at the afflicted country twas a dark blue one on the west coast about the size of a special delivery stamp from what the general tells me says denver and from what i can gather from the encyclopaedia and by conversing with the janitor of the astor library it ll be as easy to handle the vote of that country as it would be for tammany to get a man named geoghan appointed on the white wings force why don t general rumptyro stay at home says i and manage his own canvass you don t understand south american politics says denver getting out the cigars it s this way general rompiro had the misfortune of becoming a popular idol he distinguished himself by leading the army in pursuit of a couple of sailors who had stolen the plaza or the carramba or something belonging to the government the people called him a hero and the government got jealous the president sends for the chief of the department of public edifices find me a nice clean adobe wall says he and send senor rompiro up against it then call out a file of soldiers and then let him be up against it something goes on denver like the way they ve treated hobson and carrie nation in our country so the general had to flee but he was thoughtful enough to bring along his roll he s got sinews of war enough to buy a battleship and float her off in the christening fluid what chance has he got to be president wasn t i just giving you his rating says denver his country is one of the few in south america where the presidents are elected by popular ballot the general can t go there just now it hurts to be shot against a wall he needs a campaign manager to go down and whoop things up for him to get the boys in line and the new two dollar bills afloat and the babies kissed and the machine in running order sully i don t want to brag but you remember how i brought coughlin under the wire for leader of the nineteenth ours was the banner district don t you suppose i know how to manage a little monkey cage of a country like that why with the dough the general s willing to turn loose i could put two more coats of japan varnish on him and have him elected governor of georgia new york has got the finest lot of campaign managers in the world sully and you give me a feeling of hauteur when you cast doubts on my ability to handle the political situation in a country so small that they have to print the names of the towns in the appendix and footnotes i argued with denver some i told him that politics down in that tropical atmosphere was bound to be different from the nineteenth district but i might just as well have been a congressman from north dakota trying to get an appropriation for a lighthouse and a coast survey denver galloway had ambitions in the manager line and what i said didn t amount to as much as a fig leaf at the national dressmakers convention i ll give you three days to cogitate about going says denver and i ll introduce you to general rompiro to morrow so you can get his ideas drawn right from the rosewood i put on my best reception to booker washington manner the next day and tapped the distinguished rubber plant for what he knew general rompiro wasn t so gloomy inside as he appeared on the surface he was polite enough and he exuded a number of sounds that made a fair stagger at arranging themselves into language it was english he aimed at and when his system of syntax reached your mind it wasn t past you to understand it if you took a college professor s magazine essay and a chinese laundryman s explanation of a lost shirt and jumbled em together you d have about what the general handed you out for conversation he told me all about his bleeding country and what they were trying to do for it before the doctor came but he mostly talked of denver c galloway ah senor says he that is the most fine of mans never i have seen one man so magnifico so gr r rand so conformable to make done things so swiftly by other mans he shall make other mans do the acts and himself to order and regulate until we arrive at seeing accomplishments of a suddenly oh yes senor in my countree there is not such mans of so beegness so good talk so compliments so strongness of sense and such ah that senor galloway yes says i old denver is the boy you want he s managed every kind of business here except filibustering and he might as well complete the list before the three days was up i decided to join denver in his campaign denver got three months vacation from his hotel owners for a week we lived in a room with the general and got all the pointers about his country that we could interpret from the noises he made when we got ready to start denver had a pocket full of memorandums and letters from the general to his friends and a list of names and addresses of loyal politicians who would help along the boom of the exiled popular idol besides these liabilities we carried assets to the amount of in assorted united states currency general rompiro looked like a burnt effigy but he was br er fox himself when it came to the real science of politics here is moneys says the general of a small amount there is more with me moocho more plentee moneys shall you be supplied senor galloway more i shall send you at all times that you need i shall desire to pay feefty one hundred thousand pesos if necessario to be elect how no sacramento if that i am president and do not make one meelion dolla in the one year you shall keek me on that side valgame dios denver got a cuban cigar maker to fix up a little cipher code with english and spanish words and gave the general a copy so we could cable him bulletins about the election or for more money and then we were ready to start general rompiro escorted us to the steamer on the pier he hugged denver around the waist and sobbed noble mans says he general rompiro propels you into his confidence and trust go in the hands of the saints to do the work for your friend viva la libertad sure says denver and viva la liberality an la soaperino and hoch der land of the lotus and the vote us don t worry general we ll have you elected as sure as bananas grow upside down make pictures on me pleads the general make pictures on me for money as it is needful does he want to be tattooed would you think asks denver wrinkling up his eyes stupid says i he wants you to draw on him for election expenses it ll be worse than tattooing more like an autopsy me and denver steamed down to panama and then hiked across the isthmus and then by steamer again down to the town of espiritu on the coast of the general s country that was a town to send j howard payne to the growler i ll tell you how you could make one like it take a lot of filipino huts and a couple of hundred brick kilns and arrange em in squares in a cemetery cart down all the conservatory plants in the astor and vanderbilt greenhouses and stick em about wherever there s room turn all the bellevue patients and the barbers convention and the tuskegee school loose in the streets and run the thermometer up to in the shade set a fringe of the rocky mountains around the rear let it rain and set the whole business on rockaway beach in the middle of january and you d have a good imitation of espiritu it took me and denver about a week to get acclimated denver sent out the letters the general had given him and notified the rest of the gang that there was something doing at the captain s office we set up headquarters in an old dobe house on a side street where the grass was waist high the election was only four weeks off but there wasn t any excitement the home candidate for president was named roadrickeys this town of esperitu wasn t the capital any more than cleveland ohio is the capital of the united states but it was the political centre where they cooked up revolutions and made up the slates at the end of the week denver says the machine is started running sully says he we ve got a walkover just because general rompiro ain t don juan on the spot the other crowd ain t at work they re as full of apathy as a territorial delegate during the chaplain s prayer now we want to introduce a little hot stuff in the way of campaigning and we ll surprise em at the polls how are you going to go about it i asks why the usual way says denver surprised we ll get the orators on our side out every night to make speeches in the native lingo and have torch light parades under the shade of the palms and free drinks and buy up all the brass bands of course and well i ll turn the baby kissing over to you sully i ve seen a lot of em what else says i why you know says denver we get the heelers out with the crackly two spots and coal tickets and orders for groceries and have a couple of picnics out under the banyan trees and dances in the firemen s hall and the usual things but first of all sully i m going to have the biggest clam bake down on the beach that was ever seen south of the tropic of capricorn i figured that out from the start we ll stuff the whole town and the jungle folk for miles around with clams that s the first thing on the programme suppose you go out now and make the arrangements for that i want to look over the estimates the general made of the vote in the coast districts i had learned some spanish in mexico so i goes out as denver says and in fifteen minutes i come back to headquarters if there ever was a clam in this country nobody ever saw it i says great sky rockets says denver with his mouth and eyes open no clams how in the who ever saw a country without clams what kind of a how s an election to be pulled off without a clam bake i d like to know are you sure there s no clams sully not even a can says i then for god s sake go out and try to find what the people here do eat we ve got to fill em up with grub of some kind i went out again denver was manager in half an hour i gets back they eat says i tortillas cassava carne de chivo arroz con pollo aquacates zapates yucca and huevos fritos a man that would eat them things says denver getting a little mad ought to have his vote challenged in a few more days the campaign managers from the other towns came sliding into esperitu our headquarters was a busy place we had an interpreter and ice water and drinks and cigars and denver flashed the general s roll so often that it got so small you couldn t have bought a republican vote in ohio with it and then denver cabled to general rompiro for ten thousand dollars more and got it there were a number of americans in esperitu but they were all in business or grafts of some kind and wouldn t take any hand in politics which was sensible enough but they showed me and denver a fine time and fixed us up so we could get decent things to eat and drink there was one american named hicks used to come and loaf at the headquarters hicks had had fourteen years of esperitu he was six feet four and weighed in at cocoa was his line and coast fever and the climate had taken all the life out of him they said he hadn t smiled in eight years his face was three feet long and it never moved except when he opened it to take quinine he used to sit in our headquarters and kill fleas and talk sarcastic i don t take much interest in politics says hicks one day but i d like you to tell

hicks laughing for the first time in eight years sully magoon paused while the waiter poured us a black coffee your friend was indeed something of a manager i said wait a minute said sully i haven t

time he d had down on his orange plantation in florida did you fix things up with the general i asks him did i says denver come and see he takes me by the arm and walks me to the dining room door there was a little chocolate brown fat man in a dress suit with his face shining with joy as he swelled himself and skipped about the floor danged if denver hadn t made general rompiro head waiter of the hotel brunswick is mr galloway still in the managing business i asked as mr magoon ceased sully shook his head denver married an auburn haired widow that owns a big hotel in harlem he just helps around the place whistling dick s christmas stocking it was with much caution that whistling dick slid back the door of the box car for article city ordinances authorized perhaps unconstitutionally arrest on suspicion and he was familiar of old with this ordinance so before climbing out he surveyed the field with all the care of a good general he saw no change since his last visit to this big alms giving long suffering city of the south the cold weather paradise of the tramps the levee where his freight car stood was pimpled with dark bulks of merchandise the breeze reeked with the well remembered sickening smell of the old tarpaulins that covered bales and barrels the dun river slipped along among the shipping with an oily gurgle far down toward chalmette he could see the great bend in the stream outlined by the row of electric lights across the river algiers lay a long irregular blot made darker by the dawn which lightened the sky beyond an industrious tug or two coming for some early sailing ship gave a few appalling toots that seemed to be the signal for breaking day the italian luggers were creeping nearer their landing laden with early vegetables and shellfish a vague roar subterranean in quality from dray wheels and street cars began to make itself heard and felt and the ferryboats the mary anns of water craft stirred sullenly to their menial morning tasks whistling dick s red head popped suddenly back into the car a sight too imposing and magnificent for his gaze had been added to the scene a vast incomparable policeman rounded a pile of rice sacks and stood within twenty yards of the car the daily miracle of the dawn now being performed above algiers received the flattering attention of this specimen of municipal official splendour he gazed with unbiased dignity at the faintly glowing colours until at last he turned to them his broad back as if convinced that legal interference was not needed and the sunrise might proceed unchecked so he turned his face to the rice bags and drawing a flat flask from an inside pocket he placed it to his lips and regarded the firmament whistling dick professional tramp possessed a half friendly acquaintance with this officer they had met several times before on the levee at night for the officer himself a lover of music had been attracted by the exquisite whistling of the shiftless vagabond still he did not care under the present circumstances to renew the acquaintance there is a difference between meeting a policeman on a lonely wharf and whistling a few operatic airs with him and being caught by him crawling out of a freight car so dick waited as even a new orleans policeman must move on some time perhaps it is a retributive law of nature and before long big fritz majestically disappeared between the trains of cars whistling dick waited as long as his judgment advised and then slid swiftly to the ground assuming as far as possible the air of an honest labourer who seeks his daily toil he moved across the network of railway lines with the intention of making his way by quiet girod street to a certain bench in lafayette square where according to appointment he hoped to rejoin a pal known as slick this adventurous pilgrim having preceded him by one day in a cattle car into which a loose slat had enticed him as whistling dick picked his way where night still lingered among the big reeking musty warehouses he gave way to the habit that had won for him his title subdued yet clear with each note as true and liquid as a bobolink s his whistle tinkled about the dim cold mountains of brick like drops of rain falling into a hidden pool he followed an air but it swam mistily into a swirling current of improvisation you could cull out the trill of mountain brooks the staccato of green rushes shivering above chilly lagoons the pipe of sleepy birds rounding a corner the whistler collided with a mountain of blue and brass so observed the mountain calmly you are already pack und dere vill not pe frost before two veeks yet und you haf forgotten how to vistle dere was a valse note in dot last bar watcher know about it said whistling dick with tentative familiarity you wit yer little gherman band nixcumrous chunes watcher know about music pick yer ears and listen agin here s de way i whistled it see he puckered his lips but the big policeman held up his hand shtop he said und learn der right way und learn also dot a rolling shtone can t vistle for a cent big fritz s heavy moustache rounded into a circle and from its depths came a sound deep and mellow as that from a flute he repeated a few bars of the air the tramp had been whistling the rendition was cold but correct and he emphasized the note he had taken exception to dot p is p natural und not p vlat py der vay you petter pe glad i meet you von hour later und i vould half to put you in a gage to vistle mit der chail pirds der orders are to bull all der pums after sunrise to which to

not so bad as der rest und pecause you gan visl der freisechutz bezzer dan i myself gan don t run against any more bolicemans aroundt der corners but go away from town a few tays good pye so madame orleans had at last grown weary of the strange and ruffled brood that came yearly to nestle beneath her charitable pinions after the big policeman had departed whistling dick stood for an irresolute minute feeling all the outraged indignation of a delinquent tenant who is ordered to vacate his premises he had pictured to himself a day of dreamful ease when he should have joined his pal a day of lounging on the wharf munching the bananas and cocoanuts scattered in unloading the fruit steamers and then a feast along the free lunch counters from which the easy going owners were too good natured or too generous to drive him away and afterward a pipe in one of the little flowery parks and a snooze in some shady corner of the wharf but here was a stern order to exile and one that he knew must be obeyed so with a wary eye open from the gleam of brass buttons he began his retreat toward a rural refuge a few days in the country need not necessarily prove disastrous beyond the possibility of a slight nip of frost there was no formidable evil to be looked for however it was with a depressed spirit that whistling dick passed the old french market on his chosen route down the river for safety s sake he still presented to the world his portrayal of the part of the worthy artisan on his way to labour a stall keeper in the market undeceived hailed him by the generic name of his ilk and jack halted taken by surprise the vender melted by this proof of his own acuteness bestowed a foot of frankfurter and half a loaf and thus the problem of breakfast was solved when the streets from topographical reasons began to shun the river bank the exile mounted to the top of the levee and on its well trodden path pursued his way the suburban eye regarded him with cold suspicion individuals reflected the stern spirit of the city s heartless edict he missed the seclusion of the crowded town and the safety he could always find in the multitude at chalmette six miles upon his desultory way there suddenly menaced him a vast and bewildering industry a new port was being established the dock was being built compresses were going up picks and shovels and barrows struck at him like serpents from every side an arrogant foreman bore down upon him estimating his muscles with the eye of a recruiting sergeant brown men and black men all about him were toiling away he fled in terror by noon he had reached the country of the plantations the great sad silent levels bordering the mighty river he overlooked fields of sugar cane so vast that their farthest limits melted into the sky the sugar making season was well advanced and the cutters were at work the waggons creaked drearily after them the negro teamsters inspired the mules to greater speed with mellow and sonorous imprecations dark green groves blurred by the blue of distance showed where the plantation houses stood the tall chimneys of the sugar mills caught the eye miles distant like lighthouses at sea at a certain point whistling dick s unerring nose caught the scent of frying fish like a pointer to a quail he made his way down the levee side straight to the camp of a credulous and ancient fisherman whom he charmed with song and story so that he dined like an admiral and then like a philosopher annihilated the worst three hours of the day by a nap under the trees when he awoke and again continued his hegira a frosty sparkle in the air had succeeded the drowsy warmth of the day and as this portent of a chilly night translated itself to the brain of sir peregrine he lengthened his stride and bethought him of shelter he travelled a road that faithfully followed the convolutions of the levee running along its base but whither he knew not bushes and rank grass crowded it to the wheel ruts and out of this ambuscade the pests of the lowlands swarmed after him humming a keen vicious soprano and as the night grew nearer although colder the whine of the mosquitoes became a greedy petulant snarl that shut out all other sounds to his right against the heavens he saw a green light moving and accompanying it the masts and funnels of a big incoming steamer moving as upon a screen at a magic lantern show and there were mysterious marshes at his left out of which came queer gurgling cries and a choked croaking the whistling vagrant struck up a merry warble to offset these melancholy influences and it is likely that never before since pan himself jigged it on his reeds had such sounds been heard in those depressing solitudes a distant clatter in the rear quickly developed into the swift beat of horses hoofs and whistling dick stepped aside into the dew wet grass to clear the track turning his head he saw approaching a fine team of stylish grays drawing a double surrey a stout man with a white moustache occupied the front seat giving all his attention to the rigid lines in his hands behind him sat a placid middle aged lady and a brilliant looking girl hardly arrived at young ladyhood the lap robe had slipped partly from the knees of the gentleman driving and whistling dick saw two stout canvas bags between his feet bags such as while loafing in cities he had seen warily transferred between express waggons and bank doors the remaining space in the vehicle was filled with parcels of various sizes and shapes as the surrey swept even with the sidetracked tramp the bright eyed girl seized by some merry madcap impulse leaned out toward him with a sweet dazzling smile and cried mer ry christ mas in a shrill plaintive treble such a thing had not often happened to whistling dick and he felt handicapped in devising the correct response but lacking time for reflection he let his instinct decide and snatching off his battered derby he rapidly extended it at arm s length and drew it back with a continuous motion and shouted a loud but ceremonious ah there after the flying surrey the sudden movement of the girl had caused one of the parcels to become unwrapped and something limp

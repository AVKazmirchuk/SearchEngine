pulled a rose out of a bunch in a jar and took the grub basket around to the jail o connor ate like a wolf then he wiped his face with a banana peel and said have you heard nothing from dona isabel yet hist says i slipping the rose between the bars she sends you this she bids you take courage at nightfall two masked men brought it to the ruined chateau in the orange grove how did you like that goat hash barney o connor pressed the rose to his lips this is more to me than all the food in the world says he but the supper was fine where did you raise it i ve negotiated a stand off at a delicatessen but downtown i tells him rest easy if there s anything to be done i ll do it so things went along that way for some weeks izzy was a great cook and if she had had a little more poise of character and smoked a little better brand of tobacco we might have drifted into some sense of responsibility for the honor i had conferred on her but as time went on i began to hunger for the sight of a real lady standing before me in a street car all i was staying in that land of bilk and money for was because i couldn t get away and i thought it no more than decent to stay and see o connor shot one day our old interpreter drops around and after smoking an hour says that the judge of the peace sent him to request me to call on him i went to his office in a lemon grove on a hill at the edge of the town and there i had a surprise i expected to see one of the usual cinnamon colored natives in congress gaiters and one of pizzaro s cast off hats what i saw was an elegant gentleman of a slightly claybank complexion sitting in an upholstered leather chair sipping a highball and reading mrs humphry ward i had smuggled into my brain a few words of spanish by the help of izzy and i began to remark in a rich andalusian brogue buenas dias senor yo tengo yo tengo oh sit down mr bowers says he i spent eight years in your country in colleges and law schools let me mix you a highball lemon peel or not thus we got along in about half an hour i was beginning to tell him about the scandal in our family when aunt elvira ran away with a cumberland presbyterian preacher then he says to me i sent for you mr bowers to let you know that you can have your friend mr o connor now of course we had to make a show of punishing him on account of his attack on general tumbalo it is arranged that he shall be released to morrow night you and he will be conveyed on board the fruit steamer voyager bound for new york which lies in the harbor your passage will be arranged for one moment judge says i that revolution the judge lays back in his chair and howls why says he presently that was all a little joke fixed up by the boys around the court room and one or two of our cut ups and a few clerks in the stores the town is bursting its sides with laughing the boys made themselves up to be conspirators and they what you call it stick senor o connor for his money it is very funny it was says i i saw the joke all along i ll take another highball if your honor don t mind the next evening just at dark a couple of soldiers brought o connor down to the beach where i was waiting under a cocoanut tree hist says i in his ear dona isabel has arranged our escape not a word they rowed us in a boat out to a little steamer that smelled of table d hote salad oil and bone phosphate the great mellow tropical moon was rising as we steamed away o connor leaned on the taffrail or rear balcony of the ship and gazed silently at guaya at buncoville on the beach he had the red rose in his hand she will wait i heard him say eyes like hers never deceive but i shall see her again traitors cannot keep an o connor down forever you talk like a sequel says i but in volume ii please omit the light haired friend who totes the grub to the hero in his dungeon cell and thus reminiscing we came back to new york there was a little silence broken only by the familiar roar of the streets after kansas bill bowers ceased talking did o connor ever go back i asked he attained his heart s desire said bill can you walk two blocks i ll show you he led me eastward and down a flight of stairs that was covered by a curious shaped glowing pagoda like structure signs and figures on the tiled walls and supporting columns attested that we were in the grand central station of the subway hundreds of people were on the midway platform an uptown express dashed up and halted it was crowded there was a rush for it by a still larger crowd towering above every one there a magnificent broad shouldered athletic man leaped into the centre of the struggle men and women he seized in either hand and hurled them like manikins toward the open gates of the train now and then some passenger with a shred of soul and self respect left to him turned to offer remonstrance but the blue uniform on the towering figure the fierce and conquering glare of his eye and the ready impact of his ham like hands glued together the lips

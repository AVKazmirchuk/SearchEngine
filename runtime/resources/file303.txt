the porch while the colonel was thinking up another story it s going to be a fine evening says i he s coming says she he s going to tell you this time the story about the old negro and the green

windows iv coketown droned the porter making his way through the slowing car pescud gathered his hat and baggage with the leisurely promptness of an old traveller i married her a year ago said john i told you i built a house in the east end the belted i mean the colonel is there too i find him waiting at the gate whenever i get back from a trip to hear any new story i might have picked up on the road i glanced out of the window coketown was nothing more than a ragged hillside dotted with a score of black dismal huts propped up against dreary mounds of slag and clinkers it rained in slanting torrents too and the rills foamed and splashed down through the black mud to the railroad tracks you won t sell much plate glass here john said i why do you get off at this end o the world why said pescud the other day i took jessie for a little trip to philadelphia and coming back she thought she saw some petunias in a pot in one of those windows over there just like some she used to raise down in the old virginia home so i thought i d drop off here for the night and see if i could dig up some of the cuttings or blossoms for her here we are good night old man i gave you the address come out and see us when you have time the train moved forward one of the dotted brown ladies insisted on having windows raised now that the rain beat against them the porter came along with his mysterious wand and began to light the car i glanced downward and saw the best seller i picked it up and set it carefully farther along on the floor of the car where the rain drops would not fall upon it and then suddenly i smiled and seemed to see that life has no geographical metes and bounds good luck to you trevelyan i said and may you get the petunias for your princess rus in urbe considering men in relation to money there are three kinds whom i dislike men who have more money than they can spend men who have more money than they do spend and men who spend more money than they have of the three varieties i believe i have the least liking for the first but as a man i liked spencer grenville north pretty well although he had something like two or ten or thirty millions i ve forgotten exactly how many i did not leave town that summer i usually went down to a village on the south shore of long island the place was surrounded by duck farms and the ducks and dogs and whippoorwills and rusty windmills made so much noise that i could sleep as peacefully as if i were in my own flat six doors from the elevated railroad in new york but that summer i did not go remember that one of my friends asked me why i did not i replied because old man new york is the finest summer resort in the world you have heard that phrase before but that is what i told him i was press agent that year for binkly bing the theatrical managers and producers of course you know what a press agent is well he is not that is the secret of being one binkly was touring france in his new c n williamson car and bing had gone to scotland to learn curling which he seemed to associate in his mind with hot tongs rather than with ice before they left they gave me june and july on salary for my vacation which act was in accord with their large spirit of liberality but i remained in new york which i had decided was the finest summer resort in but i said that before on july the th north came to town from his camp in the adirondacks try to imagine a camp with sixteen rooms plumbing eiderdown quilts a butler a garage solid silver plate and a long distance telephone of course it was in the woods if mr pinchot wants to preserve the forests let him give every citizen two or ten or thirty million dollars and the trees will all gather around the summer camps as the birnam woods came to dunsinane and be preserved north came to see me in my three rooms and bath extra charge for light when used extravagantly or all night he slapped me on the back i would rather have my shins kicked any day and greeted me with out door obstreperousness and revolting good spirits he was insolently brown and healthy looking and offensively well dressed just ran down for a few days said he to sign some papers and stuff like that my lawyer wired me to come well you indolent cockney what are you doing in town i took a chance and telephoned and they said you were here what s the matter with that utopia on long island where you used to take your typewriter and your villanous temper every summer anything wrong

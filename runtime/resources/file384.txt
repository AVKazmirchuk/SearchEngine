mounting the levee walked its broad path while they conversed a thunder cloud was hanging imminent above but as yet no rain fell at grandemont s disclosure of his interference in the clandestine romance victor attacked him in a wild and sudden fury grandemont though of slight frame possessed muscles of iron he caught the wrists amid a shower of blows descending upon him bent the lad backward and stretched him upon the levee path in a little while the gust of passion was spent and he was allowed to rise calm now but a powder mine where he had been but a whiff of the tantrums victor extended his hand toward the dwelling house of meade d or you and they he cried have conspired to destroy my happiness none of you shall ever look upon my face again turning he ran swiftly down the levee disappearing in the darkness grandemont followed as well as he could calling to him but in vain for longer than an hour he pursued the search descending the side of the levee he penetrated the rank density of weeds and willows that undergrew the trees until the river s edge shouting victor s name there was never an answer though once he thought he heard a bubbling scream from the dun waters sliding past then the storm broke and he returned to the house drenched and dejected there he explained the boy s absence sufficiently he thought not speaking of the tangle that had led to it for he hoped that victor would return as soon as his anger had cooled afterward when the threat was made good and they saw his face no more he found it difficult to alter his explanations of that night and there clung a certain mystery to the boy s reasons for vanishing as well as to the manner of it it was on that night that grandemont first perceived a new and singular expression in adele s eyes whenever she looked at him and through the years following that expression was always there he could not read it for it was born of a thought she would never otherwise reveal perhaps if he had known that adele had stood at the gate on that unlucky night where she had followed lingering to await the return of her brother and lover wondering why they had chosen so tempestuous an hour and so black a spot to hold converse if he had known that a sudden flash of lightning had revealed to her sight that short sharp struggle as victor was sinking under his hands he might have explained everything and she i know what she would have done but one thing is clear there was something besides her brother s disappearance between grandemont s pleadings for her hand and adele s yes ten years had passed and what she had seen during the space of that lightning flash remained an indelible picture she had loved her brother but was she holding out for the solution of that mystery or for the truth women have been known to reverence it even as an abstract principle it is said there have been a few who in the matter of their affections have considered a life to be a small thing as compared with a lie that i do not know but i wonder had grandemont cast himself at her feet crying that his hand had sent victor to the bottom of that inscrutable river and that he could no longer sully his love with a lie i wonder if i wonder what she would have done but grandemont charles arcadian little gentleman never guessed the meaning of that look in adele s eyes and from this last bootless payment of his devoirs he rode away as rich as ever in honour and love but poor in hope that was in september it was during the first winter month that grandemont conceived his idea of the renaissance since adele would never be his and wealth without her were useless trumpery why need he add to that hoard of slowly harvested dollars why should he even retain that hoard hundreds were the cigarettes he consumed over his claret sitting at the little polished tables in the royal street cafes while thinking over his plan by and by he had it perfect it would cost beyond doubt all the money he had but le jeu vaut la chandelle for some hours he would be once more a charles of charleroi once again should the nineteenth of january that most significant day in the fortunes of the house of charles be fittingly observed on that date the french king had seated a charles by his side at table on that date armand charles marquis de brasse landed like a brilliant meteor in new orleans it was the date of his mother s wedding of grandemont s birth since grandemont could remember until the breaking up of the family that anniversary had been the synonym for feasting hospitality and proud commemoration charleroi was the old family plantation lying some twenty miles down the river years ago the estate had been sold to discharge the debts of its too bountiful owners once again it had changed hands and now the must and mildew of litigation had settled upon it a question of heirship was in the courts and the dwelling house of charleroi unless the tales told of ghostly powdered and laced charleses haunting its unechoing chambers were true stood uninhabited grandemont found the solicitor in chancery who held the keys pending the decision he proved to be an old friend of the family grandemont explained briefly that he desired to rent the house for two or three days he wanted to give a dinner at his old home to a few friends that was all take it for a week a month if you will said the solicitor but do not speak to me

of the new england conscience the terrible thing that medora had done was revealed to her in its full enormity she had sat in the presence of the un godly and looked upon the wine both when it was red and effervescent at midnight she wrote this letter mr berlah hoskins harmony vermont dear sir henceforth consider me as dead to you forever i have loved you too well to blight your career by bringing into it my guilty and sin stained life i have succumbed to the insidious wiles of this wicked world and have been drawn into the vortex of bohemia there is scarcely any depth of glittering iniquity that i have not sounded it is hopeless to combat my decision there is no rising from the depths to which i have sunk endeavor to forget me i am lost forever in the fair but brutal maze of awful bohemia farewell once your medora on the next day medora formed her resolutions beelzebub flung from heaven was no more cast down between her and the apple blossoms of harmony there was a fixed gulf flaming cherubim warded her from the gates of her lost paradise in one evening by the aid of binkley and mumm bohemia had gathered her into its awful midst there remained to her but one thing a life of brilliant but irremediable error vermont was a shrine that she never would dare to approach again but she would not sink there were great and com pelling ones in history upon whom she would model her meteoric career camille lola montez royal mary zaza such a name as one of these would that of medora martin be to future generations for two days medora kept her room on the third she opened a magazine at the portrait of the king of belgium and laughed sardonically if that far famed breaker of women s hearts should cross her path he would have to bow before her cold and im perious beauty she would not spare the old or the young all america all europe should do homage to her sinister but compelling charm as yet she could not bear to think of the life she had once desired a peaceful one in the shadow of the green mountains with beriah at her side and orders for expensive oil paintings coming in by each mail from new york her one fatal misstep had shattered that dream on the fourth day medora powdered her face and rouged her lips once she had seen carter in zaza she stood before the mirror in a reckless attitude and cried zut zut she rhymed it with nut but with the lawless word harmony seemed to pass away forever the vortex had her she belonged to bohemia for evermore and never would beriah the door opened and beriah walked in dory said he what s all that chalk and pink stuff on your face honey medora extended an arm too late she said solemnly the die is cast i belong in another world curse me if you will it is your right go and leave me in the path i have chosen bid them all at home never to men tion my name again and sometimes beriah pray for me when i am revelling in the gaudy but hol low pleasures of bohemia get a towel dory said beriah and wipe that paint off

when you got my let ter oh shucks said beriah did you think you could fool me how could you be run away to that bohemia country like you said when your letter was postmarked new york as plain as day a philistine in bohemia george washington with his right arm upraised sits his iron horse at the lower corner of union square forever signaling the broadway cars to stop as they round the curve into

general raise his left hand as he has raised his right it would point to a quarter of the city that forms a haven for the oppressed and sup pressed of foreign lands in the cause of national or

introduction to the tale which is of plebeians and contains no one with even the ghost of a title katy dempsey s mother kept a furnished room house in this oasis of the aliens the business was not profitable if the two scraped together enough to meet the landlord s agent on rent day and nego tiate for the ingredients of a daily irish stew they called it success often the stew lacked both meat and potatoes sometimes it became as bad as consomme with music in this mouldy old house katy waxed plump and pert and wholesome and as beautiful and freckled as a tiger lily she was the good fairy who was guilty of placing the damp clean towels and cracked pitchers of freshly laundered croton in the lodgers rooms you are informed by virtue of the privileges of astronomical discovery that the star lodger s name was mr brunelli his wearing a yellow tie and pay ing his rent promptly distinguished him from the other lodgers his raiment was splendid his com plexion olive his mustache fierce his manners a prince s his rings and pins as magnificent as those of a traveling dentist he had breakfast served in his room and he ate it in a red dressing gown with green tassels he left the house at noon and returned at midnight those were mysterious hours but there was nothing my terious about mrs dempsey s lodgers except the things that were not mysterious one of mr kip ling s poems is addressed to ye who hold the un written clue to all save all unwritten thing the same readers are invited to tackle the foregoing assertion mr brunelli being impressionable and a latin fell to conjugating the verb amare with katy in the objective case though not because of antipathy she talked it over with her mother sure i like him said katy he s more po liteness than twinty candidates for

continued his calorific wooing katy continued to hesitate one day he asked her out to dine and she felt that a denouement was in the air while they are on their way with katy in her best muslin you must take as an entr acte a brief peep at new york s bohemia tonio s restaurant is in bohemia the very lo cation of it is secret if you wish to know where it is ask the first person you meet he will tell you in a whisper tonio discountenances custom he keeps his house front black and forbidding he gives you a pretty bad dinner he locks his door at the dining hour but he knows spaghetti as the boarding house knows cold veal and he has deposited many dol lars in a certain banco di something with many gold vowels in the name on its windows to this restaurant mr brunelli conducted katy the house was dark and the shades were lowered but mr brunelli touched an electric button by the base ment door and they were admitted along a long dark narrow hallway they went and then through a shining and spotless kitchen that opened directly upon a back yard the walls of houses hemmed three sides of the yard a high board fence surrounded by cats the other a wash of clothes was suspended high upon a line stretched from diagonal corners those were property clothes and were never taken in by tonio they were there that wits with defective pronuncia tion might make puns in connection with the ragout a dozen and a half little tables set upon the bare ground were crowded with bohemia hunters who flocked there because tonio pretended not to want them and pretended to give them a good dinner there was a sprinkling of real bohemians present who came for a change because they were tired of the real bohemia and a smart shower of the men who originate the bright sayings of congressmen and the little nephew of the well known general passen ger agent of the evansville and terre haute rail road company here is a bon mot that was manufactured at tonio s a dinner at tonio s said a bohemian always amounts to twice the price that is asked for it let us assume that an accommodating voice in quires how so the dinner costs you cents you give cents to the waiter and it makes you feel like cents most of the diners were confirmed table d hoters gastronomic adventuress forever seeking the el do rado of a good claret and consistently coming to grief in california mr brunelli escorted katy to a little table em bowered with shrubbery in tubs and asked her to excuse him for a while katy sat enchanted by a scene so brilliant to her the grand ladies in splendid dresses and plumes and sparkling rings the fine gentlemen who laughed so loudly the cries of garsong and we mon seer and hello mame that distinguish bo hemia the lively chatter the cigarette smoke the interchange of bright smiles and eye glances all this display and magnificence overpowered the daugh ter of mrs dempsey and held her motionless mr brunelli stepped into the yard and seemed to spread his smile and bow over the entire company and everywhere there was a great clapping of bands and a few cries of bravo and tonio tonio whatever those words might mean ladies waved their napkins at him gentlemen almost twisted their necks off trying to catch his nod when the ovation was concluded mr brunelli with a final bow stepped nimbly into the kitchen and flung off his coat and waistcoat flaherty the nimblest garsong among the waiters had been assigned to the special service of katy she was a little faint from hunger for the irish stew on the dempsey table had been particu larly weak that day delicious odors from unknown dishes tantalized her and flaherty began to bring to her table course after course of ambrosial food that the gods might have pronounced excellent but even in the midst of her lucullian repast katy laid down her knife and fork her heart sank as lead and a tear fell upon her filet mignon her haunting suspicions of the star lodger arose again fourfold thus courted and admired and smiled upon by that fashionable and gracious assembly what else could mr brunelli be but one of those dazzling titled patricians glorious of name but shy of rent money concerning whom experience had made her wise with a sense of his ineligibility growing within her there was mingled a torturing conviction that his personality was becoming more pleasing to her day by day and why had he left her to dine alone but here he was coming again now coatless his snowy shirt sleeves rolled high above his jeffries onian elbows a white yachting cap perched upon his jetty curls tonio tonio shouted many and the spaghetti the spaghetti shouted the rest never at tonio s did a waiter dare to serve a dish of spaghetti until tonio came to test it to prove the sauce and add the needful dash of seasoning that gave it perfection from table to table moved tonio like a prince in his palace greeting his guests white jewelled bands signalled him from every side a glass of wine with this one and that smiles for all a jest and repartee for any that might challenge truly few princes could be so agreeable a host and what artist could ask for further appreciation of his handiwork katy did not know that the proudest consummation of a new yorker s ambition is to shake bands with a spaghetti chef or to receive a nod from a broadway head waiter at last the company thinned leaving but a few couples and quartettes lingering over new wine and old stories and then came mr brunelli to katy s secluded table and drew a chair close to hers katy smiled at him dreamily she was eating the last spoonful of a raspberry roll with burgundy sauce you have seen said mr brunelli laying one hand upon his collar bone i am antonio brunelli yes i am the great tonio you have not suspect that i loave you katy and you shall marry with me is it not so call me antonio and say that you will be mine katy s head drooped to the shoulder that was now freed from all suspicion of having received the knightly accolade oh andy she sighed this is great sure i ll marry wid ye but why didn t ye tell me ye was the cook i was near turnin ye down for bein one of thim foreign counts from each according to his ability vuyning left his club cursing it softly without any particular anger from ten in the morning un til eleven it had bored him immeasurably kirk with his fish story brooks with his porto rico cigars old morrison with his anecdote about the widow hep burn with his invariable luck at billiards all these afflictions had been repeated without change of bill or scenery besides these morning evils miss allison had refused him again on the night before but that was a chronic trouble five times she had laughed at his offer to make her mrs vuyning he intended to ask her again the next wednesday evening vuyning walked along forty fourth street to broadway and then drifted down the great sluice that washes out the dust of the gold mines of gotham he wore a morning suit of light gray low dull kid shoes a plain finely woven straw hat and his visible linen was the most delicate possible shade of heliotrope his necktie was the blue gray of a november sky and its knot was plainly the outcome of a lordly carelessness combined with an accurate conception of the most recent dictum of fashion now to write of a man s haberdashery is a worse thing than to write a historical novel around paul jones or to pen a testimonial to a hay fever cure therefore let it be known that the description of vuyning s apparel is germane to the movements of the story and not to make room for the new fall stock of goods even broadway that morning was a discord in vuyning s ears and in his eyes it paralleled for a few dreamy dreary minutes a certain howling scorching seething malodorous slice of street that he remembered in morocco he saw the struggling mass of dogs beggars fakirs slave drivers and veiled women in carts without horses the sun blazing brightly among the bazaars the piles of rubbish from ruined temples in the street and then a lady passing jabbed the ferrule of a parasol in his side and brought him back to broadway five minutes of his stroll brought him to a certain corner where a number of silent pale faced men are accustomed to stand immovably for hours busy with the file blades of their penknives with their hat brims on a level with their eyelids wall street speculators driving home in their carriages love to point out these men to their visiting friends and tell them of this rather famous lounging place of the crooks on wall street the speculators never use the file blades of their knives vuyning was delighted when one of this company stepped forth and addressed him as he was passing he was hungry for something out of the ordinary and to be accosted by this smooth faced keen eyed low voiced athletic member of the under world with his grim yet pleasant smile had all the taste of an adventure to the convention weary vuyning excuse me friend said be could i have a few minutes talk with you on the level certainly said vuyning with a smile but suppose we step aside to a quieter place there is a divan a cafe over here that will do schrumm will give us a private corner schrumm established them under a growing palm with two seidls between them vuyning made a pleasant reference to meteorological conditions thus forming a binge upon which might be swung the door leading from the thought repository of the other in the first place said his companion with the air of one who presents his credentials i want you to understand that i am a crook out west i am known as rowdy the dude pickpocket supper man second story man yeggman boxman all round bur glar cardsharp and slickest con man west of the twenty third street ferry landing that s my his tory that s to show i m on the square with you my name s emerson confound old kirk with his fish stories said vuyning to himself with silent glee as he went through his pockets for a card it s pronounced vining he said as he tossed it over to the other and i ll be as frank with you i m just a kind of a loafer i guess living on my daddy s money at the club they call me left at the post i never did a day s work in my life and i haven t the heart to run over a chicken when i m motoring it s a pretty shabby record altogether there s one thing you can do said emerson admiringly you can carry duds i ve watched you several times pass on broadway you look the best dressed man i ve seen and i ll bet you a gold mine i ve got worth more gent s furnishings on my frame than you have that s what i wanted to see you about i can t do the trick take a look at me what s wrong stand up said vuyning emerson arose and slowly revolved you ve been outfitted declared the clubman some broadway window dresser has misused you that s an expensive suit though emerson a hundred dollars said emerson twenty too much said vuyning six months old in cut one inch too long and half an inch to much lapel your hat is plainly dated one year ago although there s only a sixteenth of an inch lacking in the brim to tell the story that english poke in your collar is too short by the distance between troy and london a plain gold link cuff button would take all the shine out of those pearl ones with dia mond settings those tan shoes would be exactly the articles to work into the heart of a brooklyn school ma am on a two weeks visit to lake ronkon koma i think i caught a glimpse of a blue silk sock embroidered with russet lilies of the valley when you improperly drew up your trousers as you sat down there are always plain ones to be had in the stores have i hurt your feelings emer son double the ante cried the criticised one greed ily give me more of it there s a way to tote the haberdashery and i want to get wise to it say you re the right kind of a swell anything else to the queer about me your tie said vuyning is tied with absolute precision and correctness thanks gratefully i spent over half an hour at it before i thereby interrupted vuyning completing your resemblance to a dummy in a broadway store window yours truly said emerson sitting down again it s bully of you to put me wise i knew there was something wrong but i couldn t just put my finger on it i guess it comes by nature to know how to wear clothes oh i suppose said vuyning with a laugh that my ancestors picked up the knack while they were peddling clothes from house to house a couple of hundred years ago i m told they did that and mine said emerson cheerfully were making their visits at night i guess and didn t have a chance to catch on to the correct styles i tell you what said vuyning whose ennui had taken wings i ll take you to my tailor he ll eliminate the mark of the beast from your exterior that is if you care to go any further in the way of expense play em to the ceiling said emerson with a boyish smile of joy i ve got a roll as big around as a barrel of black eyed peas and as loose as the wrapper of a two for fiver i don t mind telling you that i was not touring among the antipodes when the burglar proof safe of the farmers national bank of butterville ia flew open some moonless nights ago to the tune of aren t you afraid asked vuyning that i ll call a cop and hand you over you tell me said emerson coolly why i didn t keep them he laid vuyning s pocketbook and watch the vuyning year old family watch on the table man said vuyning revelling did you ever hear the tale kirk tells about the six pound trout and the old fisherman seems not said emerson politely i d like to but you won t said vuyning i ve heard it scores of times that s why i won t tell you i was just thinking how much better this is than a club now shall we go to my tailor boys and elderly gents said vuyning five days later at his club standing up against the window where his coterie was gathered and keeping out the breeze a friend of mine from the west will dine at our table this evening will he ask if we have heard the latest from denver said a member squirming in his chair will he mention the new twenty three story ma sonic temple in quincy ill inquired another dropping his nose glasses will he spring one of those western mississippi river catfish stories in which they use yearling calves for bait demanded kirk fiercely be comforted said vuyning he has none of the little vices he is a burglar and safe blower and a pal of mine oh mary ann said they must you always adorn every statement with your alleged humor it came to pass that at eight in the evening a calm smooth brilliant affable man sat at vuyning s right hand during dinner and when the ones who pass their lives in city streets spoke of skyscrapers or of the little czar on his far frozen throne or of insig nificant fish from inconsequential streams this big deep chested man faultlessly clothed and eyed like an emperor disposed of their lilliputian chatter with a wink of his eyelash and then he painted for them with hard broad strokes a marvellous lingual panorama of the west he stacked snow topped mountains on the table freezing the hot dishes of the waiting diners with a wave of his hand he swept the clubhouse into a pine crowned gorge turning the waiters into a grim posse and each listener into a blood stained fugitive climbing with torn fingers upon the ensanguined rocks he touched the table and spake and the five panted as they gazed on barren lava beds and each man took his tongue between his teeth and felt his mouth bake at the tale of a land empty of water and food as simply as homer sang while he dug a tine of his fork leisurely into the tablecloth he opened a new world to their view as does one who tells a child of the looking glass country as one of his listeners might have spoken of tea too strong at a madison square afternoon so he depicted the ravages of redeye in a border town when the caballeros of the lariat and forty five reduced ennui to a minimum and then with a sweep of his white unringed hands be dismissed melpomene and forthwith diana and amaryllis footed it before the mind s eyes of the clubmen the savannas of the continent spread before them the wind humming through a hundred leagues of sage brush and mesquite closed their ears to the city s staccato noises he told them of camps of ranches marooned in a sea of fragrant prairie blos soms of gallops in the stilly night that apollo would have forsaken his daytime steeds to enjoy he read them the great rough epic of the cattle and the hills that have not been spoiled by the band of man the mason his words were a telescope to the city men whose eyes had looked upon youngstown o and whose tongues had called it west in fact emerson had them going the next morning at ten he met vuyning by ap pointment at a forty second street cafe emerson was to leave for the west that day he wore a suit of dark cheviot that looked to have been draped upon him by an ancient grecian tailor who was a few thousand years ahead of the styles mr vuyning said he with the clear ingenuous smile of the successful crook it s up to me to go the limit for you any time i can do so you re the real thing and if i can ever return the favor you bet your life i ll do it what was that cow puncher s name asked vuyning who used to catch a mustang by the nose and mane and throw him till he put the bridle on bates said emerson thanks said vuyning i thought it was yates oh about that toggery business i d for gotten that i ve been looking for some guy to put me on the right track for years said emerson you re the goods duty free and half way to the warehouse in a red wagon bacon toasted on a green willow switch over red coals ought to put broiled lobsters out of business said vuyning and you say a horse at the end of a thirty foot rope can t pull a ten inch stake out of wet prairie well good bye old man if you must be off at one o clock vuyning had luncheon with miss allison by previous arrangement for thirty minutes be babbled to her unaccount ably of ranches horses cations cyclones round ups rocky mountains and beans and bacon she looked at him with wondering and half terrified eyes i was going to propose again to day said vuy ning cheerily but i won t i ve worried you often enough you know dad has a ranch in colorado what s the good of staying here jumping jon quils but it s great out there i m going to start next tuesday no you won t said miss allison what said vuyning not alone said miss allison dropping a tear upon her salad what do you think betty exclaimed vuyning what do you mean i ll go too said miss allison forcibly vuyning filled her glass with apollinaris here s to rowdy the dude he gave a toast mysterious don t know him said miss allison but if he s your friend jimmy here goes the memento miss lynnette d armande turned her back on broadway this was but tit for tat be cause broadway had often done the same thing to miss d armande still the tats seemed to have it for the ex leading lady of the reaping the whirlwind company had everything to ask of broadway while there was no vice versa so miss lynnette d armande turned the back of her chair to her window that overlooked broadway and sat down to stitch in time the lisle thread heel of a black silk stocking the tumult and glitter of the roaring broadway beneath her window had no charm for her what she greatly desired was the stifling air of a dressing room on that fairyland street and the roar of an audience gathered in that capricious quarter in the meantime those stock ings must not be neglected silk does wear out so but after all isn t it just the only goods there is the hotel thalia looks on broadway as marathon looks on the sea it stands like a gloomy cliff above the whirlpool where the tides of two great thorough fares clash here the player bands gather at the end of their wanderings to loosen the buskin and dust the sock thick in the streets around it are booking offices theatres agents schools and the lobster pal aces to which those thorny paths lead wandering through the eccentric halls of the dim and fusty thalia you seem to have found yourself in some great ark or caravan about to sail or fly or roll away on wheels about the house lingers a sense of unrest of expectation of transientness even of anxiety and apprehension the halls are a labyrinth without a guide you wander like a lost soul in a sam loyd puzzle turning any corner a dressing sack or a cul de sac may bring you up short you meet alarming tragedians stalking in bath robes in search of ru mored bathrooms from hundreds of rooms come the buzz of talk scraps of new and old songs and the ready laughter of the convened players summer has come their companies have disbanded and they take their rest in their favorite caravansary while they besiege the managers for engagements for the coming season at this hour of the afternoon the day s work of tramping the rounds of the agents offices is over past you as you ramble distractedly through the mossy halls flit audible visions of houris with veiled starry eyes flying tag ends of things and a swish of silk bequeathing to the dull hallways an odor of gaiety and a memory of frangipanni serious young comedians with versatile adam s apples gather in doorways and talk of booth far reaching from somewhere comes the smell of ham and red cabbage and the crash of dishes on the american plan the indeterminate hum of life in the thalia is enlivened by the discreet popping at reasonable and salubrious intervals of beer bottle corks thus punctuated life in the genial hostel scans easily the comma being the favorite mark semicolons frowned upon and periods barred miss d armannde s room was a small one there was room for her rocker between the dresser and the wash stand if it were placed longitudinally on the dresser were its usual accoutrements plus the ex lead ing lady s collected souvenirs of road engagements and photographs of her dearest and best professional friends at one of these photographs she looked twice or thrice as she darned and smiled friendlily i d like to know where lee is just this minute she said half aloud if you had been privileged to view the photograph thus flattered you would have thought at the first glance that you saw the picture of a many petalled white flower blown through the air by a storm but the floral kingdom was not responsible for that swirl of petalous whiteness you saw the filmy brief skirt of miss rosalie ray as she made a complete heels over head turn in her wistaria entwined swing far out from the stage high above the heads of the audience you saw the cam era s inadequate representation of the graceful strong kick with which she at this exciting moment sent flying high and far the yellow silk garter that each evening spun from her agile limb and descended upon the delighted audience below you saw too amid the black clothed mainly mas culine patrons of select vaudeville a hundred hands raised with the hope of staying the flight of the bril liant aerial token forty weeks of the best circuits this act had brought miss rosalie ray for each of two years she did other things during her twelve minutes a song and dance imitations of two or three actors who are but imitations of themselves and a balancing feat with a step ladder and feather duster but when the blossom decked swing was let down from the flies and miss rosalie sprang smiling into the seat with the golden circlet conspicuous in the place whence it was soon to slide and become a soaring and coveted guerdon then it was that the audience rose in its seat as a single man or presumably so and in dorsed the specialty that made miss ray s name a favorite in the booking offices at the end of the two years miss ray suddenly an nounced to her dear friend miss d armande that she was going to spend the summer at an antediluvian village on the north shore of long island and that the stage would see her no more seventeen minutes after miss lynnette d armande had expressed her wish to know the whereabouts of her old chum there were sharp raps at her door doubt not that it was rosalie ray at the shrill command to enter she did so with something of a tired flutter and dropped a heavy hand bag on the floor upon my word it was rosalie in a loose travel stained automobileless coat closely tied brown veil with yard long flying ends gray walking suit and tan oxfords with lavender overgaiters when she threw off her veil and hat you saw a pretty enough face now flushed and disturbed by some unusual emotion and restless large eyes with discontent marring their brightness a heavy pile of dull auburn hair hastily put up was escaping in crinkly waving strands and curling small locks from the confining combs and pins the meeting of the two was not marked by the effusion vocal gymnastical osculatory and catecheti cal that distinguishes the greetings of their unpro fessional sisters in society there was a brief clinch two simultaneous labial dabs and they stood on the same footing of the old days very much like the short salutations of soldiers or of travellers in for eign wilds are the welcomes between the strollers at the corners of their crisscross roads i ve got the hall room two flights up above yours said rosalie but i came straight to see you before going up i didn t know you were here till they told me i ve been in since the last of april said lyn nette and i m going on the road with a fatal inheritance company we open next week in eliz abeth i thought you d quit the stage lee tell me about yourself rosalie settled herself with a skilful wriggle on the top of miss d armande s wardrobe trunk and leaned her head against the papered wall from long habit thus can peripatetic leading ladies and their sisters make themselves as comfort able as though the deepest armchairs embraced them i m going to tell you lynn she said with a strangely sardonic and yet carelessly resigned look on her youthful face and then to morrow i ll strike the old broadway trail again and wear some more paint off the chairs in the agents offices if anybody had told me any time in the last three months up to four o clock this afternoon that i d ever listen to that leave your name and address rot of the booking bunch again i d have given em the real mrs fiske laugh loan me a handkerchief lynn gee but those long island trains are fierce i ve got enough soft coal cinders on my face to go on and play topsy without using the cork and speaking of corks got anything to drink lynn miss d armande opened a door of the wash stand and took out a bottle there s nearly a pint of manhattan there s a cluster of carnations in the drinking glass but oh pass the bottle save the glass for com pany thanks that hits the spot the same to you my first drink in three months yes lynn i quit the stage at the end of last season i quit it because i was sick of the life and especially because my heart and soul were sick of men of the kind of men we stage people have to be up against you know what the game is to us it s a fight against em all the way down the line from the manager who wants us to try his new motor car to the bill posters who want to call us by our front names and the men we have to meet after the show are the worst of all the stage door kind and the man ager s friends who take us to supper and show their diamonds and talk about seeing dan and dave and charlie for us they re beasts and i hate em i tell you lynn it s the girls like us on the stage that ought to be pitied it s girls from good homes that are honestly ambitious and work hard to rise in the profession but never do get there you bear a lot of sympathy sloshed around on chorus girls and their fifteen dollars a week piffle there ain t a sorrow in the chorus that a lobster cannot heal if there s any tears to shed let em fall for the actress that gets a salary of from thirty to forty five dollars a week for taking a leading part in a bum show she knows she ll never do any better but she hangs on for years hoping for the chance i that never comes and the fool plays we have to work in having another girl roll you around the stage by the hind legs in a wheelbarrow chorus in a musical comedy is dignified drama compared with the idiotic things i ve had to do in the thirty centers but what i hated most was the men the men leering and blathering at you across tables trying to buy you with wurzburger or extra dry accord ing to their estimate of your price and the men in the audiences clapping yelling snarling crowding writhing gloating like a lot of wild beasts with their eyes fixed on you ready to eat you up if you come in reach of their claws oh how i hate em well i m not telling you much about myself am i lynn i had two hundred dollars saved up and i cut the stage the first of the summer i went over on long island and found the sweetest little village that ever was called soundport right on the water i was going to spend the summer there and study up on elocution and try to get a class in the fall there was an old widow lady with a cottage near the beach who sometimes rented a room or two just for com pany and she took me in she had another boarder too the reverend arthur lyle yes he was the head liner you re on lynn i ll tell you all of it in a minute it s only a one act play the first time he walked on lynn i felt myself going the first lines he spoke he had me he was different from the men in audiences he was tall and slim and you never heard him come in the room but you felt him he had a face like a picture of a knight like one of that round table bunch and a voice like a cello solo and his manners lynn if you d take john drew in his best draw ing room scene and compare the two you d have john arrested for disturbing the peace i ll spare you the particulars but in less than a month arthur and i were engaged he preached at a little one night stand of a methodist church there was to be a parsonage the size of a lunch wagon and hens and honeysuckles when we were married ar thur used to preach to me a good deal about heaven but be never could get my mind quite off those honey suckles and hens no i didn t tell him i d been on the stage i hated the business and all that went with it i d cut it out forever and i didn t see any use of stirring things up i was a good girl and i didn t have any thing to confess except being an elocutionist and that was about all the strain my conscience would stand oh i tell you lynn i was happy i sang in the choir and attended the sewing society and re cited that annie laurie thing with the whistling stunt in it in a manner bordering upon the profes sional as the weekly village paper reported it and arthur and i went rowing and walking in the woods and clamming and that poky little village seemed to me the best place in the world i d have been happy to live there always too if but one morning old mrs gurley the widow lady got gossipy while i was helping her string beans on the back porch and began to gush information as folks who rent out their rooms usually do mr lyle was her idea of a saint on earth as he was mine too she went over all his virtues and graces and wound up by telling me that arthur had had an exremely romantic love affair not long before that had ended unhappily she didn t seem to be on to the details but she knew that he had been hit pretty hard he was paler and thinner she said and he had some kind of a remembrance or keepsake of the lady in a little rosewood box that he kept locked in his desk drawer in his study several times says she i ve seen him gloomerin over that box of evenings and he always locks it up right away if anybody comes into the room well you can imagine how long it was before i got arthur by the wrist and led him down stage and hissed in his ear that same afternoon we were lazying around in a boat among the water lilies at the edge of the bay arthur says i you never told me you d had another love affair but mrs gurley did i went on to let him know i knew i hate to bear a man lie before you came says he looking me frankly in the eye there was a previous affection a strong one since you know of it i will be perfectly candid with you i am waiting says i my dear ida says arthur of course i went by my real name while i was in soundport this former affection was a spiritual one in fact al though the lady aroused my deepest sentiments and was as i thought my ideal woman i never met her and never spoke to her it was an ideal love my love for you while no less ideal is different you wouldn t let that come between us was she pretty i asked she was very beautiful said arthur did you see her often i asked something like a dozen times says he always from a distance says i always from quite a distance says he and you loved her i asked she seemed my ideal of beauty and grace and soul says arthur and this keepsake that you keep under lock and key and moon over at times is that a remembrance from her a memento says arthur that i have treasured did she send it to you it came to me from her says be in a roundabout way i asked somewhat roundabout says he and yet rather direct why didn t you ever meet her i asked were your positions in life so different she was far above me says arthur now ida he goes on this is all of the past you re not going to be jealous are you jealous says i why man what are you talking about it makes me think ten times as much of you as i did before i knew about it and it did lynn if you can understand it that ideal love was a new one on me but it struck me as being the most beautiful and glorious thing i d ever heard of think of a man loving a woman he d never even spoken to and being faithful just to what his mind and heart pictured her oh it sounded great to me the men i d always known come at you with either diamonds knock out drops or a raise of salary and their ideals well we ll say no more yes it made me think more of arthur than i did before i couldn t be jealous of that far away divin ity that he used to worship for i was going to have him myself and i began to look upon him as a saint on earth just as old lady gurley did about four o clock this afternoon a man came to the house for arthur to go and see somebody that was sick among his church bunch old lady gurley was taking her afternoon snore on a couch so that left me pretty much alone in passing by arthur s study i looked in and saw his bunch of keys hanging in the drawer of his desk where he d forgotten em well i guess we re all to the mrs bluebeard now and then ain t we lynn i made up my mind i d have a look at that memento he kept so secret not that i cared what it was it was just curiosity while i was opening the drawer i imagined one or two things it might be i thought it might be a dried rosebud she d dropped down to him from a balcony or maybe a picture of her he d cut out of a magazine she being so high up in the world i opened the drawer and there was the rosewood casket about the size of a gent s collar box i found the little key in the bunch that fitted it and unlocked it and raised the lid i took one look at that memento and then i went to my room and packed my trunk i threw a few things into my grip gave my hair a flirt or two with a side comb put on my hat and went in and gave the old lady s foot a kick i d tried awfully hard to use proper and correct language while i was there for arthur s sake and i had the habit down pat but it left me then stop sawing gourds says i and sit up and take notice the ghost s about to walk i m going away from here and i owe you eight dollars the expressman will call for my trunk i handed her the money dear me miss crosby says she is any thing wrong i thought you were pleased here dear me young women are so hard to understand and so different from what you expect em to be you re damn right says i some of em are but you can t say that about men when you know one man you know em all that settles the human race question and then i caught the four thirty eight soft coal unlimited and here i am you didn t tell me what was in the box lee said miss d armande anxiously one of those yellow silk garters that i used to kick off my leg into the audience during that old vaudeville swing act of mine is there any of the cocktail left lynn waifs and strays the red roses of tonia a trestle burned down on the international railroad the south bound from san antonio was cut off for the next forty eight hours on that train was tonia weaver s easter hat espirition the mexican who had been sent forty miles in a buckboard from the espinosa ranch to fetch it returned with a shrugging shoulder and hands empty except for a cigarette at the small station nopal he had learned of the delayed train and having no commands to wait turned his ponies toward the ranch again now if one supposes that easter the goddess of spring cares any more for the after church parade on fifth avenue than she does for her loyal outfit of subjects that assemble at the meeting house at cactus tex a mistake has been made the wives and daughters of the ranchmen of the frio country put forth easter blossoms of new hats and gowns as faithfully as is done anywhere and the southwest is for one day a mingling of prickly pear paris and paradise and now it was good friday and tonia weaver s easter hat blushed unseen in the desert air of an impotent express car beyond the burned trestle on saturday noon the rogers girls from the shoestring ranch and ella reeves from the anchor o and mrs bennet and ida from green valley would convene at the espinosa and pick up tonia with their easter hats and frocks carefully wrapped and bundled against the dust the fair aggregation would then merrily jog the ten miles to cactus where on the morrow they would array themselves subjugate man do homage to easter and cause jealous agitation among the lilies of the field tonia sat on the steps of the espinosa ranch house flicking gloomily with a quirt at a tuft of curly mesquite she displayed a frown and a contumelious lip and endeavored to radiate an aura of disagreeableness and tragedy i hate railroads she announced positively and men men pretend to run them can you give any excuse why a trestle should burn ida bennet s hat is to be trimmed with violets i shall not go one step toward cactus without a new hat if i were a man i would get one two men listened uneasily to this disparagement of their kind one was wells pearson foreman of the mucho calor cattle ranch the other was thompson burrows the prosperous sheepman from the quintana valley both thought tonia weaver adorable especially when she railed at railroads and menaced men either would have given up his epidermis to make for her an easter hat more cheerfully than the ostrich gives up his tip or the aigrette lays down its life neither possessed the ingenuity to conceive a means of supplying the sad deficiency against the coming sabbath pearson s deep brown face and sunburned light hair gave him the appearance of a schoolboy seized by one of youth s profound and insolvable melancholies tonia s plight grieved him through and through thompson burrows was the more skilled and pliable he hailed from somewhere in the east originally and he wore neckties and shoes and was made dumb by woman s presence the big water hole on sandy creek said pearson scarcely hoping to make a hit was filled up by that last rain oh was it said tonia sharply thank you for the information i suppose a new hat is nothing to you mr pearson i suppose you think a woman ought to wear an old stetson five years without a change as you do if your old water hole could have put out the fire on that trestle you might have some reason to talk about it i am deeply sorry said burrows warned by pearson s fate that you failed to receive your hat miss weaver deeply sorry indeed if there was anything i could do don t bother interrupted tonia with sweet sarcasm if there was anything you could do you d be doing it of course there isn t tonia paused a sudden sparkle of hope had come into her eye her frown smoothed away she had an inspiration there s a store over at lone elm crossing on the nueces she said that keeps hats eva rogers got hers there she said it was the latest style it might have some left but it s twenty eight miles to lone elm the spurs of two men who hastily arose jingled and tonia almost smiled the knights then were not all turned to dust nor were their rowels rust of course said tonia looking thoughtfully at a white gulf cloud sailing across the cerulean dome nobody could ride to lone elm and back by the time the girls call by for me to morrow so i reckon i ll have to stay at home this easter sunday and then she smiled well miss tonia said pearson reaching for his hat as guileful as a sleeping babe i reckon i ll be trotting along back to mucho calor there s some cutting out to be done on dry branch first thing in the morning and me and road runner has got to be on hand it s too bad your hat got sidetracked maybe they ll get that trestle mended yet in time for easter i must be riding too miss tonia announced burrows looking at his watch i declare it s nearly five o clock i must be out at my lambing camp in time to help pen those crazy ewes tonia s suitors seemed to have been smitten with a need for haste they bade her a ceremonious farewell and then shook each other s hands with the elaborate and solemn courtesy of the southwesterner hope i ll see you again soon mr pearson said burrows same here said the cowman with the serious face of one whose friend goes upon a whaling voyage be gratified to see you ride over to mucho calor any time you strike that section of the range pearson mounted road runner the soundest cow pony on the frio and let him pitch for a minute as he always did on being mounted even at the end of a day s travel what kind of a hat was that miss tonia he called that you ordered from san antone i can t help but be sorry about that hat a straw said tonia the latest shape of course trimmed with red roses that s what i like red roses there s no color more becoming to your complexion and hair said burrows admiringly it s what i like said tonia and of all the flowers give me red roses keep all the pinks and blues for yourself but what s the use when trestles burn and leave you without anything it ll be a dry old easter for me pearson took off his hat and drove road bunner at a gallop into the chaparral east of the espinosa ranch house as his stirrups rattled against the brush burrows s long legged sorrel struck out down the narrow stretch of open prairie to the southwest tonia hung up her quirt and went into the sitting room i m mighty sorry daughter that you didn t get your hat said her mother oh don t worry mother said tonia coolly i ll have a new hat all right in time to morrow when burrows reached the end of the strip of prairie he pulled his sorrel to the right and let him pick his way daintily across a sacuista flat through which ran the ragged dry bed of an arroyo then up a gravelly hill matted with bush the hoarse scrambled and at length emerged with a snort of satisfaction

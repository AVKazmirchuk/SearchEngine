a spring waggon team and driver half a dozen lengthy bamboo fishing poles projected from the waggon s rear you re here bob said judge archinard mr robert s old friend and schoolmate it s going to be a royal day for fishing i thought you said why didn t you bring along the stuff the president of the weymouth bank took off his hat and rumpled his gray locks well ben to tell you the truth there s an infernally presumptuous old nigger belonging in my family that broke up the arrangement he came down to the depot and vetoed the whole proceeding he means all right and well i reckon he is right somehow he had found out what i had along though i hid it in the bank vault and sneaked it out at midnight i reckon he has noticed that i ve been indulging a little more than a gentleman should and he laid for me with some reaching arguments i m going to quit drinking mr robert concluded i ve come to the conclusion that a man can t keep it up and be quite what he d like to be pure and fearless and without reproach that s the way old bushrod quoted it well i ll have to admit said the judge thoughtfully as they climbed into the waggon that the old darkey s argument can t conscientiously be overruled still said mr robert with a ghost of a sigh there was two quarts of the finest old silk velvet bourbon in that satchel you ever wet your lips with the discounters of money the spectacle of the money caliphs of the present day going about bagdad on the subway trying to relieve the wants of the people is enough to make the great al raschid turn haroun in his grave if not so then the assertion should do so the real caliph having been a wit and a scholar and therefore a hater of puns how properly to alleviate the troubles of the poor is one of the greatest troubles of the rich but one thing agreed upon by all professional philanthropists is that you must never hand over any cash to your subject the poor are notoriously temperamental and when they get money they exhibit a strong tendency to spend it for stuffed olives and enlarged crayon portraits instead of giving it to the instalment man and still old haroun had some advantages as an eleemosynarian he took around with him on his rambles his vizier giafar a vizier is a composite of a chauffeur a secretary of state and a night and day bank and old uncle mesrour his executioner who toted a snickersnee with this entourage a caliphing tour could hardly fail to be successful have you noticed lately any newspaper articles headed what shall we do with our ex presidents well now suppose that mr carnegie could engage him and joe gans to go about assisting in the distribution of free libraries do you suppose any town would have had the hardihood to refuse one that caliphalous combination would cause two libraries to grow where there had been only one set of e p roe s works before but as i said the money caliphs are handicapped they have the idea that earth has no sorrow that dough cannot heal and they rely upon it solely al raschid administered justice rewarding the deserving and punished whomsoever he disliked on the spot he was the originator of the short story contest whenever he succoured any chance pick up in the bazaars he always made the succouree tell the sad story of his life if the narrative lacked construction style and esprit he commanded his vizier to dole him out a couple of thousand ten dollar notes of the first national bank of the bosphorus or else gave him a soft job as keeper of the bird seed for the bulbuls in the imperial gardens if the story was a cracker jack he had mesrour the executioner whack of his head the report that haroun al raschid is yet alive and is editing the magazine that your grandmother used to subscribe for lacks confirmation and now follows the story of the millionaire the inefficacious increment and the babes drawn from the wood young howard pilkins the millionaire got his money ornithologically he was a shrewd judge of storks and got in on the ground floor at the residence of his immediate ancestors the pilkins brewing company for his mother was a partner in the business finally old man pilkins died from a torpid liver and then mrs pilkins died from worry on account of torpid delivery waggons and there you have young howard pilkins with and a good fellow at that he was an agreeable modestly arrogant young man who implicitly believed that money could buy anything that the world had to offer and bagdad on the subway for a long time did everything possible to encourage his belief but the rat trap caught him at last he heard the spring snap and found his heart in a wire cage regarding a piece of cheese whose other name was alice von der ruysling the von der ruyslings still live in that little square about which so much has been said and in which so little has been done to day you hear of mr tilden s underground passage and you hear mr gould s elevated passage and that about ends the noise in the world made by gramercy square but once it was different the von der ruyslings live there yet and they received the first key ever made to gramercy park you shall have no description of alice v d r just call up in your mind the picture of your own maggie or vera or beatrice straighten her nose soften her voice tone her down and then tone her up make her beautiful and unattainable and you have

ogres while they devour cattle and sheep growling fiercely as they stamp white limestone dust from their great shoes for you to sweep and scour with your weak aching fingers and then to have grimm taken away from you lena raised the lid of an old empty case that had once contained canned corn and got out a sheet of paper and a piece of pencil she was going to write a letter to her mamma tommy ryan was going to post it for her at ballinger s tommy was seventeen worked in the quarries went home to ballinger s every night and was now waiting in the shadows under lena s window for her to throw the letter out to him that was the only way she could send a letter to fredericksburg mrs maloney did not like for her to write letters the stump of the candle was burning low so lena hastily bit the wood from around the lead of her pencil and began this is the letter she wrote dearest mamma i want so much to see you and gretel and claus and heinrich and little adolf i am so tired i want to see you to day i was slapped by mrs maloney and had no supper i could not bring in enough wood for my hand hurt she took my book yesterday i mean grimm s fairy tales which uncle leo gave me it did not hurt any one for me to read the book i try to work as well as i can but there is so much to do i read only a little bit every night dear mamma i shall tell you what i am going to do unless you send for me to morrow to bring me home i shall go to a deep place i know in the river and drown it is wicked to drown i suppose but i wanted to see you and there is no one else i am very tired and tommy is waiting for the letter you will excuse me mamma if i do it your respectful and loving daughter lena tommy was still waiting faithfully when the letter was concluded and when lena dropped it out she saw him pick it up and start up the steep hillside without undressing she blew out the candle and curled herself upon the mattress on the floor at o clock old man ballinger came out of his house in his stocking feet and leaned over the gate smoking his pipe he looked down the big road white in the moonshine and rubbed one ankle with the toe of his other foot it was time for the fredericksburg mail to come pattering up the road old man ballinger had waited only a few minutes when he heard the lively hoofbeats of fritz s team of little black mules and very soon afterward his covered spring wagon stood in front of the gate fritz s big spectacles flashed in the moonlight and his tremendous voice shouted a greeting to the postmaster of ballinger s the mail carrier jumped out and took the bridles from the mules for he always fed them oats at ballinger s while the mules were eating from their feed bags old man ballinger brought out the mail sack and threw it into the wagon fritz bergmann was a man of three sentiments or to be more accurate four the pair of mules deserving to be reckoned individually those mules were the chief interest and joy of his existence next came the emperor of germany and lena hildesmuller tell me said fritz when he was ready to start contains the sack a letter to frau hildesmuller from the little lena at the quarries one came in the last mail to say that she is a little sick already her mamma is very anxious to hear again yes said old man ballinger thar s a letter for mrs helterskelter or some sich name tommy ryan brung it over when he come her little gal workin over thar you say in the hotel shouted fritz as he gathered up the lines eleven years old and not bigger as a frankfurter the close fist of a peter hildesmuller some day i shall with a big club pound that man s dummkopf all in and out the town perhaps in this letter lena will say that she is yet feeling better so her mamma will be glad auf wiedersehen herr ballinger your feets will take cold out in the night air so long fritzy said old man ballinger you got a nice cool night for your drive up the road went the little black mules at their steady trot while fritz thundered at them occasional words of endearment and cheer these fancies occupied the mind of the mail carrier until he reached the big post oak forest eight miles from ballinger s here his ruminations were scattered by the sudden flash and report of pistols and a whooping as if from a whole tribe of indians a band of galloping centaurs closed in around the mail wagon one of them leaned over the front wheel covered the driver with his revolver and ordered him to stop others caught at the bridles of donder and blitzen donnerwetter shouted fritz with all his tremendous voice wass ist release your hands from dose mules ve vas der united states mail hurry up dutch drawled a melancholy voice don t you know when you re in a stick up reverse your mules and climb out of the cart it is due to the breadth of hondo bill s demerit and the largeness of his achievements to state that the holding up of the fredericksburg mail was not perpetrated by way of an exploit as the lion while in the pursuit of prey commensurate to his prowess might set a frivolous foot upon a casual rabbit in his path so hondo bill and his gang had swooped sportively upon the pacific transport of meinherr fritz the real work of their sinister night ride was over fritz and his mail bag and his mules came as gentle relaxation grateful after the arduous duties of their profession twenty miles to the southeast stood a train with a killed engine hysterical passengers and a looted express and mail car that represented the serious occupation of hondo bill and his gang with a fairly rich prize of currency and silver the robbers were making a wide detour to the west through the less populous country intending to seek safety in mexico by means of some fordable spot on the rio grande the booty from the train had melted the desperate bushrangers to jovial and happy skylarkers trembling with outraged dignity and no little personal apprehension fritz climbed out to the road after replacing his suddenly removed spectacles the band had dismounted and were singing capering and whooping thus expressing their satisfied delight in the life of a jolly outlaw rattlesnake rogers who stood at the heads of the mules jerked a little too vigorously at the rein of the tender mouthed donder who reared and emitted a loud protesting snort of pain instantly fritz with a scream of anger flew at the bulky rogers and began to assiduously pummel that surprised freebooter with his fists villain shouted fritz dog bigstiff dot mule he has a soreness by his mouth i vill knock off your shoulders mit your head robbermans yi yi howled rattlesnake roaring with laughter and ducking his head somebody git this here sour krout off n me one of the band yanked fritz back by the coat tail and the woods rang with rattlesnake s vociferous comments the dog goned little wienerwurst he yelled amiably he s not so much of a skunk for a dutchman took up for his animile plum quick didn t he i like to see a man like his hoss even if it is a mule the dad blamed little limburger he went for me didn t he whoa now muley i ain t a goin to hurt your mouth agin any more perhaps the mail would not have been tampered with had not ben moody the lieutenant possessed certain wisdom that seemed to promise more spoils say cap he said addressing hondo bill there s likely to be good pickings in these mail sacks i ve done some hoss tradin with these dutchmen around fredericksburg and i know the style of the varmints there s big money goes through the mails to that town them dutch risk a thousand dollars sent wrapped in a piece of paper before they d pay the banks to handle the money hondo bill six feet two gentle of voice and impulsive in action was dragging the sacks from the rear of the wagon before moody had finished his speech a knife shone in his hand and they heard the ripping sound as it bit through the tough canvas the outlaws crowded around and began tearing open letters and packages enlivening their labours by swearing affably at the writers who seemed to have conspired to confute the prediction of ben moody not a dollar was found in the fredericksburg mail you ought to be ashamed of yourself said hondo bill to the mail carrier in solemn tones to be packing around such a lot of old trashy paper as this what d you mean by it anyhow where do you dutchers keep your money at the ballinger mail sack opened like a cocoon under hondo s knife it contained but a handful of mail fritz had been fuming with terror and excitement until this sack was reached he now remembered lena s letter he addressed the leader of the band asking that that particular missive be spared much obliged dutch he said to the disturbed carrier i guess that s the letter we want got spondulicks in it ain t it here she is make a light boys hondo found and tore open the letter to mrs hildesmuller the others stood about lighting twisted up letters one from another hondo gazed with mute disapproval at the single sheet of paper covered with the angular german script whatever is this you ve humbugged us with dutchy you call this here a valuable letter that s a mighty low down trick to play on your friends what come along to help you distribute your mail that s chiny writin said sandy grundy peering over hondo s shoulder you re off your kazip declared another of the gang an effective youth covered with silk handkerchiefs and nickel plating that s shorthand i see em do it once in court ach no no no dot is german said fritz it is no more as a little girl writing a letter to her mamma one poor little girl sick and vorking hard avay from home ach it is a shame good mr robberman you vill please let me have dot letter what the devil do you take us for old pretzels said hondo with sudden and surprising severity you ain t presumin to insinuate that we gents ain t possessed of sufficient politeness for to take an interest in the miss s health are you now you go on and you read that scratchin out loud and in plain united states language to this here company of educated society hondo twirled his six shooter by its trigger guard and stood towering above the little german who at once began to read the letter translating the simple words into english the gang of rovers stood in absolute silence listening intently how old is that kid asked hondo when the letter was done eleven said fritz and where is she at at dose rock quarries working ach mein gott little lena she speak of drowning i do not know if she vill do it but if she shall i schwear i vill dot peter hildesmuller shoot mit a gun you dutchers said hondo bill his voice swelling with fine contempt make me plenty tired hirin out your kids to work when they ought to be playin dolls in the sand you re a hell of a sect of people i reckon we ll fix your clock for a while just to show what we think of your old cheesy nation here boys hondo bill parleyed aside briefly with his band and then they seized fritz and conveyed him off the road to one side here they bound him fast to a tree with a couple of lariats his team they tied to another tree near by we ain t going to hurt you bad said hondo reassuringly twon t hurt you to be tied up for a while we will now pass you the time of day as it is up to us to depart ausgespielt nixcumrous dutchy don t get any more impatience fritz heard a great squeaking of saddles as the men mounted their horses then a loud yell and a great clatter of hoofs as they galloped pell mell back along the fredericksburg road for more than two hours fritz sat against his tree tightly but not painfully bound then from the reaction after his exciting adventure he sank into slumber how long he slept he knew not but he was at last awakened by a rough shake hands were untying his ropes he was lifted to his feet dazed confused in mind and weary of body rubbing his eyes he looked and saw that he was again in the midst of the same band of terrible bandits they shoved him up to the seat of his wagon and placed the lines in his hands hit it out for home dutch said hondo bill s voice commandingly you ve given us lots of trouble and we re pleased to see the back of your neck spiel zwei bier vamoose hondo reached out and gave blitzen a smart cut with his quirt the little mules sprang ahead glad to be moving again fritz urged them along himself dizzy and muddled over his fearful adventure according to schedule time he should have reached fredericksburg at daylight as it was he drove down the long street of the town at eleven o clock a m he had to pass peter hildesmuller s house on his way to the post office he stopped his team at the gate and called but frau hildesmuller was watching for him out rushed the whole family of hildesmullers frau hildesmuller fat and flushed inquired if he had a letter from lena and then fritz raised his voice and told the tale of his adventure he told the contents of that letter that the robber had made him read and then frau hildesmuller broke into wild weeping her little lena drown herself why had they sent her from home what could be done perhaps it would be too late by the time they could send for her now peter hildesmuller dropped his meerschaum on the walk and it shivered into pieces woman he roared at his wife why did you let that child go away it is your fault if she comes home to us no more every one knew that it was peter hildesmuller s fault so they paid no attention to his words a moment afterward a strange faint voice was heard to call mamma frau hildesmuller at first thought it was lena s spirit calling and then she rushed to the rear of fritz s covered wagon and with a loud shriek of joy caught up lena herself covering her pale little face with kisses and smothering her with hugs lena s eyes were heavy with the deep slumber of exhaustion but she smiled and lay close to the one she had longed to see there among the mail sacks covered in a nest of strange blankets and comforters she had lain asleep until wakened by the voices around her fritz stared at her with eyes that bulged behind his spectacles gott in himmel he shouted how did you get in that wagon am i going crazy as well as to be murdered and hanged by robbers this day you brought her to us fritz cried frau hildesmuller how can we ever thank you enough tell mamma how you came in fritz s wagon said frau hildesmuller i don t know said lena but i know how i got away from the hotel the prince brought me by the emperor s crown shouted fritz we are all going crazy i always knew he would come said lena sitting down on her bundle of bedclothes on the sidewalk last night he came with his armed knights and captured the ogre s castle they broke the dishes and kicked down the doors they pitched mr maloney into a barrel of rain water and threw flour all over mrs maloney the workmen in the hotel jumped out of the windows and ran into the woods when the knights began firing their guns they wakened me up and i peeped down the stair and then the prince came up and wrapped me in the bedclothes and carried me out he was so tall and strong and fine his face was as rough as a scrubbing brush and he talked soft and kind and smelled of schnapps he took me on his horse before him and we rode away among the knights he held me close and i went to sleep that way and didn t wake up till i got home rubbish cried fritz bergmann fairy tales how did you come from the quarries to my wagon the prince brought me said lena confidently and to this day the good people of fredericksburg haven t been able to make her give any other explanation the reformation of calliope calliope catesby was in his humours again ennui was upon him this goodly promontory the earth particularly that portion of it known as quicksand was to him no more than a pestilent congregation of vapours overtaken by the megrims the philosopher may seek relief in soliloquy my lady find solace in tears the flaccid easterner scold at the millinery bills of his women folk such recourse was insufficient to the denizens of quicksand calliope especially was wont to express his ennui according to his lights over night calliope had hung out signals of approaching low spirits he had kicked his own dog on the porch of the occidental hotel and refused to apologise he had become capricious and fault finding in conversation while strolling about he reached often for twigs of mesquite and chewed the leaves fiercely that was always an ominous act another symptom alarming to those who were familiar with the different stages of his doldrums was his increasing politeness and a tendency to use formal phrases a husky softness succeeded the usual penetrating drawl in his tones a dangerous courtesy marked his manners later his smile became crooked the left side of his mouth slanting upward and quicksand got ready to stand from under at this stage calliope generally began to drink finally about midnight he was seen going homeward saluting those whom he met with exaggerated but inoffensive courtesy not yet was calliope s melancholy at the danger point he would seat himself at the window of the room he occupied over silvester s tonsorial parlours and there chant lugubrious and tuneless ballads until morning accompanying the noises by appropriate maltreatment of a jangling guitar more magnanimous than nero he would thus give musical warning of the forthcoming municipal upheaval that quicksand was scheduled to endure a quiet amiable man was calliope catesby at other times quiet to indolence and amiable to worthlessness at best he was a loafer and a nuisance at worst he was the terror of quicksand his ostensible occupation was something subordinate in the real estate line he drove the beguiled easterner in buckboards out to look over lots and ranch property originally he came from one of the gulf states his lank six feet slurring rhythm of speech and sectional idioms giving evidence of his birthplace and yet after taking on western adjustments this languid pine box whittler cracker barrel hugger shady corner lounger of the cotton fields and sumac hills of the south became famed as a bad man among men who had made a life long study of the art of truculence at nine the next morning calliope was fit inspired by his own barbarous melodies and the contents of his jug he was ready primed to gather fresh laurels from the diffident brow of quicksand encircled and criss crossed with cartridge belts abundantly garnished with revolvers and copiously drunk he poured forth into quicksand s main street too chivalrous to surprise and capture a town by silent sortie he paused at the nearest corner and emitted his slogan that fearful brassy yell so reminiscent of the steam piano that had gained for him the classic appellation that had superseded his own baptismal name following close upon his vociferation came three shots from his forty five by way of limbering up the guns and testing his aim a yellow dog the personal property of colonel swazey the proprietor of the occidental fell feet upward in the dust with one farewell yelp a mexican who was crossing the street from the blue front grocery carrying in his hand a bottle of kerosene was stimulated to a sudden and admirable burst of speed still grasping the neck of the shattered bottle the new gilt weather cock on judge riley s lemon and ultramarine two story residence shivered flapped and hung by a splinter the sport of the wanton breezes the artillery was in trim calliope s hand was steady the high calm ecstasy of habitual battle was upon him though slightly embittered by the sadness of alexander in that his conquests were limited to the small world of quicksand down the street went calliope shooting right and left glass fell like hail dogs vamosed chickens flew squawking feminine voices shrieked concernedly to youngsters at large the din was perforated at intervals by the staccato of the terror s guns and was drowned periodically by the brazen screech that quicksand knew so well the occasions of calliope s low spirits were legal holidays in quicksand all along the main street in advance of his coming clerks were putting up shutters and closing doors business would languish for a space the right of way was calliope s and as he advanced observing the dearth of opposition and the few opportunities for distraction his ennui perceptibly increased but some four squares farther down lively preparations were being made to minister to mr catesby s love for interchange of compliments and repartee on the previous night numerous messengers had hastened to advise buck patterson the city marshal of calliope s impending eruption the patience of that official often strained in extending leniency toward the disturber s misdeeds had been overtaxed in quicksand some indulgence was accorded the natural ebullition of human nature providing that the lives of the more useful citizens were not recklessly squandered or too much property needlessly laid waste the community sentiment was against a too strict enforcement of the law but calliope had raised the limit his outbursts had been too frequent and too violent to come within the classification of a normal and sanitary relaxation of spirit buck patterson had been expecting and awaiting in his little ten by twelve frame office that preliminary yell announcing that calliope was feeling blue when the signal came the city marshal rose to his feet and buckled on his guns two deputy sheriffs and three citizens who had proven the edible qualities of fire also stood up ready to bandy with calliope s leaden jocularities gather that fellow in said buck patterson setting forth the lines of the campaign don t have no talk but shoot as soon as you can get a show keep behind cover and bring him down he s a nogood un it s up to calliope to turn up his toes this time i reckon go to him all spraddled out boys and don t git too reckless for what calliope shoots at he hits buck patterson tall muscular and solemn faced with his bright city marshal badge shining on the breast of his blue flannel shirt gave his posse directions for the onslaught upon calliope the plan was to accomplish the downfall of the quicksand terror without loss to the attacking party if possible the splenetic calliope unconscious of retributive plots was steaming down the channel cannonading on either side when he suddenly became aware of breakers ahead the city marshal and one of the deputies rose up behind some dry goods boxes half a square to the front and opened fire at the same time the rest of the posse divided shelled him from two side streets up which they were cautiously manoeuvring from a well executed detour the first volley broke the lock of one of calliope s guns cut a neat underbit in his right ear and exploded a cartridge in his crossbelt scorching his ribs as it burst feeling braced up by this unexpected tonic to his spiritual depression calliope executed a fortissimo note from his upper register and returned the fire like an echo the upholders of the law dodged at his flash but a trifle too late to save one of the deputies a bullet just above the elbow and the marshal a bleeding cheek from a splinter that a ball tore from the box he had ducked behind and now calliope met the enemy s tactics in kind choosing with a rapid eye the street from which the weakest and least accurate fire had come he invaded it at a double quick abandoning the unprotected middle of the street with rare cunning the opposing force in that direction one of the deputies and two of the valorous volunteers waited concealed by beer barrels until calliope had passed their retreat and then peppered him from the rear in another moment they were reinforced by the marshal and his other men and then calliope felt that in order to successfully prolong the delights of the controversy he must find some means of reducing the great odds against him his eye fell upon a structure that seemed to hold out this promise providing he could reach it not far away was the little railroad station its building a strong box house ten by twenty feet resting upon a platform four feet above ground windows were in each of its walls something like a fort it might become to a man thus sorely pressed by superior numbers calliope made a bold and rapid spurt for it the marshal s crowd smoking him as he ran he reached the haven in safety the station agent leaving the building by a window like a flying squirrel as the garrison entered the door patterson and his supporters halted under protection of a pile of lumber and held consultations in the station was an unterrified desperado who was an excellent shot and carried an abundance of ammunition for thirty yards on either side of the besieged was a stretch of bare open ground it was a sure thing that the man who attempted to enter that unprotected area would be stopped by one of calliope s bullets the city marshal was resolved he had decided that calliope catesby should no more wake the echoes of quicksand with his strident whoop he had so announced officially and personally he felt imperatively bound to put the soft pedal on that instrument of discord it played bad tunes standing near was a hand truck used in the manipulation of small freight it stood by a shed full of sacked wool a consignment from one of the sheep ranches on this truck the marshal and his men piled three heavy sacks of wool stooping low buck patterson started for calliope s fort slowly pushing this loaded truck before him for protection the posse scattering broadly stood ready to nip the besieged in case he should show himself in an effort to repel the juggernaut of justice that was creeping upon him only once did calliope make demonstration he fired from a window and some tufts of wool spurted from the marshal s trustworthy bulwark the return shots from the posse pattered against the window frame of the fort no loss resulted on either side the marshal was too deeply engrossed in steering his protected battleship to be aware of the approach of the morning train until he was within a few feet of the platform the train was coming up on the other side of it it stopped only one minute at quicksand what an opportunity it would offer to calliope he had only to step out the other door mount the train and away abandoning his breastwork buck with his gun ready dashed up the steps and into the room driving upon the closed door with one heave of his weighty shoulder the members of the posse heard one shot fired inside and then there was silence at length the wounded man opened his eyes after a blank space he again could see and hear and feel and think turning his eyes about he found himself lying on a wooden bench a tall man with a perplexed countenance wearing a big badge with city marshal engraved upon it stood over him a little old woman in black with a wrinkled face and sparkling black eyes was holding a wet handkerchief against one of his temples he was trying to get these facts fixed in his mind and connected with past events when the old woman began to talk there now great big strong man that bullet never tetched ye jest skeeted along the side of your head and sort of paralysed ye for a spell i ve heerd of sech things afore cun cussion is what they names it abel wadkins used to kill squirrels that way barkin em abe called it you jest been barked sir and you ll be all right in a little bit feel lots better already don t ye you just lay still a while longer and let me bathe your head you don t know me i reckon and tain t surprisin that you shouldn t i come in on that train from alabama to see my son big son ain t he lands you wouldn t hardly think he d ever been a baby would ye this is my son sir half turning the old woman looked up at the standing man her worn face lighting with a proud and wonderful smile she reached out one veined and calloused hand and took one of her son s then smiling cheerily down at the prostrate man she continued to dip the handkerchief in the waiting room tin washbasin and gently apply it to his temple she had the benevolent garrulity of old age i ain t seen my son before she continued in eight years one of my nephews elkanah price he s a conductor on one of them railroads and he got me a pass to come out here i can stay a whole week on

concussion patient i m feeling pretty fair by this time he sat somewhat weakly yet leaning against the wall he was a rugged man big boned and straight his eyes steady and keen seemed to linger upon the face of the man standing so still above him his look wandered often from the face he studied to the marshal s badge upon the other s breast yes yes you ll be all right said the old woman patting his arm if you don t get to cuttin up agin and havin folks shooting at you son told me about you sir while you was layin senseless on the floor don t you take it as meddlesome fer an old woman with a

more be a good man and leave liquor alone and live peaceably and goodly keep away from bad company and work honest and sleep sweet the black mitted hand of the old pleader gently touched the breast of the man she addressed very earnest and candid her old worn face looked in her rusty black dress and antique bonnet she sat near the close of a long life and epitomised the experience of the world still the man to whom she spoke gazed above her head contemplating the silent son of the old mother what does the marshal say he asked does he believe the advice is good suppose the marshal speaks up and says if the talk s all right the tall man moved uneasily he fingered the badge on his breast for a moment and then he put an arm around the old woman and drew her close to him she smiled the unchanging mother smile of three score years and patted his big brown hand with her crooked mittened fingers while her son spake i says this he said looking squarely into the eyes of the other man that if i was in your place i d follow it if i was a drunken desp rate character without shame or hope i d follow it if i was in your place and you was in mine i d say marshal i m willin to swear if you ll give me the chance i ll quit the racket i ll drop the tanglefoot and the gun play and won t play hoss no more i ll be a good citizen and go to work and quit my foolishness so help me god that s what i d say to you if you was marshal and i was in your place hear my son talkin said the old woman softly hear him sir you promise to be good and he won t do you no harm forty one year ago his heart first beat ag in mine and it s beat true ever since the other man rose to his feet trying his limbs and stretching his muscles then said he if you was in my place and said that and i was marshal i d say go free and do your best to keep your promise lawsy exclaimed the old woman in a sudden flutter ef i didn t clear forget that trunk of mine i see a man settin it on the platform jest as i seen son s face in the window and it went plum out of my head there s eight jars of home made quince jam in that trunk that i made myself i wouldn t have nothin happen to them jars for a red apple away to the door she trotted spry and anxious and then calliope catesby spoke out to buck patterson i just couldn t help it buck i seen her through the window a comin in she never had heard a word bout my tough ways i didn t have the nerve to let her know i was a worthless cuss bein hunted down by the community there you was lyin where my shot laid you like you was dead the idea struck me sudden and i just took your badge off and fastened it onto myself and i fastened my reputation onto you i told her i was the marshal and you was a holy terror you can take your badge back now buck with shaking fingers calliope began to unfasten the disc of metal from his shirt easy there said buck patterson you keep that badge right where it is calliope catesby don t you dare to take it off till the day your mother leaves this town you ll be city marshal of quicksand as long as she s here to know it after i stir around town a bit and put em on i ll guarantee that nobody won t give the thing away to her and say

said buck she s a comin back cabbages and kings the proem by the carpenter they will tell you in anchuria that president miraflores of that volatile republic died by his own hand in the coast town of coralio that he had reached thus far in flight from the inconveniences of an imminent revolution and that one hundred thousand dollars government funds which he carried with him in an american leather valise as a souvenir of his tempestuous administration was never afterward recovered for a real a boy will show you his grave it is back of the town near a little bridge that spans a mangrove swamp a plain slab of wood stands at its head some one has burned upon the headstone with a hot iron this inscription ramon angel de las cruzes y miraflores presidente de la republica de anchuria que sea su juez dios it is characteristic of this buoyant people that they pursue no man beyond the grave let god be his judge even with the hundred thousand unfound though they greatly coveted the hue and cry went no further than that to the stranger or the guest the people of coralio will relate the story of the tragic end of their former president how he strove to escape from the country with the publice funds and also with dona isabel guilbert the young american opera singer and how being apprehended by members of the opposing political party in coralio he shot himself through the head rather than give up the funds and in consequence the senorita guilbert they will relate further that dona isabel her adventurous bark of fortune shoaled by the simultaneous loss of her distinguished admirer and the souvenir hundred thousand dropped anchor on this stagnant coast awaiting a rising tide they say in coralio that she found a prompt and prosperous tide in the form of frank goodwin an american resident of the town an investor who had grown wealthy by dealing in the products of the country a banana king a rubber prince a sarsaparilla indigo and mahogany baron the senorita guilbert you will be told married senor goodwin one month after the president s death thus in the very moment when fortune had ceased to smile wresting from her a gift greater than the prize withdrawn of the american don frank goodwin and of his wife the natives have nothing but good to say don frank has lived among them for years and has compelled their respect his lady is easily queen of what social life the sober coast affords the wife of the governor of the district herself who was of the proud castilian family of monteleon y dolorosa de los santos y mendez feels honored to unfold her napkin with olive hued ringed hands at the table of senora goodwin were you to refer with your northern prejudices to the vivacious past of mrs goodwin when her audacious and gleeful abandon in light opera captured the mature president s fancy or to her share in that statesman s downfall and malfeasance the latin shrug of the shoulder would be your only answer and rebuttal what prejudices there were in coralio concerning senora goodwin seemed now to be in her favor whatever they had been in the past it would seem that the story is ended instead of begun that the close of tragedy and the climax of a romance have covered the ground of interest but to the more curious reader it shall be some slight instruction to trace the close threads that underlie the ingenious web of circumstances the headpiece bearing the name of president miraflores is daily scrubbed with soap bark and sand an old half breed indian tends the grave with fidelity and the dawdling minuteness of inherited sloth he chops down the weeds and ever springing grass with his machete he plucks ants and scorpions and beetles from it with his horny fingers and sprinkles its turf with water from the plaza fountain there is no grave anywhere so well kept and ordered only by following out the underlying threads will it be made clear why the old indian galves is secretly paid to keep green the grave of president miraflores by one who never saw that unfortunate statesman in life or in death and why that one was wont to walk in the twilight casting from a distance looks of gentle sadness upon that unhonored mound elsewhere than at coralio one learns of the impetuous career of isabel guilbert new orleans gave her birth and the mingled french and spanish creole nature that tinctured her life with such turbulence and warmth she had little education but a knowledge of men and motives that seemed to have come by instinct far beyond the common woman was she endowed with intrepid rashness with a love for the pursuit of adventure to the brink of danger and with desire for the pleasures of life her spirit was one to chafe under any curb she was eve after the fall but before the bitterness of it was felt she wore life as a rose in her bosom of the legion of men who had been at her feet it was said that but one was so fortunate as to engage her fancy to president miraflores the brilliant but unstable ruler of anchuria she yielded the key to her resolute heart how then do we find her as the coralians would have told you the wife of frank goodwin and happily living a life of dull and dreamy inaction the underlying threads reach far stretching across the sea following them out it will be made plain why shorty o day of the columbia detective agency resigned his position and for a lighter pastime it shall be a duty and a pleasing sport to wander with momus beneath the tropic stars where melpomene once stalked austere now to cause laughter to echo from those lavish jungles and frowing crags where formerly rang the cries of pirate s victims to lay aside pike and cutlass and attack with quip and jollity to draw one saving titter of mirth from the rusty casque of romance this were pleasant to do in the shade of the lemon trees on that coast that is curved like lips set for smiling for there are yet tales of the spanish main that segment of continent washed by the tempestuous caribbean and presenting to the sea a formidable border of tropicle jungle topped by the overweening cordilleras is still begirt by mystery and romance in past times buccaneers and revolutionists roused the echoes of its cliffs and the condor wheeled perpetually above where in the green groves they made food for him with their matchlocks and toledos taken and retaken by sea rovers by adverse powers and by sudden uprising of rebellious factions the historic miles of adventurous coast has scarcely known for hundreds of years whom rightly to call its master pizarro balboa sir francis drake and bolivar did what they could to make it a part of christendom sir john morgan lafitte and other eminent swashbucklers bombarded and pounded it in the name of abaddon the game still goes on the guns of the rovers are silenced but the tintype man the enlarged photograph brigand the kodaking tourist and the scouts of the gentle brigade of fakirs have found it out and carry on the work the hucksters of germany france and sicily now bag in small change across their counters gentlemen adventurers throng the waiting rooms of its rulers with proposals for railways and concessions the little opera bouffe nations play at government and intrigue until some day a big silent gunboat glides into the offing and warns them not to break their toys and with these changes comes also the small adventurer with empty pockets to fill light of heart busy brained the modern fairy prince bearing an alarm clock with which more surely than by the sentimental kiss to awaken the beautiful tropics from their centuries sleep generally he wears a shamrock which he matches pridefully against the extravagant palms and it is he who had driven melpomene to the wings and set comedy to dancing before the footlights of the southern cross so there is a little tale to tell of many things perhaps to the promiscuous ear of the walrus it shall come with most avail for in it there are indeed shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbage palms and presidents instead of kings add to these a little love and counterplotting and scatter everywhere throughout the maze a trail of tropical dollars dollars warmed no more by the torrid sun than by the hot palms of the scouts of fortune and after all here seems to be life itself with talk enough to weary the most garrulous of walruses i fox in the morning coralio reclined in the mid day heat like some vacuous beauty lounging in a guarded harem the town lay at the sea s edge on a strip of alluvial coast it was set like a little pearl in an emerald band behind it and seeming almost to topple imminent above it rose the sea following range of the cordilleras in front the sea was spread a smiling jailer but even more incorruptible than the frowning mountains the waves swished along the smooth beach the parrots screamed in the orange and ceiba trees the palms waved their limber fronds foolishly like an awkward chorus at the prima donna s cue to enter suddenly the town was full of excitement a native boy dashed down a grass grown street shrieking busca el senor goodwin ha venido un telegrafo por el the word passed quickly telegrams do not come to any one in coralio the cry for senor goodwin was taken up by a dozen officious voices the main street running parallel to the beach became populated with those who desired to expedite the delivery of the dispatch knots of women with complexions varying from palest olive to deepest brown gathered at street corners and plaintively carolled un telegrafo por senor goodwin the comandante don senor el coronel encarnacion rios who was loyal to the ins and suspected goodwin s devotion to the outs hissed aha and wrote in his secret memorandum book the accusive fact that senor goodwin had on that momentous date received a telegram in the midst of the hullabaloo a man stepped to the door of a small wooden building and looked out above the door was a sign that read keogh and clancy a nomenclature that seemed not to be indigenous to that tropical soil the man in the door was billy keogh scout of fortune and progress and latter day rover of the spanish main tintypes and photographs were the weapons with which keogh and clancy were at that time assailing the hopeless shores outside the shop were set two large frames filled with specimens fo their art and skill keogh leaned in the doorway his bold and humorous countenance wearing a look of interest at the unusual influx of life and sound in the street when the meaning of the disturbance became clear to him he placed a hand beside his mouth and shouted hey frank in such a robustious voice that the feeble clamor of the natives was drowned and silenced fifty yards away on the seaward side of the street stood the abode of the consul for the united states out from the door of this building tumbled goodwin at the call he had been smoking with willard geddie the consul on the back porch of the consulate which was conceded to be the coolest spot in coralio hurry up shouted keogh there s a riot in town on account of a telegram that s come for you you want to be careful about these things my boy it won t do to trifle with the feelings of the public this way you ll be getting a pink note some day with violet scent on it and then the country ll be steeped in the throes of a revolution goodwin had strolled up the street and met the boy with the message the ox eyed women gazed at him with shy admiration for his type drew them he was big blond and jauntily dressed in white linen with buckskin zapatos his manner was courtly with a merciful eye when the telegram had been delivered and the bearer of it dismissed with a gratuity the relieved populace returned to the contiguities of shade from which curiosity had drawn it the women to their baking in the mud ovens under the orange trees or to the interminable combing of their long straight hair the men to their cigarettes and gossip in the cantinas goodwin sat on keogh s doorstep and read his telegram it was from bob englehart an american who lived in san mateo the capital city of anchuria eighty miles in the interior englehart was a gold miner an ardent revolutionist and good people that he was a man of resource and imagination was proven by the telegram he had sent it had had been his task to send a confidential message to his friend in coralio this could not have been accomplished in either spanish or english for the eye politic in anchuria was an active one but englehart was a diplomatist there existed but one code upon which he might make requisition with promise of safety the great and potent code of slang so here is the message that slipped unconstrued through the fingers of curious officials and came to the eye of goodwin his nibs skedaddled yesterday per jack rabbit line with all the coin in the kitty and the bundle of muslin he s spoony about the boodle is six figures short our crowd in good shape but we need the spondulicks you collar it the main guy and the dry goods are headed for the briny you to know what to do bob this screed remarkable as it was had no mystery for goodwin he was the most successful of the small advance guard of speculative americans that had invaded anchuria and he had not reached that enviable pinnacle without having well exercised the arts of foresight and deduction he had taken up political intrigue as a matter of business he was acute enough to wield a certain influence among the leading schemers and he was prosperous enough to be able to purchase the respect of the petty officeholders there was always a revolutionary party and to it he had allied himself for the adherents of a new administration received the rewards of their labors there was now a liberal party seeking to overturn president miraflores if the wheel successfully revolved goodwin stood to win a concession to manzanas of the finest coffee lands in the interior certain incidents in the recent career of president miraflores had excited a shrewd suspicion in goodwin s mind that the government was near a dissolution from another cause than that of a revolution and now englehart s telegram had come as a corroboration of his wisdom the telegram which had remained unintelligible to the anchurian linguists who had applied to it in vain their knowledge of spanish and elemental english conveyed a stimulating piece of news to goodwin s understanding it informed him that the president of the republic had decamped from the capital city with the contents of the treasury furthermore that he was accompanied in his flight by that winning adventuress isabel guilbert the opera singer whose troupe of performers had been entertained by the president at san mateo during the past month on a scale less modest than that with which royal visitors are often content the reference to the jackrabbit line could mean nothing else than the mule back system of transport that prevailed between coralio and the capital the hint that the boodle was six figures short made the condition of the national treasury lamentably clear also it was convincingly true that the ingoing party its way now made a pacific one would need the spondulicks unless its pledges should be fulfilled and the spoils held for the delectation of the victors precarious indeed would be the position of the new government therefore it was exceeding necessary to collar the main guy and recapture the sinews of war and government goodwin handed the message to keogh read that billy he said it s from bob englehart can you manage the cipher keogh sat in the other half of the doorway and carefully perused the telegram tis not a cipher he said finally tis what they call literature and that s a system of language put in the mouths of people that they ve never been introduced to by writers of imagination the magazines invented it but i never knew before that president norvin green had stamped it with the seal of his approval tis now no longer literature but language the dictionaries tried but they couldn t make it go for anything but dialect sure now that the western union indorses it it won t be long till a race of people will spring up that speaks it you re running too much to philology billy said goodwin do you make out the meaning of it sure replied the philosopher of fortune all languages come easy to the man who must know em i ve even failed to misunderstand an order to evacuate in classical chinese when it was backed up by the muzzle of a breech loader this little literary essay i hold in my hands means a game of fox in the morning ever play that frank when you was a kid i think so said goodwin laughing you join hands all round and you do not interrupted keogh you ve got a fine sporting game mixed up in your head with all around the rosebush the spirit of fox in the morning is opposed to the holding of hands i ll tell you how it s played this president man and his companion in play they stand up over in san mateo ready for the run and shout fox in the morning me and you standing here we say goose and gander they say how many miles is it to london town we say only a few if your legs are long enough how many comes out they say more than you re able to catch and then the game commences i catch the idea said goodwin it won t do to let the goose and gander slip through your fingers billy their feathers are too valuable our crowd is prepared and able to step into the shoes of the government at once but with the treasury empty we d stay in power about as long as a tenderfoot would stick on an untamed bronco we must play the fox on every foot of the coast to prevent their getting out of the country by the mule back schedule said keogh it s five days down from san mateo we ve got plenty of time to set our outposts there s only three places on the coast where they can hope to sail from here and solitas and alazan they re the only points we ll have to guard it s as easy as a chess problem fox to play and mate in three moves oh goosey goosey gander whither do you wander by the blessing of the literary telegraph the boodle of this benighted fatherland shall be preserved to the honest political party that is seeking to overthrow it the situation had been justly outlined by keogh the down trail from the capital was at all times a weary road to travel a jiggety joggety journey it was ice cold and hot wet and dry the trail climbed appalling mountains wound like a rotten string about the brows of breathless precipices plunged through chilling snow fed streams and wriggled like a snake through sunless forests teeming with menacing insect and animal life after descending to the foothills it turned to a trident the central prong ending at alazan another branched off to coralio the third penetrated to solitas between the sea and the foothills stretched the five miles breadth of alluvial coast here was the flora ofthe tropics in its rankest and most prodigal growth spaces here and there had been wrested from the jungle and planted with bananas and cane and orange groves the rest was a riot of wild vegetation the home of monkeys tapirs jaguars alligators and prodigious reptiles and insects where no road was cut a serpent could scarcely make its way through the tangle of vines and creepers across the treacherous mangrove swamps few things without wings could safely pass therefore the fugitives could hope to reach the coast only by one of the routes named keep the matter quiet billy advised goodwin we don t want the ins to know that the president is in flight i suppose bob s information is something of a scoop in the capital as yet otherwise he would not have tried to make his message a confidential one and besides everybody would have heard the news i m going around now to see dr zavalla and start a man up the trail to cut the telegraph wire as goodwin rose keogh threw his hat upon the grass by the door and expelled a tremendous sigh what s the trouble billy asked goodwin pausing that s the first time i heard you sigh tis the last said keogh with that sorrowful puff of wind i resign myself

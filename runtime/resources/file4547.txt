but if you think there s anything queer at the address i ll go there with ye on the next afternoon at turpin and the captain crept softly up the stairs of no blank street a dozen plain clothes men dressed in full police uniforms so as to allay suspicion waited in the hall below at the top of the stairs was a door which was found to be locked the captain took a key from his pocket and unlocked it the two men entered they found themselves in a large room occupied by twenty or twenty five elegantly clothed ladies racing charts hung against the walls a ticker clicked in one corner with a telephone receiver to his ear a man was calling out the various positions of the horses in a very exciting race the occupants of the room looked up at the intruders but as if reassured by the sight of the captain s uniform they reverted their attention to the man at the telephone you see said the captain to turpin the value of an anonymous letter no high minded and self respect ing gentleman should consider one worthy of notice is your wife among this assembly mr turpin she is not said turpin and if she was continued the captain would she be within the reach of the tongue of slander these ladies

sheets were tacked close together covering a large space on one of the walls turpin suspicious tore several of them down a door pre viously hidden was revealed turpin placed an ear to the crack and listened intently he heard the soft hum of many voices low and guarded laughter and a sharp metallic clicking and scraping as if from a multitude of tiny but busy objects my god it is as i feared whispered turpin to himself summon your men at once he called to the captain she is in there i know at the blowing of the captain s whistle the uniformed plain clothes men rushed up the stairs into the pool room when they saw the betting paraphernalia distrib uted around they halted surprised and puzzled to know why they had been summoned but the captain pointed to the lock ed door and bade them break it down in a few moments they demolished it with the axes they carried into the other room sprang claude turpin with the captain at his heels the scene was one that lingered long in turpin s mind nearly a score of women women expensively and fashionably clothed many beautiful and of refined appearance had been seated at little marble topped tables when the police burst open the door they shrieked and ran here and there like gayly plumed birds that had been disturbed in a tropical grove some became hysterical one or two fainted several knelt at the feet of the officers and besought them for mercy on account of their families and social position a man who had been seated behind a desk had seized a roll of currency as large as the ankle of a paradise roof gardens chorus girl and jumped out of the window half a dozen attendants huddled at one end of the room breathless from fear upon the tables remained the damning and incon trovertible evidences of the guilt of the habitu es of that sinister room dish after dish heaped high with ice cream and surrounded by stacks of empty ones scraped to the last spoonful ladies said the captain to his weeping circle of prisoner i ll not hold any of yez some of yez i recog nize as having fine houses and good standing in the community with hard working husbands and childer at home but i ll read ye a bit of a lecture before ye go in the next room there s a to shot just dropped in under the wire three lengths ahead of the field is this the way ye waste your husbands money instead of help ing earn it home wid yez the lid s on the ice cream freezer in this precinct claude turpin s wife was among the patrons of the raided room he led her to their apartment in stem silence there she wept so remorsefully and besought his forgiveness so pleadingly that he forgot his just anger and soon he gathered his penitent golden haired vivien in his arms and forgave her darling she murmured half sobbingly as the moon light drifted through the open window glorifying her sweet upturned face i know i done wrong i will never touch ice cream again i forgot you were not a millionaire i used to go there every day but to day i felt some strange sad presentiment of evil and i was not myself i ate only eleven saucers say no more said claude gently as he fondly caressed her waving curls and you are sure that you fully forgive me asked vivien gazing at him entreatingly with dewy eyes of heavenly blue almost sure little one answered claude stooping and lightly touching her snowy forehead with his lips i ll let you know later on i ve got a month s salary down on vanilla to win the three year old steeplechase to morrow and if the ice cream hunch is to the good you are it again see the whirligig of life justice of the peace benaja widdup sat in the door of his office smoking his elder stem pipe half way to the zenith the cumberland range rose blue gray in the afternoon haze a speckled hen swaggered down the main street of the settlement cackling foolishly up the road came a sound of creaking axles and then a slow cloud of dust and then a bull cart bearing ransie bilbro and his wife the cart stopped at the justice s door and the two climbed down ransie was a narrow six feet of sallow brown skin and yellow hair the imperturbability of the mountains hung upon him like a suit of armour the woman was calicoed angled snuff brushed and weary with unknown desires through it all gleamed a faint protest of cheated youth unconscious of its loss the justice of the peace slipped his feet into his shoes for the sake of dignity and moved to let them enter we all said the woman in a voice like the wind blowing through pine boughs wants a divo ce she looked at ransie to see if he noted any flaw or ambiguity or evasion or partiality or self partisanship in her state ment of their business a divo ce repeated ransie with a solemn dod we all can t git along together nohow it s lonesome enough fur to live in the mount ins

stirred deliberately to his duties he placed his one chair and a wooden stool for his petitioners he opened his book of statutes on the table and scanned the index presently he wiped his spectacles and shifted his inkstand the law and the statutes said he air silent on the subjeck of divo ce as fur as the jurisdiction of this co t air concerned but accordin to equity and the con stitution and the golden rule it s a bad barg in that can t run both ways if a justice of the peace can marry a couple it s plain that he is bound to be able to divo ce em this here office will issue a decree of divo ce and abide by the decision of the supreme co t to hold it good ransie bilbro drew a small tobacco bag from his trousers pocket out of this he shook upon the table a five dollar note sold a b arskin and two foxes fur that he remarked it s all the money we got the regular price of a divo ce in this co t said the justice air five dollars he stuffed the bill into the pocket of his homespun vest with a deceptive air of indiffer ence with much bodily toil and mental travail he wrote the decree upon half a sheet of foolscap and then copied it upon the other ransie bilbro and his wife listened to his reading of the document that was to give them freedom know all men by these presents that ransie bilbro and his wife ariela bilbro this day personally appeared before me and promises

perplexity there had been no previous hint of alimony women were always bringing up startling and unlooked for issues justice benaja widdup felt that the point demanded judicial decision the authorities were also silent on the subject of alimony but the woman s feet were bare the trail to hogback mountain was steep and flinty ariela bilbro he asked in official tones how much did you low

the night he climbed into the cart on one side and ariela climbed in on the other obeying the flap of his rope the little red bull slowly came around on a tack and the cart crawled away in the nimbus arising from its wheels justice of the peace benaja widdup smoked his elder stem pipe late in the afternoon he got his weekly paper and read it until the twilight dimmed its lines then he lit the tallow candle on his table and read until the moon rose marking the time for supper he lived in the double log cabin on the slope near the girdled poplar going home to supper he crossed a little branch darkened by a laurel thicket the dark figure of a man stepped from the laurels and pointed a rifle at his breast his hat was pulled down low and something covered most of his face i want yo money said the figure thout any talk i m gettin nervous and my finger s a wabblin on this here trigger i ve only got f f five dollars said the justice pro ducing it from his vest pocket roll it up came the order and stick it in the end of this here gun bar l the bill was crisp and new even fingers that were clumsy and trembling found little difficulty in making a spill of it and inserting it this with less ease into the muzzle of the rifle now i reckon you kin be goin along said the robber the justice lingered not on his way the next day came the little red bull drawing the cart to the office door justice benaja widdup had his shoes on for he was expecting the visit in his presence ransie bilbro handed to his wife a five dollar bill the official s eye sharply viewed it it seemed to curl up as though it had been rolled and inserted into the end of a gun barrel but the justice refrained from comment it is true that other bills might be inclined to curl he handed each one a decree of divorce each stood awkwardly silent slowly folding the guarantee of freedom the woman cast a shy glance full of constraint at ransie i reckon you ll be goin back up to the cabin she said along ith the bull cart there s bread in the tin box settin on the shelf i put the bacon in the b ilin pot to keep the hounds from gittin it don t forget to wind the clock to night you air a goin to your

benaja widdup watched the money disappear with mournful eyes behind his spectacles and then with his next words he achieved rank as his thoughts ran with either the great crowd of the world s sympathizers or the little crowd of its great financiers be kind o lonesome in the old cabin to night ranse he said ransie bilbro stared out at the cumberlands clear blue now in the sunlight he did not look at ariela i low it might be lonesome he said but when folks gits mad and wants a divo ce you can t make folks stay there s others wanted a divo ce said ariela speaking to the wooden stool besides nobody don t want no body to stay nobody never said they didn t nobody never said they did i reckon i better start on now to brother ed s nobody can t wind that old clock want me to go back

aricla caught the gleam of promise in his words swiftly her hand went to her bosom freely as an alighting dove the bill fluttered to the justice s table her sallow cheek coloured as she stood hand in hand with ransie and listened to the reuniting words ransie helped her into the cart and climbed in beside her the little red bull turned once more and they set out hand clasped for the mountains justice of the peace benaja widdup sat in his door and took off his shoes once again he fingered the bill tucked down in his vest pocket once again he smoked his elder stem pipe once again the speck led hen swag gered down the main street of the settlement cackling foolishly a sacrifice hit the editor of the hearthstone magazine his own ideas about the selection of manuscript for his publication his theory is no secret in fact he will expound it to you willingly sitting at his mahogany desk smiling benignantly and tapping his knee gently with his gold rimmed eye glasses the hearthstone he will say does not employ a staff of readers we obtain opinions of the manuscripts submitted to us directly from types of the various classes of our readers that is the editor s theory and this is the way he carries it out when a batch of mss is received the editor stuffs every one of his pockets full of them and distributes them as he goes about during the day the office employees the hall porter the janitor the elevator man messenger boys the waiters at the caf where the editor has luncheon the man at the news stand where he buys his evening paper the grocer and milkman the guard on the uptown elevated train the ticket chopper at sixty th street the cook and maid at his home these are the readers who pass upon mss sent in to the hearthstone magazine if his pockets are not entirely emptied by the time he reaches the bosom of his family the remaining ones are handed over to his wife to read after the baby goes to sleep a few days later the editor gathers in the mss during his regular rounds and con siders the verdict of his assorted readers this system of making up a magazine has been very successful and the circulation paced by the advertising rates is making a wonderful record of speed the hearthstone company also publishes books and its imprint is to be found on several successful works all recommended says the editor by the hearthstone army of volunteer readers now and then according to talkative members of the editorial staff the hearthstone has allowed manuscripts to slip through its fingers on the advice of its heterogeneous readers that afterward proved to be famous sellers when brought out by other houses for instance the gossips say the rise and fall of silas latham was unfavourably passed upon by the elevator man the office boy unanimously rejected the boss in the bishop s carriage was contemptuously looked upon by the street car conductor the deliver ance was turned down by a clerk in the subscription department whose wife s mother had just begun a two months visit at his home the queen s quair came back from the janitor with the comment so is the book but nevertheless the hearthstone adheres to its theory and system and it will never lack volunteer readers for each one of the widely scattered staff from the young lady stenographer in the editorial office to the man who shovels in coal whose adverse decision lost to the hearth stone company the manuscript of the under world has expectations of becoming editor of the magazine some day this method of the hearthstone was well known to allen slayton when he wrote his novelette entitled love is all slayton had hung about the editorial offices of all the magazines so persistently that he was acquainted with the inner workings of every one in gotham he knew not only that the editor of the hearthstone handed his mss around among different types of people for reading but that the stories of sentimental love interest went to miss puffkin the editor s stenographer another of the editor s peculiar customs was to conceal invariably the name of the writer from his readers of mss so that a glittering name might not influence the sincerity of their reports slayton made love is all the effort of his life he gave it six months of the best work of his heart and brain it was a pure love story fine elevated romantic passionate a prose poem that set the divine blessing of love i am transposing from the manuscript high above all earthly gifts and honours and listed it in the catalogue of heaven s choicest rewards slayton s literary ambition was intense he would have sacrificed all other worldly possessions to have gained fame in his chosen art he would almost have cut off his right hand or have offered himself to the knife of the appendi citis fancier to have realized his dream of seeing one of his efforts published in the hearthstone slayton finished love is all and took it to thy hearthstone in person the office of the magazine was in a large conglomerate building presided under by a janitor as the writer stepped inside the door on his way to the elevator a potato masher flew through the hall wreck ing slayton s hat and smashing the glass of the door closely following in the wake of the utensil flew the janitor a bulky unwholesome man suspenderless and sordid panic stricken and breathless a frowsy tall woman with flying hair followed the missile the janitor s foot slipped on the tiled floor he fell in a heap with an exclamation of despair the woman pounced upon him and seized his hair the man bellowed lustily her vengeance wreaked the virago rose and stalked triumphant as minerva back to some cryptic domestic retreat at the rear the janitor got to his feet blown and humiliated this is married life he said to slayton with a certain bruised humour that s the girl i used to lay awake of nights thinking about sorry about your hat mister say don t snitch to the tenants about this will yer i don t want to lose me job slayton took the elevator at the end of the hall and went up to the offices of the hearthstone he left the ms of love is all with the editor who agreed to give him an answer as to its availability at the end of a week slayton formulated his great winning scheme on his way down it struck him with one brilliant flash and he could not refrain from admiring his own genius in conceiving the idea that very night he set about carry ing it into execution miss puffkin the hearthstone stenographer boarded in the same house with the author she was an oldish thin exclusive languishing sentimental maid and slayton had been introduced to her some time before the writer s daring and self sacrificing project was this he knew that the editor of the hearthstone relied strongly upon miss puffkin s judgment in the manuscript of romantic and sentimental fiction her taste represented the immense average of mediocre women who devour novels and stories of that type the central idea and keynote of love is all was love at first sight the enrapturing irresistible soul thrilling feeling that com pels a man or a woman to recognize his or her spirit mate as soon as heart speaks to heart suppose he should impress this divine truth upon miss puffkin personally would she not surely indorse her new and rapturous sensations by recommending highly to the editor of the hearthstone the novelette love is all slayton thought so and that night he took miss puffkin to the theatre the next night he made vehement love to her in the dim parlour of the boarding house he quoted freely from love is all and he wound up with miss puffkin s head on his shoulder and visions of literary fame dancing in his head but slayton did not stop at love making this he said to himself was the turning point of his life and like a true sportsman he went the limit on thursday night he and miss puffkin walked over to the big church in the middle of the block and were married brave slayton chateaubriand died in a garret byron courted a widow keats starved to death poe mixed his drinks de quincey hit the pipe ade lived in chica o james kept on doing it dic kens wore white socks de maupassant wore a strait jacket tom watson became a populist jeremiah wept all these authors did these things for the sake of literature but thou didst cap them all thou marriedst a wife for to carve for thyself a niche in the temple of fame on friday morning mrs slayton said she would go over to the hearthstone office hand in one or two manu ripts that the editor had given to her to read and resign her position as stenographer was there anything er that er you particu larly fancied in the stories you are going to turn in asked slayton with a thumping heart there was one a novelette that i liked so much said his wife i haven t read anything in years that i thought was half as nice and true to life that afternoon slayton hurried down to the hearth stone office he felt that his reward was close at hand with a novelette in the hearthstone literary reputation would soon be his the office boy met him at the railing in the outer office it was not for unsuccessful authors to hold personal colloquy with the editor except at rare intervals slayton hugging himself internally was nursing in his heart the exquisite hope of being able to crush the office boy with his forthcoming success he inquired concerning his novelette the office boy went into the sacred precincts and brought forth a large envelope thick with more than the bulk of a thousand diecks the boss told me to tell you he s sorry said the boy but your manuscript ain t available for the magazine slayton stood dazed can you tell me he stammered whether or no miss puff that is my i mean miss ruffkin handed in a novelette this morning that she had been asked to read sure she did answered the office boy wisely i heard the old man say that miss puffkin said it was a daisy the name of it was married for the mazuma or a working girl s triumph say you said the office boy confidentially your name s slayton ain t it i guess i mixed cases on vou without meanin to do it the boss give me some manu script to hand around the other day and i got the ones for miss puffkin and the janitor mixed i guess it s all right though and then slayton looked closer and saw on the cover of his manuscript under the title love is all the janitor s comment scribbled with a piece of charcoal the you say the roads we take twienty miles west of tucson the sunset express stopped at a tank to take on water besides the aqueous addition the engine of that famous flyer acquired some other things that were not good for it while the fireman was lowering the feeding hose bob tidball shark dodson and a quarter bred creek indian called john big dog climbed on the engine and showed the engineer three round orifices in pieces of ordnance that the carried these orifices so impressed the engineer with their possibilities that he raised both hands in a gesture such as accompanies the ejaculation do tell at the crisp command of shark dodson who was leader of the attacking force the engineer descended to the ground and uncoupled the engine and tender then john big dog perched upon the coal sportively held two guns upon the engine driver and the fireman and suggested that they run the engine fifty yards away and there await further orders shark dodson and bob tidball scorning to put such low grade ore as the passengers through the mill struck out for the rich pocket of the express car they found the messenger serene in the belief that the sunset express was taking on nothing more stimulating and dangerous than aqua pura while bob was knocking this idea out of his head with the butt end of his six shooter shark dodson was already dosing the express car safe with dynamite the safe exploded to the tune of all gold and currency the passengers thrust their heads casually out of the windows to look for the thunder cloud the conductor jerked at the bell rope which sagged down loose and unresisting at his tug shark dodson and bob tidball with their booty in a stout canvas bag tumbled out of the express car and ran awkwardly in their high heeled boots to the engine the engineer sullenly angry but wise ran the engine according to orders rapidly away from the inert train but before this was accomplished the express messenger recovered from bob tidball s persuader to neutrality jumped out of his car with a winchester rifle and took a trick in the game mr john big dog sitting on the coal tender unwittingly made a wrong lead by giving an imitation of a target and the messenger trumped him with a ball exactly between his shoulder blades the creek chevalier of industry rolled off to the ground thus increasing the share of his comrades in the loot by one sixth each two miles from the tank the engineer was ordered to stop the robbers waved a defiant adieu and plunged down the steep slope into the thick woods that lined the track five minutes of crashing through a thicket of chapparal brought them to open woods where three horses were tied to low hanging branches one was waiting for john big dog who would never ride by night or day again this animal the robbers divested of saddle and bridle and set free they mounted the other two with the bag across one pommel and rode fast and with discre tion through the forest and up a primeval lonely gorge here the animal that bore bob tidball slipped on a mossy boulder and broke a foreleg they shot him through the head at once and sat down to hold a council of flight made secure for the present by the tortuous trail they had travelled the question of time was no longer so big many miles and hours lay between them and the spryest posse that could follow shark dodson s horse with trailing rope and dropped bridle panted and cropped thankfully of the grass along the stream in the gorge bob tidball opened the sack drew out double handfuls of the neat packages of currency and the one sack of gold and chuckled with the glee of a child say you old double decked pirate he called joyfully to dodson you said we could do it you got a head for financing that knocks the horns off of anything in arizona what are we going to do about a hoss for you bob we ain t got long to wait here they ll be on our trail before daylight in the mornin oh i guess that cayuse of yourn ll carry double for a while answered the sanguine bob we ll annex the first animal we come across by jingoes we made a haul didn t we accordin to the marks on this money there s apiece it s short of what i expected said shark dodson kicking softly at the packages with the toe of his boot and then he looked pensively at the wet sides of his tired horse old bolivar s mighty nigh played out he said slowly i wish that sorrel of yours hadn t got hurt so do i said bob heartily but it can t be helped bolivar s got plenty of bottom he ll get us both far enough to get fresh mounts dang it shark i can t belp thinkin how funny it is that an easterner like you can come out here and give us western fellows cards and spades in the desperado business what part of the east was you from anyway new york state said shark dodson sitting down on a boulder and chewing a twig i was born on a farm in ulster county i ran away from home when i was seventeen it was an accident my coming west i was walkin along the road with my clothes in a bundle makin for new york city i had an idea of goin there and makin lots of money i always felt like i could do it i came to a place one evenin where the road forked and i didn t know which fork to take i studied about it for half an hour and then i took the left hand that night i run into the camp of a wild west show that was travellin among the little towns and i went west with it i ve often wondered if i wouldn t have turned out different if i d took the other road oh i reckon you d have ended up about the same said bob tidball cheerfully philosophical it ain t the roads we take it s what s inside of us that makes us turn out the way we do shark dodson got up and leaned against a tree i d a good deal rather that sorrel of yourn hadn t hurt himself bob he said again almost pathetically same here agreed bob he was sure a first rate kind of a crowbait but bolivar he ll pull us through all right reckon we d better be movin on hadn t we shark i ll bag this boodle ag in and we ll hit the trail for higher timber bob tidball replaced the spoil in the bag and tied the mouth of it tightly with a cord when he looked up the most prominent object that he saw was the muzzle of shark dodson s held upon him without a waver stop your funnin said bob with a grin we got to be hittin the breeze set still said shark you ain t goin to hit no breeze bob i hate to tell you but there ain t any chance for but one of us bolivar he s plenty tired and he can t carry double we been pards me and you shark dodson for three year bob said quietly we ve risked our lives together time and again i ve always give you a square deal and i thought you was a man i ve heard some queer stories about you shootin one or two men in a peculiar way but i never believed em now if you re just havin a little fun with me shark put your gun up and we ll get on bolivar and vamose if you mean to shoot shoot you blackhearted son of a tarantula shark dodson s face bore a deeply sorrowful look you don t know how bad i feel he sighed about that sorrel of yourn breakin his leg bob the expression on dodson s face changed in an instant to one of cold ferocity mingled with inexorable cupidity the soul of the man showed itself for a moment like an evil face in the window of a reputable house truly bob tidball was never to hit the breeze again the deadly of the false friend cracked and filled the gorge with a roar that the walls hurled back with indignant echoes and bolivar unconscious accomplice swiftly bore away the last of the holders up of the sunset express not put to the stress of carrying double but as shark dodson galloped away the woods seemed to fade from his view the revolver in his right hand turned to the curved arm of a mahogany chair his saddle was strangely upholstered and he opened his eyes and saw his feet not in stirrups but resting quietly on the edge of a quartered oak desk i am telling you that dodson of the firm of dodson decker wall street brokers opened his eyes peabody the confidential clerk was standing by his chair hesitating to speak there was a confused hum of wheels below and the sedative buzz of an electric fan ahem peabody said dodson blinking i must have fallen asleep i had a most remarkable dream what is it peabody mr williams sir of tracy williams is outside he has come to settle his deal in x y z the market caught him short sir if you remember yes i remember what is x y z quoted at to day peabody one eighty five sir then that s his price excuse me said peabody rather nervously for speaking of it but i ve been talking to williams he s an old friend of yours mr dodson and you practically have a corner in x y z i thought you might that is i thought you might not remember that he sold you the stock at if he settles at the market price it will take every cent he has in the world and his home too to deliver the shares the expression on dodson s face changed in an instant to one of cold ferocity mingled with inexorable cupidity the soul of the man showed itself for a moment like an evil face in the window of a reputable house he will settle at one eighty five said dodson bolivar cannot carry double a blackjack bargainer the most disreputable thing in yancey goree s law office was goree himself sprawled in his creakv old arm chair the rickety little office built of red brick was set flush with the street the main street of the town of bethel bethel rested upon the foot hills of the blue ridge above it the mountains were piled to the sky far below it the turbid catawba gleamed yellow along its disconsolate valley the june day was at its sultriest hour bethel dozed in the tepid shade trade was not it was so still that goree reclining in his chair distinctly heard the clicking of the chips in the grand jury room where the court house gang was playing poker from the open back door of the office a well worn path meandered across the grassy lot to the court house the treading out of that path had cost goree all he ever had first inheritance of a few thousand dollars next the old family home and latterly the last shreds of his self respect and manhood the gang had cleaned him out the broken gambler had turned drunkard and parasite he had lived to see this day come when the men who had stripped him denied him a seat at the game his word was no longer to be taken the daily bouts at cards had arranged itself accordingly and to him was assigned the ignoble part of the onlooker the sheriff the county clerk a sportive deputy a gay attorney and a chalk faced man hailing from the valley sat at table and the sheared one was thus tacitly advised to go and grow more wool soon wearying of his ostracism goree had departed for his office muttering to himself as he unsteadily traversed the unlucky pathway after a drink of corn whiskey from a demijohn under the table he had flung himself into the chair staring in a sort of maudlin apathy out at the mountains immersed in the summer haze the little white patch he saw away up on the side of blackjack was laurel the village near which he had been born and bred there also was the birthplace of the feud between the gorees and the coltranes now no direct heir of the gorees survived except this plucked and singed bird of misfortune to the coltranes also but one male supporter was left colonel abner col trane a man of substance and standing a member of the state legislature and a contemporary with goree s father the feud had been a typical one of the region it had left a red record of hate wrong and slaughter but yancey goree was not thinking of feuds his befuddled brain was hopelessly attacking the problem of the future maintenance of himself and his favourite follies of late old friends of the family had seen to it that he had whereof to eat and a place to sleep but whiskey they would not buy for him and he must have whiskey his law business was extinct no case had been intrusted to him in two years he had been a borrower and a sponge and it seemed that if he fell no lower it would be from lack of opportunity one more chance he was saying to himself if he had one more stake at the game he thought he could win but he had nothing left to sell and his credit was more than exhausted he could not help smiling even in his misery as he thought of the man to whom six months before he had sold the old goree homestead there had come from back yan in the mountains two of the strangest creatures a man named pike garvey and his wife back yan with a wave of the hand toward the hills was understood among the mountaineers to designate the remotest fastnesses the unplumbed gorges the haunts of lawbreakers the wolf s den and the boudoir of the bear in the cabin far up on blackjack s shoulder in the wildest part of these retreats this odd couple had lived for twenty years they had neither dog nor children to mitigate the heavy silence of the hills pike garvey was little known in the settlements but all who had dealt with him pronounced him crazy as a loon he acknowledged no occupation save that of a squirrel hunter but he moonshined occasionally by way of diversion once the revenues had dragged him from his lair fighting silently and desperately like a terrier and he had been sent to state s prison for two years released he popped back into his hole like an angry weasel fortune passing over many anxious wooers made a freakish flight into blackjack s bosky pockets to smile upon pike and his faithful partner one day a party of spectacled knickerbockered and altogether absurd prospectors invaded the vicinity of the garvey s cabin pike lifted his squirrel rifle off the hooks and took a shot at them at long range on the chance of their being revenues happily he missed and the unconscious agents of good luck drew nearer disclosing their innocence of anything resembling law or justice later on they offered the garveys an enormous quantity of ready green crisp money for their thirty acre patch of cleared land mentioning as an excuse for such a mad action some irrelevant and inadequate nonsense about a bed of mica underlying the said property when the garveys became possessed of so many dol lars that they faltered in computing them the deficiencies of life on blackjack began to grow prominent pike began to talk of new shoes a hogshead of tobacco to set in the corner a new lock to his rifle and leading martella to a certain spot on the mountain side he pointed out to her how a small cannon doubtless a thing not beyond the scope of their fortune in price might be planted so as to command and defend the sole accessible trail to the cabin to the confusion of revenues and meddling strangers forever but adam reckoned without his eve these things represented to him the applied power of wealth but there slumbered in his dingy cabin an ambition that soared far above his primitive wants somewhere in mrs garvey s bosom still survived a spot of femininity unstarved by twenty years of blackjack for so long a time the sounds in her ears had been the scaly barks dropping in the woods at noon and the wolves singing among the rocks at night and it was enough to have purged her of vanities she had grown fat and sad and yellow and dull but when the means came she felt a rekindled desire to assume the perquisites of her sex to sit at tea tables to buy futile things to whitewash the hideous veracity of life with a little form and ceremony so she coldly vetoed pike s proposed system of fortifica tions and announced that thev would descend upon the world and gyrate socially and thus at length it was decided and the thing done the village of laurel was their compromise between mrs garvey s preference for one of the large valley towns and pike s hankering for primeval solitudes laurel yielded a halting round of feeble social distractions omportable with martella s ambitions and was not entirely without recommendation to pike its contiguity to the mountains presenting advantages for sudden retreat in case fashionable society should make it advisable their descent upon laurel had been coincident with yancey goree s feverish desire to convert property into cash and they bought the old goree homestead paying four thousand dollars ready money into the spendthrift s shaking hands thus it happened that while the disreputable last of the gorees sprawled in his disreputable office at the end of his row spurned by the cronies whom he had gorged strangers dwelt in the halls of his fathers a cloud of dust was rolling slowly up the parched street with something travelling in the midst of it a little breeze wafted the cloud to one side and a new brightly painted carryall drawn by a slothful gray horse became visible the vehicle deflected from the middle of the street as it neared goree s office and stopped in the gutter directly in front of his door on the front seat sat a gaunt tall man dressed in black broadcloth his rigid hands incarcerated in yellow kid gloves on the back seat was a lady who triumphed over the june heat her stout form was armoured in a skintight silk dress of the description known as change able being a gorgeous combination of shifting hues she sat erect waving a much omamented fan with her eyes fixed stonily far down the street however martella garvey s heart might be rejoicing at the pleasures of her new life blackjack had done his work with her exterior he had carved her countenance to the image of emptiness and inanity had imbued her with the stolidity of his crags and the reserve of his hushed interiors she always seemed to hear whatever her surroundings were the scaly barks falling and pattering down the mountain side she could always hear the awful silence of black jack sounding through the stillest of nights goree watched this solemn equipage as it drove to his door with only faint interest but when the lank driver wrapped the reins about his whip awkwardly descended and stepped into the office he rose unsteadily to receive him recognizing pike garvey the new the transformed the recently civilized the mountaineer took the chair goree offered him they who cast doubts upon garvey s soundness of mind had a strong witness in the man s countenance his face was too long a dull saffron in hue and immobile as a statue s pale blue unwinking round eyes without lashes added to the singularity of his gruesome visage goree was at a loss to account for the visit everything all right at laurel mr garvey he inquired everything all right sir and mighty pleased is missis garvey and me with the property missis garvey likes yo old place and she likes the neighbourhood society is what she lows she wants and she is gettin of it the rogerses the hapgoods the pratts and the troys

squar out with it said goree his racked nerves growing impatient garvey threw his slouch bat upon the table and leaned forward fixing his unblinking eves upon goree s there s a old feud he said distinctly and slowly tween you uns and the coltranes goree frowned ominously to speak of his feud to a feudist is a serious breach of the mountain etiquette the man from back yan knew it as well as the lawyer did na offense he went on but purely in the way of business missis garvey hev studied all about feuds most of the quality folks in the mountains hev em the settles and the goforths the rankins and the boyds the silers and the galloways hev all been cyarin on feuds f om twenty to a hundred year the last man to drap was when yo uncle jedge paisley goree journed co t and shot len

room drew a roll of bills from his pocket and threw them on the table thar s two hundred dollars mr goree what you would call a fa r price for a feud that s been lowed to run down like yourn hev thar s only you left to cyar on yo side of it and you d make mighty po killin i ll take it off yo hands and it ll set me and missis garvey up among the quality thar s the money the little roll of currency on the table slowly untwisted itself writhing and jumping as its folds relaxed in the silence that followed garvey s last speech the rattling of the poker chips in the court house could be plainly heard goree knew that the sheriff had just won a pot for the subdued whoop with which he always greeted a victory floated across the sqquare upon the crinkly heat waves beads of moisture stood on goree s brow stooping he drew the wicker covered demijohn from under the table and filled a tumbler from it a little corn liquor mr garvey of course you are joking about what you spoke of opens quite a new market doesn t it feuds prime two fifty to three feuds slightly damaged two hundred i believe you said mr garvey goree laughed self consciously the mountaineer took the glass goree handed him and drank the whisky without a tremor of the lids of his staring eyes the lawyer applauded the feat by a look of envious admiration he poured his own drink and took it like a drunkard by gulps and with shudders at the smell and taste two hundred repeated garvey thar s the money a sudden passion flared up in goree s brain he struck the table with his fist one of the bills flipped over and touched his hand he flinched as if something had stung him do you come to me he shouted seriously with such a ridiculous insulting darned fool proposition it s fa r and squar said the squirrel hunter but he reached out his hand as if to take back the money and then goree knew that his own flurry of rage had not been from pride or resentment but from anger at himself knowing that he would set foot in the deeper depths that were being opened to him he turned in an instant from an outraged gentleman to an anxious chafferer recom mending his goods don t be in a hurry garvey he said his face crimson and his speech thick i accept your p p proposition though it s dirt cheap at two hundred a t trade s all right when both p purchaser and b buyer are s satisfied shall i w wrap it up for you mr garvey garvey rose and shook out his broadcloth missis garvev will be pleased you air out of it and it stands coltrane and garvey just a scrap ov writin mr goree you bein a lawyer to show we traded goree seized a sheet of paper and a pen the money was clutched in his moist hand everything else sud denly seemed to grow trivial and light bill of sale by all means right title and interest in and to forever warrant and no garvey we ll have to leave out that defend said goree with a loud laugh you ll have to defend this title yourself the mountaineer received the amazing screed that the lawyer handed him folded it with immense labour and laced it carefully in his pocket goree was standing near the window step here said raising his finger and i ll show you

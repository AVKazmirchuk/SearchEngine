i inferred that on such gala occasions carriages were given an extra cleaning i looked up and down the street and perceived that there was little choice among the vehicles for hire that lined the curb i looked in my memorandum book for the address of azalea adair i want to go to jessamine street i said and was about to step into the hack but for an instant the thick long gorilla like arm of the old negro barred me on his massive and saturnine face a look of sudden suspicion and enmity flashed for a moment then with quickly returning conviction he asked blandishingly what are you gwine there for boss what is it to you i asked a little sharply nothin suh jus nothin only it s a lonesome kind of part of town and few folks ever has business out there step right in the seats is clean jes got back from a funeral suh a mile and a half it must have been to our journey s end i could hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving i could smell nothing but the drizzle now further flavored with coal smoke and something like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms all i could see through the streaming windows were two rows of dim houses the city has an area of square miles miles of streets of which miles are paved a system of waterworks that cost with miles of mains eight sixty one jessamine street was a decayed mansion thirty yards back from the street it stood outmerged in a splendid grove of trees and untrimmed shrubbery a row of box bushes overflowed and almost hid the paling fence from sight the gate was kept closed by a rope noose that encircled the gate post and the first paling of the gate but when you got inside you saw that was a shell a shadow a ghost of former grandeur and excellence but in the story i have not yet got inside when the hack had ceased from rattling and the weary quadrupeds came to a rest i handed my jehu his fifty cents with an additional quarter feeling a glow of conscious generosity as i did so he refused it it s two dollars suh he said how s that i asked i plainly heard you call out at the hotel fifty cents to any part of the town it s two dollars suh he repeated obstinately it s a long ways from the hotel it is within the city limits and well within them i argued don t think that you have picked up a greenhorn yankee do you see those hills over there i went on pointing toward the east i could not see them myself for the drizzle well i was born and raised on their other side you old fool nigger can t you tell people from other people when you see em the grim face of king cettiwayo softened is you from the south suh i reckon it was them shoes of yourn fooled me they is somethin sharp in the toes for a southern gen lman to wear then the charge is fifty cents i suppose said i inexorably his former expression a mingling of cupidity and hostility returned remained ten seconds and vanished boss he said fifty cents is right but i needs two dollars suh i m obleeged to have two dollars i ain t demandin it now suh after i know whar you s from i m jus sayin that i has to have two dollars to night and business mighty po peace and confidence settled upon his heavy features he had been luckier than he had hoped instead of having picked up a greenhorn ignorant of rates he had come upon an inheritance you confounded old rascal i said reaching down to my pocket you ought to be turned over to the police for the first time i saw him smile he knew he knew he knew i gave him two one dollar bills as i handed them over i noticed that one of them had seen parlous times its upper right hand corner was missing and it had been torn through the middle but joined again a strip of blue tissue paper pasted over the split preserved its negotiability enough of the african bandit for the present i left him happy lifted the rope and opened a creaky gate the house as i said was a shell a paint brush had not touched it in twenty years i could not see why a strong wind should not have bowled it over like a house of cards until i looked again at the trees that hugged it close the trees that saw the battle of nashville and still drew their protecting branches around it against storm and enemy and cold azalea adair fifty years old white haired a descendant of the cavaliers as thin and frail as the house she lived in robed in the cheapest and cleanest dress i ever saw with an air as simple as a queen s received me the reception room seemed a mile square because there was nothing in it except some rows of books on unpainted white pine bookshelves a cracked marble top table a rag rug a hairless horsehair sofa and two or three chairs yes there was a picture on the wall a colored crayon drawing of a cluster of pansies i looked around for the portrait of andrew jackson and the pinecone hanging basket but they were not there azalea adair and i had conversation a little of which will be repeated to you she was a product of the old south gently nurtured in the sheltered life her

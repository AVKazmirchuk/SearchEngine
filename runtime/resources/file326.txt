an eastern flavour after all we ll get along in new york there is an old old hotel you have seen woodcuts of it in the magazines it was built let s see at a time when there was nothing above fourteenth street except the old indian trail to boston and hammerstein s office soon the old hostelry will be torn down and as the stout walls are riven apart and the bricks go roaring down the chutes crowds of citizens will gather at the nearest corners and weep over the destruction of a dear old landmark civic pride is strongest in new bagdad and the wettest weeper and the loudest howler against the iconoclasts will be the man originally from terre haute whose fond memories of the old hotel are limited to his having been kicked out from its free lunch counter in at this hotel always stopped mrs maggie brown mrs brown was a bony woman of sixty dressed in the rustiest black and carrying a handbag made apparently from the hide of the original animal that adam decided to call an alligator she always occupied a small parlour and bedroom at the top of the hotel at a rental of two dollars per day and always while she was there each day came hurrying to see her many men sharp faced anxious looking with only seconds to spare for maggie brown was said to be the third richest woman in the world and these solicitous gentlemen were only the city s wealthiest brokers and business men seeking trifling loans of half a dozen millions or so from the dingy old lady with the prehistoric handbag the stenographer and typewriter of the acropolis hotel there i ve let the name of it out was miss ida bates she was a hold over from the greek classics there wasn t a flaw in her looks some old timer paying his regards to a lady said to have loved her was a liberal education well even to have looked over the black hair and neat white shirtwaist of miss bates was equal to a full course in any correspondence school in the country she sometimes did a little typewriting for me and as she refused to take the money in advance she came to look upon me as something of a friend and protege she had unfailing kindliness and a good nature and not even a white lead drummer or a fur importer had ever dared to cross the dead line of good behaviour in her presence the entire force of the acropolis from the owner who lived in vienna down to the head porter who had been bedridden for sixteen years would have sprung to her defence in a moment one day i walked past miss bates s little sanctum remingtorium and saw in her place a black haired unit unmistakably a person pounding with each of her forefingers upon the keys musing on the mutability of temporal affairs i passed on the next day i went on a two weeks vacation returning i strolled through the lobby of the acropolis and saw with a little warm glow of auld lang syne miss bates as grecian and kind and flawless as ever just putting the cover on her machine the hour for closing had come but she asked me in to sit for a few minutes on the dictation chair miss bates explained her absence from and return to the acropolis hotel in words identical with or similar to these following well man how are the stories coming pretty regularly said i about equal to their going i m sorry said she good typewriting is the main thing in a story you ve missed me haven t you no one said i whom i have ever known knows as well as you do how to space properly belt buckles semi colons hotel guests and hairpins but you ve been away too i saw a package of peppermint pepsin in your place the other day i was going to tell you all about it said miss bates if you hadn t interrupted me of course you know about maggie brown who stops here well she s worth she lives in jersey in a ten dollar flat she s always got more cash on hand than half a dozen business candidates for vice president i don t know whether she carries it in her stocking or not but i know she s mighty popular down in the part of town where they worship the golden calf well about two weeks ago mrs brown stops at the door and rubbers at me for ten minutes i m sitting with my side to her striking off some manifold copies of a copper mine proposition for a nice old man from tonopah but i always see everything all around me when i m hard at work i can see things through my side combs and i can leave one button unbuttoned in the back of my shirtwaist and see who s behind me i didn t look around because i make from eighteen to twenty dollars a week and i didn t have to that evening at knocking off time she sends for me to come up to her apartment i expected to have to typewrite about two thousand words of notes of hand liens and contracts with a ten cent tip in sight but i went well man i was certainly surprised old maggie brown had turned human child says she you re the most beautiful creature i ever saw in my life i want you to quit your work and come and live with me i ve no kith or kin says she except a husband and a son or two and i hold no communication with any of em they re extravagant burdens on a hard working woman i want you to be a daughter to me they say i m

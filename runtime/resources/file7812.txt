man no larger than yerself with hair the colour of an amber pipe stem they buried him at samarkand i was at the wake sir oh he was a fine built man in his coffin six feet long with black whiskers to his face and i see em throw turnips at the imperor vispacian in africa all over the world i have tramped sir without the body of me findin any rest twas so commanded i saw jerusalem destroyed and pompeii go up in the fireworks and i was at the coronation of charlemagne and the lynchin of joan of arc and everywhere i go there comes storms and revolutions and plagues and fires twas so commanded ye have heard of the wandering jew tis all so except that divil a bit am i a jew but history lies as i have told ye are ye quite sure sir that ye haven t a drop of whiskey convenient ye well know that i have many miles of walking before me i have none said i and if you please i am about to leave for my supper i pushed my chair back creakingly this ancient landlubber was becoming as great an affliction as any cross bowed mariner he shook a musty effluvium from his piebald clothes overturned my inkstand and went on with his insufferable nonsense i wouldn t mind it so much he complained if it wasn t for the work i must do on good fridays ye know about pontius pilate sir of course his body whin he killed himself was pitched into a lake on the alps mountains now listen to the job that tis mine to perform on the night of ivery good friday the ould divil goes down in the pool and drags up pontius and the water is bilin and spewin like a wash pot and the ould divil sets the body on top of a throne on the rocks and thin comes me share of the job oh sir ye would pity me thin ye would pray for the poor wandering jew that niver was a jew if ye could see the horror of the thing that i must do tis i that must fetch a bowl of water and kneel down before it till it washes its hands i declare to ye that pontius pilate a man dead two hundred years dragged up with the lake slime coverin him and fishes wrigglin inside of him widout eyes and in the discomposition of the body sits there sir and washes his hands in the bowl i hold for him on good fridays twas so commanded clearly the matter had progressed far beyond the scope of the bugle s local column there might have been employment here for the alienist or for those who circulate the pledge but i had had enough of it i got up and repeated that i must go at this he seized my coat grovelled upon my desk and burst again into distressful weeping whatever it was about i said to myself that his grief was genuine come now mr ader i said soothingly what is the matter the answer came brokenly through his racking sobs because i would not let the poor christ rest upon the step his hallucination seemed beyond all reasonable answer yet the effect of it upon him scarcely merited disrespect but i knew nothing that might assuage it and i told him once more that both of us should be leaving the office at once obedient at last he raised himself from my dishevelled desk and permitted me to half lift him to the floor the gale of his grief had blown away his words his freshet of tears had soaked away the crust of his grief reminiscence died in him at least the coherent part of it twas me that did it he muttered as i led him toward the door me the shoemaker of jerusalem i got him to the sidewalk and in the augmented light i saw that his face was seared and lined and warped by a sadness almost incredibly the product of a single lifetime and then high up in the firmamental darkness we heard the clamant cries of some great passing birds my wandering jew lifted his hand with side tilted head the seven whistlers he said as one introduces well known friends wild geese said i but i confess that their number is beyond me they follow me everywhere he said twas so commanded what ye hear is the souls of the seven jews that helped with the crucifixion sometimes they re plovers and sometimes geese but ye ll find them always flyin where i go i stood uncertain how to take my leave i looked down the street shuffled my feet looked back again and felt my hair rise the old man had disappeared and then my capillaries relaxed for i dimly saw him footing it away through the darkness but he walked so swiftly and silently and contrary to the gait promised by his age that my composure was not all restored though i knew not why that night i was foolish enough to take down some dust covered volumes from my modest shelves i searched hermippus redivvus and salathiel and the pepys collection in vain and then in a book called the citizen of the world and in one two centuries old i came upon what i desired michob ader had indeed come to paris in the year and related to the turkish spy an extraordinary story he claimed to be the wandering jew and that but here i fell asleep for my editorial duties had not been light that day judge hoover was the bugle s candidate for congress having to confer with him i sought his home early the next morning and we walked together down town through a little street with which i was unfamiliar did you ever hear of michob ader i asked him smiling why yes said the judge and that reminds me of my shoes he has for mending here is his shop now judge hoover stepped into a dingy small shop i looked up at the sign and saw mike o bader boot and shoe maker on it some wild geese passed above honking clearly i scratched my ear and frowned and then trailed into the shop there sat my wandering jew on his shoemaker s bench trimming a half sole he was drabbled with dew grass stained unkempt and miserable and on his face was still the unexplained wretchedness the problematic sorrow the esoteric woe that had been written there by nothing less it seemed than the stylus of the centuries judge hoover inquired kindly concerning his shoes the old shoemaker looked up and spoke sanely enough he had been ill he said for a few days the next day the shoes would be ready he looked at me and i could see that i had no place in his memory so out we went and on our way old mike remarked the candidate has been on one of his sprees he gets crazy drunk regularly once a month but he s a good shoemaker what is his history i inquired whiskey epitomized judge hoover that explains him i was silent but i did not accept the explanation and so when i had the chance i asked old man sellers who browsed daily on my exchanges mike o bader said he was makin shoes in montopolis when i come here goin on fifteen year ago i guess whiskey s his trouble once a month he gets off the track and stays so a week he s got a rigmarole somethin about his bein a jew pedler that he tells ev rybody nobody won t listen to him any more when he s sober he ain t sich a fool he s got a sight of books in the back room of his shop that he reads i guess you can lay all his trouble to whiskey but again i would not not yet was my wandering jew rightly construed for me i trust that women may not be allowed a title to all the curiosity in the world so when montopolis s oldest inhabitant some ninety score years younger than michob ader dropped in to acquire promulgation in print i siphoned his perpetual trickle of reminiscence in the direction of the uninterpreted maker of shoes uncle abner was the complete history of montopolis bound in butternut o bader he quavered come here in he was the first shoemaker in the place folks generally considers him crazy at times now but he don t harm nobody i s pose drinkin upset his mind yes drinkin very likely done it it s a powerful bad thing drinkin i m an old old man sir and i never see no good in drinkin i felt disappointment i was willing to admit drink in the case of my shoemaker but i preferred it as a recourse instead of a cause why had he pitched upon his perpetual strange note of the wandering jew why his unutterable grief during his aberration i could not yet accept whiskey as an explanation did mike o bader ever have a great loss or trouble of any kind i asked lemme see about thirty year ago there was somethin of the kind i recollect montopolis sir in them days used to be a mighty strict place well mike o bader had a daughter then a right pretty girl she was too gay a sort for montopolis so one day she slips off to another town and runs away with a circus it was two years before she comes back all fixed up in fine clothes and rings and jewellery to see mike he wouldn t have nothin to do with her so she stays around town awhile anyway i reckon the men folks wouldn t have raised no objections but the women egged em on to order her to leave town but she had plenty of spunk and told em to mind their own business so one night they decided to run her away a crowd of men and women drove her out of her house and chased her with sticks and stones she run to her father s door callin for help mike opens it and when he sees who it is he hits her with his fist and knocks her down and shuts the door and then the crowd kept on chunkin her till she run clear out of town and the next day they finds her drowned dead in hunter s mill pond i mind it all now that was thirty year ago i leaned back in my non rotary revolving chair and nodded gently like a mandarin at my paste pot when old mike has a spell went on uncle abner tepidly garrulous he thinks he s the wanderin jew he is said i nodding away and uncle abner cackled insinuatingly at the editor s remark for he was expecting at least a stickful in the personal notes of the bugle the duplicity of hargraves when major pendleton talbot of mobile sir and his daughter miss lydia talbot came to washington to reside they selected for a boarding place a house that stood fifty yards back from one of the quietest avenues it was an old fashioned brick building with a portico upheld by tall white pillars the yard was shaded by stately locusts and elms and a catalpa tree in season rained its pink and white blossoms upon the grass rows of high box bushes lined the fence and walks it was the southern style and aspect of the place that pleased the eyes of the talbots in this pleasant private boarding house they engaged rooms including a study for major talbot who was adding the finishing chapters to his book anecdotes and reminiscences of the alabama army bench and bar major talbot was of the old old south the present day had little interest or excellence in his eyes his mind lived in that period before the civil war when the talbots owned thousands of acres of fine cotton land and the slaves to till them when the family mansion was the scene of princely hospitality and drew its guests from the aristocracy of the south out of that period he had brought all its old pride and scruples of honour an antiquated and punctilious politeness and you would think its wardrobe such clothes were surely never made within fifty years the major was tall but whenever he made that wonderful archaic genuflexion he called a bow the corners of his frock coat swept the floor that garment was a surprise even to washington which has long ago ceased to shy at the frocks and broadbrimmed hats of southern congressmen one of the boarders christened it a father hubbard and it certainly was high in the waist and full in the skirt but the major with all his queer clothes his immense area of plaited ravelling shirt bosom and the little black string tie with the bow always slipping on one side both was smiled at and liked in mrs vardeman s select boarding house some of the young department clerks would often string him as they called it getting him started upon the subject dearest to him the traditions and history of his beloved southland during his talks he would quote freely from the anecdotes and reminiscences but they were very careful not to let him see their designs for in spite of his sixty eight years he could make the boldest of them uncomfortable under the steady regard of his piercing gray eyes miss lydia was a plump little old maid of thirty five with smoothly drawn tightly twisted hair that made her look still older old fashioned too she was but ante bellum glory did not radiate from her as it did from the major she possessed a thrifty common sense and it was she who handled the finances of the family and met all comers when there were bills to pay the major regarded board bills and wash bills as contemptible nuisances they kept coming in so persistently and so often why the major wanted to know could they not be filed and paid in a lump sum at some convenient period say when the anecdotes and reminiscences had been published and paid for miss lydia would calmly go on with her sewing and say we ll pay as we go as long as the money lasts and then perhaps they ll have to lump it most of mrs vardeman s boarders were away during the day being nearly all department clerks and business men but there was one of them who was about the house a great deal from morning to night this was a young man named henry hopkins hargraves every one in the house addressed him by his full name who was engaged at one of the popular vaudeville theatres vaudeville has risen to such a respectable plane in the last few years and mr hargraves was such a modest and well mannered person that mrs vardeman could find no objection to enrolling him upon her list of boarders at the theatre hargraves was known as an all round dialect comedian having a large repertoire of german irish swede and black face specialties but mr hargraves was ambitious and often spoke of his great desire to succeed in legitimate comedy this young man appeared to conceive a strong fancy for major talbot whenever that gentleman would begin his southern reminiscences or repeat some of the liveliest of the anecdotes hargraves could always be found the most attentive among his listeners for a time the major showed an inclination to discourage the advances of the play actor as he privately termed him but soon the young man s agreeable manner and indubitable appreciation of the old gentleman s stories completely won him over it was not long before the two were like old chums the major set apart each afternoon to read to him the manuscript of his book during the anecdotes hargraves never failed to laugh at exactly the right point the major was moved to declare to miss lydia one day that young hargraves possessed remarkable perception and a gratifying respect for the old regime and when it came to talking of those old days if major talbot liked to talk mr hargraves was entranced to listen like almost all old people who talk of the past the major loved to linger over details in describing the splendid almost royal days of the old planters he would hesitate until he had recalled the name of the negro who held his horse or the exact date of certain minor happenings or the number of bales of cotton raised in such a year but hargraves never grew impatient or lost interest on the contrary he would advance questions on a variety of subjects connected with the life of that time and he n ever failed to extract ready replies the fox hunts the possum suppers the hoe downs and jubilees in the negro quarters the banquets in the plantation house hall when invitations went for fifty miles around the occasional feuds with the neighbouring gentry the major s duel with rathbone culbertson about kitty chalmers who afterward married a thwaite of south carolina and private yacht races for fabulous sums on mobile bay the quaint beliefs improvident habits and loyal virtues of the old slaves all these were subjects that held both the major and hargraves absorbed for hours at a time sometimes at night when the young man would be coming upstairs to his room after his turn at the theatre was over the major would appear at the door of his study and beckon archly to him going in hargraves would find a little table set with a decanter sugar bowl fruit and a big bunch of fresh green mint it occurred to me the major would begin he was always ceremonious that perhaps you might have found your duties at the at your place of occupation sufficiently arduous to enable you mr hargraves to appreciate what the poet might well have had in his mind when he wrote tired nature s sweet restorer one of our southern juleps it was a fascination to hargraves to watch him make it he took rank among artists when he began and he never varied the process with what delicacy he bruised the mint with what exquisite nicety he estimated the ingredients with what solicitous care he capped the compound with the scarlet fruit glowing against the dark green fringe and then the hospitality and grace with which he offered it after the selected oat straws had been plunged into its tinkling depths after about four months in washington miss lydia discovered one morning that they were almost without money the anecdotes and reminiscences was completed but publishers had not jumped at the collected gems of alabama sense and wit the rental of a small house which they still owned in mobile was two months in arrears their board money for the month would be due in three days miss lydia called her father to a consultation no money said he with a surprised look it is quite annoying to be called on so frequently for these petty sums really i the major searched his pockets he found only a two dollar bill which he returned to his vest pocket i must attend to this at once lydia he said kindly get me my umbrella and i will go down town immediately the congressman from our district general fulghum assured me some days ago that he would use his influence to get my book published at an early date i will go to his hotel at once and see what arrangement has been made with a sad little smile miss lydia watched him button his father hubbard and depart pausing at the door as he always did to bow profoundly that evening at dark he returned it seemed that congressman fulghum had seen the publisher who had the major s manuscript for reading that person had said that if the anecdotes etc were carefully pruned down about one half in order to eliminate the sectional and class prejudice with which the book was dyed from end to end he might consider its publication the major was in a white heat of anger but regained his equanimity according to his code of manners as soon as he was in miss lydia s presence we must have money said miss lydia with a little wrinkle above her nose give me the two dollars and i will telegraph to uncle ralph for some to night the major drew a small envelope from his upper vest pocket and tossed it on the table perhaps it was injudicious he said mildly but the sum was so merely nominal that i bought tickets to the theatre to night it s a new war drama lydia i thought you would be pleased to witness its first production in washington i am told that the south has very fair treatment in the play i confess i should like to see the performance myself miss lydia threw up her hands in silent despair still as the tickets were bought they might as well be used so that evening as they sat in the theatre listening to the lively overture even miss lydia was minded to relegate their troubles for the hour to second place the major in spotless linen with his extraordinary coat showing only where it was closely buttoned and his white hair smoothly roached looked really fine and distinguished the curtain went up on the first act of a magnolia flower revealing a typical southern plantation scen e major talbot betrayed some interest oh see exclaimed miss lydia nudging his arm and pointing to her programme the major put on his glasses and read the line in the cast of characters that her finger indicated col webster calhoun h hopkins hargraves it s our mr hargraves said miss lydia it must be his first appearance in what he calls the legitimate i m so glad for him not until the second act did col webster calhoun appear upon the stage when he made his entry major talbot gave an audible sniff glared at him and seemed to freeze solid miss lydia uttered a little ambiguous squeak and crumpled her programme in her hand for colonel calhoun was made up as nearly resembling major talbot as one pea does another the long thin white hair curly at the ends the aristocratic beak of a nose the crumpled wide ravelling shirt front the string tie with the bow nearly under one ear were almost exactly duplicated and then to clinch the imitation he wore the twin to the major s supposed to be unparalleled coat high collared baggy empire waisted ample skirted hanging a foot lower in front than behind the garment could have been designed from no other pattern from then on the major and miss lydia sat bewitched and saw the counterfeit presentment of a haughty talbot dragged as the major afterward expressed it through the slanderous mire of a corrupt st age mr hargraves had used his opportunities well he had caught the major s little idiosyncrasies of speech accent and intonation and his pompous courtliness to perfection exaggerating all to the purposes of the stage when he performed that marvellous bow that the major fondly imagined to be the pink of all salutations the audience sent forth a sudden round of hearty applause miss lydia sat immovable not daring to glance toward her father sometimes her hand next to him would be laid against her cheek as if to conceal the smile which in spite of her disapproval she could not entirely suppress the culmination of hargraves s audacious imitation took place in the third act the scene is where colonel calhoun entertains a few of the neighbouring planters in his den standing at a table in the centre of the stage with his friends grouped about him he delivers that inimitable rambling character monologue so famous in a magnolia flower at the same time that he deftly makes juleps for the party major talbot sitting quietly but white with indignation heard his best stories retold his pet theories and hobbies advanced and expanded and the dream of the anecdotes and reminiscences served exaggerated and garbled his favourite narrative that of his duel with rathbone culbertson was not omitted and it was delivered with more fire egotism and gusto than the major himself put into it the monologue concluded with a quaint delicious witty little lecture on the art of concocting a julep illustrated by the act here major talbot s delicate but showy science was reproduced to a hair s breadth from his dainty handling of the fragrant weed the one thousandth part of a grain too much pressure gentlemen and you extract the bitterness instead of the aroma of this heaven bestowed plant to his solicitous selection of the oaten straws at the close of the scene the audience raised a tumultuous roar of appreciation the portrayal of the type was so exact so sure and thorough that the leading characters in the play were forgotten after repeated calls hargraves came before the curtain and bowed his rather boyish face bright and flushed with the knowledge of success at last miss lydia turned and looked at the major his thin nostrils were working like the gills of a fish he laid both shaking hands upon the arms of his chair to rise we will go lydia he said chokingly this is an abominable desecration before he could rise she pulled him back into his seat we will stay it out she declared do you want to advertise the copy by exhibiting the original coat so they remained to the end hargraves s success must have kept him up late that night for neither at the breakfast nor at the dinner table did he appear about three in the afternoon he tapped at the door of major talbot s study the major opened it and hargraves walked in with his hands full of the morning papers too full of his triumph to notice anything unusual in the major s demeanour i put it all over em last night major he began exultantly i had my inning and i think scored here s what the post says his conception and portrayal of the old time southern colonel with his absurd grandiloquence his eccentric garb his quaint idioms and phrases his moth eaten pride of family and his really kind heart fastidious sense of honour and lovable simplicity is the best delineation of a character role on the boards to day the coat worn by colonel calhoun is itself nothing less than an evolution of genius mr hargraves has captured his public how does that sound major for a first nighter i had the honour the major s voice sounded ominously frigid of witnessing your very remarkable performance sir last night hargraves looked disconcerted you were there i didn t know you ever i didn t know you cared for the theatre oh i say major talbot he exclaimed frankly don t you be offended i admit i did get a lot of pointers from you that helped me out wonderfully in the part but it s a type you know not individual the way the audience caught on shows that half the patrons of that theatre are southerners they recognized it mr hargraves said the major who had remained standing you have put upon me an unpardonable insult you have burlesqued my person grossly betrayed my confidence and misused my hospitality if i thought you possessed the faintest conception of what is the sign manual of a gentleman or what is due one i would call you out sir old as i am i will ask you to leave the room sir the actor appeared to be slightly bewildered and seemed hardly to take in the full meaning of the old gentleman s words i am truly sorry you took offence he said regretfully up here we don t look at things just as you people do i know men who would buy out half the house to have their personality put on the stage so the public would recognize it they are not from alabama sir said the major haughtily perhaps not i have a pretty good memory major let me quote a few lines from your book in response to a toast at a banquet given in milledgeville i believe you uttered and intend to have printed these words the northern man is utterly without sentiment or warmth except in so far as the feelings may be turned to his own commercial profit he will suffer without resentment any imputation cast upon the honour of himself or his loved ones that does not bear with it the consequence of pecuniary loss in his charity he gives with a liberal hand but it must be heralded with the trumpet and chronicled in brass do you think that picture is fairer than the one you saw of colonel calhoun last night the description said the major frowning is not without grounds some exag latitude must be allowed in public speaking and in public acting replied hargraves that is not the point persisted the major unrelenting it was a personal caricature i positively decline to overlook it sir major talbot said hargraves with a winning smile i wish you would understand me i want you to know that i never dreamed of insulting you in my profession all life belongs to me i take what i want and what i can and return it over the footlights now if you will let s let it go at that i came in to see you about something else we ve been pretty good friends for some months and i m going to take the risk of offending you again i know you are hard up for money never mind how i found out a boarding house is no place to keep such matters secret and i want you to let me help you out of the pinch i ve been there often enough myself i ve been getting a fair salary all the season and i ve saved some money you re welcome to a couple hundred or even more until you get stop commanded the major with his arm outstretched it seems that my book didn t lie after all you think your money salve will heal all the hurts of honour under no circumstances would i accept a loan from a casual acquaintance and as to you sir i would starve before i would consider your insulting offer of a financial adjustment of the circumstances we have discussed i beg to repeat my request relative to your quitting the apartment hargraves took his departure without another word he also left the house the same day moving as mrs vardeman explained at the supper table nearer the vicinity of the down town theatre where a magnolia flower was booked for a week s run critical was the situation with major talbot and miss lydia there was no one in washington to whom the major s scruples allowed him to apply for a loan miss lydia wrote a letter to uncle ralph but it was doubtful whether that relative s constricted affairs would permit him to furnish help the major was forced to make an apologetic address to mrs vardeman regarding the delayed payment for board referring to delinquent rentals and delayed remittances in a rather confused strain deliverance came from an entirely unexpected source late one afternoon the door maid came up and announced an old coloured man who wanted to see major talbot the major asked that he be sent up to his study soon an old darkey appeared in the doorway with his hat in hand bowing and scraping with one clumsy foot he was quite decently dressed in a baggy suit of black his big coarse shoes shone with a metallic lustre suggestive of stove polish his bushy wool was gray almost white after middle life it is difficult to estimate the age of a negro this one might have seen as many years as had major talbot i be bound you don t know me mars pendleton were his first words the major rose and came forward at the old familiar style of address it was one of the old plantation darkeys without a doubt but they had been widely scattered and he could not recall the voice or face i don t believe i do he said kindly unless you will assist my memory don t you member cindy s mose mars pendleton what migrated mediately after de war wait a moment said the major rubbing his forehead with the tips of his fingers he loved to recall everything connected with those beloved days cindy s mose he reflected you worked among the horses breaking the colts yes i remember now after the surrender you took the name of don t prompt me mitchell and went to the west to nebraska yassir yassir the old man s face stretched with a delighted grin dat s him dat s it newbraska dat s me mose mitchell old uncle mose mitchell dey

remember you uncle mose at that age and as you say i m plum growed up and was a blessed long time ago but i m glad to see you even if i can t remember you and she was and so was the major something alive and tangible had come to link them with the happy past the three sat and talked over the olden times the major and uncle mose correcting or prompting each other as they reviewed the plantation scenes and days the major inquired what the old man was doing so far from his home uncle mose am a delicate he explained to de grand baptis convention in dis city i never preached none but bein a residin elder in de church and able fur to pay my own expenses dey sent me along and how did you know we were in washington inquired miss lydia dey s a cullud man works in de hotel whar i stops what

laid his other upon his shoulder dear faithful old servitor he said in an unsteady voice i don t mind saying to you that mars pendleton spent his last dollar in the world a week ago we will accept this money uncle mose since in a way it is a sort of payment as well as a token of the loyalty and devotion of the old regime lydia my dear take the money you are better fitted than i to manage its expenditure take it honey said uncle mose hit belongs to you hit s talbot money after uncle mose had gone miss lydia had a good cry for joy and the major turned his face to a corner and smoked his clay pipe volcanically the succeeding days saw the talbots restored to peace and ease miss lydia s face lost its worried look the major appeared in a new frock coat in which he looked like a wax figure personifying the memory of his golden age another publisher who read the manuscript of the anecdotes and reminiscences thought that with a little retouching and toning down of the high lights he could make a really bright and salable volume of it altogether the situation was comfortable and not without the touch of hope that is often sweeter than arrived blessings one day about a week after their piece of good luck a maid brought a letter for miss lydia to her room the postmark showed that it was from new york not knowing any one there miss lydia in a mild flutter of wonder sat down by her table and opened the letter with her scissors this was what she read dear miss talbot i thought you might be glad to learn of my good fortune i have received and accepted an offer of two hundred dollars per week by a new york stock company to play colonel calhoun in a magnolia flower there is something else i wanted you to know i guess you d better not tell major talbot i was anxious to make him some amends for the great help he was to me in studying the part and for the bad humour he was in about it he refused to let me so i did it anyhow i could easily spare the three hundred sincerely yours h hopkins hargraves p s how did i play uncle mose major talbot passing through the hall saw miss lydia s door open and stopped any mail for us this morning lydia dear he asked miss lydia slid the letter beneath a fold of her dress the mobile chronicle came she said promptly it s on the table in your study let me feel your pulse so i went to a doctor how long has it been since you took any alcohol into your system he asked turning my head sidewise i answered oh quite awhile he was a young doctor somewhere between twenty and forty he wore heliotrope socks but he looked like napoleon i liked him immensely now said he i am going to show you the effect of alcohol upon your circulation i think it was circulation he said though it may have been advertising he bared my left arm to the elbow brought out a bottle of whiskey and gave me a drink he began to look more like napoleon i began to like him better then he put a tight compress on my upper arm stopped my pulse with his fingers and squeezed a rubber bulb connected with an apparatus on a stand that looked like a thermometer the mercury jumped up and down without seeming to stop anywhere but the doctor said it registered two hundred and thirty seven or one hundred and sixty five or some such number now said he you see what alcohol does to the blood pressure it s marvellous said i but do you think it a sufficient test have one on me and let s try the other arm but no then he grasped my hand i thought i was doomed and he was saying good bye but all he wanted to do was to jab a needle into the end of a finger and compare the red drop with a lot of fifty cent poker chips that he had fastened to a card it s the haemoglobin test he explained the colour of your blood is wrong well said i i know it should be blue but this is a country of mix ups some of my ancestors were cavaliers but they got thick with some people on nantucket island so i mean said the doctor that the shade of red is too light oh said i it s a case of matching instead of matches the doctor then pounded me severely in the region of the chest when he did that i don t know whether he reminded me most of napoleon or battling or lord nelson then he looked grave and mentioned a string of grievances that the flesh is heir to mostly ending in itis i immediately paid him fifteen dollars on account is or are it or some or any of them necessarily fatal i asked i thought my connection with the matter justified my manifesting a certain amount of interest all of them he answered cheerfully but their progress may be arrested with care and proper continuous treatment you may live to be eighty five or ninety i began to think of the doctor s bill eighty five would be sufficient i am sure was my comment i paid him ten dollars more on account the first thing to do he said with renewed animation is to find a sanitarium where you will get a complete rest for a while and allow your nerves to get into a better condition i myself will go with you and select a suitable one so he took me to a mad house in the catskills it was on a bare mountain frequented only by infrequent frequenters you could see nothing but stones and boulders some patches of snow and scattered pine trees the young physician in charge was most agreeable he gave me a stimulant without applying a compress to the arm it was luncheon time and we were invited to partake there were about twenty inmates at little tables in the dining room the young physician in charge came to our table and said it is a custom with our guests not to regard themselves as patients hut merely as tired ladies and gentlemen taking a rest whatever slight maladies they may have are never alluded to in conversation my doctor called loudly to a waitress to bring some phosphoglycerate of lime hash dog bread bromo seltzer pancakes and nux vomica tea for my repast then a sound arose like a sudden wind storm among pine trees it was produced by every guest in the room whispering loudly neurasthenia except one man with a nose whom i distinctly heard say chronic alcoholism i hope to meet him again the physician in charge turned and walked away an hour or so after luncheon he conducted us to the workshop say fifty yards from the house thither the guests had been conducted by the physician in charge s understudy and sponge holder a man with feet and a blue sweater he was so tall that i was not sure he had a face hut the armour packing company would have been delighted with his hands here said the physician in charge our guests find relaxation from past mental worries by devoting themselves to physical labour recreation in reality there were turning lathes carpenters outfits clay modelling tools spinning wheels weaving frames treadmills bass drums enlarged crayon portrait apparatuses blacksmith forges and everything seemingly that could interest the paying lunatic guests of a first rate sanitarium the lady making mud pies in the corner whispered the physician in charge is no other than lula lulington the authoress of the novel entitled why love loves what she is doing now is simply to rest her mind after performing that piece of work i had seen the book why doesn t she do it by writing another one instead i asked as you see i wasn t as far gone as they thought i was the gentleman pouring water through the funnel continued the physician in charge is a wall street broker broken down from overwork i buttoned my coat others he pointed out were architects playing with noah s arks ministers reading darwin s theory of evolution lawyers sawing wood tired out society ladies talking ibsen to the blue sweatered sponge holder a neurotic millionaire lying asleep on the floor and a prominent artist drawing a little red wagon around the room you look pretty strong said the physician in charge to me i think the best mental relaxation for you would be throwing small boulders over the mountainside and then bringing them up again i was a hundred yards away before my doctor overtook me what s the matter he asked the matter is said i that there are no aeroplanes handy so i am going to merrily and hastily jog the foot pathway to yon station and catch the first unlimited soft coal express back to town well said the doctor perhaps you are right this seems hardly the suitable place for you but what you need is rest absolute rest and exercise that night i went to a hotel in the city and said to the clerk what i need is absolute rest and exercise can you give me a room with one of those tall folding beds in it and a relay of bellboys to work it up and down while i rest the clerk rubbed a speck off one of his finger nails and glanced sidewise at a tall man in a white hat sitting in the lobby that man came over and asked me politely if i had seen the shrubbery at the west entrance i had not so he showed it to me and then looked me over i thought you had em he said not unkindly but i guess you re all right you d better go see a doctor old man a week afterward my doctor tested my blood pressure again without the preliminary stimulant he looked to me a little less like napoleon and his socks were of a shade of tan that did not appeal to me what you need he decided is sea air and companionship would a mermaid i began but he slipped on his professional manner i myself he said will take you to the hotel bonair off the coast of long island and see that you get in good shape it is a quiet comfortable resort where you will soon recuperate the hotel bonair proved to be a nine hundred room fashionable hostelry on an island off the main shore everybody who did not dress for dinner was shoved into a side dining room and given only a terrapin and champagne table d hote the bay was a great stamping ground for wealthy yachtsmen the corsair anchored there the day we arrived i saw mr morgan standing on deck eating a cheese sandwich and gazing longingly at the hotel still it was a very inexpensive place nobody could afford to pay their p rices when you went away you simply left your baggage stole a skiff and beat it for the mainland in the night when i had been there one day i got a pad of monogrammed telegraph blanks at the clerk s desk and began to wire to all my friends for get away money my doctor and i played one game of croquet on the golf links and went to sleep on the lawn when we got back to town a thought seemed to occur to him suddenly by the way he asked how do you feel relieved of very much i replied now a consulting physician is different he isn t exactly sure whether he is to be paid or not and this uncertainty insures you either the most careful or the most careless attention my doctor took me to see a consulting physician he made a poor guess and gave me careful attention i liked him immensely he put me through some coordination exercises have you a pain in the back of your head he asked i told him i had not shut your eyes he ordered put your feet close together and jump backward as far as you can i always was a good backward jumper with my eyes shut so i obeyed my head struck the edge of the bathroom door which had been left open and was only three feet away the doctor was very sorry he had overlooked the fact that the door was open he closed it now touch your nose with your right forefinger he said where is it i asked on your face said he i mean my right forefinger i explained oh excuse me said he he reopened the bathroom door and i took my finger out of the crack of it after i had performed the marvellous digito nasal feat i said i do not wish to deceive you as to symptoms doctor i really have something like a pain in the back of my head he ignored the symptom and examined my heart carefully with a latest popular air penny in the slot ear trumpet i felt like a ballad now he said gallop like a horse for about five minutes around the room i gave the best imitation i could of a disqualified percheron being led out of madison square garden then without dropping in a penny he listened to my chest again no glanders in our family doc i said the consulting physician held up his forefinger within three inches of my nose look at my finger he commanded did you ever try pears i began but he went on with his test rapidly now look across the bay at my finger across the bay at my finger at my finger across the bay across the bay at my finger across the bay this for about three minutes he explained that this was a test of the action of the brain it seemed easy to me i never once mistook his finger for the bay i ll bet that if he had used the phrases gaze as it were unpreoccupied outward or rather laterally in the direction of the horizon underlaid so to speak with the adjacent fluid inlet and now returning or rather in a manner withdrawing your attention bestow it upon my upraised digit i ll bet i say that henry james himself could have passed the exami nation after asking me if i had ever had a grand uncle with curvature of the spine or a cousin with swelled ankles the two doctors retired to the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bath tub for their consultation i ate an apple and gazed first at my finger and then across the bay the doctors came out looking grave more they looked tombstones and tennessee papers please copy they wrote out a diet list to which i was to be restricted it had everything that i had ever heard of to eat on it except snails and i never eat a snail unless it overtakes me and bites me first you must follow this diet strictly said the doctors i d follow it a mile if i could get one tenth of what s on it i answered of next importance they went on is outdoor air and exercise and here is a prescription that will be of great benefit to you then all of us took something they took their hats and i took my departure i went to a druggist and showed him the prescription it will be for an ounce bottle he said will you give me a piece of your wrapping cord said i i made a hole in the prescription ran the cord through it tied it around my neck and tucked it inside all of us have a little superstition and mine runs to a confidence in amulets of course there was nothing the matter with me but i was very ill i couldn t work sleep eat or bowl the only way i could get any sympathy was to go without shaving for four days even then somebody would say old man you look as hardy as a pine knot been up for a jaunt in the maine woods eh then suddenly i remembered that i must have outdoor air and exercise so i went down south to john s john is an approximate relative by verdict of a preacher standing with a little book in his hands in a bower of chrysanthemums while a hundred thousand people looked on john has a country house seven miles from pineville it is at an altitude and on the blue ridge mountains in a state too dignified to be dragged into this controversy john is mica which is more valuable and clearer than gold he met me at pineville and we took the trolley car to his home it is a big neighbourless cottage on a hill surrounded by a hundred mountains we got off at his little private station where john s family and amaryllis met and greeted us amaryllis looked at me a trifle anxiously a rabbit came bounding across the hill between us and the house i threw down my suit case and pursued it hotfoot after i had run twenty yards and seen it disappear i sat down on the grass and wept disconsolately i can t catch a rabbit any more i sobbed i m of no further use in the world i may as well be dead oh what is it what is it brother john i heard amaryllis say nerves a little unstrung said john in his calm way don t worry get up you rabbit chaser and come on to the house before the biscuits get cold it was about twilight and the mountains came up nobly to miss murfree s descriptions of them soon after dinner i announced that i believed i could sleep for a year or two including legal holidays so i was shown to a room as big and cool as a flower garden where there was a bed as broad as a lawn soon afterward the remainder of the household retired and then there fell upon the land a silence i had not heard a silence before in years it was absolute i raised myself on my elbow and listened to it sleep i thought that if i only could hear a star twinkle or a blade of grass sharpen itself i could compose myself to rest i thought once that i heard a sound like the sail of a catboat flapping as it veered about in a breeze but i decided that it was probably only a tack in the carpet still i listened suddenly some belated little bird alighted upon the window sill and in what he no doubt considered sleepy tones enunciated the noise generally translated as cheep i leaped into the air hey what s the matter down there called john from his room above mine oh nothing i answered except that i accidentally bumped my head against the ceiling the next morning i went out on the porch and looked at the mountains there were forty seven of them in sight i shuddered went into the big hall sitting room of the house selected pancoast s family practice of medicine from a bookcase and began to read john came in took the book away from me and led me outside he has a farm of three hundred acres furnished with the usual complement of barns mules peasantry and harrows with three front teeth broken off i had seen such things in my childhood and my heart began to sink then john spoke of alfalfa and i brightened at once oh yes said i wasn t she in the chorus of let s see green you know said john and tender and you plow it under after the first season i know said i and the grass grows over her right said john you know something about farming after all i know something of some farmers said i and a sure scythe will mow them down some day on the way back to the house a beautiful and inexplicable creature walked across our path i stopped irresistibly fascinated gazing at it john waited patiently smoking his cigarette he is a modern farmer after ten minutes he said are you going to stand there looking at that chicken all day breakfast is nearly ready a chicken said i a white orpington hen if you want to particularize a white orpington hen i repeated with intense interest the fowl walked slowly away with graceful dignity and i followed like a child after the pied piper five minutes more were allowed me by john and then he took me by the sleeve and conducted me to breakfast after i had been there a week i began to grow alarmed i was sleeping and eating well and actually beginning to enjoy life for a man in my desperate condition that would never do so i sneaked down to the trolley car station took the car for pineville and went to see one of the best physicians in town by this time i knew exactly what to do when i needed medical treatment i hung my hat on the back of a chair and said rapidly doctor i have cirrhosis of the heart indurated arteries neurasthenia neuritis acute indigestion and convalescence i am going to live on a strict diet i shall also take a tepid bath at night and a cold one in the morning i shall endeavour to be cheerful and fix my mind on pleasant subjects in

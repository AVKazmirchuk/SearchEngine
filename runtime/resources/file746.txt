would not personally serve behind the counter with the nearly three hundred dollars i have remaining i can manage the building of a house by giving a lien on the lot i have an old friend in atlanta who is a partner in a large book store and he has agreed to furnish me with a stock of goods on credit on extremely easy terms i am pleased to hope sir that mrs blaylock s health and happiness will be increased by the change of locality already i fancy i can perceive the return of those roses that were once the hope and despair of georgia cavaliers again followed that wonderful bow as the colonel lightly touched the pale cheek of the poetess mrs blaylock blushing like a girl shook her curl and gave the colonel an arch reproving tap secret of eternal youth where art thou every second the answer comes here here here listen to thine own heartbeats weary seeker after external miracles those years said mrs blaylock in holly springs were long long long but now is the promised land in sight skyland a lovely name doubtless said the colonel we shall be able to secure comfortable accommodations at some modest hotel at reasonable rates our trunks are in okochee to be forwarded when we shall have made permanent arrangements j pinkney bloom excused himself went forward and stood by the captain at the wheel mac said he do you remember my telling you once that i sold one of those five hundred dollar lots in skyland seems i do grinned captain macfarland i m not a coward as a general rule went on the promoter but i always said that if i ever met the sucker that bought that lot i d run like a turkey now you see that old babe in the wood over there well he s the boy that drew the prize that was the only five hundred dollar lot that went the rest ranged from ten dollars to two hundred his wife writes poetry she s invented one about the high grounds of georgia that s way up in g they re going to skyland to open a book store well said macfarland with another grin it s a good thing you are along j p you can show em around town until they begin to feel at home he s got three hundred dollars left to build a house and store with went on j pinkney as if he were talking to himself and he thinks there s an open house up there captain macfarland released the wheel long enough to give his leg a roguish slap you old fat rascal he chuckled with a wink mac you re a fool said j pinkney bloom coldly he went back and joined the blaylocks where he sat less talkative with that straight furrow between his brows that always stood as a signal of schemes being shaped within there s a good many swindles connected with these booms he said presently what if this skyland should turn out to be one that is suppose business should be sort of dull there and no special sale for books my dear sir said colonel blaylock resting his hand upon the back of his wife s chair three times i have been reduced to almost penury by the duplicity of others but i have not yet lost faith in humanity if i have been deceived again still we may glean health and content if not worldly profit i am aware that there are dishonest schemers in the world who set traps for the unwary but even they are not altogether bad my dear can you recall those verses entitled he giveth the increase that you composed for the choir of our church in holly springs that was four years ago said mrs blaylock perhans i can repeat a verse or two the lily springs from the rotting mould pearls from the deep sea slime good will come out of nazareth all in god s own time to the hardest heart the softening grace cometh at last to bless guiding it right to help and cheer and succor in distress i cannot remember the rest the lines were not ambitious they were written to the music composed by a dear friend it s a fine rhyme just the same declared mr bloom it seems to ring the bell all right i guess i gather the sense of it it means that the rankest kind of a phony will give you the best end of it once in a while mr bloom strayed thoughtfully back to the captain and stood meditating ought to be in sight of the spires and gilded domes of skyland now in a few minutes chirruped macfarland shaking with enjoyment go to the devil said mr bloom still pensive and now upon the left bank they caught a glimpse of a white village high up on the hills smothered among green trees that was cold branch no boom town but the slow growth of many years cold branch lay on the edge of the grape and corn lands the big country road ran just back of the heights cold branch had nothing in common with the frisky ambition of okochee with its impertinent lake mac said j pinkney suddenly i want you to stop at cold branch there s a landing there that they made to use sometimes when the river was up can t said the captain grinning more broadly i ve got the united states mails on board right to day this boat s in the government service do you want to have the poor old captain keelhauled by uncle sam and the great city of skyland all disconsolate waiting for its mail i m ashamed of your extravagance j p mac almost whispered j pinkney in his danger line voice i looked into the engine room of the dixie

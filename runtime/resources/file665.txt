pay her millinery bills and fix the furnace and have her do away with the sewell part of her name forever those who could stay only a week or two went away hinting at pistols and blighted hearts but compton stayed like the mountains themselves for he could afford it and gaines stayed because he was a fighter and wasn t afraid of millionaire s sons and well he adored the country what do you think miss mary he said once i knew a duffer in new york who claimed to like it in the summer time said you could keep cooler there than you could in the woods wasn t he an awful silly i don t think i could breathe on broadway after the st of june mamma was thinking of going back week after next said miss mary with a lovely frown but when you think of it said gaines there are lots of jolly places in town in the summer the roof gardens you know and the er the roof gardens deepest blue was the lake that day the day when they had the mock tournament and the men rode clumsy farm horses around in a glade in the woods and caught curtain rings on the end of a lance such fun cool and dry as the finest wine came the breath of the shadowed forest the valley below was a vision seen through an opal haze a white mist from hidden falls blurred the green of a hand s breadth of tree tops half way down the gorge youth made merry hand in hand with young summer nothing on broadway like that the villagers gathered to see the city folks pursue their mad drollery the woods rang with the laughter of pixies and naiads and sprites gaines caught most of the rings his was the privilege to crown the queen of the tournament he was the conquering knight as far as the rings went on his arm he wore a white scarf compton wore light blue she had declared her preference for blue but she wore white that day gaines looked about for the queen to crown her he heard her merry laugh as if from the clouds she had slipped away and climbed chimney rock a little granite bluff and stood there a white fairy among

was youth in it cross reader and light hearts and something else that miss clay writes so charmingly about gaines gave a great tug at the root of a laurel and pulled himself to miss mary s feet on his arm he carried the wreath of roses and while the villagers and summer boarders screamed and applauded below he placed it on the queen s brow you are a gallant knight said miss mary if i could be your true knight always began gaines but miss mary laughed him dumb for compton scrambled over the edge of the rock one minute behind time what a twilight that was when they drove back to the hotel the opal of the valley turned slowly to purple the dark woods framed the lake as a mirror the tonic air stirred the very soul in one the first pale stars came out over the mountain tops where yet a faint glow of i beg your pardon mr gaines said adkins the man who believed new york to be the finest summer resort in the world opened his eyes and kicked over the mucilage bottle on his desk i i believe i was asleep he said it s the heat said adkins it s something awful in the city these nonsense said the other the city beats the country ten to one in summer fools go out tramping in muddy brooks and wear themselves out trying to catch little fish as long as your finger stay in town and keep comfortable that s my idea some letters just came said adkins i thought you might like to glance at them before you go let us look over his shoulder and read just a few lines of one of them my dear dear husband just received your letter ordering us to stay another month rita s cough is almost gone johnny has simply gone wild like a little indian will be the making of both children work so hard and i know that your business can hardly afford to keep us here so long best man that ever you always pretend that you like the city in summer trout fishing that you used to be so fond of and all to keep us well and happy come to you if it were not doing the babies so much good i stood last evening on chimney rock in exactly the same spot where i was when you put the wreath of roses on my head through all the world when you said you would be my true knight fifteen years ago dear just think have always been that to me ever and ever mary the man who said he thought new york the finest summer resort in the country dropped into a cafe on his way home and had a glass of beer under an electric fan wonder what kind of a fly old harding used he said to himself the last leaf in a little district west of washington square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called places these

three pounds of steak good morning the next morning i was back on time well mr riddle says i when he opened the bedroom door and how is uncle this morning he seems much better says the young man the mayor s color and pulse was fine i gave him another treatment and he said the last of the pain left him now says i you d better stay in bed for a day or two and you ll be all right it s a good thing i happened to be in fisher hill mr mayor says i for all the remedies in the cornucopia that the regular schools of medicine use couldn t have saved you and now that error has flew and pain proved a perjurer let s allude to a cheerfuller subject say the fee of no checks please i hate to write my name on the back of a check almost as bad as i do on the front i ve got the cash here says the mayor pulling a pocket book from under his pillow he counts out five fifty dollar notes and holds em in his hand bring the receipt he says to biddle i signed the receipt and the mayor handed me the money i put it in my inside pocket careful now do your duty officer says the mayor grinning much unlike a sick man mr biddle lays his hand on my arm you re under arrest dr waugh hoo alias peters says he for practising medicine without authority under the state law who are you i asks i ll tell you who he is says mr mayor sitting up in bed he s a detective employed by the state medical society he s been following you over five counties he came to me yesterday and we fixed up this scheme to catch you i guess you won t do any more doctoring around these parts mr fakir what was it you said i had doc the mayor laughs compound well it wasn t softening of the brain i guess anyway a detective says i correct says biddle i ll have to turn you over to the sheriff let s see you do it says i and i grabs biddle by the throat and half throws him out the window but he pulls a gun and sticks it under my chin and i stand still then he puts handcuffs on me and takes the money out of my pocket i witness says he that they re the same bank bills that you and i marked judge banks i ll turn them over to the sheriff when we get to his office and he ll send you a receipt they ll have to be used as evidence in the case all right mr biddle says the mayor and now doc waugh hoo he goes on why don t you demonstrate can t you pull the cork out of your magnetism with your teeth and hocus pocus them handcuffs off come on officer says i dignified i may as well make the best of it and then i turns to old banks and rattles my chains mr mayor says i the time will come soon when you ll believe that personal magnetism is a success and you ll be sure that it succeeded in this case too and i guess it did when we got nearly to the gate i says we might meet somebody now andy i reckon you better take em off and hey why of course it was andy tucker that was his scheme and that s how we got the capital to go into business together modern rural sports jeff peters must be reminded whenever he is called upon pointedly for a story he will maintain that his life has been as devoid of incident as the longest of trollope s novels but lured he will divulge therefore i cast many and divers flies upon the current of his thoughts before i feel a nibble i notice said i that the western farmers in spite of their prosperity are running after their old populistic idols again it s the running season said jeff for farmers shad maple trees and the connemaugh river i know something about farmers i thought i struck one once that had got out of the rut but andy tucker proved to me i was mistaken once a farmer always a sucker said andy he s the man that s shoved into the front row among bullets ballots and the ballet he s the funny bone and gristle of the country said andy and i don t know who we would do without him one morning me and andy wakes up with sixty eight cents between us in a yellow pine hotel on the edge of the pre digested hoe cake belt of southern indiana how we got off the train there the night before i can t tell you for she went through the village so fast that what looked like a saloon to us through the car window turned out to be a composite view of a drug store and a water tank two blocks apart why we got off at the first station we could belongs to a little oroide gold watch and alaska diamond deal we failed to pull off the day before over the kentucky line when i woke up i heard roosters crowing and smelt something like the fumes of nitro muriatic acid and heard something heavy fall on the floor below us and a man swearing cheer up andy says i we re in a rural community somebody has just tested a gold brick downstairs we ll go out and get what s coming to us from a farmer and then yoicks and away farmers was always a kind of reserve fund to me whenever i was in hard luck i d go to the crossroads hook a finger in a farmer s suspender recite the prospectus of my swindle in a mechanical kind of a way look over what he had give him back his keys whetstone and papers that was of no value except to owner and stroll away without asking any questions farmers are not fair game to me as high up in our business as me and andy was but there was times when we found em useful just as wall street does the secretary of the treasury now and then when we went down stairs we saw we was in the midst of the finest farming section we ever see about two miles away on a hill was a big white house in a grove surrounded by a wide spread agricultural agglomeration of fields and barns and pastures and out houses whose house is that we asked the landlord that says he is the domicile and the arboreal terrestrial and horticultural accessories of farmer ezra plunkett one of our county s most progressive citizens after breakfast me and andy with eight cents capital left casts the horoscope of the rural potentate let me go alone says i two of us against one farmer would look as one sided as roosevelt using both hands to kill a grizzly all right says andy i like to be a true sport even when i m only collecting rebates from the rutabag raisers what bait are you going to use for this ezra thing andy asks me oh i says the first thing that come to hand in the suit case i reckon i ll take along some of the new income tax receipts and the recipe for making clover honey out of clabber and apple peelings and the order blanks for the mcguffey s readers which afterwards turn out to be mccormick s reapers and the pearl necklace found on the train and a pocket size goldbrick and a that ll be enough says andy any one of the lot ought to land on ezra and say jeff make that succotash fancier give you nice clean new bills it s a disgrace to our department of agriculture civil service and pure food law the kind of stuff some of these farmers hand out to use i ve had to take rolls from em that looked like bundles of microbe cultures captured out of a red cross ambulance so i goes to a livery stable and hires a buggy on my looks i drove out to the plunkett farm and hitched there was a man sitting on the front steps of the house he had on a white flannel suit a diamond ring golf cap and a pink ascot tie summer boarder says i to myself i d like to see farmer ezra plunkett says i to him you see him says he what seems to be on your mind i never answered a word i stood still repeating to myself the rollicking lines of that merry jingle the man with the hoe when i looked at this farmer the little devices i had in my pocket for buncoing the pushed back brows seemed as hopeless as trying to shake down the beef trust with a mittimus and a parlor rifle well says he looking at me close speak up i see the left pocket of your coat sags a good deal out with the goldbrick first i m rather more interested in the bricks than i am in the trick sixty day notes and the lost silver mine story i had a kind of cerebral sensation of foolishness in my ideas of ratiocination but i pulled out the little brick and unwrapped my handkerchief off it one dollar and eighty cents says the farmer hefting it in his hand is it a trade the lead in it is worth more than that says i dignified i put it back in my pocket all right says he but i sort of wanted it for the collection i m starting i got a one last week for just then a telephone bell rings in the house come in bunk says the farmer and look at my place it s kind of lonesome here sometimes i think that s new york calling we went inside the room looked like a broadway stockbroker s light oak desks two phones spanish leather upholstered chairs and couches oil paintings in gilt frames a foot deep and a ticker hitting off the news in one corner hello hello says this funny farmer is that the regent theatre yes this is plunkett of woodbine centre reserve four orchestra seats for friday evening my usual ones yes friday good bye i run over to new york every two weeks to see a show says the farmer hanging up the receiver i catch the eighteen hour flyer at indianapolis spend ten hours in the heyday of night on the yappian way and get home in time to see the chickens go to roost forty eight hours later oh the pristine hubbard squasherino of the cave dwelling period is getting geared up some for the annual meeting of the don t blow out the gas association don t you think mr bunk i seem to perceive says i a kind of hiatus in the agrarian traditions in which heretofore i have reposed confidence sure bunk says he the yellow primrose on the river s brim is getting to look to us reubs like a holiday edition de luxe of the language of flowers with deckle edges and frontispiece just then the telephone calls him again hello hello says he oh that s perkins at milldale i told you was too much for that horse have you got him there good let me see him get away from the transmitter now make him trot in a circle faster yes i can hear him keep on faster yet that ll do now lead him up to the phone closer get his nose nearer there now wait no i don t want that horse what no not at any price he interferes and he s windbroken goodbye now bunk says the farmer do you begin to realize that agriculture has had a hair cut you belong in a bygone era why tom lawson himself knows better than to try to catch an up to date agriculturalist napping it s saturday the fourteenth on the farm you bet now look here and see how we keep up with the day s doings he shows me a machine on a table with two things for your ears like the penny in the slot affairs i puts it on and listens a female voice starts up reading headlines of murders accidents and other political casualities what you hear says the farmer is a synopsis of to day s news in the new york chicago st louis and san francisco papers it is wired in to our rural news bureau and served hot to subscribers on this table you see the principal dailies and weeklies of the country also a special service of advance sheets of the monthly magazines i picks up one sheet and sees that it s headed special advance proofs in july the century will say and so forth the farmer rings up somebody his manager i reckon and tells him to let that herd of jerseys go at a head and to sow the acre field in wheat and to have extra cans ready at the station for the milk trolley car then he passes the henry clays and sets out a bottle of green chartreuse and goes over and looks at the ticker tape consolidated gas up two points says he oh very well ever monkey with copper i asks stand back says he raising his hand or i ll call the dog i told you not to waste your time after a while he says bunk if you don t mind my telling you your company begins to cloy slightly i ve got to write an article on the chimera of communism for a magazine and attend a meeting of the race track association this afternoon of course you understand by now that you can t get my proxy for your remedy whatever it may be well sir all i could think of to do was to go out and get in the buggy the horse turned round and took me back to the hotel i hitched him and went in to see andy in his room i told him about this farmer word for word and i sat picking at the table cover like one bereft of sagaciousness i don t understand it says i humming a sad and foolish little song to cover my humiliation andy walks up and down the room for a long time biting the left end of his mustache as he does when in the act of thinking jeff says he finally i believe your story of this expurgated rustic but i am not convinced it looks incredulous to me that he could have inoculated himself against all the preordained systems of bucolic bunco now you never regarded me as a man of special religious proclivities did you jeff says andy well says i no but says i not to wound his feelings i have also observed many church members whose said proclivities were not so outwardly developed that they would show on a white handkerchief if you rubbed em with it i have always been a deep student of nature from creation down says andy and i believe in an ultimatum design of providence farmers was made for a purpose and that was to furnish a livelihood to men like me and you else why was we given brains it is my belief that the manna that the israelites lived on for forty years in the wilderness was only a figurative word for farmers and they kept up the practice to this day and now says andy i am going to test my theory once a farmer always a come on in spite of the veneering and the orifices that a spurious civilization has brought to him you ll fail same as i did says i this one s shook off the shackles of the sheep fold he s entrenched behind the advantages of electricity education literature and intelligence i ll try said andy there are certain laws of nature that free rural delivery can t overcome andy fumbles around awhile in the closet and comes out dressed in a suit with brown and yellow checks as big as your hand his vest is red with blue dots and he wears a high silk hat i noticed he d soaked his sandy mustache in a kind of blue ink great barnums says i you re a ringer for a circus thimblerig man right says andy is the buggy outside wait here till i come back i won t be long two hours afterwards andy steps into the room and lays a wad of money on the table eight hundred and sixty dollars said he let me tell you he was in he looked me over and began to guy me i didn t say a word but got out the walnut shells and began to roll the little ball on the table i whistled a tune or two and then i started up the old formula step up lively gentlemen says i and watch the little ball it costs you nothing to look there you see it and there you don t guess where the little joker is the quickness of the hand deceives the eye i steals a look at the farmer man i see the sweat coming out on his forehead he goes over and closes the front door and watches me some more directly he says i ll bet you twenty i can pick the shell the ball s under now after that goes on andy there is nothing new to relate he only had cash in the house when i left he followed me to the gate there was tears in his eyes when he shook hands bunk says he thank you for the only real pleasure i ve had in years it brings up happy old days when i was only a farmer and not an agriculturalist god bless you here jeff peters ceased and i inferred that his story was done then you think i began yes said jeff something like that you let the farmers go ahead and amuse themselves with politics farming s a lonesome life and they ve been against the shell game before the chair of philanthromathematics i see that the cause of education has received the princely gift of more than fifty millions of dollars said i i was gleaning the stray items from the evening papers while jeff peters packed his briar pipe with plug cut which same said jeff calls for a new deck and a recitation by the entire class in philanthromathematics is that an allusion i asked it is said jeff i never told you about the time when me and andy tucker was philanthropists did i it was eight years ago in arizona andy and me was out in the gila mountains with a two horse wagon prospecting for silver we struck it and sold out to parties in tucson for they paid our check at the bank in silver a thousand dollars in a sack we loaded it in our wagon and drove east a hundred miles before we recovered our presence of intellect twenty five thousand dollars doesn t sound like so much when you re reading the annual report of the pennsylvania railroad or listening to an actor talking about his salary but when you can raise up a wagon sheet and kick around your bootheel and hear every one of em ring against another it makes you feel like you was a night and day bank with the clock striking twelve the third day out we drove into one of the most specious and tidy little towns that nature or rand and mcnally ever turned out it was in the foothills and mitigated with trees and flowers and about head of cordial and dilatory inhabitants the town seemed to be called floresville and nature had not contaminated it with many railroads fleas or eastern tourists me and andy deposited our money to the credit of peters and tucker in the esperanza savings bank and got rooms at the skyview hotel after supper we lit up and sat out on the gallery and smoked then was when the philanthropy idea struck me i suppose every grafter gets it sometime when a man swindles the public out of a certain amount he begins to get scared and wants to return part of it and if you ll watch close and notice the way his charity runs you ll see that he tries to restore it to the same people he got it from as a hydrostatical case take let s say a a made his millions selling oil to poor students who sit up nights studying political economy and methods for regulating the trusts so back to the universities and colleges goes his conscience dollars there s b got his from the common laboring man that works with his hands and tools how s he to get some of the remorse fund back into their overalls aha says b i ll do it in the name of education i ve skinned the laboring man says he to himself but according to the old proverb charity covers a multitude of skins so he puts up eighty million dollars worth of libraries and the boys with the dinner pail that builds em gets the benefit where s the books asks the reading public i dinna ken says b i offered ye libraries and there they are i suppose if i d given ye preferred steel trust stock instead ye d have wanted the water in it set out in cut glass decanters hoot for ye but as i said the owning of so much money was beginning to give me philanthropitis it was the first time me and andy had ever made a pile big enough to make us stop and think how we got it andy says i we re wealthy not beyond the dreams of average but in our humble way we are comparatively as rich as greasers i feel as if i d like to do something for as well as to humanity i was thinking the same thing jeff says he we ve been gouging the public for a long time with all kinds of little schemes from selling self igniting celluloid collars to flooding georgia with hoke smith presidential campaign buttons i d like myself to hedge a bet or two in the graft game if i could do it without actually banging the cymbalines in the salvation army or teaching a bible class by the bertillon system what ll we do says andy give free grub to the poor or send a couple of thousand to george cortelyou neither says i we ve got too much money to be implicated in plain charity and we haven t got enough to make restitution so we ll look about for something that s about half way between the two the next day in walking around floresville we see on a hill a big red brick building that appears to be disinhabited the citizens speak up and tell us that it was begun for a residence several years before by a mine owner after running up the house he finds he only had left to furnish it with so he invests that in whiskey and jumps off the roof on a spot where he now requiescats in pieces as soon as me and andy saw that building the same idea struck both of us we would fix it up with lights and pen wipers and professors and put an iron dog and statues of hercules and father john on the lawn and start one of the finest free educational institutions in the world right there so we talks it over to the prominent citizens of floresville who falls in fine with the idea they give a banquet in the engine house to us and we make our bow for the first time as benefactors to the cause of progress and enlightenment andy makes an hour and a half speech on the subject of irrigation in lower egypt and we have a moral tune on the phonograph and pineapple sherbet andy and me didn t lose any time in philanthropping we put every man in town that could tell a hammer from a step ladder to work on the building dividing it up into class rooms and lecture halls we wire to frisco for a car load of desks footballs arithmetics penholders dictionaries chairs for the professors slates skeletons sponges twenty seven cravenetted gowns and caps for the senior class and an open order for all the truck that goes with a first class university i took it on myself to put a campus and a curriculum on the list but the telegraph operator must have got the words wrong being an ignorant man for when the goods come we found a can of peas and a curry comb among em while the weekly papers was having chalk plate cuts of me and andy we wired an employment agency in chicago to express us f o b six professors immediately one english literature one up to date dead languages one chemistry one political economy democrat preferred one logic and one wise to painting italian and music with union card the esperanza bank guaranteed salaries which was to run between and well sir we finally got in shape over the front door was carved the words the world s university peters tucker patrons and proprietors and when september the first got a cross mark on the calendar the come ons begun to roll in first the faculty got off the tri weekly express from tucson they was mostly young spectacled and red headed with sentiments divided between ambition and food andy and me got em billeted on the floresvillians and then laid for the students they came in bunches we had advertised the university in all the state papers and it did us good to see how quick the country responded two hundred and nineteen husky lads aging along from up to chin whiskers answered the clarion call of free education they ripped open that town sponged the seams turned it lined it with new mohair and you couldn t have told it from harvard or goldfields at the march term of court they marched up and down the streets waving flags with the world s university colors ultra marine and blue and they certainly made a lively place of floresville andy made them a speech from the balcony of the skyview hotel and the whole town was out celebrating in about two weeks the professors got the students disarmed and herded into classes i don t believe there s any pleasure equal to being a philanthropist me and andy bought high silk hats and pretended to dodge the two reporters of the floresville gazette the paper had a man to kodak us whenever we appeared on the street and ran our pictures every week over the column headed educational notes andy lectured twice a week at the university and afterward i would rise and tell a humorous story once the gazette printed my pictures with abe lincoln on one side and marshall p wilder on the other andy was as interested in philanthropy as i was we used to wake up of nights and tell each other new ideas for booming the university andy says i to him one day there s something we overlooked the boys ought to have dromedaries what s that andy asks why something to sleep in of course says i all colleges have em oh you mean pajamas says andy i do not says i i mean dromedaries but i never could make andy understand so we never ordered em of course i meant them long bedrooms in colleges where the scholars sleep in a row well sir the world s university was a success we had scholars from five states and territories and floresville had a boom a new shooting gallery and a pawn shop and two more saloons started and the boys got up a college yell that went this way raw raw raw done done done peters tucker lots of fun bow wow wow haw hee haw world university hip hurrah the scholars was a fine lot of young men and me and andy was as proud of em as if they belonged to our own family but one day about the last of october andy comes to me and asks if i have any idea how much money we had left in the bank i guesses about sixteen thousand our balance says andy is what says i with a kind of a yell do you mean to tell me that them infernal clod hopping dough headed pup faced goose brained gate stealing rabbit eared sons of horse thieves have soaked us for that much no less says andy then to helvetia with philanthropy says i not necessarily says andy philanthropy says he when run on a good business basis is one of the best grafts going i ll look into the matter and see if it can t be straightened out the next week i am looking over the payroll of our faculty when i run across a new name professor james darnley mccorkle chair of mathematics salary per week i yells so loud that andy runs in quick what s this says i a professor of mathematics at more than a year how did this happen did he get in through the window and appoint himself i wired to frisco for him a week ago says andy in ordering the faculty we seemed to have overlooked the chair of mathematics a good thing we did says i we can pay his salary two weeks and then our philanthropy will look like the ninth hole on the skibo golf links wait a while says andy and see how things turn out we have taken up too noble a cause to draw out now besides the further i gaze into the retail philanthropy business the better it looks to me i never thought about investigating it before come to think of it now goes on andy all the philanthropists i ever knew had plenty of money i ought to have looked into that matter long ago and located which was the cause and which was the effect i had confidence in andy s chicanery in financial affairs so i left the whole thing in his hands the university was flourishing fine and me and andy kept our silk hats shined up and floresville kept on heaping honors on us like we was millionaires instead of almost busted philanthropists the students kept the town lively and prosperous some stranger came to town and started a faro bank over the red front livery stable and began to amass money in quantities me and andy strolled up one night and piked a dollar or two for sociability there were about fifty of our students there drinking rum punches and shoving high stacks of blues and reds about the table as the dealer turned the cards up why dang it andy says i these free school hunting gander headed silk socked little sons of sap suckers have got more money than you and me ever had look at the rolls they re pulling out of their pistol pockets yes says andy a good many of them are sons of wealthy miners and stockmen it s very sad to see em wasting their opportunities this way at christmas all the students went home to spend the holidays we had a farewell blowout at the university and andy lectured on modern music and prehistoric literature of the archipelagos each one of the faculty answered to toasts and compared me and andy to rockefeller and the emperor marcus autolycus i pounded on the table and yelled for professor mccorkle but it seems he wasn t present on the occasion i wanted a look at the man that andy thought could earn a week in philanthropy that was on the point of making an assignment the students all left on the night train and the town sounded as quiet as the campus of a correspondence school at midnight when i went to the hotel i saw a light in andy s room and i opened the door and walked in there sat andy and the faro dealer at a table dividing a two foot high stack of currency in thousand dollar packages correct says andy thirty one thousand apiece come in jeff says he this is our share of the profits of the first half of the scholastic term of the world s university incorporated and philanthropated are you convinced now says andy that philanthropy when practiced in a business way is an art that blesses him who gives as well as him who receives great says i feeling fine i ll admit you are the doctor this time we ll be leaving on the morning train says andy you d better get your collars and cuffs and press clippings together great says i i ll be ready but andy says i i wish i could have met that professor james darnley mccorkle before we went i had a curiosity to know that man that ll be easy says andy turning around to the faro dealer jim says andy shake hands with mr peters the hand that riles the world many of our great men said i apropos of many things have declared that they owe their success to the aid and encouragement of some brilliant woman i know said jeff peters i ve read in history and mythology about joan of arc and mme yale and mrs caudle and eve and other noted females of the past but in my opinion the woman of to day is of little use in politics or business what s she best in anyway men make the best cooks milliners nurses housekeepers stenographers clerks hairdressers and launderers about the only job left that a woman can beat a man in is female impersonator in vaudeville i would have thought said i that occasionally anyhow you would have found the wit and intuition of woman valuable to you in your lines of er business now wouldn t you said jeff with an emphatic nod wouldn t you have imagined that but a woman is an absolutely unreliable partner in any straight swindle she s liable to turn honest on you when you are depending upon her the most i tried em once bill humble an old friend of mine in the territories conceived the illusion that he wanted to be appointed united states marshall at that time me and andy was doing a square legitimate business of selling walking canes if you unscrewed the head of one and turned it up to your mouth a half pint of good rye whiskey would go trickling down your throat to reward you for your act of intelligence the deputies was annoying me and andy some and when bill spoke to me about his officious aspirations i saw how the appointment as marshall might help along the firm of peters tucker jeff says bill to me you are a man of learning and education besides having knowledge and information concerning not only rudiments but facts and attainments i do says i and i have never regretted it i am not one says i who would cheapen education by making it free tell me says i which is of the most value to mankind literature or horse racing why er playing the po i mean of course the poets and the great writers have got the call of course says bill exactly says i then why do the master minds of finance and philanthropy says i charge us to get into a race track and let us into a library free is that distilling into the masses says i a correct estimate of the relative value of the two means of self culture and disorder you are arguing outside of my faculties of sense and rhetoric says bill what i wanted you to do is to go to washington and dig out this appointment for me i haven t no ideas of cultivation and intrigue i m a plain citizen and i need the job i ve killed seven men says bill i ve got nine children i ve been a good republican ever since the first of may i can t read nor write and i see no reason why i ain t illegible for the office and i think your partner mr tucker goes on bill is also a man of sufficient ingratiation and connected system of mental delinquency to assist you in securing the appointment i will give you preliminary says bill for drinks bribes and carfare in washington if you land the job i will pay you more cash down and guarantee you impunity in boot legging whiskey for twelve months are you patriotic to the west enough to help me put this thing through the whitewashed wigwam of the great father of the most eastern flag station of the pennsylvania railroad says bill well i talked to andy about it and he liked the idea immense andy was a man of an involved nature he was never content to plod along as i was selling to the peasantry some little tool like a combination steak beater shoe horn marcel waver monkey wrench nail file potato masher and multum in parvo tuning fork andy had the artistic temper which is not to be judged as a preacher s or a moral man s is by purely commercial deflections so we accepted bill s offer and strikes out for washington says i to andy when we get located at a hotel on south dakota avenue g s s w now andy for the first time in our lives we ve got to do a real dishonest act lobbying is something we ve never been used to but we ve got to scandalize ourselves for bill humble s sake in a straight and legitimate business says i we could afford to introduce a little foul play and chicanery but in a disorderly and heinous piece of malpractice like this it seems to me that the straightforward and aboveboard way is the best i propose says i that we hand over of this money to the chairman of the national campaign committee get a receipt lay the receipt on the president s desk and tell him about bill the president is a man who would appreciate a candidate who went about getting office that way instead of pulling wires andy agreed with me but after we talked the scheme over with the hotel clerk we give that plan up he told us that there was only one way to get an appointment in washington and that was through a lady lobbyist he gave us the address of one he recommended a mrs avery who he said was high up in sociable and diplomatic rings and circles the next morning at o clock me and andy called at her hotel and was shown up to her reception room this mrs avery was a solace and a balm to the eyesight she had hair the color of the back of a twenty dollar gold certificate blue eyes and a system of beauty that would make the girl on the cover of a july magazine look like a cook on a monongahela coal barge she had on a low necked dress covered with silver spangles and diamond rings and ear bobs her arms was bare and she was using a desk telephone with one hand and drinking tea with the other well boys says she after a bit what is it i told her in as few words as possible what we wanted for bill and the price we could pay those western appointments says she are easy le me see now says she who could put that through for us no use fooling with the territorial delegates i guess says she that senator sniper would be about the man he s from somewheres in the west let s see how he stands on my private menu card she takes some papers out of a pigeon hole with the letter s over it yes says she he s marked with a star that means ready to serve now let s see age married twice presbyterian likes blondes tolstoi poker and stewed terrapin sentimental at third bottle of wine yes she goes on i am sure i can have your friend mr bummer appointed minister to brazil humble says i and united states marshal was the berth oh yes says mrs avery i have so many deals of this sort i sometimes get them confused give me all the memoranda you have of the case mr peters and come back in four days i think it can be arranged by then so me and andy goes back to our hotel and waits andy walks up and down and chews the left end of his mustache a woman of high intellect and perfect beauty is a rare thing jeff says he as rare says i as an omelet made from the eggs of the fabulous bird known as the epidermis says i a woman like that says andy ought to lead a man to the highest positions of opulence and fame i misdoubt says i if any woman ever helped a man to secure a job any more than to have his meals ready promptly and spread a report that the other candidate s wife had once been a shoplifter they are no more adapted for business and politics says i than algernon charles swinburne is to be floor manager at one of chuck connor s annual balls i know says i to andy that sometimes a woman seems to step out into the kalsomine light as the charge d affaires of her man s political job but how does it come out say they have a neat little berth somewhere as foreign consul of record to afghanistan or lockkeeper on the delaware and raritan canal one day this man finds his wife putting on her overshoes and three months supply of bird seed into the canary s cage sioux falls he asks with a kind of hopeful light in his eye no arthur says she washington we re wasted here says she you ought to be toady extraordinary to the court of st bridget or head porter of the island of porto rico i m going to see about it then this lady i says to andy moves against the authorities at washington with her baggage and munitions consisting of five dozen indiscriminating letters written to her by a member of the cabinet when she was a letter of introduction from king leopold to the smithsonian institution and a pink silk costume with canary colored spats well and then what i goes she has the letters printed in the evening papers that match her costume she lectures at an informal tea given in the palm room of the b o depot and then calls on the president the ninth assistant secretary of commerce and labor the first aide de camp of the blue room and an unidentified colored man are waiting there to grasp her by the hands and feet they carry her out to s w b street and leave her on a cellar door that ends it the next time we hear of her she is writing postcards to the chinese minister asking him to get arthur a job in a tea store then says andy you don t think mrs avery will land the marshalship for bill i do not says i i do not wish to be a septic but i doubt if she can do as well as you and me could have done i don t agree with you says andy i ll bet you she does i m proud of having a higher opinion of the talent and the powers of negotiation of ladies we was back at mrs avery s hotel at the time she appointed she was looking pretty and fine enough as far as that went to make any man let her name every officer in the country but i hadn t much faith in looks so i was certainly surprised when she pulls out a document with the great seal of the united states on it and william henry humble in a fine big hand on the back you might have had it the next day boys says mrs avery smiling i hadn t the slightest trouble in getting it says she i just asked for it that s all now i d like to talk to you a while she goes on but i m awfully busy and i know you ll excuse me i ve got an ambassadorship two consulates and a dozen other minor applications to look after i can hardly find time to sleep at all you ll give my compliments to mr humble when you get home of course well i handed her the which she pitched into her desk drawer without counting i put bill s appointment in my pocket and me and andy made our adieus we started back for the territory the same day we wired bill job landed get the tall glasses ready and we felt pretty good andy joshed me all the way about how little i knew about women all right says i i ll admit that she surprised me but it s the first time i ever knew one of em to manipulate a piece of business on time without getting it bungled up in some way says i down about the edge of arkansas i got out bill s appointment and looked it over and then i handed it to andy to read andy read it but didn t add any remarks to my silence the paper was for bill all right and a genuine document but it appointed him postmaster of dade city fla me and andy got off the train at little rock and sent bill s appointment to him by mail then we struck northeast toward lake superior i never saw bill humble after that the exact science of matrimony as i have told you before said jeff peters i never had much confidence in the perfidiousness of woman as partners or coeducators in the most innocent line of graft they are not trustworthy they deserve the compliment said i i think they are entitled to be called the honest sex why shouldn t they be said jeff they ve got the other sex either grafting or working overtime for em they re all right in business until they get their emotions or their hair touched up too much then you want to have a flat footed heavy breathing man with sandy whiskers five kids and a building and loan mortgage ready as an understudy to take her desk now there was that widow lady that me and andy tucker engaged to help us in that little matrimonial agency scheme we floated out in cairo when you ve got enough advertising capital say a roll as big as the little end of a wagon tongue there s money in matrimonial agencies we had about and we expected to double it in two months which is about as long as a scheme like ours can be carried on without taking out a new jersey charter we fixed up an advertisement that read about like this charming widow beautiful home loving years possessing cash and owning valuable country property would remarry would prefer a poor man with affectionate disposition to one with means as she realizes that the solid virtues are oftenest to be found in the humble walks of life no objection to elderly man or one of homely appearance if faithful and true and competent to manage property and invest money with judgment address with particulars lonely care of peters tucker agents cairo ill so far so pernicious says i when we had finished the literary concoction and now says i where is the lady andy gives me one of his looks of calm irritation jeff says he i thought you had lost them ideas of realism in your art why should there be a lady when they sell a lot of watered stock on wall street would you expect to find a mermaid in it what has a matrimonial ad got to do with a lady now listen says i you know my rule andy that in all my illegitimate inroads against the legal letter of the law the article sold must be existent visible producible in that way and by a careful study of city ordinances and train schedules i have kept out of all trouble with the police that a five dollar bill and a cigar could not square now to work this scheme we ve got to be able to produce bodily a charming widow or its equivalent with or without the beauty hereditaments and appurtenances set forth in the catalogue and writ of errors or hereafter be held by a justice of the peace well says andy reconstructing his mind maybe it would be safer in case the post office or the peace commission should try to investigate our agency but where he says could you hope to find a widow who would waste time on a matrimonial scheme that had no matrimony in it i told andy that i thought i knew of the exact party an old friend of mine zeke trotter who used to draw soda water and teeth in a tent show had made his wife a widow a year before by drinking some dyspepsia cure of the old doctor s instead of the liniment that he always got boozed up on i used to stop at their house often and i thought we could get her to work with us twas only sixty miles to the little town where she lived so i jumped out on the i c and finds her in the same cottage with the same sunflowers and roosters standing on the washtub mrs trotter fitted our ad first rate except maybe for beauty and age and property valuation but she looked feasible and praiseworthy to the eye and it was a kindness to zeke s memory to give her the job is this an honest deal you are putting on mr peters she asks me when i tell her what we want mrs trotter says i andy tucker and me have computed the calculation that men in this broad and unfair country will endeavor to secure your fair hand and ostensible money and property through our advertisement out of that number something like thirty hundred will expect to give you in exchange if they should win you the carcass of a lazy and mercenary loafer a failure in life a swindler and contemptible fortune seeker me and andy says i propose to teach these preyers upon society a lesson it was with difficulty says i that me and andy could refrain from forming a corporation under the title of the great moral and millennial malevolent matrimonial agency does that satisfy you it does mr peters says she i might have known you wouldn t have gone into anything that wasn t opprobrious but what will my duties be do i have to reject personally these ramscallions you speak of or can i throw them out in bunches your job mrs trotter says i will be practically a cynosure you will live at a quiet hotel and will have no work to do andy and i will attend to all the correspondence and business end of it of course says i some of the more ardent and impetuous suitors who can raise the railroad fare may come to cairo to personally press their suit or whatever fraction of a suit they may be wearing in that case you will be probably put to the inconvenience of kicking them out face to face we will pay you per week and hotel expenses give me five minutes says mrs trotter to get my powder rag and leave the front door key with a neighbor and you can let my salary begin so i conveys mrs trotter to cairo and establishes her in a family hotel far enough away from mine and andy s quarters to be unsuspicious and available and i tell andy great says andy and now that your conscience is appeased as to the tangibility and proximity of the bait and leaving mutton aside suppose we revenoo a noo fish so we began to insert our advertisement in newspapers covering the country far and wide one ad was all we used we couldn t have used more without hiring so many clerks and marcelled paraphernalia that the sound of the gum chewing would have disturbed the postmaster general we placed in a bank to mrs trotter s credit and gave her the book to show in case anybody might question the honesty and good faith of the agency i knew mrs trotter was square and reliable and it was safe to leave it in her name with that one ad andy and me put in twelve hours a day answering letters about one hundred a day was what came in i never knew there was so many large hearted but indigent men in the country who were willing to acquire a charming widow and assume the burden of investing her money most of them admitted that they ran principally to whiskers and lost jobs and were misunderstood by the world but all of em were sure that they were so chock full of affection and manly qualities that the widow would be making the bargain of her life to get em every applicant got a reply from peters tucker informing him that the widow had been deeply impressed by his straightforward and interesting letter and requesting them to write again stating more particulars and enclosing photograph if convenient peters tucker also informed the applicant that their fee for handing over the second letter to their fair client would be enclosed therewith there you see the simple beauty of the scheme about per cent of them domestic foreign noblemen raised the price somehow and sent it in that was all there was to it except that me and andy complained an amount about being put to the trouble of slicing open them envelopes and taking the money out some few clients called in person we sent em to mrs trotter and she did the rest except for three or four who came back to strike us for carfare after the letters began to get in from the r f d districts andy and me were taking in about a day one afternoon when we were busiest and i was stuffing the two and ones into cigar boxes and andy was whistling no wedding bells for her a small slick man drops in and runs his eye over the walls like he was on the trail of a lost gainesborough painting or two as soon as i saw him i felt a glow of pride because we were running our business on the level i see you have quite a large mail to day says the man i reached and got my hat come on says i we ve been expecting you i ll show you the goods how was teddy when you left washington i took him down to the riverview hotel and had him shake hands with mrs trotter then i showed him her bank book with the to her credit it seems to be all right says the secret service it is says i and if you re not a married man i ll leave you to talk a while with the lady we won t mention the two dollars thanks says he if i wasn t i might good day mrs peters toward the end of three months we had taken in something over and we saw it was time to quit we had a good many complaints made to us and mrs trotter seemed to be tired of the job a good many suitors had been calling to see her and she didn t seem to like that so we decides to pull out and i goes down to mrs trotter s hotel to pay her last week s salary and say farewell and get her check for the when i got there i found her crying like a kid that don t want to go to school now now says i what s it all about somebody sassed you or you getting homesick no mr peters says she i ll tell you you was always a friend of zeke s and i don t mind mr peters i m in love i just love a man so hard i can t bear not to get him he s just the ideal i ve always had in mind then take him says i that is if it s a mutual case does he return the sentiment according to the specifications and painfulness you have described he does says she but he s one of the gentlemen that s been coming to see me about the advertisement and he won t marry me unless i give him the his name is william wilkinson and then she goes off again in the agitations and hysterics of romance mrs trotter says i there s no man more sympathizing with a woman s affections than i am besides you was once the life partner of one of my best friends if it was left to me i d say take this and the man of your choice and be happy we could afford to do that because we have cleaned up over from these suckers that wanted to marry you but says i andy tucker is to be consulted he is a good man but keen in business he is my equal partner financially i will talk to andy says i and see what can be done i goes back to our hotel and lays the case before andy i was expecting something like this all the time says andy you can t trust a woman to stick by you in any scheme that involves her emotions and preferences it s a sad thing andy says i to think that we ve been the cause of the breaking of a woman s heart it is says andy and i tell you what i m willing to do jeff you ve always been a man of a soft and generous heart and disposition perhaps i ve been too hard and worldly and suspicious for once i ll meet you half way go to mrs trotter and tell her to draw the from the bank and give it to this man she s infatuated with and be happy i jumps up and shakes andy s hand for five minutes and then i goes back to mrs trotter and tells her and she cries as hard for joy as she did for sorrow two days afterward me and andy packed up to go wouldn t you like to go down and meet mrs trotter once before we leave i asks him she d like mightily to know you and express her encomiums and gratitude why i guess not says andy i guess we d better hurry and catch that train i was strapping our capital around me in a memory belt like we always carried it when andy pulls a roll of large bills out of his pocket and asks me to put em with the rest what s this says i it s mrs trotter s two thousand says andy how do you come to have it i asks she gave it to me says andy i ve been calling on her three evenings a week for more than a month then are you william wilkinson says i i was says andy a midsummer masquerade satan said jeff peters is a hard boss to work for when other people are having their vacation is when he keeps you the busiest as old dr watts or st paul or some other diagnostician says he always finds somebody for idle hands to do i remember one summer when me and my partner andy tucker tried to take a layoff from our professional and business duties but it seems that our work followed us wherever we went now with a preacher it s different he can throw off his responsibilities and enjoy himself on the st of may he wraps mosquito netting and tin foil around the pulpit grabs his niblick breviary and fishing pole and hikes for lake como or atlantic city according to the size of the loudness with which he has been called by his congregation and sir for three months he don t have to think about business except to hunt around in deuteronomy and proverbs and timothy to find texts to cover and exculpate such little midsummer penances as dropping a couple of looey door on rouge or teaching a presbyterian widow to swim but i was going to tell you about mine and andy s summer vacation that wasn t one we was tired of finance and all the branches of unsanctified ingenuity even andy whose brain rarely ever stopped working began to make noises like a tennis cabinet heigh ho says andy i m tired i ve got that steam up the yacht corsair and ho for the riviera feeling i want to loaf and indict my soul as walt whittier says i want to play pinochle with merry del val or give a knouting to the tenants on my tarrytown estates or do a monologue at a chautauqua picnic in kilts or something summery and outside the line of routine and sand bagging patience says i you ll have to climb higher in the profession before you can taste the laurels that crown the footprints of the great captains of industry now what i d like andy says i would be a summer sojourn in a mountain village far from scenes of larceny labor and overcapitalization i m tired too and a month or so of sinlessness ought to leave us in good shape to begin again to take away the white man s burdens in the fall andy fell in with the rest cure at once so we struck the general passenger agents of all the railroads for summer resort literature and took a week to study out where we should go i reckon the first passenger agent in the world was that man genesis but there wasn t much competition in his day and when he said the lord made the earth in six days and all very good he hadn t any idea to what extent the press agents of the summer hotels would plagiarize from him later on when we finished the booklets we perceived easy that the united states from passadumkeg maine to el paso and from skagway to key west was a paradise of glorious mountain peaks crystal lakes new laid eggs golf girls garages cooling breezes straw rides open plumbing and tennis and all within two hours ride so me and andy dumps the books out the back window and packs our trunk and takes the o clock tortoise flyer for crow knob a kind of a dernier resort in the mountains on the line of tennessee and north carolina we was directed to a kind of private hotel called woodchuck inn and thither me and andy bent and almost broke our footsteps over the rocks and stumps the inn set back from the road in a big grove of trees and it looked fine with its broad porches and a lot of women in white dresses rocking in the shade the rest of crow knob was a post office and some scenery set an angle of forty five degrees and a welkin well sir when we got to the gate who do you suppose comes down the walk to greet us old smoke em out smithers who used to be the best open air painless dentist and electric liver pad faker in the southwest old smoke em out is dressed clerico rural and has the mingled air of a landlord and a claim jumper which aspect he corroborates by telling us that he is the host and perpetrator of woodchuck inn i introduces andy and we talk about a few volatile topics such as will go around at meetings of boards of directors and old associates like us three were old smoke em out leads us into a kind of summer house in the yard near the gate and took up the harp of life and smote on all the chords with his mighty right gents says he i m glad to see you maybe you can help me out of a scrape i m getting a bit old for street work so i leased this dogdays emporium so the good things would come to me two weeks before the season opened i gets a letter signed lieut peary and one from the duke of marlborough each wanting to engage board for part of the summer well sir you gents know what a big thing for an obscure hustlery it would be to have for guests two gentlemen whose names are famous from long association with icebergs and the coburgs so i prints a lot of handbills announcing that woodchuck inn would shelter these distinguished boarders during the summer except in places where it leaked and i sends em out to towns around as far as knoxville and charlotte and fish dam and bowling green and now look up there on the porch gents says smoke em out at them disconsolate specimens of their fair sex waiting for the arrival of the duke and the lieutenant the house is packed from rafters to cellar with hero worshippers there s four normal school teachers and two abnormal there s three high school graduates between and there s two literary old maids and one that can write there s a couple of society women and a lady from haw river two elocutionists are bunking in the corn crib and i ve put cots in the hay loft for the cook and the society editress of the chattanooga opera glass you see how names draw gents well says i how is it that you seem to be biting your thumbs at good luck you didn t use to be that way i ain t through says smoke em out yesterday was the day for the advent of the auspicious personages i goes down to the depot to welcome em two apparently animate substances gets off the train both carrying bags full of croquet mallets and these magic lanterns with pushbuttons i compares these integers with the original signatures to the letters and well gents i reckon the mistake was due to my poor eyesight instead of being the lieutenant the daisy chain and wild verbena explorer was none other than levi t peevy a soda water clerk from asheville and the duke of marlborough turned out to be theo drake of murfreesborough a bookkeeper in a grocery what did i do i kicked em both back on the train and watched em depart for the lowlands the low now you see the fix i m in gents goes on smoke em out smithers i told the ladies that the notorious visitors had been detained on the road by some unavoidable circumstances that made a noise like an ice jam and an heiress but they would arrive a day or two later when they find out that they ve been deceived says smoke em out every yard of cross barred muslin and natural waved switch in the house will pack up and leave it s a hard deal says old smoke em out friend says andy touching the old man on the sophagus why this jeremiad when the polar regions and the portals of blenheim are conspiring to hand you prosperity on a hall marked silver salver we have arrived a light breaks out on smoke em out s face can you do it gents he asks could ye do it could ye play the polar man and the little duke for the nice ladies will ye do it i see that andy is superimposed with his old hankering for the oral and polyglot system of buncoing that man had a vocabulary of about words and synonyms which arrayed themselves into contraband sophistries and parables when they came out listen says andy to old smoke em out can we do it you behold before you mr smithers two of the finest equipped men on earth for inveigling the proletariat whether by word of mouth sleight of hand or swiftness of foot dukes come and go explorers go and get lost but me and jeff peters says andy go after the come ons forever if you say so we re the two illustrious guests you were expecting and you ll find says andy that we ll give you the true local color of the title r les from the aurora borealis to the ducal portcullis old smoke em out is delighted he takes me and andy up to the inn by an arm apiece telling us on the way that the finest fruits of the can and luxuries of the fast freights should be ours without price as long as we would stay on the porch smoke em out says ladies i have the honor to introduce his gracefulness the duke of marlborough and the famous inventor of the north pole lieut peary the skirts all flutter and the rocking chairs squeak as me and andy bows and then goes on in with old smoke em out to register and then we washed up and turned our cuffs and the landlord took us to the rooms he d been saving for us and got out a demijohn of north carolina real mountain dew i expected trouble when andy began to drink he has the artistic metempsychosis which is half drunk when sober and looks down on airships when stimulated after lingering with the demijohn me and andy goes out on the porch where the ladies are to begin to earn our keep we sit in two special chairs and then the schoolma ams and literaterrers hunched their rockers close around us one lady says to me how did that last venture of yours turn out sir now i d clean forgot to have an understanding with andy which i was to be the duke or the lieutenant and i couldn t tell from her question whether she was referring to arctic or matrimonial expeditions so i gave an answer that would cover both cases well ma am says i it was a freeze out right smart of a freeze out ma am and then the flood gates of andy s perorations was opened and i knew which one of the renowned ostensible guests i was supposed to be i wasn t either andy was both and still furthermore it seemed that he was trying to be the mouthpiece of the whole british nobility and of arctic exploration from sir john franklin down it was the union of corn whiskey and the conscientious fictional form that mr w d howletts admires so much ladies says andy smiling semicircularly i am truly glad to visit america i do not consider the magna charta says he or gas balloons or snow shoes in any way a detriment to the beauty and charm of your american women skyscrapers or the architecture of your icebergs the next time says andy that i go after the north pole all the vanderbilts in greenland won t be able to turn me out in the cold i mean make it hot for me tell us about one of your trips lieutenant says one of the normals sure says andy getting the decision over a hiccup it was in the spring of last year that i sailed the castle of blenheim up to latitude degrees fahrenheit and beat the record ladies says andy it was a sad sight to see a duke allied by a civil and liturgical chattel mortgage to one of your first families lost in a region of semiannual days and then he goes on at four bells we sighted westminster abbey but there was not a drop to eat at noon we threw out five sandbags and the ship rose fifteen knots higher at midnight continues andy the restaurants closed sitting on a cake of ice we ate seven hot dogs all around us was snow and ice six times a night the boatswain rose up and tore a leaf off the calendar so we could keep time with the barometer at says andy with a lot of anguish on his face three huge polar bears sprang down the hatchway into the cabin and then what then lieutenant says a schoolma am excitedly andy gives a loud sob the duchess shook me he cries out and slides out of the chair and weeps on the porch well of course that fixed the scheme the women boarders all left the next morning the landlord wouldn t speak to us for two days but when he found we had money to pay our way he loosened up so me and andy had a quiet restful summer after all coming away from crow knob with that we enticed out of old smoke em out playing seven up shearing the wolf jeff peters was always eloquent when the ethics of his profession was under discussion the only times said he that me and andy tucker ever had any hiatuses in our cordial intents was when we differed on the moral aspects of grafting andy had his standards and i had mine i didn t approve of all of andy s schemes for levying contributions from the public and he thought i allowed my conscience to interfere too often for the financial good of the firm we had high arguments sometimes one word led on to another till he said i reminded him of rockefeller i don t know how you mean that andy says i but we have been friends too long for me to take offense at a taunt that you will regret when you cool off i have yet says i to shake hands with a subpoena server one summer me and andy decided to rest up a spell in a fine little town in the mountains of kentucky called grassdale we was supposed to be horse drovers and good decent citizens besides taking a summer vacation the grassdale people liked us and me and andy declared a cessation of hostilities never so much as floating the fly leaf of a rubber concession prospectus or flashing a brazilian diamond while we was there one day the leading hardware merchant of grassdale drops around to the hotel where me and andy stopped and smokes with us sociable on the side porch we knew him pretty well from pitching quoits in the afternoons in the court house yard he was a loud red man breathing hard but fat and respectable beyond all reason after we talk on all the notorious themes of the day this murkison for such was his entitlements takes a letter out of his coat pocket in a careful careless way and hands it to us to read now what do you think of that says he laughing a letter like that to me me and andy sees at a glance what it is but we pretend to read it through it was one of them old time typewritten green goods letters explaining how for you could get in bills that an expert couldn t tell from the genuine and going on to tell how they were made from plates stolen by an employee of the treasury at washington think of em sending a letter like that to me says murkison again lot s of good men get em says andy if you don t answer the first letter they let you drop if you answer it they write again asking you to come on with your money and do business but think of em writing to me says murkison a few days later he drops around again boys says he i know you are all right or i wouldn t confide in you i wrote to them rascals again just for fun they answered and told me to come on to chicago they said telegraph to j smith when i would start when i get there i m to wait on a certain street corner till a man in a gray suit comes along and drops a newspaper in front of me then i am to ask him how the water is and he knows it s me and i know it s him ah yes says andy gaping it s the same old game i ve often read about it in the papers then he conducts you to the private abattoir in the hotel where mr jones is already waiting they show you brand new real money and sell you all you want at five for one you see em put it in a satchel for you and know it s there of course it s brown paper when you come to look at it afterward oh they couldn t switch it on me says murkison i haven t built up the best paying business in grassdale without having witticisms about me you say it s real money they show you mr tucker i ve always i see by the papers that it always is says andy boys says murkison i ve got it in my mind that them fellows can t fool me i think i ll put a couple of thousand in my jeans and go up there and put it all over em if bill murkison gets his eyes once on them bills they show him he ll never take em off of em they offer for and they ll have to stick to the bargain if i tackle em that s the kind of trader bill murkison is yes i jist believe i ll drop up chicago way and take a to shot on j smith i guess the water ll be fine enough me and andy tries to get this financial misquotation out of murkison s head but we might as well have tried to keep the man who rolls peanuts with a toothpick from betting on bryan s election no sir he was going to perform a public duty by catching these green goods swindlers at their own game maybe it would teach em a lesson after murkison left us me and andy sat a while prepondering over our silent meditations and heresies of reason in our idle hours we always improved our higher selves by ratiocination and mental thought jeff says andy after a long time quite unseldom i have seen fit to impugn your molars when you have been chewing the rag with me about your conscientious way of doing business i may have been often wrong but here is a case where i think we can agree i feel that it would be wrong for us to allow mr murkison to go alone to meet those chicago green goods men there is but one way it can end don t you think we would both feel better if we was to intervene in some way and prevent the doing of this deed i got up and shook andy tucker s hand hard and long andy says i i may have had one or two hard thoughts about the heartlessness of your corporation but i retract em now you have a kind nucleus at the interior of your exterior after all it does you credit i was just thinking the same thing that you have expressed it would not be honorable or praiseworthy says i for us to let murkison go on with this project he has taken up if he is determined to go let us go with him and prevent this swindle from coming off andy agreed with me and i was glad to see that he was in earnest about breaking up this green goods scheme i don t call myself a religious man says i or a fanatic in moral bigotry but i can t stand still and see a man who has built up his business by his own efforts and brains and risk be robbed by an unscrupulous trickster who is a menace to the public good right jeff says andy we ll stick right along with murkison if he insists on going and block this funny business i d hate to see any money dropped in it as bad as you would well we went to see murkison no boys says he i can t consent to let the song of this chicago siren waft by me on the summer breeze i ll fry some fat out of this ignis fatuus or burn a hole in the skillet but i d be plumb diverted to death to have you all go along with me maybe you could help some when it comes to cashing in the ticket to that to shot yes i d really take it as a pastime and regalement if you boys would go along too murkison gives it out in grassdale that he is going for a few days with mr peters and mr tucker to look over some iron ore property in west virginia he wires j smith that he will set foot in the spider web on a given date and the three of us lights out for chicago on the way murkison amuses himself with premonitions and advance pleasant recollections in a gray suit says he on the southwest corner of wabash avenue and lake street he drops the paper and i ask how the water is oh my my my and then he laughs all over for five minutes sometimes murkison was serious and tried to talk himself out of his cogitations whatever they was boys says he i wouldn t have this to get out in grassdale for ten times a thousand dollars it would ruin me there but i know you all are all right i think it s the duty of every citizen says he to try to do up these robbers that prey upon the public i ll show em whether the water s fine five dollars for one that s what j smith offers and he ll have to keep his contract if he does business with bill murkison we got into chicago about p m murkison was to meet the gray man at half past we had dinner at a hotel and then went up to murkison s room to wait for the time to come now boys says murkison let s get our gumption together and inoculate a plan for defeating the enemy suppose while i m exchanging airy bandage with the gray capper you gents come along by accident you know and holler hello murk and shake hands with symptoms of surprise and familiarity then i take the capper aside and tell him you all are jenkins and brown of grassdale groceries and feed good men and maybe willing to take a chance while away from home bring em along he ll say of course if they care to invest now how does that scheme strike you what do you say jeff says andy looking at me why i ll tell you what i say says i i say let s settle this thing right here now i don t see any use of wasting any more time i took a nickel plated out of my pocket and clicked the cylinder around a few times you undevout sinful insidious hog says i to murkison get out that two thousand and lay it on the table obey with velocity says i for otherwise alternatives are impending i am preferably a man of mildness but now and then i find myself in the middle of extremities such men as you i went on after he had laid the money out is what keeps the jails and court houses going you come up here to rob these men of their money does it excuse you i asks that they were trying to skin you no sir you was going to rob peter to stand off paul you are ten times worse says i than that green goods man you go to church at home and pretend to be a decent citizen but you ll come to chicago and commit larceny from men that have built up a sound and profitable business by dealing with such contemptible scoundrels as you have tried to be to day how do you know says i that that green goods man hasn t a large family dependent upon his extortions it s you supposedly respectable citizens who are always on the lookout to get something for nothing says i that support the lotteries and wild cat mines and stock exchanges and wire tappers of this country if it wasn t for you they d go out of business the green goods man you was going to rob says i studied maybe for years to learn his trade every turn he makes he risks his money and liberty and maybe his life you come up here all sanctified and vanoplied with respectability and a pleasing post office address to swindle him if he gets the money you can squeal to the police if you get it he hocks the gray suit to buy supper and says nothing mr tucker and me sized you up says i and came along to see that you got what you deserved hand over the money says i you grass fed hypocrite i put the two thousand which was all in bills in my inside pocket now get out your watch says i to murkison no i don t want it says i lay it on the table and you sit in that chair till it ticks off an hour then you can go if you make any noise or leave any sooner we ll handbill you all over grassdale i guess your high position there is worth more than to you then me and andy left on the train andy was a long time silent then he says jeff do you mind my asking you a question two says i or forty was that the idea you had says he when we started out with murkison why certainly says i what else could it have been wasn t it yours too in about half an hour andy spoke again i think there are times when andy don t exactly understand my system of ethics and moral hygiene jeff says he some time when you have the leisure i wish you d draw off a diagram and foot notes of that conscience of yours i d like to have it to refer to occasionally innocents of broadway i hope some day to retire from business said jeff peters and when i do i don t want anybody to be able to say that i ever got a dollar of any man s money without giving him a quid pro rata for it i ve always managed to leave a customer some little gewgaw to paste in his scrapbook or stick between his seth thomas clock and the wall after we are through trading there was one time i came near having to break this rule of mine and do a profligate and illaudable action but i was saved from it by the laws and statutes of our great and profitable country one summer me and andy tucker my partner went to new york to lay in our annual assortment of clothes and gents furnishings we was always pompous and regardless dressers finding that looks went further than anything else in our business except maybe our knowledge of railroad schedules and an autograph photo of the president that loeb sent us probably by mistake andy wrote a nature letter once and sent it in about animals that he had seen caught in a trap lots of times loeb must have read it triplets instead of trap lots and sent the photo anyhow it was useful to us to show people as a guarantee of good faith me and andy never cared much to do business in new york it was too much like pothunting catching suckers in that town is like dynamiting a texas lake for bass all you have to do anywhere between the north and east rivers is to stand in the street with an open bag marked drop packages of money here no checks or loose bills taken you have a cop handy to club pikers who try to chip in post office orders and canadian money and that s all there is to new york for a hunter who loves his profession so me and andy used to just nature fake the town we d get out our spyglasses and watch the woodcocks along the broadway swamps putting plaster casts on their broken legs and then we d sneak away without firing a shot one day in the papier m ch palm room of a chloral hydrate and hops agency in a side street about eight inches off broadway me and andy had thrust upon us the acquaintance of a new yorker we had beer together until we discovered that each of us knew a man named hellsmith traveling for a stove factory in duluth this caused us to remark that the world was a very small place and then this new yorker busts his string and takes off his tin foil and excelsior packing and starts in giving us his ellen terris beginning with the time he used to sell shoelaces to the indians on the spot where tammany hall now stands this new yorker had made his money keeping a cigar store in beekman street and he hadn t been above fourteenth street in ten years moreover he had whiskers and the time had gone by when a true sport will do anything to a man with whiskers no grafter except a boy who is soliciting subscribers to an illustrated weekly to win the prize air rifle or a widow would have the heart to tamper with the man behind with the razor he was a typical city reub i d bet the man hadn t been out of sight of a skyscraper in twenty five years well presently this metropolitan backwoodsman pulls out a roll of bills with an old blue sleeve elastic fitting tight around it and opens it up there s mr peters says he shoving it over the table to me saved during my fifteen years of business put that in your pocket and keep it for me mr peters i m glad to meet you gentlemen from the west and i may take a drop too much i want you to take care of my money for me now let s have another beer you d better keep this yourself says i we are strangers to you and you can t trust everybody you meet put your roll back in your pocket says i and you d better run along home before some farm hand from the kaw river bottoms strolls in here and sells you a copper mine oh i don t know says whiskers i guess little old new york can take care of herself i guess i know a man that s on the square when i see him i ve always found the western people all right i ask you as a favor mr peters says he to keep that roll in your pocket for me i know a gentleman when i see him and now let s have some more beer in about ten minutes this fall of manna leans back in his chair and snores andy looks at me and says i reckon i d better stay with him for five minutes or so in case the waiter comes in i went out the side door and walked half a block up the street and then i came back and sat down at the table andy says i i can t do it it s too much like swearing off taxes i can t go off with this man s money without doing something to earn it like taking advantage of the bankrupt act or leaving a bottle of eczema lotion in his pocket to make it look more like a square deal well says andy it does seem kind of hard on one s professional pride to lope off with a bearded pard s competency especially after he has nominated you custodian of his bundle in the sappy insouciance of his urban indiscrimination suppose we wake him up and see if we can formulate some commercial sophistry by which he will be enabled to give us both his money and a good excuse we wakes up whiskers he stretches himself and yawns out the hypothesis that he must have dropped off for a minute and then he says he wouldn t mind sitting in at a little gentleman s game of poker he used to play some when he attended high school in brooklyn and as he was out for a good time why and so forth andy brights up a little at that for it looks like it might be a solution to our financial troubles so we all three go to our hotel further down broadway and have the cards and chips brought up to andy s room i tried once more to make this babe in the horticultural gardens take his five thousand but no keep that little roll for me mr peters says he and oblige i ll ask you fer it when i want it i guess i know when i m among friends a man that s done business on beekman street for twenty years right in the heart of the wisest old village on earth ought to know what he s about i guess i can tell a gentleman from a con man or a flimflammer when i meet him i ve got some odd change in my clothes enough to start the game with i guess he goes through his pockets and rains gold certificates on the table till it looked like a autumn day in a lemon grove picture by turner in the salons andy almost smiled the first round that was dealt this boulevardier slaps down his hand claims low and jack and big casino and rakes in the pot andy always took a pride in his poker playing he got up from the table and looked sadly out of the window at the street cars well gentlemen says the cigar man i don t blame you for not wanting to play i ve forgotten the fine points of the game i guess it s been so long since i indulged now how long are you gentlemen going to be in the city i told him about a week longer he says that ll suit him fine his cousin is coming over from brooklyn that evening and they are going to see the sights of new york his cousin he says is in the artificial limb and lead casket business and hasn t crossed the bridge in eight years they expect to have the time of their lives and he winds up by asking me to keep his roll of money for him till next day i tried to make him take it but it only insulted him to mention it i ll use what i ve got in loose change says he you keep the rest for me i ll drop in on you and mr tucker to morrow afternoon about or says he and we ll have dinner together be good after whiskers had gone andy looked at me curious and doubtful well jeff says he it looks like the ravens are trying to feed us two elijahs so hard that if we turned em down again we ought to have the audubon society after us it won t do to put the crown aside too often i know this is something like paternalism but don t you think opportunity has skinned its knuckles about enough knocking at our door i put my feet up on the table and my hands in my pockets which is an attitude unfavorable to frivolous thoughts andy says i this man with the hirsute whiskers has got us in a predicament we can t move hand or foot with his money you and me have got a gentleman s agreement with fortune that we can t break we ve done business in the west where it s more of a fair game out there the people we skin are trying to skin us even the farmers and the remittance men that the magazines send out to write up goldfields but there s little sport in new york city for rod reel or gun they hunt here with either one of two things a slungshot or a letter of introduction the town has been stocked so full of carp that the game fish are all gone if you spread a net here do you catch legitimate suckers in it such as the lord intended to be caught fresh guys who know it all sports with a little coin and the nerve to play another man s game street crowds out for the fun of dropping a dollar or two and village smarties who know just where the little pea is no sir says i what the grafters live on here is widows and orphans and foreigners who save up a bag of money and hand it out over the first counter they see with an iron railing to it and factory girls and little shopkeepers that never leave the block they do business on that s what they call suckers here they re nothing but canned sardines and all the bait you need to catch em is a pocketknife and a soda cracker now this cigar man i went on is one of the types he s lived twenty years on one street without learning as much as you would in getting a once over shave from a lockjawed barber in a kansas crossroads town but he s a new yorker and he ll brag about that all the time when he isn t picking up live wires or getting in front of street cars or paying out money to wire tappers or standing under a safe that s being hoisted into a skyscraper when a new yorker does loosen up says i it s like the spring decomposition of the ice jam in the allegheny river he ll swamp you with cracked ice and back water if you don t get out of the way it s mighty lucky for us andy says i that this cigar exponent with the parsley dressing saw fit to bedeck us with his childlike trust and altruism for says i this money of his is an eyesore to my sense of rectitude and ethics we can t take it andy you know we can t says i for we haven t a shadow of a title to it not a shadow if there was the least bit of a way we could put in a claim to it i d be willing to see him start in for another twenty years and make another for himself but we haven t sold him anything we haven t been embroiled in a trade or anything commercial he approached us friendly says i and with blind and beautiful idiocy laid the stuff in our hands we ll have to give it back to him when he wants it your arguments says andy are past criticism or comprehension no we can t walk off with the money as things now stand i admire your conscious way of doing business jeff says andy and i wouldn t propose anything that wasn t square in line with your theories of morality and initiative but i ll be away to night and most of to morrow jeff says andy i ve got some business affairs that i want to attend to when this free greenbacks party comes in to morrow afternoon hold him here till i arrive we ve all got an engagement for dinner you know well sir about the next afternoon in trips the cigar man with his eyes half open been having a glorious time mr peters says he took in all the sights i tell you new york is the onliest only now if you don t mind says he i ll lie down on that couch and doze off for about nine minutes before mr tucker comes i m not used to being up all night and to morrow if you don t mind mr peters i ll take that five thousand i met a man last night that s got a sure winner at the racetrack to morrow excuse me for being so impolite as to go to sleep mr peters and so this inhabitant of the second city in the world reposes himself and begins to snore while i sit there musing over things and wishing i was back in the west where you could always depend on a customer fighting to keep his money hard enough to let your conscience take it from him at half past andy comes in and sees the sleeping form i ve been over to trenton says andy pulling a document out of his pocket i think i ve got this matter fixed up all right jeff look at that i open the paper and see that it is a corporation charter issued by the state of new jersey to the peters tucker consolidated and amalgamated aerial franchise development company limited it s to buy up rights of way for airship lines explained andy the legislature wasn t in session but i found a man at a postcard stand in the lobby that kept a stock of charters on hand there are shares says andy expected to reach a par value of i had one blank certificate of stock printed andy takes out the blank and begins to fill it in with a fountain pen the whole bunch says he goes to our friend in dreamland for did you learn his name make it out to bearer says i we put the certificate of stock in the cigar man s hand and went out to pack our suit cases illustration we put the certificate of stock in the cigarman s hand on the ferryboat andy says to me is your conscience easy about taking the money now jeff why shouldn t it be says i are we any better than any other holding corporation conscience in art i never could hold my partner andy tucker down to legitimate ethics of pure swindling said jeff peters to me one day andy had too much imagination to be honest he used to devise schemes of money getting so fraudulent and high financial that they wouldn t have been allowed in the bylaws of a railroad rebate system myself i never believed in taking any man s dollars unless i gave him something for it something in the way of rolled gold jewelry garden seeds lumbago lotion stock certificates stove polish or a crack on the head to show for his money i guess i must have had new england ancestors away back and inherited some of their stanch and rugged fear of the police but andy s family tree was in different kind i don t think he could have traced his descent any further back than a corporation one summer while we was in the middle west working down the ohio valley with a line of family albums headache powders and roach destroyer andy takes one of his notions of high and actionable financiering jeff says he i ve been thinking that we ought to drop these rutabaga fanciers and give our attention to something more nourishing and prolific if we keep on snapshooting these hinds for their egg money we ll be classed as nature fakers how about plunging into the fastnesses of the skyscraper country and biting some big bull caribous in the chest well says i you know my idiosyncrasies i prefer a square non illegal style of business such as we are carrying on now when i take money i want to leave some tangible object in the other fellow s hands for him to gaze at and to distract his attention from my spoor even if it s only a komical kuss trick finger ring for squirting perfume in a friend s eye but if you ve got a fresh idea andy says i let s have a look at it i m not so wedded to petty graft that i would refuse something better in the way of a subsidy i was thinking says andy of a little hunt without horn hound or camera among the great herd of the midas americanus commonly known as the pittsburg millionaires in new york i asks no sir says andy in pittsburg that s their habitat they don t like new york they go there now and then just because it s expected of em a pittsburg millionaire in new york is like a fly in a cup of hot coffee he attracts attention and comment but he don t enjoy it new york ridicules him for blowing so much money in that town of sneaks and snobs and sneers the truth is he don t spend anything while he is there i saw a memorandum of expenses for a ten days trip to bunkum town made by a pittsburg man worth once here s the way he set it down r r fare to and from cab fare to and from hotel hotel bill per day tips total that s the voice of new york goes on andy the town s nothing but a head waiter if you tip it too much it ll go and stand by the door and make fun of you to the hat check boy when a pittsburger wants to spend money and have a good time he stays at home that s where we ll go to catch him well to make a dense story more condensed me and andy cached our paris green and antipyrine powders and albums in a friend s cellar and took the trail to pittsburg andy didn t have any especial prospectus of chicanery and violence drawn up but he always had plenty of confidence that his immoral nature would rise to any occasion that presented itself as a concession to my ideas of self preservation and rectitude he promised that if i should take an active and incriminating part in any little business venture that we might work up there should be something actual and cognizant to the senses of touch sight taste or smell to transfer to the victim for the money so my conscience might rest easy after that i felt better and entered more cheerfully into the foul play andy says i as we strayed through the smoke along the cinderpath they call smithfield street had you figured out how we are going to get acquainted with these coke kings and pig iron squeezers not that i would decry my own worth or system of drawing room deportment and work with the olive fork and pie knife says i but isn t the entree nous into the salons of the stogie smokers going to be harder than you imagined if there s any handicap at all says andy it s our own refinement and inherent culture pittsburg millionaires are a fine body of plain wholehearted unassuming democratic men they are rough but uncivil in their manners and though their ways are boisterous and unpolished under it all they have a great deal of impoliteness and discourtesy nearly every one of em rose from obscurity says andy and they ll live in it till the town gets to using smoke consumers if we act simple and unaffected and don t go too far from the saloons and keep making a noise like an import duty on steel rails we won t have any trouble in meeting some of em socially well andy and me drifted about town three or four days getting our bearings we got to knowing several millionaires by sight one used to stop his automobile in front of our hotel and have a quart of champagne brought out to him when the waiter opened it he d turn it up to his mouth and drink it out of the bottle that showed he used to be a glassblower before he made his money one evening andy failed to come to the hotel for dinner about o clock he came into my room landed one jeff says he twelve millions oil rolling mills real estate and natural gas he s a fine man no airs about him made all his money in the last five years he s got professors posting him up now in education art and literature and haberdashery and such things when i saw him he d just won a bet of with a steel corporation man that there d be four suicides in the allegheny rolling mills to day so everybody in sight had to walk up and have drinks on him he took a fancy to me and asked me to dinner with him we went to a restaurant in diamond alley and sat on stools and had a sparkling moselle and clam chowder and apple fritters then he wanted to show me his bachelor apartment on liberty street he s got ten rooms over a fish market with privilege of the bath on the next floor above he told me it cost him to furnish his apartment and i believe it he s got worth of pictures in one room and worth of curios and antiques in another his name s scudder and he s and taking lessons on the piano and barrels of oil a day out of his wells all right says i preliminary canter satisfactory but kay vooly voo what good is the art junk to us and the oil now that man says andy sitting thoughtfully on the bed ain t what you would call an ordinary scutt when he was showing me his cabinet of art curios his face lighted up like the door of a coke oven he says that if some of his big deals go through he ll make j p morgan s collection of sweatshop tapestry and augusta me beadwork look like the contents of an ostrich s craw thrown on a screen by a magic lantern and then he showed me a little carving went on andy that anybody could see was a wonderful thing it was something like years old he said it was a lotus flower with a woman s face in it carved out of a solid piece of ivory scudder looks it up in a catalogue and describes it an egyptian carver named khafra made two of em for king rameses ii about the year b c the other one can t be found the junkshops and antique bugs have rubbered all europe for it but it seems to be out of stock scudder paid for the one he has oh well says i this sounds like the purling of a rill to me i thought we came here to teach the millionaires business instead of learning art from em be patient says andy kindly maybe we will see a rift in the smoke ere long all the next morning andy was out i didn t see him until about noon he came to the hotel and called me into his room across the hall he pulled a roundish bundle about as big as a goose egg out of his pocket and unwrapped it it was an ivory carving just as he had described the millionaire s to me i went in an old second hand store and pawnshop a while ago says andy and i see this half hidden under a lot of old daggers and truck the pawnbroker said he d had it several years and thinks it was soaked by some arabs or turks or some foreign dubs that used to live down by the river i offered him for it and i must have looked like i wanted it for he said it would be taking the pumpernickel out of his children s mouths to hold any conversation that did not lead up to a price of i finally got it for jeff goes on andy this is the exact counterpart of scudder s carving it s absolutely a dead ringer for it he ll pay for it as quick as he d tuck a napkin under his chin and why shouldn t it be the genuine other one anyhow that the old gypsy whittled out why not indeed says i and how shall we go about compelling him to make a voluntary purchase of it andy had his plan all ready and i ll tell you how we carried it out i got a pair of blue spectacles put on my black frock coat rumpled my hair up and became prof pickleman i went to another hotel registered and sent a telegram to scudder to come to see me at once on important art business the elevator dumped him on me in less than an hour he was a foggy man with a clarion voice smelling of connecticut wrappers and naphtha hello profess he shouts how s your conduct i rumpled my hair some more and gave him a blue glass stare sir says i are you cornelius t scudder of pittsburg pennsylvania i am says he come out and have a drink i ve neither the time nor the desire says i for such harmful and deleterious amusements i have come from new york says i on a matter of busi on a matter of art i learned there that you are the owner of an egyptian ivory carving of the time of rameses ii representing the head of queen isis in a lotus flower there were only two of such carvings made one has been lost for many years i recently discovered and purchased the other in a pawn in an obscure museum in vienna i wish to purchase yours name your price well the great ice jams profess says scudder have you found the other one me sell no i don t guess cornelius scudder needs to sell anything that he wants to keep have you got the carving with you profess i shows it to scudder he examines it careful all over it s the article says he it s a duplicate of mine every line and curve of it tell you what i ll do he says i won t sell but i ll buy give you for yours since you won t sell i will says i large bills please i m a man of few words i must return to new york to night i lecture to morrow at the aquarium scudder sends a check down and the hotel cashes it he goes off with his piece of antiquity and i hurry back to andy s hotel according to arrangement andy is walking up and down the room looking at his watch well he says twenty five hundred says i cash we ve got just eleven minutes says andy to catch the b o westbound grab your baggage what s the hurry says i it was a square deal and even if it was only an imitation of the original carving it ll take him some time to find it out he seemed to be sure it was the genuine article it was says andy it was his own when i was looking at his curios yesterday he stepped out of the room for a moment and i pocketed it now will you pick up your suit case and hurry then says i why was that story about finding another one in the pawn oh says andy out of respect for that conscience of yours come on the man higher up across our two dishes of spaghetti in a corner of provenzano s restaurant jeff peters was explaining to me the three kinds of graft every winter jeff comes to new york to eat spaghetti to watch the shipping in east river from the depths of his chinchilla overcoat and to lay in a supply of chicago made clothing at one of the fulton street stores during the other three seasons he may be found further west his range is from spokane to tampa in his profession he takes a pride which he supports and defends with a serious and unique philosophy of ethics his profession is no new one he is an incorporated uncapitalized unlimited asylum for the reception of the restless and unwise dollars of his fellowmen in the wilderness of stone in which jeff seeks his annual lonely holiday he is glad to palaver of his many adventures as a boy will whistle after sundown in a wood wherefore i mark on my calendar the time of his coming and open a question of privilege at provenzano s concerning the little wine stained table in the corner between the rakish rubber plant and the framed palazzio della something on the wall there are two kinds of graft said jeff that ought to be wiped out by law i mean wall street speculation and burglary nearly everybody will agree with you as to one of them said i with a laugh well burglary ought to be wiped out too said jeff and i wondered whether the laugh had been redundant about three months ago said jeff it was my privilege to become familiar with a sample of each of the aforesaid branches of illegitimate art i was sine qua grata with a member of the housebreakers union and one of the john d napoleons of finance at the same time interesting combination said i with a yawn did i tell you i bagged a duck and a ground squirrel at one shot last week over in the ramapos i knew well how to draw jeff s stories let me tell you first about these barnacles that clog the wheels of society by poisoning the springs of rectitude with their upas like eye said jeff with the pure gleam of the muck raker in his own as i said three months ago i got into bad company there are two times in a man s life when he does this when he s dead broke and when he s rich now and then the most legitimate business runs out of luck it was out in arkansas i made the wrong turn at a cross road and drives into this town of peavine by mistake it seems i had already assaulted and disfigured peavine the spring of the year before i had sold worth of young fruit trees there plums cherries peaches and pears the peaviners were keeping an eye on the country road and hoping i might pass that way again i drove down main street as far as the crystal palace drugstore before i realized i had committed ambush upon myself and my white horse bill the peaviners took me by surprise and bill by the bridle and began a conversation that wasn t entirely disassociated with the subject of fruit trees a committee of em ran some trace chains through the armholes of my vest and escorted me through their gardens and orchards their fruit trees hadn t lived up to their labels most of em had turned out to be persimmons and dogwoods with a grove or two of blackjacks and poplars the only one that showed any signs of bearing anything was a fine young cottonwood that had put forth a hornet s nest and half of an old corset cover the peaviners protracted our fruitless stroll to the edge of town they took my watch and money on account and they kept bill and the wagon as hostages they said the first time one of them dogwood trees put forth an amsden s june peach i might come back and get my things then they took off the trace chains and jerked their thumbs in the direction of the rocky mountains and i struck a lewis and clark lope for the swollen rivers and impenetrable forests when i regained intellectualness i found myself walking into an unidentified town on the a t s f railroad the peaviners hadn t left anything in my pockets except a plug of chewing they wasn t after my life and that saved it i bit off a chunk and sits down on a pile of ties by the track to recogitate my sensations of thought and perspicacity and then along comes a fast freight which slows up a little at the town and off of it drops a black bundle that rolls for twenty yards in a cloud of dust and then gets up and begins to spit soft coal and interjections i see it is a young man broad across the face dressed more for pullmans than freights and with a cheerful kind of smile in spite of it all that made phoebe snow s job look like a chimney sweep s fall off says i nunk says he got off arrived at my destination what town is this haven t looked it up on the map yet says i i got in about five minutes before you did how does it strike you hard says he twisting one of his arms around i believe that shoulder no it s all right he stoops over to brush the dust off his clothes when out of his pocket drops a fine nine inch burglar s steel jimmy he picks it up and looks at me sharp and then grins and holds out his hand brother says he greetings didn t i see you in southern missouri last summer selling colored sand at half a dollar a teaspoonful to put into lamps to keep the oil from exploding oil says i never explodes it s the gas that forms that explodes but i shakes hands with him anyway my name s bill bassett says he to me and if you ll call it professional pride instead of conceit i ll inform you that you have the pleasure of meeting the best burglar that ever set a gum shoe on ground drained by the mississippi river well me and this bill bassett sits on the ties and exchanges brags as artists in kindred lines will do it seems he didn t have a cent either and we went into close caucus he explained why an able burglar sometimes had to travel on freights by telling me that a servant girl had played him false in little rock and he was making a quick get away it s part of my business says bill bassett to play up to the ruffles when i want to make a riffle as raffles tis loves that makes the bit go round show me a house with a swag in it and a pretty parlor maid and you might as well call the silver melted down and sold and me spilling truffles and that chateau stuff on the napkin under my chin while the police are calling it an inside job just because the old lady s nephew teaches a bible class i first make an impression on the girl says bill and when she lets me inside i make an impression on the locks but this one in little rock done me says he she saw me taking a trolley ride with another girl and when i came round on the night she was to leave the door open for me it was fast and i had keys made for the doors upstairs but no sir she had sure cut off my locks she was a delilah says bill bassett it seems that bill tried to break in anyhow with his jimmy but the girl emitted a succession of bravura noises like the top riders of a tally ho and bill had to take all the hurdles between there and the depot as he had no baggage they tried hard to check his departure but he made a train that was just pulling out well says bill bassett when we had exchanged memories of our dead lives i could eat this town don t look like it was kept under a yale lock suppose we commit some mild atrocity that will bring in temporary expense money i don t suppose you ve brought along any hair tonic or rolled gold watch chains or similar law defying swindles that you could sell on the plaza to the pikers of the paretic populace have you no says i i left an elegant line of patagonian diamond earrings and rainy day sunbursts in my valise at peavine but they re to stay there until some of those black gum trees begin to glut the market with yellow clings and japanese plums i reckon we can t count on them unless we take luther burbank in for a partner very well says bassett we ll do the best we can maybe after dark i ll borrow a hairpin from some lady and open the farmers and drovers marine bank with it while we were talking up pulls a passenger train to the depot near by a person in a high hat gets off on the wrong side of the train and comes tripping down the track towards us he was a little fat man with a big nose and rat s eyes but dressed expensive and carrying a hand satchel careful as if it had eggs or railroads bonds in it he passes by us and keeps on down the track not appearing to notice the town come on says bill bassett to me starting after him where i asks lordy says bill had you forgot you was in the desert didn t you see colonel manna drop down right before your eyes don t you hear the rustling of general raven s wings i m surprised at you elijah we overtook the stranger in the edge of some woods and as it was after sun down and in a quiet place nobody saw us stop him bill takes the silk hat off the man s head and brushes it with his sleeve and puts it back what does this mean sir says the man when i wore one of these says bill and felt embarrassed i always done that not having one now i had to use yours i hardly know how to begin sir in explaining our business with you but i guess we ll try your pockets first bill bassett felt in all of them and looked disgusted not even a watch he says ain t you ashamed of yourself you whited sculpture going about dressed like a head waiter and financed like a count you haven t even got carfare what did you do with your transfer the man speaks up and says he has no assets or valuables of any sort but bassett takes his hand satchel and opens it out comes some collars and socks and a half a page of a newspaper clipped out bill reads the clipping careful and holds out his hand to the held up party brother says he greetings accept the apologies of friends i am bill bassett the burglar mr peters you must make the acquaintance of mr alfred e ricks shake hands mr peters says bill stands about halfway between me and you mr ricks in the line of havoc and corruption he always gives something for the money he gets i m glad to meet you mr ricks you and mr peters this is the first time i ever attended a full gathering of the national synod of sharks housebreaking swindling and financiering all represented please examine mr rick s credentials mr peters the piece of newspaper that bill bassett handed me had a good picture of this ricks on it it was a chicago paper and it had obloquies of ricks in every paragraph by reading it over i harvested the intelligence that said alleged ricks had laid off all that portion of the state of florida that lies under water into town lots and sold em to alleged innocent investors from his magnificently furnished offices in chicago after he had taken in a hundred thousand or so dollars one of these fussy purchasers that are always making trouble i ve had em actually try gold watches i ve sold em with acid took a cheap excursion down to the land where it is always just before supper to look at his lot and see if it didn t need a new paling or two on the fence and market a few lemons in time for the christmas present trade he hires a surveyor to find his lot for him they run the line out and find the flourishing town of paradise hollow so advertised to be about rods and poles s degrees e of the middle of lake okeechobee this man s lot was under thirty six feet of water and besides had been preempted so long by the alligators and gars that his title looked fishy naturally the man goes back to chicago and makes it as hot for alfred e ricks as the morning after a prediction of snow by the weather bureau ricks defied the allegation but he couldn t deny the alligators one morning the papers came out with a column about it and ricks come out by the fire escape it seems the alleged authorities had beat him to the safe deposit box where he kept his winnings and ricks has to westward ho with only feetwear and a dozen and a half english pokes in his shopping bag he happened to have some mileage left in his book and that took him as far as the town in the wilderness where he was spilled out on me and bill bassett as elijah iii with not a raven in sight for any of us then this alfred e ricks lets out a squeak that he is hungry too and denies the hypothesis that he is good for the value let alone the price of a meal and so there was the three of us representing if we had a mind to draw syllogisms and parabolas labor and trade and capital now when trade has no capital there isn t a dicker to be made and when capital has no money there s a stagnation in steak and onions that put it up to the man with the jimmy brother bushrangers says bill bassett never yet in trouble did i desert a pal hard by in yon wood i seem to see unfurnished lodgings let us go there and wait till dark there was an old deserted cabin in the grove and we three took possession of it after dark bill bassett tells us to wait and goes out for half an hour he comes back with a armful of bread and spareribs and pies panhandled em at a farmhouse on washita avenue says he eat drink and be leary the full moon was coming up bright so we sat on the floor of the cabin and ate in the light of it and this bill bassett begins to brag sometimes says he with his mouth full of country produce i lose all patience with you people that think you are higher up in the profession than i am now what could either of you have done in the present emergency to set us on our feet again could you do it ricksy i must confess mr bassett says ricks speaking nearly inaudible out of a slice of pie that at this immediate juncture i could not perhaps promote an enterprise to relieve the situation large operations such as i direct naturally require careful preparation in advance i i know ricksy breaks in bill bassett you needn t finish you need to make the first payment on a blond typewriter and four roomsful of quartered oak furniture and you need more for advertising contracts and you need two weeks time for the fish to begin to bite your line of relief would be about as useful in an emergency as advocating municipal ownership to cure a man suffocated by eighty cent gas and your graft ain t much swifter brother peters he winds up oh says i i haven t seen you turn anything into gold with your wand yet mr good fairy most anybody could rub the magic ring for a little left over victuals that was only getting the pumpkin ready says bassett braggy and cheerful the coach and six ll drive up to the door before you know it miss cinderella maybe you ve got some scheme under your sleeve holders that will give us a start son says i i m fifteen years older than you are and young enough yet to take out an endowment policy i ve been broke before we can see the lights of that town not half a mile away i learned under montague silver the greatest street man that ever spoke from a wagon there are hundreds of men walking those streets this moment with grease spots on their clothes give me a gasoline lamp a dry goods box and a two dollar bar of white castile soap cut into little where s your two dollars snickered bill bassett into my discourse there was no use arguing with that burglar no he goes on you re both babes in the wood finance has closed the mahogany desk and trade has put the shutters up both of you look to labor to start the wheels going all right you admit it to night i ll show you what bill bassett can do bassett tells me and ricks not to leave the cabin till he comes back even if it s daylight and then he starts off toward town whistling gay this alfred e ricks pulls off his shoes and his coat lays a silk handkerchief over his hat and lays down on the floor i think i will endeavor to secure a little slumber he squeaks the day has been fatiguing good night my dear mr peters my regards to morpheus says i i think i ll sit up a while about two o clock as near as i could guess by my watch in peavine home comes our laboring man and kicks up ricks and calls us to the streak of bright moonlight shining in the cabin door then he spreads out five packages of one thousand dollars each on the floor and begins to cackle over the nest egg like a hen i ll tell you a few things about that town says he it s named rocky springs and they re building a masonic temple and it looks like the democratic candidate for mayor is going to get soaked by a pop and judge tucker s wife who has been down with pleurisy is getting some better i had a talk on these liliputian thesises before i could get a siphon in the fountain of knowledge that i was after and there s a bank there called the lumberman s fidelity and plowman s savings institution it closed for business yesterday with cash on hand it will open this morning with all silver that s the reason i didn t bring more there you are trade and capital now will you be bad my young friend says alfred e ricks holding up his hands have you robbed this bank dear me dear me you couldn t call it that says bassett robbing sounds harsh all i had to do was to find out what street it was on that town is so quiet that i could stand on the corner and hear the tumblers clicking in that safe lock right to left twice to right once to left to as plain as the yale captain giving orders in the football dialect now boys says bassett this is an early rising town they tell me the citizens are all up and stirring before daylight i asked what for and they said because breakfast was ready at that time and what of merry robin hood it must be yoicks and away with the tinkers chorus i ll stake you how much do you want speak up capital my dear young friend says this ground squirrel of a ricks standing on his hind legs and juggling nuts in his paws i have friends in denver who would assist me if i had a hundred dollars i basset unpins a package of the currency and throws five twenties to ricks trade how much he says to me put your money up labor says i i never yet drew upon honest toil for its hard earned pittance the dollars i get are surplus ones that are burning the pockets of damfools and greenhorns when i stand on a street corner and sell a solid gold diamond ring to a yap for i make just and i know he s going to give it to a girl in return for all the benefits accruing from a ring his profits are which of us is the biggest fakir and when you sell a poor woman a pinch of sand for fifty cents to keep her lamp from exploding says bassett what do you figure her gross earnings to be with sand at forty cents a ton listen says i i instruct her to keep her lamp clean and well filled if she does that it can t burst and with the sand in it she knows it can t and she don t worry it s a kind of industrial christian science she pays fifty cents and gets both rockefeller and mrs eddy on the job it ain t everybody that can let the gold dust twins do their work alfred e ricks all but licks the dust off of bill bassett s shoes my dear young friend says he i will never forget your generosity heaven will reward you but let me implore you to turn from your ways of violence and crime mousie says bill the hole in the wainscoting for yours your dogmas and inculcations sound to me like the last words of a bicycle pump what has your high moral elevator service system of pillage brought you to penuriousness and want even brother peters who insists upon contaminating the art of robbery with theories of commerce and trade admitted he was on the lift both of you live by the gilded rule brother peters says bill you d better choose a slice of this embalmed currency you re welcome i told bill bassett once more to put his money in his pocket i never had the respect for burglary that some people have i always gave something for the money i took even if it was only some little trifle for a souvenir to remind em not to get caught again and then alfred e ricks grovels at bill s feet again and bids us adieu he says he will have a team at a farmhouse and drive to the station below and take the train for denver it salubrified the atmosphere when that lamentable boll worm took his departure he was a disgrace to every non industrial profession in the country with all his big schemes and fine offices he had wound up unable even to get an honest meal except by the kindness of a strange and maybe unscrupulous burglar i was glad to see him go though i felt a little sorry for him now that he was ruined forever what could such a man do without a big capital to work with why alfred e ricks as we left him was as helpless as turtle on its back he couldn t have worked a scheme to beat a little girl out of a penny slate pencil when me and bill bassett was left alone i did a little sleight of mind turn in my head with a trade secret at the end of it thinks i i ll show this mr burglar man the difference between business and labor he had hurt some of my professional self adulation by casting his persians upon commerce and trade i won t take any of your money as a gift mr bassett says i to him but if you ll pay my expenses as a travelling companion until we get out of the danger zone of the immoral deficit you have caused in this town s finances to night i ll be obliged bill bassett agreed to that and we hiked westward as soon as we could catch a safe train when we got to a town in arizona called los perros i suggested that we once more try our luck on terra cotta that was the home of montague silver my old instructor now retired from business i knew monty would stake me to web money if i could show him a fly buzzing round the locality bill bassett said all towns looked alike to him as he worked mainly in the dark so we got off the train in los perros a fine little town in the silver region i had an elegant little sure thing in the way of a commercial slungshot that i intended to hit bassett behind the ear with i wasn t going to take his money while he was asleep but i was going to leave him with a lottery ticket that would represent in experience to him i think that was the amount he had when we got off the train but the first time i hinted to him about an investment he turns on me and disencumbers himself of the following terms and expressions brother peters says he it ain t a bad idea to go into an enterprise of some kind as you suggest i think i will but if i do it will be such a cold proposition that nobody but robert e peary and charlie fairbanks will be able to sit on the board of directors i thought you might want to turn your money over says i i do says he frequently i can t sleep on one side all night i ll tell you brother peters says he i m going to start a poker room i don t seem to care for the humdrum in swindling such as peddling egg beaters and working off breakfast food on barnum and bailey for sawdust to strew in their circus rings but the gambling business says he from the profitable side of the table is a good compromise between swiping silver spoons and selling penwipers at a waldorf astoria charity bazar then says i mr bassett you don t care to talk over my little business proposition why says he do you know you can t get a pasteur institute to start up within fifty miles of where i live i bite so seldom so bassett rents a room over a saloon and looks around for some furniture and chromos the same night i went to monty silver s house and he let me have on my prospects then i went to the only store in los perros that sold playing cards and bought every deck in the house the next morning when the store opened i was there bringing all the cards back with me i said that my partner that was going to back me in the game had changed his mind and i wanted to sell the cards back again the storekeeper took em at half price yes i was seventy five dollars loser up to that time but while i had the cards that night i marked every one in every deck that was labor and then trade and commerce had their innings and the bread i had cast upon the waters began to come back in the form of cottage pudding with wine sauce of course i was among the first to buy chips at bill bassett s game he had bought the only cards there was to be had in town and i knew the back of every one of them better than i know the back of my head when the barber shows me my haircut in the two mirrors when the game closed i had the five thousand and a few odd dollars and all bill bassett had was the wanderlust and a black cat he had bought for a mascot bill shook hands with me when i left brother peters says he i have no business being in business i was preordained to labor when a no burglar tries to make a james out of his jimmy he perpetrates an improfundity you have a well oiled and efficacious system of luck at cards says he peace go with you and i never afterward sees bill bassett again well jeff said i when the autolycan adventurer seemed to have divulged the gist of his tale i hope you took care of the money that would be a respecta that is a considerable working capital if you should choose some day to settle down to some sort of regular business me said jeff virtuously you can bet i ve taken care of that five thousand he tapped his coat over the region of his chest exultantly gold mining stock he explained every cent of it shares par value one dollar bound to go up per cent within a year non assessable the blue gopher mine just discovered a month ago better get in yourself if you ve any spare dollars on hand sometimes said i these mines are not oh this one s solid as an old goose said jeff fifty thousand dollars worth of ore in sight and per cent monthly earnings guaranteed he drew out a long envelope from his pocket and cast it on the table always carry it with me said he so the burglar can t corrupt or the capitalist break in and water it i looked at the beautifully engraved certificate of stock in colorado i see said i and by the way jeff what was the name of the little man who went to denver the one you and bill met at the station alfred e ricks said jeff was the toad s designation i see said i the president of this mining company signs himself a l fredericks i was wondering let me see that stock said jeff quickly almost snatching it from me to mitigate even though slightly the embarrassment i summoned the waiter and ordered another bottle of the barbera i thought it was the least i could do a tempered wind the first time my optical nerves was disturbed by the sight of buckingham skinner was in kansas city i was standing on a corner when i see buck stick his straw colored head out of a third story window of a business block and holler whoa there whoa like you would in endeavoring to assuage a team of runaway mules i looked around but all the animals i see in sight is a policeman having his shoes shined and a couple of delivery wagons hitched to posts then in a minute downstairs tumbles this buckingham skinner and runs to the corner and stands and gazes down the other street at the imaginary dust kicked up by the fabulous hoofs of the fictitious team of chimerical quadrupeds and then b skinner goes back up to the third story room again and i see that the lettering on the window is the farmers friend loan company by and by straw top comes down again and i crossed the street to meet him for i had my ideas yes sir when i got close i could see where he overdone it he was reub all right as far as his blue jeans and cowhide boots went but he had a matinee actor s hands and the rye straw stuck over his ear looked like it belonged to the property man of the old homestead co curiosity to know what his graft was got the best of me was that your team broke away and run just now i asks him polite i tried to stop em says i but i couldn t i guess they re half way back to the farm by now gosh blame them darned mules says straw top in a voice so good that i nearly apologized they re a lus bustin loose and then he looks at me close and then he takes off his hayseed hat and says in a different voice i d like to shake hands with parleyvoo pickens the greatest street man in the west barring only montague silver which you can no more than allow i let him shake hands with me i learned under silver i said i don t begrudge him the lead but what s your graft son i admit that the phantom flight of the non existing animals at which you remarked whoa has puzzled me somewhat how do you win out on the trick buckingham skinner blushed pocket money says he that s all i am temporarily unfinanced this little coup de rye straw is good for forty dollars in a town of this size how do i work it why i involve myself as you perceive in the loathsome apparel of the rural dub thus embalmed i am jonas stubblefield a name impossible to improve upon i repair noisily to the office of some loan company conveniently located in the third floor front there i lay my hat and yarn gloves on the floor and ask to mortgage my farm for to pay for my sister s musical education in europe loans like that always suit the loan companies it s ten to one that when the note falls due the foreclosure will be leading the semiquavers by a couple of lengths well sir i reach in my pocket for the abstract of title but i suddenly hear my team running away i run to the window and emit the word or exclamation which ever it may be viz whoa then i rush down stairs and down the street returning in a few minutes dang them mules i says they done run away and busted the doubletree and two traces now i got to hoof it home for i never brought no money along reckon we ll talk about that loan some other time gen lemen then i spreads out my tarpaulin like the israelites and waits for the manna to drop why no mr stubblefield says the lobster colored party in the specs and dotted pique vest oblige us by accepting this ten dollar bill until to morrow get your harness repaired and call in at ten we ll be pleased to accommodate you in the matter of this loan it s a slight thing says buckingham skinner modest but as i said only for temporary loose change it s nothing to be ashamed of says i in respect for his mortification in case of an emergency of course it s small compared to organizing a trust or bridge whist but even the chicago university had to be started in a small way what s your graft these days buckingham skinner asks me the legitimate says i i m handling rhinestones and dr oleum sinapi s electric headache battery and the swiss warbler s bird call a small lot of the new queer ones and twos and the bonanza budget consisting of a rolled gold wedding and engagement ring six egyptian lily bulbs a combination pickle fork and nail clipper and fifty engraved visiting cards no two names alike all for the sum of cents two months ago says buckingham skinner i was doing well down in texas with a patent instantaneous fire kindler made of compressed wood ashes and benzine i sold loads of em in towns where they like to burn niggers quick without having to ask somebody for a light and just when i was doing the best they strikes oil down there and puts me out of business your machine s too slow now pardner they tells me we can have a coon in hell with this here petroleum before your old flint and tinder truck can get him warm enough to perfess religion and so i gives up the kindler and drifts up here to k c this little curtain raiser you seen me doing mr pickens with the simulated farm and the hypothetical teams ain t in my line at all and i m ashamed you found me working it no man says i kindly need to be ashamed of putting the skibunk on a loan corporation for even so small a sum as ten dollars when he is financially abashed still it wasn t quite the proper thing it s too much like borrowing money without paying it back i liked buckingham skinner from the start for as good a man as ever stood over the axles and breathed gasoline smoke and pretty soon we gets thick and i let him in on a scheme i d had in mind for some time and offers to go partners anything says buck that is not actually dishonest will find me willing and ready let us perforate into the inwardness of your proposition i feel degraded when i am forced to wear property straw in my hair and assume a bucolic air for the small sum of ten dollars actually mr pickens it makes me feel like the ophelia of the great occidental all star one night consolidated theatrical aggregation this scheme of mine was one that suited my proclivities by nature i am some sentimental and have always felt gentle toward the mollifying elements of existence i am disposed to be lenient with the arts and sciences and i find time to instigate a cordiality for the more human works of nature such as romance and the atmosphere and grass and poetry and the seasons i never skin a sucker without admiring the prismatic beauty of his scales i never sell a little auriferous beauty to the man with the hoe without noticing the beautiful harmony there is between gold and green and that s why i liked this scheme it was so full of outdoor air and landscapes and easy money we had to have a young lady assistant to help us work this graft and i asked buck if he knew of one to fill the bill one says i that is cool and wise and strictly business from her pompadour to her oxfords no ex toe dancers or gum chewers or crayon portrait canvassers for this buck claimed he knew a suitable feminine and he takes me around to see miss sarah malloy the minute i see her i am pleased she looked to be the goods as ordered no sign of the three p s about her no peroxide patchouli nor peau de soie about twenty two brown hair pleasant ways the kind of a lady for the place a description of the sandbag if you please she begins why ma am says i this graft of ours is so nice and refined and romantic it would make the balcony scene in romeo and juliet look like second story work we talked it over and miss malloy agreed to come in as a business partner she said she was glad to get a chance to give up her place as stenographer and secretary to a suburban lot company and go into something respectable this is the way we worked our scheme first i figured it out by a kind of a proverb the best grafts in the world are built up on copy book maxims and psalms and proverbs and esau s fables they seem to kind of hit off human nature our peaceful little swindle was constructed on the old saying the whole push loves a lover one evening buck and miss malloy drives up like blazes in a buggy to a farmer s door she is pale but affectionate clinging to his arm always clinging to his arm any one can see that she is a peach and of the cling variety they claim they are eloping for to be married on account of cruel parents they ask where they can find a preacher farmer says b gum there ain t any preacher nigher than reverend abels four miles over on caney creek farmeress wipes her hand on her apron and rubbers through her specs illustration she is a peach and of the cling variety then lo and look ye up the road from the other way jogs parleyvoo pickens in a gig dressed in black white necktie long face sniffing his nose emitting a spurious kind of noise resembling the long meter doxology b jinks says farmer if thar ain t a preacher now it transpires that i am rev abijah green travelling over to little bethel school house for to preach next sunday the young folks will have it they must be married for pa is pursuing them with the plow mules and the buckboard so the reverend green after hesitating marries em in the farmer s parlor and farmer grins and has in cider and says b gum and farmeress sniffles a bit and pats the bride on the shoulder and parleyvoo pickens the wrong reverend writes out a marriage certificate and farmer and farmeress sign it as witnesses and the parties of the first second and third part gets in their vehicles and rides away oh that was an idyllic graft true love and the lowing kine and the sun shining on the red barns it certainly had all other impostures i know about beat to a batter so the reverend green after hesitations marries em in the farmer s parlor i suppose i happened along in time to marry buck and miss malloy at about twenty farm houses i hated to think how the romance was going to fade later on when all them marriage certificates turned up in banks where we d discounted em and the farmers had to pay them notes of hand they d signed running from to on the th day of may us three divided about miss malloy nearly cried with joy you don t often see a tenderhearted girl or one that is bent on doing right boys says she dabbing her eyes with a little handkerchief this stake comes in handier than a powder rag at a fat men s ball it gives me a chance to reform i was trying to get out of the real estate business when you fellows came along but if you hadn t taken me in on this neat little proposition for removing the cuticle of the rutabaga propagators i m afraid i d have got into something worse i was about to accept a place in one of these women s auxiliary bazars where they build a parsonage by selling a spoonful of chicken salad and a cream puff for seventy five cents and calling it a business man s lunch now i can go into a square honest business and give all them queer jobs the shake i m going to cincinnati and start a palm reading and clairvoyant joint as madame saramaloi the egyptian sorceress i shall give everybody a dollar s worth of good honest prognostication good by boys take my advice and go into some decent fake get friendly with the police and newspapers and you ll be all right so then we all shook hands and miss malloy left us me and buck also rose up and sauntered off a few hundred miles for we didn t care to be around when them marriage certificates fell due with about between us we hit that bumptious little town off the new jersey coast they call new york if there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that yaptown on the hudson cosmopolitan they call it you bet so s a piece of fly paper you listen close when they re buzzing and trying to pull their feet out of the sticky stuff little old new york s good enough for us that s what they sing there s enough reubs walk down broadway in one hour to buy up a week s output of the factory in augusta maine that makes knaughty knovelties and the little phine phun oroide gold finger ring that sticks a needle in your friend s hand you d think new york people was all wise but no they don t get a chance to learn everything s too compressed even the hayseeds are baled hayseeds but what else can you expect from a town that s shut off from the world by the ocean on one side and new jersey on the other it s no place for an honest grafter with a small capital there s too big a protective tariff on bunco even when giovanni sells a quart of warm worms and chestnut hulls he has to hand out a pint to an insectivorous cop and the hotel man charges double for everything in the bill that he sends by the patrol wagon to the altar where the duke is about to marry the heiress but old badville near coney is the ideal burg for a refined piece of piracy if you can pay the bunco duty imported grafts come pretty high the custom house officers that look after it carry clubs and it s hard to smuggle in even a bib and tucker swindle to work brooklyn with unless you can pay the toll but now me and buck having capital descends upon new york to try and trade the metropolitan backwoodsmen a few glass beads for real estate just as the vans did a hundred or two years ago at an east side hotel we gets acquainted with romulus g atterbury a man with the finest head for financial operations i ever saw it was all bald and glossy except for gray side whiskers seeing that head behind an office railing and you d deposit a million with it without a receipt this atterbury was well dressed though he ate seldom and the synopsis of his talk would make the conversation of a siren sound like a cab driver s kick he said he used to be a member of the stock exchange but some of the big capitalists got jealous and formed a ring that forced him to sell his seat atterbury got to liking me and buck and he begun to throw on the canvas for us some of the schemes that had caused his hair to evacuate he had one scheme for starting a national bank on that made the mississippi bubble look as solid as a glass marble he talked this to us for three days and when his throat was good and sore we told him about the roll we had atterbury borrowed a quarter from us and went out and got a box of throat lozenges and started all over again this time he talked bigger things and he got us to see em as he did the scheme he laid out looked like a sure winner and he talked me and buck into putting our capital against his burnished dome of thought it looked all right for a kid gloved graft it seemed to be just about an inch and a half outside of the reach of the police and as money making as a mint it was just what me and buck wanted a regular business at a permanent stand with an open air spieling with tonsilitis on the street corners every evening so in six weeks you see a handsome furnished set of offices down in the wall street neighborhood with the golconda gold bond and investment company in gilt letters on the door and you see in his private room with the door open the secretary and treasurer mr buckingham skinner costumed like the lilies of the conservatory with his high silk hat close to his hand nobody yet ever saw buck outside of an instantaneous reach for his hat and you might perceive the president and general manager mr r g atterbury with his priceless polished poll busy in the main office room dictating letters to a shorthand countess who has got pomp and a pompadour that is no less than a guarantee to investors there is a bookkeeper and an assistant and a general atmosphere of varnish and culpability at another desk the eye is relieved by the sight of an ordinary man attired with unscrupulous plainness sitting with his feet up eating apples with his obnoxious hat on the back of his head that man is no other than colonel tecumseh once parleyvoo pickens the vice president of the company no recherch rags for me i says to atterbury when we was organizing the stage properties of the robbery i m a plain man says i and i do not use pajamas french or military hair brushes cast me for the role of the rhinestone in the rough or i don t go on exhibition if you can use me in my natural though displeasing form do so dress you up says atterbury i should say not just as you are you re worth more to the business than a whole roomful of the things they pin chrysanthemums on you re to play the part of the solid but disheveled capitalist from the far west you despise the conventions you ve got so many stocks you can afford to shake socks conservative homely rough shrewd saving that s your pose it s a winner in new york keep your feet on the desk and eat apples whenever anybody comes in eat an apple let em see you stuff the peelings in a drawer of your desk look as economical and rich and rugged as you can i followed out atterbury s instructions i played the rocky mountain capitalist without ruching or frills the way i deposited apple peelings to my credit in a drawer when any customers came in made hetty green look like a spendthrift i could hear atterbury saying to victims as he smiled at me indulgent and venerating that s our vice president colonel pickens fortune in western investments delightfully plain manners but could sign his check for half a million simple as a child wonderful head conservative and careful almost to a fault atterbury managed the business me and buck never quite understood all of it though he explained it to us in full it seems the company was a kind of cooperative one and everybody that bought stock shared in the profits first we officers bought up a controlling interest we had to have that of the shares at cents a hundred just what the printer charged us and the rest went to the public at a dollar each the company guaranteed the stockholders a profit of ten per cent each month payable on the last day thereof when any stockholder had paid in as much as the company issued him a gold bond and he became a bondholder i asked atterbury one day what benefits and appurtenances these gold bonds was to an investor more so than the immunities and privileges enjoyed by the common sucker who only owned stock atterbury picked up one of them gold bonds all gilt and lettered up with flourishes and a big red seal tied with a blue ribbon in a bowknot and he looked at me like his feelings was hurt my dear colonel pickens says he you have no soul for art think of a thousand homes made happy by possessing one of these beautiful gems of the lithographer s skill think of the joy in the household where one of these gold bonds hangs by a pink cord to the what not or is chewed by the baby caroling gleefully upon the floor ah i see your eye growing moist colonel i have touched you have i not you have not says i for i ve been watching you the moisture you see is apple juice you can t expect one man to act as a human cider press and an art connoisseur too atterbury attended to the details of the concern as i understand it they was simple the investors in stock paid in their money and well i guess that s all they had to do the company received it and i don t call to mind anything else me and buck knew more about selling corn salve than we did about wall street but even we could see how the golconda gold bond investment company was making money you take in money and pay back ten per cent of it it s plain enough that you make a clean legitimate profit of per cent less expenses as long as the fish bite atterbury wanted to be president and treasurer too but buck winks an eye at him and says you was to furnish the brains do you call it good brain work when you propose to take in money at the door too think again i hereby nominate myself treasurer ad valorem sine die and by acclamation i chip in that much brain work free me and pickens we furnished the capital and we ll handle the unearned increment as it incremates it costs us for office rent and first payment on furniture more went for printing and advertising atterbury knew his business three months to a minute we ll last says he a day longer than that and we ll have to either go under or go under an alias by that time we ought to clean up and then a money belt and a lower berth for me and the yellow journals and the furniture men can pick the bones our ads done the work country weeklies and washington hand press dailies of course says i when we was ready to make contracts man says atterbury as its advertising manager you would cause a limburger cheese factory to remain undiscovered during a hot summer the game we re after is right here in new york and brooklyn and the harlem reading rooms they re the people that the street car fenders and the answers to correspondents columns and the pickpocket notices are made for we want our ads in the biggest city dailies top of column next to editorials on radium and pictures of the girl doing health exercises pretty soon the money begins to roll in buck didn t have to pretend to be busy his desk was piled high up with money orders and checks and greenbacks people began to drop in the office and buy stock every day most of the shares went in small amounts and and and a good many and lots and the bald and inviolate cranium of president atterbury shines with enthusiasm and demerit while colonel tecumseh pickens the rude but reputable croesus of the west consumes so many apples that the peelings hang to the floor from the mahogany garbage chest that he calls his desk just as atterbury said we ran along about three months without being troubled buck cashed the paper as fast as it came in and kept the money in a safe deposit vault a block or so away buck never thought much of banks for such purposes we paid the interest regular on the stock we d sold so there was nothing for anybody to squeal about we had nearly on hand and all three of us had been living as high as prize fighters out of training one morning as me and buck sauntered into the office fat and flippant from our noon grub we met an easy looking fellow with a bright eye and a pipe in his mouth coming out we found atterbury looking like he d been caught a mile from home in a wet shower know that man he asked us we said we didn t i don t either says atterbury wiping off his head but i ll bet enough gold bonds to paper a cell in the tombs that he s a newspaper reporter what did he want asks buck information says our president said he was thinking of buying some stock he asked me about nine hundred questions and every one of em hit some sore place in the business i know he s on a paper you can t fool me you see a man about half shabby with an eye like a gimlet smoking cut plug with dandruff on his coat collar and knowing more than j p morgan and shakespeare put together if that ain t a reporter i never saw one i was afraid of this i don t mind detectives and post office inspectors i talk to em eight minutes and then sell em stock but them reporters take the starch out of my collar boys i recommend that we declare a dividend and fade away the signs point that way me and buck talked to atterbury and got him to stop sweating and stand still that fellow didn t look like a reporter to us reporters always pull out a pencil and tablet on you and tell you a story you ve heard and strikes you for the drinks but atterbury was shaky and nervous all day the next day me and buck comes down from the hotel about ten thirty on the way we buys the papers and the first thing we see is a column on the front page about our little imposition it was a shame the way that reporter intimated that we were no blood relatives of the late george w childs he tells all about the scheme as he sees it in a rich racy kind of a guying style that might amuse most anybody except a stockholder yes atterbury was right it behooveth the gaily clad treasurer and the pearly pated president and the rugged vice president of the golconda gold bond and investment company to go away real sudden and quick that their days might be longer upon the land me and buck hurries down to the office we finds on the stairs and in the hall a crowd of people trying to squeeze into our office which is already jammed full inside to the railing they ve nearly all got golconda stock and gold bonds in their hands me and buck judged they d been reading the papers too we stopped and looked at our stockholders some surprised it wasn t quite the kind of a gang we supposed had been investing they all looked like poor people there was plenty of old women and lots of young girls that you d say worked in factories and mills some was old men that looked like war veterans and some was crippled and a good many was just kids bootblacks and newsboys and messengers some was working men in overalls with their sleeves rolled up not one of the gang looked like a stockholder in anything unless it was a peanut stand but they all had golconda stock and looked as sick as you please i saw a queer kind of a pale look come on buck s face when he sized up the crowd he stepped up to a sickly looking woman and says madam do you own any of this stock i put in a hundred dollars says the woman faint like it was all i had saved in a year one of my children is dying at home now and i haven t a cent in the house i came to see if i could draw out some the circulars said you could draw it at any time but they say now i will lose it all there was a smart kind of kid in the gang i guess he was a newsboy i got in twenty fi mister he says looking hopeful at buck s silk hat and clothes dey paid me two fifty a mont on it say a man tells me dey can t do dat and be on de square is dat straight do you guess i can get out my twenty fi some of the old women was crying the factory girls was plumb distracted they d lost all their savings and they d be docked for the time they lost coming to see about it there was one girl a pretty one in a red shawl crying in a corner like her heart would dissolve buck goes over and asks her about it it ain t so much losing the money mister says she shaking all over though i ve been two years saving it up but jakey won t marry me now he ll take rosa steinfeld i know j j jakey she s got in the savings bank ai ai ai she sings out buck looks all around with that same funny look on his face and then we see leaning against the wall puffing at his pipe with his eye shining at us this newspaper reporter buck and me walks over to him you re a real interesting writer says buck how far do you mean to carry it anything more up your sleeve oh i m just waiting around says the reporter smoking away in case any news turns up it s up to your stockholders now some of them might complain you know isn t that the patrol wagon now he says listening to a sound outside no he goes on that s doc whittleford s old cadaver coup from the roosevelt i ought to know that gong yes i suppose i ve written some interesting stuff at times you wait says buck i m going to throw an item of news in your way buck reaches in his pocket and hands me a key i knew what he meant before he spoke confounded old buccaneer i knew what he meant they don t make them any better than buck pick says he looking at me hard ain t this graft a little out of our line do we want jakey to marry rosa steinfeld you ve got my vote says i i ll have it here in ten minutes and i starts for the safe deposit vaults i comes back with the money done up in a big bundle and then buck and me takes the journalist reporter around to another door and we let ourselves into one of the office rooms now my literary friend says buck take a chair and keep still and i ll give you an interview you see before you two grafters from graftersville grafter county arkansas me and pick have sold brass jewelry hair tonic song books marked cards patent medicines connecticut smyrna rugs furniture polish and albums in every town from old point comfort to the golden gate we ve grafted a dollar whenever we saw one that had a surplus look to it but we never went after the simoleon in the toe of the sock under the loose brick in the corner of the kitchen hearth there s an old saying you may have heard fussily decency averni which means it s an easy slide from the street faker s dry goods box to a desk in wall street we ve took that slide but we didn t know exactly what was at the bottom of it now you ought to be wise but you ain t you ve got new york wiseness which means that you judge a man by the outside of his clothes that ain t right you ought to look at the lining and seams and the button holes while we are waiting for the patrol wagon you might get out your little stub pencil and take notes for another funny piece in the paper and then buck turns to me and says i don t care what atterbury thinks he only put in brains and if he gets his capital out he s lucky but what do you say pick me says i you ought to know me buck i didn t know who was buying the stock all right says buck and then he goes through the inside door into the main office and looks at the gang trying to squeeze through the railing atterbury and his hat was gone and buck makes em a short speech all you lambs get in line you re going to get your wool back don t shove so get in a line a line not in a pile lady will you please stop bleating your money s waiting for you here sonny don t climb over that railing your dimes are safe don t cry sis you ain t out a cent get in line i say here pick come and straighten em out and let em through and out by the other door buck takes off his coat pushes his silk hat on the back of his head and lights up a reina victoria he sets at the table with the boodle before him all done up in neat packages i gets the stockholders strung out and marches em single file through from the main room and the reporter man passes em out of the side door into the hall again as they go by buck takes up the stock and the gold bonds paying em cash dollar for dollar the same as they paid in the shareholders of the golconda gold bond and investment company can t hardly believe it they almost grabs the money out of buck s hands some of the women keep on crying for it s a custom of the sex to cry when they have sorrow to weep when they have joy and to shed tears whenever they find themselves without either the old women s fingers shake when they stuff the skads in the bosom of their rusty dresses the factory girls just stoop over and flap their dry goods a second and you hear the elastic go pop as the currency goes down in the ladies department of the old domestic lisle thread bank some of the stockholders that had been doing the jeremiah act the loudest outside had spasms of restored confidence and wanted to leave the money invested salt away that chicken feed in your duds and skip along says buck what business have you got investing in bonds the tea pot or the crack in the wall behind the clock for your hoard of pennies when the pretty girl in the red shawl cashes in buck hands her an extra twenty a wedding present says our treasurer from the golconda company and say if jakey ever follows his nose even at a respectful distance around the corner where rosa steinfeld lives you are hereby authorized to knock a couple of inches of it off when they was all paid off and gone buck calls the newspaper reporter and shoves the rest of the money over to him you begun this says buck now finish it over there are the books showing every share and bond issued here s the money to cover except what we ve spent to live on you ll have to act as receiver i guess you ll do the square thing on account of your paper this is the best way we know how to settle it me and our substantial but apple weary vice president are going to follow the example of our revered president and skip now have you got enough news for to day or do you want to interview us on etiquette and the best way to make over an old taffeta skirt news says the newspaper man taking his pipe out do you think i could use this i don t want to lose my job suppose i go around to the office and tell em this happened what ll the managing editor say he ll just hand me a pass to bellevue and tell me to come back when i get cured i might turn in a story about a sea serpent wiggling up broadway but i haven t got the nerve to try em with a pipe like this a get rich quick scheme excuse me gang giving back the boodle oh no i m not on the comic supplement you can t understand it of course says buck with his hand on the door knob me and pick ain t wall streeters like you know em we never allowed to swindle sick old women and working girls and take nickels off of kids in the lines of graft we ve worked we took money from the people the lord made to be buncoed sports and rounders and smart alecks and street crowds that always have a few dollars to throw away and farmers that wouldn t ever be happy if the grafters didn t come around and play with em when they sold their crops we never cared to fish for the kind of suckers that bite here no sir we got too much respect for the profession and for ourselves good by to you mr receiver here says the journalist reporter wait a minute there s a broker i know on the next floor wait till i put this truck in his safe i want you fellows to take a drink on me before you go on you says buck winking solemn don t you go and try to make em believe at the office you said that thanks we can t spare the time i reckon so long and me and buck slides out the door and that s the way the golconda company went into involuntary liquefaction if you had seen me and buck the next night you d have had to go to a little bum hotel over near the west side ferry landings we was in a little back room and i was filling up a gross of six ounce bottles with hydrant water colored red with aniline and flavored with cinnamon buck was smoking contented and he wore a decent brown derby in place of his silk hat it s a good thing pick says he as he drove in the corks that we got brady to lend us his horse and wagon for a week we ll rustle up the stake by then this hair tonic ll sell right along over in jersey bald heads ain t popular over there on account of the mosquitoes directly i dragged out my valise and went down in it for labels hair tonic labels are out says i only about a dozen on hand buy some more says buck we investigated our pockets and found we had just enough money to settle our hotel bill in the morning and pay our passage over the ferry plenty of the shake the shakes chill cure labels says i after looking what more do you want says buck slap em on the chill season is just opening up in the hackensack low grounds what s hair anyway if you have to shake it off we pasted on the chill cure labels about half an hour and buck says making an honest livin s better than that wall street anyhow ain t it pick you bet says i hostages to momus i i never got inside of the legitimate line of graft but once but one time as i say i reversed the decision of the revised statutes and undertook a thing that i d have to apologize for even under the new jersey trust laws me and caligula polk of muskogee in the creek nation was down in the mexican state of tamaulipas running a peripatetic lottery and monte game now selling lottery tickets is a government graft in mexico just like selling forty eight cents worth of postage stamps for forty nine cents is over here so uncle porfirio he instructs the rurales to attend to our case rurales they re a sort of country police but don t draw any mental crayon portraits of the worthy constables with a tin star and a gray goatee the rurales well if we d mount our supreme court on broncos arm em with winchesters and start em out after john doe et al we d have about the same thing when the rurales started for us we started for the states they chased us as far as matamoras we hid in a brickyard and that night we swum the rio grande caligula with a brick in each hand absent minded which he drops upon the soil of texas forgetting he had em from there we emigrated to san antone and then over to new orleans where we took a rest and in that town of cotton bales and other adjuncts to female beauty we made the acquaintance of drinks invented by the creoles during the period of louey cans in which they are still served at the side doors the most i can remember of this town is that me and caligula and a frenchman named mccarty wait a minute adolph mccarty was trying to make the french quarter pay up the back trading stamps due on the louisiana purchase when somebody hollers that the johndarms are coming i have an insufficient recollection of buying two yellow tickets through a window and i seemed to see a man swing a lantern and say all aboard i remembered no more except that the train butcher was covering me and caligula up with augusta j evans s works and figs when we become revised we find that we have collided up against the state of georgia at a spot hitherto unaccounted for in time tables except by an asterisk which means that trains stop every other thursday on signal by tearing up a rail we was waked up in a yellow pine hotel by the noise of flowers and the smell of birds yes sir for the wind was banging sunflowers as big as buggy wheels against the weatherboarding and the chicken coop was right under the window me and caligula dressed and went down stairs the landlord was shelling peas on the front porch he was six feet of chills and fever and hongkong in complexion though in other respects he seemed amenable in the exercise of his sentiments and features caligula who is a spokesman by birth and a small man though red haired and impatient of painfulness of any kind speaks up pardner says he good morning and be darned to you would you mind telling us why we are at we know the reason we are where but can t exactly figure out on account of at what place well gentlemen says the landlord i reckoned you all would be inquiring this morning you all dropped off of the nine thirty train here last night and you was right tight yes you was right smart in liquor i can inform you that you are now in the town of mountain valley in the state of georgia on top of that says caligula don t say that we can t have anything to eat sit down gentlemen says the landlord and in twenty minutes i ll call you to the best breakfast you can get anywhere in town that breakfast turned out to be composed of fried bacon and a yellowish edifice that proved up something between pound cake and flexible sandstone the landlord calls it corn pone and then he sets out a dish of the exaggerated breakfast food known as hominy and so me and caligula makes the acquaintance of the celebrated food that enabled every johnny reb to lick one and two thirds yankees for nearly four years at a stretch the wonder to me is says caligula that uncle robert lee s boys didn t chase the grant and sherman outfit clear up into hudson s bay it would have made me that mad to eat this truck they call mahogany hog and hominy i explains is the staple food of this section then says caligula they ought to keep it where it belongs i thought this was a hotel and not a stable now if we was in muskogee at the st lucifer house i d show you some breakfast grub antelope steaks and fried liver to begin on and venison cutlets with chili con carne and pineapple fritters and then some sardines and mixed pickles and top it off with a can of yellow clings and a bottle of beer you won t find a layout like that on the bill of affairs of any of your eastern restauraws too lavish says i i ve traveled and i m unprejudiced there ll never be a perfect breakfast eaten until some man grows arms long enough to stretch down to new orleans for his coffee and over to norfolk for his rolls and reaches up to vermont and digs a slice of butter out of a spring house and then turns over a beehive close to a white clover patch out in indiana for the rest then he d come pretty close to making a meal on the amber that the gods eat on mount olympia too ephemeral says caligula i d want ham and eggs or rabbit stew anyhow for a chaser what do you consider the most edifying and casual in the way of a dinner i ve been infatuated from time to time i answers with fancy ramifications of grub such as terrapins lobsters reed birds jambolaya and canvas covered ducks but after all there s nothing less displeasing to me than a beefsteak smothered in mushrooms on a balcony in sound of the broadway streetcars with a hand organ playing down below and the boys hollering extras about the latest suicide for the wine give me a reasonable ponty cany and that s all except a demi tasse well says caligula i reckon in new york you get to be a conniseer and when you go around with the demi tasse you are naturally bound to buy em stylish grub it s a great town for epicures says i you d soon fall into their ways if you was there i ve heard it was says caligula but i reckon i wouldn t i can polish my fingernails all they need myself ii after breakfast we went out on the front porch lighted up two of the landlord s flor de upas perfectos and took a look at georgia the installment of scenery visible to the eye looked mighty poor as far as we could see was red hills all washed down with gullies and scattered over with patches of piny woods blackberry bushes was all that kept the rail fences from falling down about fifteen miles over to the north was a little range of well timbered mountains that town of mountain valley wasn t going about a dozen people permeated along the sidewalks but what you saw mostly was rain barrels and roosters and boys poking around with sticks in piles of ashes made by burning the scenery of uncle tom shows and just then there passes down on the other side of the street a high man in a long black coat and a beaver hat all the people in sight bowed and some crossed the street to shake hands with him folks came out of stores and houses to holler at him women leaned out of windows and smiled and all the kids stopped playing to look at him our landlord stepped out on the porch and bent himself double like a carpenter s rule and sung out good morning colonel when he was a dozen yards gone by and is that alexander pa says caligula to the landlord and why is he called great that gentlemen says the landlord is no less than colonel jackson t rockingham the president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad mayor of mountain valley and chairman of the perry county board of immigration and public improvements been away a good many years hasn t he i asked no sir colonel rockingham is going down to the post office for his mail his fellow citizens take pleasure in greeting him thus every morning the colonel is our most prominent citizen besides the height of the stock of the sunrise edenville tap railroad he owns a thousand acres of that land across the creek mountain valley delights sir to honor a citizen of such worth and public spirit for an hour that afternoon caligula sat on the back of his neck on the porch and studied a newspaper which was unusual in a man who despised print when he was through he took me to the end of the porch among the sunlight and drying dish towels i knew that caligula had invented a new graft for he chewed the ends of his mustache and ran the left catch of his suspenders up and down which was his way what is it now i asks just so it ain t floating mining stocks or raising pennsylvania pinks we ll talk it over pennsylvania pinks oh that refers to a coin raising scheme of the keystoners they burn the soles of old women s feet to make them tell where their money s hid caligula s words in business was always few and bitter you see them mountains said he pointing and you seen that colonel man that owns railroads and cuts more ice when he goes to the post office than roosevelt does when he cleans em out what we re going to do is to kidnap the latter into the former and inflict a ransom of ten thousand dollars illegality says i shaking my head i knew you d say that says caligula at first sight it does seem to jar peace and dignity but it don t i got the idea out of that newspaper would you commit aspersions on a equitable graft that the united states itself has condoned and indorsed and ratified kidnapping says i is an immoral function in the derogatory list of the statutes if the united states upholds it it must be a recent enactment of ethics along with race suicide and rural delivery listen says caligula and i ll explain the case set down in the papers here was a greek citizen named burdick harris says he captured for a graft by africans and the united states sends two gunboats to the state of tangiers and makes the king of morocco give up seventy thousand dollars to raisuli go slow says i that sounds too international to take in all at once it s like thimble thimble who s got the naturalization papers twas press despatches from constantinople says caligula you ll see six months from now they ll be confirmed by the monthly magazines and then it won t be long till you ll notice em alongside the photos of the mount pelee eruption photos in the while you get your hair cut weeklies it s all right pick this african man raisuli hides burdick harris up in the mountains and advertises his price to the governments of different nations now you wouldn t think for a minute goes on caligula that john hay would have chipped in and helped this graft along if it wasn t a square game would you why no says i i ve always stood right in with bryan s policies and i couldn t consciously say a word against the republican administration just now but if harris was a greek on what system of international protocols did hay interfere it ain t exactly set forth in the papers says caligula i suppose it s a matter of sentiment you know he wrote this poem little breeches and them greeks wear little or none but anyhow john hay sends the brooklyn and the olympia over and they cover africa with thirty inch guns and then hay cables after the health of the persona grata and how are they this morning he wires is burdick harris alive yet or mr raisuli dead and the king of morocco sends up the seventy thousand dollars and they turn burdick harris loose and there s not half the hard feelings among the nations about this little kidnapping matter as there was about the peace congress and burdick harris says to the reporters in the greek language that he s often heard about the united states and he admires roosevelt next to raisuli who is one of the whitest and most gentlemanly kidnappers that he ever worked alongside of so you see pick winds up caligula we ve got the law of nations on our side we ll cut this colonel man out of the herd and corral him in them little mountains and stick up his heirs and assigns for ten thousand dollars well you seldom little red headed territorial terror i answers you can t bluff your uncle tecumseh pickens i ll be your company in this graft but i misdoubt if you ve absorbed the inwardness of this burdick harris case calig and if on any morning we get a telegram from the secretary of state asking about the health of the scheme i propose to acquire the most propinquitous and celeritous mule in this section and gallop diplomatically over into the neighboring and peaceful nation of alabama iii me and caligula spent the next three days investigating the bunch of mountains into which we proposed to kidnap colonel jackson t rockingham we finally selected an upright slice of topography covered with bushes and trees that you could only reach by a secret path that we cut out up the side of it and the only way to reach the mountain was to follow up the bend of a branch that wound among the elevations then i took in hand an important subdivision of the proceedings i went up to atlanta on the train and laid in a two hundred and fifty dollar supply of the most gratifying and efficient lines of grub that money could buy i always was an admirer of viands in their more palliative and revised stages hog and hominy are not only inartistic to my stomach but they give indigestion to my moral sentiments and i thought of colonel jackson t rockingham president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad and how he would miss the luxury of his home fare as is so famous among wealthy southerners so i sunk half of mine and caligula s capital in as elegant a layout of fresh and canned provisions as burdick harris or any other professional kidnappee ever saw in a camp i put another hundred in a couple of cases of bordeaux two quarts of cognac two hundred havana regalias with gold bands and a camp stove and stools and folding cots i wanted colonel rockingham to be comfortable and i hoped after he gave up the ten thousand dollars he would give me and caligula as good a name for gentlemen and entertainers as the greek man did the friend of his that made the united states his bill collector against africa when the goods came down from atlanta we hired a wagon moved them up on the little mountain and established camp and then we laid for the colonel we caught him one morning about two miles out from mountain valley on his way to look after some of his burnt umber farm land he was an elegant old gentleman as thin and tall as a trout rod with frazzled shirt cuffs and specs on a black string we explained to him brief and easy what we wanted and caligula showed him careless the handle of his forty five under his coat what says colonel rockingham bandits in perry county georgia i shall see that the board of immigration and public improvements hears of this be so unfoolhardy as to climb into that buggy says caligula by order of the board of perforation and public depravity this is a business meeting and we re anxious to adjourn sine qua non we drove colonel rockingham over the mountain and up the side of it as far as the buggy could go then we tied the horse and took our prisoner on foot up to the camp now colonel i says to him we re after the ransom me and my partner and no harm will come to you if the king of mor if your friends send up the dust in the mean time we are gentlemen the same as you and if you give us your word not to try to escape the freedom of the camp is yours i give you my word says the colonel all right says i and now it s eleven o clock and me and mr polk will proceed to inculcate the occasion with a few well timed trivialities in the way of grub thank you says the colonel i believe i could relish a slice of bacon and a plate of hominy but you won t says i emphatic not in this camp we soar in higher regions than them occupied by your celebrated but repulsive dish while the colonel read his paper me and caligula took off our coats and went in for a little luncheon de luxe just to show him caligula was a fine cook of the western brand he could toast a buffalo or fricassee a couple of steers as easy as a woman could make a cup of tea he was gifted in the way of knocking together edibles when haste and muscle and quantity was to be considered he held the record west of the arkansas river for frying pancakes with his left hand broiling venison cutlets with his right and skinning a rabbit with his teeth at the same time but i could do things en casserole and la creole and handle the oil and tobasco as gently and nicely as a french chef so at twelve o clock we had a hot lunch ready that looked like a banquet on a mississippi river steamboat we spread it on the tops of two or three big boxes opened two quarts of the red wine set the olives and a canned oyster cocktail and a ready made martini by the colonel s plate and called him to grub colonel rockingham drew up his campstool wiped off his specs and looked at the things on the table then i thought he was swearing and i felt mean because i hadn t taken more pains with the victuals but he wasn t he was asking a blessing and me and caligula hung our heads and i saw a tear drop from the colonel s eye into his cocktail i never saw a man eat with so much earnestness and application not hastily like a grammarian or one of the canal but slow and appreciative like a anaconda or a real vive bonjour in an hour and a half the colonel leaned back i brought him a pony of brandy and his black coffee and set the box of havana regalias on the table gentlemen says he blowing out the smoke and trying to breathe it back again when we view the eternal hills and the smiling and beneficent landscape and reflect upon the goodness of the creator who excuse me colonel says i but there s some business to attend to now and i brought out paper and pen and ink and laid em before him who do you want to send to for the money i asks i reckon says he after thinking a bit to the vice president of our railroad at the general offices of the company in edenville how far is it to edenville from here i asked about ten miles says he then i dictated these lines and colonel rockingham wrote them out i am kidnapped and held a prisoner by two desperate outlaws in a place which is useless to attempt to find they demand ten thousand dollars at once for my release the amount must be raised immediately and these directions followed come alone with the money to stony creek which runs out of blacktop mountains follow the bed of the creek till you come to a big flat rock on the left bank on which is marked a cross in red chalk stand on the rock and wave a white flag a guide will come to you and conduct you to where i am held lose no time after the colonel had finished this he asked permission to take on a postscript about how he was being treated so the railroad wouldn t feel uneasy in its bosom about him we agreed to that he wrote down that he had just had lunch with the two desperate ruffians and then he set down the whole bill of fare from cocktails to coffee he wound up with the remark that dinner would be ready about six and would probably be a more licentious and intemperate affair than lunch me and caligula read it and decided to let it go for we being cooks were amenable to praise though it sounded out of place on a sight draft for ten thousand dollars i took the letter over to the mountain valley road and watched for a messenger by and by a colored equestrian came along on horseback riding toward edenville i gave him a dollar to take the letter to the railroad offices and then i went back to camp iv about four o clock in the afternoon caligula who was acting as lookout calls to me i have to report a white shirt signalling on the starboard bow sir i went down the mountain and brought back a fat red man in an alpaca coat and no collar gentlemen says colonel rockingham allow me to introduce my brother captain duval c rockingham vice president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad otherwise the king of morocco says i i reckon you don t mind my counting the ransom just as a business formality well no not exactly says the fat man not when it comes i turned that matter over to our second vice president i was anxious after brother jackson s safetiness i reckon he ll be along right soon what does that lobster salad you mentioned taste like brother jackson mr vice president says i you ll oblige us by remaining here till the second v p arrives this is a private rehearsal and we don t want any roadside speculators selling tickets in half an hour caligula sings out again sail ho looks like an apron on a broomstick i perambulated down the cliff again and escorted up a man six foot three with a sandy beard and no other dimension that you could notice thinks i to myself if he s got ten thousand dollars on his person it s in one bill and folded lengthwise mr patterson g coble our second vice president announces the colonel glad to know you gentlemen says this coble i came up to disseminate the tidings that major tallahassee tucker our general passenger agent is now negotiating a peachcrate full of our railroad bonds with the perry county bank for a loan my dear colonel rockingham was that chicken gumbo or cracked goobers on the bill of fare in your note me and the conductor of fifty six was having a dispute about it another white wings on the rocks hollers caligula if i see any more i ll fire on em and swear they was torpedo boats the guide goes down again and convoys into the lair a person in blue overalls carrying an amount of inebriety and a lantern i am so sure that this is major tucker that i don t even ask him until we are up above and then i discover that it is uncle timothy the yard switchman at edenville who is sent ahead to flag our understandings with the gossip that judge pendergast the railroad s attorney is in the process of mortgaging colonel rockingham s farming lands to make up the ransom while he is talking two men crawl from under the bushes into camp and caligula with no white flag to disinter him from his plain duty draws his gun but again colonel rockingham intervenes and introduces mr jones and mr batts engineer and fireman of train number forty two excuse us says batts but me and jim have hunted squirrels all over this mounting and we don t need no white flag was that straight colonel about the plum pudding and pineapples and real store cigars towel on a fishing pole in the offing howls caligula suppose it s the firing line of the freight conductors and brakeman my last trip down says i wiping off my face if the s e t wants to run an excursion up here just because we kidnapped their president let em we ll put out our sign the kidnapper s cafe and trainmen s home this time i caught major tallahassee tucker by his own confession and i felt easier i asked him into the creek so i could drown him if he happened to be a track walker or caboose porter all the way up the mountain he driveled to me about asparagus on toast a thing that his intelligence in life had skipped up above i got his mind segregated from food and asked if he had raised the ransom my dear sir says he i succeeded in negotiating a loan on thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds of our railroad and never mind just now major says i it s all right then wait till after dinner and we ll settle the business all of you gentlemen i continues to the crowd are invited to stay to dinner we have mutually trusted one another and the white flag is supposed to wave over the proceedings the correct idea says caligula who was standing by me two baggage masters and a ticket agent dropped out of a tree while you was below the last time did the major man bring the money he says i answered that he succeeded in negotiating the loan if any cooks ever earned ten thousand dollars in twelve hours me and caligula did that day at six o clock we spread the top of the mountain with as fine a dinner as the personnel of any railroad ever engulfed we opened all the wine and we concocted entr es and pi ces de resistance and stirred up little savory chef de cuisines and organized a mass of grub such as has been seldom instigated out of canned and bottled goods the railroad gathered around it and the wassail and diversions was intense after the feast me and caligula in the line of business takes major tucker to one side and talks ransom the major pulls out an agglomeration of currency about the size of the price of a town lot in the suburbs of rabbitville arizona and makes this outcry gentlemen says he the stock of the sunrise edenville railroad has depreciated some the best i could do with thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds was to secure a loan of eighty seven dollars and fifty cents on the farming lands of colonel rockingham judge pendergast was able to obtain on a ninth mortgage the sum of fifty dollars you will find the amount one hundred and thirty seven fifty correct a railroad president said i looking this tucker in the eye and the owner of a thousand acres of land and yet gentlemen says tucker the railroad is ten miles long there don t any train run on it except when the crew goes out in the pines and gathers enough lightwood knots to get up steam a long time ago when times was good the net earnings used to run as high as eighteen dollars a week colonel rockingham s land has been sold for taxes thirteen times there hasn t been a peach crop in this part of georgia for two years the wet spring killed the watermelons nobody around here has money enough to buy fertilizer and land is so poor the corn crop failed and there wasn t enough grass to support the rabbits all the people have had to eat in this section for over a year is hog and hominy and pick interrupts caligula mussing up his red hair what are you going to do with that chicken feed i hands the money back to major tucker and then i goes over to colonel rockingham and slaps him on the back colonel says i i hope you ve enjoyed our little joke we don t want to carry it too far kidnappers well wouldn t it tickle your uncle my name s rhinegelder and i m a nephew of chauncey depew my friend s a second cousin of the editor of puck so you can see we are down south enjoying ourselves in our humorous way now there s two quarts of cognac to open yet and then the joke s over what s the use to go into details one or two will be enough i remember major tallahassee tucker playing on a jew s harp and caligula waltzing with his head on the watch pocket of a tall baggage master i hesitate to refer to the cake walk done by me and mr patterson g coble with colonel jackson t rockingham between us and even on the next morning when you wouldn t think it possible there was a consolation for me and caligula we knew that raisuli himself never made half the hit with burdick harris that we did with the sunrise edenville tap railroad the ethics of pig on an east bound train i went into the smoker and found jefferson peters the only man with a brain west of the wabash river who can use his cerebrum cerebellum and medulla oblongata at the same time jeff is in the line of unillegal graft he is not to be dreaded by widows and orphans he is a reducer of surplusage his favorite disguise is that of the target bird at which the spendthrift or the reckless investor may shy a few inconsequential dollars he is readily vocalized by tobacco so with the aid of two thick and easy burning brevas i got the story of his latest autolycan adventure in my line of business said jeff the hardest thing is to find an upright trustworthy strictly honorable partner to work a graft with some of the best men i ever worked with in a swindle would resort to trickery at times so last summer i thinks i will go over into this section of country where i hear the serpent has not yet entered and see if i can find a partner naturally gifted with a talent for crime but not yet contaminated by success i found a village that seemed to show the right kind of a layout the inhabitants hadn t found that adam had been dispossessed and were going right along naming the animals and killing snakes just as if they were in the garden of eden they call this town mount nebo and it s up near the spot where kentucky and west virginia and north carolina corner together them states don t meet well it was in that neighborhood anyway after putting in a week proving i wasn t a revenue officer i went over to the store where the rude fourflushers of the hamlet lied to see if i could get a line on the kind of man i wanted gentlemen says i after we had rubbed noses and gathered round the dried apple barrel i don t suppose there s another community in the whole world into which sin and chicanery has less extensively permeated than this life here where all the women are brave and propitious and all the men honest and expedient must indeed be an idol it reminds me says i of goldstein s beautiful ballad entitled the deserted village which says ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey what art can drive its charms away the judge rode slowly down the lane mother for i m to be queen of the may why yes mr peters says the storekeeper i reckon we air about as moral and torpid a community as there be on the mounting according to censuses of opinion but i reckon you ain t ever met rufe tatum why no says the town constable he can t hardly have ever that air rufe is shore the monstrousest scalawag that has escaped hangin on the galluses and that puts me in mind that i ought to have turned rufe out of the lockup before yesterday the thirty days he got for killin yance goodloe was up then a day or two more won t hurt rufe any though shucks now says i in the mountain idiom don t tell me there s a man in mount nebo as bad as that worse says the storekeeper he steals hogs i think i will look up this mr tatum so a day or two after the constable turned him out i got acquainted with him and invited him out on the edge of town to sit on a log and talk business what i wanted was a partner with a natural rural make up to play a part in some little one act outrages that i was going to book with the pitfall gin circuit in some of the western towns and this r tatum was born for the role as sure as nature cast fairbanks for the stuff that kept eliza from sinking into the river he was about the size of a first baseman and he had ambiguous blue eyes like the china dog on the mantelpiece that aunt harriet used to play with when she was a child his hair waved a little bit like the statue of the dinkus thrower at the vacation in rome but the color of it reminded you of the sunset in the grand canon by an american artist that they hang over the stove pipe holes in the salongs he was the reub without needing a touch you d have known him for one even if you d seen him on the vaudeville stage with one cotton suspender and a straw over his ear i told him what i wanted and found him ready to jump at the job overlooking such a trivial little peccadillo as the habit of manslaughter says i what have you accomplished in the way of indirect brigandage or nonactionable thriftiness that you could point to with or without pride as an evidence of your qualifications for the position why says he in his kind of southern system of procrastinated accents hain t you heard tell there ain t any man black or white in the blue ridge that can tote off a shoat as easy as i can without bein heard seen or cotched i can lift a shoat he goes on out of a pen from under a porch at the trough in the woods day or night anywhere or anyhow and i guarantee nobody won t hear a squeal it s all in the way you grab hold of em and carry em atterwards some day goes on this gentle despoiler of pig pens i hope to become reckernized as the champion shoat stealer of the world it s proper to be ambitious says i and hog stealing will do very well for mount nebo but in the outside world mr tatum it would be considered as crude a piece of business as a bear raid on bay state gas however it will do as a guarantee of good faith we ll go into partnership i ve got a thousand dollars cash capital and with that homeward plods atmosphere of yours we ought to be able to win out a few shares of soon parted preferred in the money market so i attaches rufe and we go away from mount nebo down into the lowlands and all the way i coach him for his part in the grafts i had in mind i had idled away two months on the florida coast and was feeling all to the ponce de leon besides having so many new schemes up my sleeve that i had to wear kimonos to hold em i intended to assume a funnel shape and mow a path nine miles wide though the farming belt of the middle west so we headed in that direction but when we got as far as lexington we found binkley brothers circus there and the blue grass peasantry romping into town and pounding the belgian blocks with their hand pegged sabots as artless and arbitrary as an extra session of a datto bryan drama i never pass a circus without pulling the valve cord and coming down for a little key west money so i engaged a couple of rooms and board for rufe and me at a house near the circus grounds run by a widow lady named peevy then i took rufe to a clothing store and gent s outfitted him he showed up strong as i knew he would after he was rigged up in the ready made rutabaga regalia me and old misfitzky stuffed him into a bright blue suit with a nile green visible plaid effect and riveted on a fancy vest of a light tuskegee normal tan color a red necktie and the yellowest pair of shoes in town they were the first clothes rufe had ever worn except the gingham layette and the butternut top dressing of his native kraal and he looked as self conscious as an igorrote with a new nose ring that night i went down to the circus tents and opened a small shell game rufe was to be the capper i gave him a roll of phony currency to bet with and kept a bunch of it in a special pocket to pay his winnings out of no i didn t mistrust him but i simply can t manipulate the ball to lose when i see real money bet my fingers go on a strike every time i try it i set up my little table and began to show them how easy it was to guess which shell the little pea was under the unlettered hinds gathered in a thick semicircle and began to nudge elbows and banter one another to bet then was when rufe ought to have single footed up and called the turn on the little joker for a few tens and fives to get them started but no rufe i d seen him two or three times walking about and looking at the side show pictures with his mouth full of peanut candy but he never came nigh the crowd piked a little but trying to work the shells without a capper is like fishing without a bait i closed the game with only forty two dollars of the unearned increment while i had been counting on yanking the yeomen for two hundred at least i went home at eleven and went to bed i supposed that the circus had proved too alluring for rufe and that he had succumbed to it concert and all but i meant to give him a lecture on general business principles in the morning just after morpheus had got both my shoulders to the shuck mattress i hears a houseful of unbecoming and ribald noises like a youngster screeching with green apple colic i opens my door and calls out in the hall for the widow lady and when she sticks her head out i says mrs peevy ma am would you mind choking off that kid of yours so that honest people can get their rest sir says she it s no child of mine it s the pig squealing that your friend mr tatum brought home to his room a couple of hours ago and if you are uncle or second cousin or brother to it i d appreciate your stopping its mouth sir yourself if you please i put on some of the polite outside habiliments of external society and went into rufe s room he had gotten up and lit his lamp and was pouring some milk into a tin pan on the floor for a dingy white half grown squealing pig how is this rufe says i you flimflammed in your part of the work to night and put the game on crutches and how do you explain the pig it looks like back sliding to me now don t be too hard on me jeff says he you know how long i ve been used to stealing shoats it s got to be a habit with me and to night when i see such a fine chance i couldn t help takin it well says i maybe you ve really got kleptopigia and maybe when we get out of the pig belt you ll turn your mind to higher and more remunerative misconduct why you should want to stain your soul with such a distasteful feeble minded perverted roaring beast as that i can t understand why jeff says he you ain t in sympathy with shoats you don t understand em like i do this here seems to me to be an animal of more than common powers of ration and intelligence he walked half across the room on his hind legs a while ago well i m going back to bed says i see if you can impress it upon your friend s ideas of intelligence that he s not to make so much noise he was hungry says rufe he ll go to sleep and keep quiet now i always get up before breakfast and read the morning paper whenever i happen to be within the radius of a hoe cylinder or a washington hand press the next morning i got up early and found a lexington daily on the front porch where the carrier had thrown it the first thing i saw in it was a double column ad on the front page that read like this five thousand dollars reward the above amount will be paid and no questions asked for the return alive and uninjured of beppo the famous european educated pig that strayed or was stolen from the side show tents of binkley bros circus last night geo b tapley business manager at the circus grounds i folded up the paper flat put it into my inside pocket and went to rufe s room he was nearly dressed and was feeding the pig the rest of the milk and some apple peelings well well well good morning all i says hearty and amiable so we are up and piggy is having his breakfast what had you intended doing with that pig rufe i m going to crate him up says rufe and express him to ma in mount nebo he ll be company for her while i am away he s a mighty fine pig says i scratching him on the back you called him a lot of names last night says rufe oh well says i he looks better to me this morning i was raised on a farm and i m very fond of pigs i used to go to bed at sundown so i never saw one by lamplight before tell you what i ll do rufe i says i ll give you ten dollars for that pig i reckon i wouldn t sell this shoat says he if it was any other one i might why not this one i asked fearful that he might know something why because says he it was the grandest achievement of my life there ain t airy other man that could have done it if i ever have a fireside and children i ll sit beside it and tell em how their daddy toted off a shoat from a whole circus full of people and maybe my grandchildren too they ll certainly be proud a whole passel why says he there was two tents one openin into the other this shoat was on a platform tied with a little chain i seen a giant and a lady with a fine chance of bushy white hair in the other tent i got the shoat and crawled out from under the canvas again without him squeakin as loud as a mouse i put him under my coat and i must have passed a hundred folks before i got out where the streets was dark i reckon i wouldn t sell that shoat jeff i d want ma to keep it so there d be a witness to what i done the pig won t live long enough i says to use as an exhibit in your senile fireside mendacity your grandchildren will have to take your word for it i ll give you one hundred dollars for the animal rufe looked at me astonished the shoat can t be worth anything like that to you he says what do you want him for viewing me casuistically says i with a rare smile you wouldn t think that i ve got an artistic side to my temper but i have i m a collector of pigs i ve scoured the world for unusual pigs over in the wabash valley i ve got a hog ranch with most every specimen on it from a merino to a poland china this looks like a blooded pig to me rufe says i i believe it s a genuine berkshire that s why i d like to have it i d shore like to accommodate you says he but i ve got the artistic tenement too i don t see why it ain t art when you can steal a shoat better than anybody else can shoats is a kind of inspiration and genius with me specially this one i wouldn t take two hundred and fifty for that animal now listen says i wiping off my forehead it s not so much a matter of business with me as it is art and not so much art as it is philanthropy being a connoisseur and disseminator of pigs i wouldn t feel like i d done my duty to the world unless i added that berkshire to my collection not intrinsically but according to the ethics of pigs as friends and coadjutors of mankind i offer you five hundred dollars for the animal jeff says this pork esthete it ain t money it s sentiment with me seven hundred says i make it eight hundred says rufe and i ll crush the sentiment out of my heart i went under my clothes for my money belt and counted him out forty twenty dollar gold certificates i ll just take him into my own room says i and lock him up till after breakfast i took the pig by the hind leg he turned on a squeal like the steam calliope at the circus let me tote him in for you says rufe and he picks up the beast under one arm holding his snout with the other hand and packs him into my room like a sleeping baby after breakfast rufe who had a chronic case of haberdashery ever since i got his trousseau says he believes he will amble down to misfitzky s and look over some royal purple socks and then i got as busy as a one armed man with the nettle rash pasting on wall paper i found an old negro man with an express wagon to hire and we tied the pig in a sack and drove down to the circus grounds i found george b tapley in a little tent with a window flap open he was a fattish man with an immediate eye in a black skull cap with a four ounce diamond screwed into the bosom of his red sweater are you george b tapley i asks i swear it says he well i ve got it says i designate says he are you the guinea pigs for the asiatic python or the alfalfa for the sacred buffalo neither says i i ve got beppo the educated hog in a sack in that wagon i found him rooting up the flowers in my front yard this morning i ll take the five thousand dollars in large bills if it s handy george b hustles out of his tent and asks me to follow we went into one of the side shows in there was a jet black pig with a pink ribbon around his neck lying on some hay and eating carrots that a man was feeding to him hey mac calls g b nothing wrong with the world wide this morning is there him no says the man he s got an appetite like a chorus girl at a m how d you get this pipe says tapley to me eating too many pork chops last night i pulls out the paper and shows him the ad fake says he don t know anything about it you ve beheld with your own eyes the marvelous world wide porcine wonder of the four footed kingdom eating with preternatural sagacity his matutinal meal unstrayed and unstole good morning i was beginning to see i got in the wagon and told uncle ned to drive to the most adjacent orifice of the nearest alley there i took out my pig got the range carefully for the other opening set his sights and gave him such a kick that he went out the other end of the alley twenty feet ahead of his squeal then i paid uncle ned his fifty cents and walked down to the newspaper office i wanted to hear it in cold syllables i got the advertising man to his window to decide a bet says i wasn t the man who had this ad put in last night short and fat with long black whiskers and a club foot he was not says the man he would measure about six feet by four and a half inches with corn silk hair and dressed like the pansies of the conservatory at dinner time i went back to mrs peevy s shall i keep some soup hot for mr tatum till he comes back she asks if you do ma am says i you ll more than exhaust for firewood all the coal in the bosom of the earth and all the forests on the outside of it so there you see said jefferson peters in conclusion how hard it is ever to find a fair minded and honest business partner but i began with the freedom of long acquaintance the rule should work both ways if you had offered to divide the reward you would not have lost jeff s look of dignified reproach stopped me that don t involve the same principles at all said he mine was a legitimate and moral attempt at speculation buy low and sell high don t wall street endorse it bulls and bears and pigs what s the difference why not bristles as well as horns and fur options the rose of dixie when the rose of dixie magazine was started by a stock company in toombs city georgia there was never but one candidate for its chief editorial position in the minds of its owners col aquila telfair was the man for the place by all the rights of learning family reputation and southern traditions he was its foreordained fit and logical editor so a committee of the patriotic georgia citizens who had subscribed the founding fund of called upon colonel telfair at his residence cedar heights fearful lest the enterprise and the south should suffer by his possible refusal the colonel received them in his great library where he spent most of his days the library had descended to him from his father it contained ten thousand volumes some of which had been published as late as the year when the deputation arrived colonel telfair was seated at his massive white pine centre table reading burton s anatomy of melancholy he arose and shook hands punctiliously with each member of the committee if you were familiar with the rose of dixie you will remember the colonel s portrait which appeared in it from time to time you could not forget the long carefully brushed white hair the hooked high bridged nose slightly twisted to the left the keen eyes under the still black eyebrows the classic mouth beneath the drooping white mustache slightly frazzled at the ends the committee solicitously offered him the position of managing editor humbly presenting an outline of the field that the publication was designed to cover and mentioning a comfortable salary the colonel s lands were growing poorer each year and were much cut up by red gullies besides the honor was not one to be refused in a forty minute speech of acceptance colonel telfair gave an outline of english literature from chaucer to macaulay re fought the battle of chancellorsville and said that god helping him he would so conduct the rose of dixie that its fragrance and beauty would permeate the entire world hurling back into the teeth of the northern minions their belief that no genius or good could exist in the brains and hearts of the people whose property they had destroyed and whose rights they had curtailed offices for the magazine were partitioned off and furnished in the second floor of the first national bank building and it was for the colonel to cause the rose of dixie to blossom and flourish or to wilt in the balmy air of the land of flowers the staff of assistants and contributors that editor colonel telfair drew about him was a peach it was a whole crate of georgia peaches the first assistant editor tolliver lee fairfax had had a father killed during pickett s charge the second assistant keats unthank was the nephew of one of morgan s raiders the book reviewer jackson rockingham had been the youngest soldier in the confederate army having appeared on the field of battle with a sword in one hand and a milk bottle in the other the art editor roncesvalles sykes was a third cousin to a nephew of jefferson davis miss lavinia terhune the colonel s stenographer and typewriter had an aunt who had once been kissed by stonewall jackson tommy webster the head office boy got his job by having recited father ryan s poems complete at the commencement exercises of the toombs city high school the girls who wrapped and addressed the magazines were members of old southern families in reduced circumstances the cashier was a scrub named hawkins from ann arbor michigan who had recommendations and a bond from a guarantee company filed with the owners even georgia stock companies sometimes realize that it takes live ones to bury the dead well sir if you believe me the rose of dixie blossomed five times before anybody heard of it except the people who buy their hooks and eyes in toombs city then hawkins climbed off his stool and told on em to the stock company even in ann arbor he had been used to having his business propositions heard of at least as far away as detroit so an advertising manager was engaged beauregard fitzhugh banks a young man in a lavender necktie whose grandfather had been the exalted high pillow slip of the kuklux klan in spite of which the rose of dixie kept coming out every month although in every issue it ran photos of either the taj mahal or the luxembourg gardens or carmencita or la follette a certain number of people bought it and subscribed for it as a boom for it editor colonel telfair ran three different views of andrew jackson s old home the hermitage a full page engraving of the second battle of manassas entitled lee to the rear and a five thousand word biography of belle boyd in the same number the subscription list that month advanced also there were poems in the same issue by leonina vashti haricot pen name related to the haricots of charleston south carolina and bill thompson nephew of one of the stockholders and an article from a special society correspondent describing a tea party given by the swell boston and english set where a lot of tea was spilled overboard by some of the guests masquerading as indians one day a person whose breath would easily cloud a mirror he was so much alive entered the office of the rose of dixie he was a man about the size of a real estate agent with a self tied tie and a manner that he must have borrowed conjointly from w j bryan hackenschmidt and hetty green he was shown into the editor colonel s pons asinorum colonel telfair rose and began a prince albert bow i m thacker said the intruder taking the editor s chair t t thacker of new york he dribbled hastily upon the colonel s desk some cards a bulky manila envelope and a letter from the owners of the rose of dixie this letter introduced mr thacker and politely requested colonel telfair to give him a conference and whatever information about the magazine he might desire i ve been corresponding with the secretary of the magazine owners for some time said thacker briskly i m a practical magazine man myself and a circulation booster as good as any if i do say it i ll guarantee an increase of anywhere from ten thousand to a hundred thousand a year for any publication that isn t printed in a dead language i ve had my eye on the rose of dixie ever since it started i know every end of the business from editing to setting up the classified ads now i ve come down here to put a good bunch of money in the magazine if i can see my way clear it ought to be made to pay the secretary tells me it s losing money i don t see why a magazine in the south if it s properly handled shouldn t get a good circulation in the north too colonel telfair leaned back in his chair and polished his gold rimmed glasses mr thacker said he courteously but firmly the rose of dixie is a publication devoted to the fostering and the voicing of southern genius its watchword which you may have seen on the cover is of for and by the south but you wouldn t object to a northern circulation would you asked thacker i suppose said the editor colonel that it is customary to open the circulation lists to all i do not know i have nothing to do with the business affairs of the magazine i was called upon to assume editorial control of it and i have devoted to its conduct such poor literary talents as i may possess and whatever store of erudition i may have acquired sure said thacker but a dollar is a dollar anywhere north south or west whether you re buying codfish goober peas or rocky ford cantaloupes now i ve been looking over your november number i see one here on your desk you don t mind running over it with me well your leading article is all right a good write up of the cotton belt with plenty of photographs is a winner any time new york is always interested in the cotton crop and this sensational account of hatfield mccoy feud by a schoolmate of a niece of the governor of kentucky isn t such a bad idea it happened so long ago that most people have forgotten it now here s a poem three pages long called the tyrant s foot by lorella lascelles i ve pawed around a good deal over manuscripts but i never saw her name on a rejection slip miss lascelles said the editor is one of our most widely recognized southern poetesses she is closely related to the alabama lascelles family and made with her own hands the silken confederate banner that was presented to the governor of that state at his inauguration but why persisted thacker is the poem illustrated with a view of the m railroad freight depot at tuscaloosa the illustration said the colonel with dignity shows a corner of the fence surrounding the old homestead where miss lascelles was born all right said thacker i read the poem but i couldn t tell whether it was about the depot of the battle of bull run now here s a short story called rosies temptation by fosdyke piggott it s rotten what is a piggott anyway mr piggott said the editor is a brother of the principal stockholder of the magazine all s right with the world piggott passes said thacker well this article on arctic exploration and the one on tarpon fishing might go but how about this write up of the atlanta new orleans nashville and savannah breweries it seems to consist mainly of statistics about their output and the quality of their beer what s the chip over the bug if i understand your figurative language answered colonel telfair it is this the article you refer to was handed to me by the owners of the magazine with instructions to publish it the literary quality of it did not appeal to me but in a measure i feel impelled to conform in certain matters to the wishes of the gentlemen who are interested in the financial side of the rose i see said thacker next we have two pages of selections from lalla rookh by thomas moore now what federal prison did moore escape from or what s the name of the f f v family that he carries as a handicap moore was an irish poet who died in said colonel telfair pityingly he is a classic i have been thinking of reprinting his translation of anacreon serially in the magazine look out for the copyright laws said thacker flippantly who s bessie belleclair who contributes the essay on the newly completed water works plant in milledgeville the name sir said colonel telfair is the nom de guerre of miss elvira simpkins i have not the honor of knowing the lady but her contribution was sent to us by congressman brower of her native state congressman brower s mother was related to the polks of tennessee now see here colonel said thacker throwing down the magazine this won t do you can t successfully run a magazine for one particular section of the country you ve got to make a universal appeal look how the northern publications have catered to the south and encouraged the southern writers and you ve got to go far and wide for your contributors you ve got to buy stuff according to its quality without any regard to the pedigree of the author now i ll bet a quart of ink that this southern parlor organ you ve been running has never played a note that originated about mason hamlin s line am i right i have carefully and conscientiously rejected all contributions from that section of the country if i understand your figurative language aright replied the colonel all right now i ll show you something thacker reached for his thick manila envelope and dumped a mass of typewritten manuscript on the editors desk here s some truck said he that i paid cash for and brought along with me one by one he folded back the manuscripts and showed their first pages to the colonel here are four short stories four of the highest priced authors in the united states three of em living in new york and one commuting there s a special article on vienna bred society by tom vampson here s an italian serial by captain jack no it s the other crawford here are three separate exposes of city governments by sniffings and here s a dandy entitled what women carry in dress suit cases a chicago newspaper woman hired herself out for five years as a lady s maid to get that information and here s a synopsis of preceding chapters of hall caine s new serial to appear next june and here s a couple of pounds of vers de societe that i got at a rate from the clever magazines that s the stuff that people everywhere want and now here s a writeup with photographs at the ages of four twelve twenty two and thirty of george b mcclellan it s a prognostication he s bound to be elected mayor of new york it make a big hit all over the country he i beg your pardon said colonel telfair stiffening in his chair what was the name oh i see said thacker with half a grin yes he s a son of the general we ll pass that manuscript up but if you ll excuse me colonel it s a magazine we re trying to make go off not the first gun at fort sumter now here s a thing that s bound to get next to you it s an original poem by james whitcomb riley j w himself you know what that means to a magazine i won t tell you what i had to pay for that poem but i ll tell you this riley can make more money writing with a fountain pen than you or i can with one that lets the ink run i ll read you the last two stanzas pa lays around n loafs all day n reads and makes us leave him be he lets me do just like i please n when i m in bad he laughs at me n when i holler loud n say bad words n then begin to tease the cat n pa just smiles ma s mad n gives me jesse crost her knees i always wondered why that wuz i guess it s cause pa never does n after all the lights are out i m sorry bout it so i creep out of my trundle bed to ma s n say i love her a whole heap n kiss her n i hug her tight n it s too dark to see her eyes but every time i do i know she cries n cries n cries n cries i always wondered why that wuz i guess it s cause pa never does that s the stuff continued thacker what do you think of that i am not unfamiliar with the works of mr riley said the colonel deliberately i believe he lives in indiana for the last ten years i have been somewhat of a literary recluse and am familiar with nearly all the books in the cedar heights library i am also of the opinion that a magazine should contain a certain amount of poetry many of the sweetest singers of the south have already contributed to the pages of the rose of dixie i myself have thought of translating from the original for publication in its pages the works of the great italian poet tasso have you ever drunk from the fountain of this immortal poet s lines mr thacker not even a demi tasso said thacker now let s come to the point colonel telfair i ve already invested some money in this as a flyer that bunch of manuscripts cost me my object was to try a number of them in the next issue i believe you make up less than a month ahead and see what effect it has on the circulation i believe that by printing the best stuff we can get in the north south east or west we can make the magazine go you have there the letter from the owning company asking you to co operate with me in the plan let s chuck out some of this slush that you ve been publishing just because the writers are related to the skoopdoodles of skoopdoodle county are you with me as long as i continue to be the editor of the rose said colonel telfair with dignity i shall be its editor but i desire also to conform to the wishes of its owners if i can do so conscientiously that s the talk said thacker briskly now how much of this stuff i ve brought can we get into the january number we want to begin right away there is yet space in the january number said the editor for about eight thousand words roughly estimated great said thacker it isn t much but it ll give the readers some change from goobers governors and gettysburg i ll leave the selection of the stuff i brought to fill the space to you as it s all good i ve got to run back to new york and i ll be down again in a couple of weeks colonel telfair slowly swung his eye glasses by their broad black ribbon the space in the january number that i referred to said he measuredly has been held open purposely pending a decision that i have not yet made a short time ago a contribution was submitted to the rose of dixie that is one of the most remarkable literary efforts that has ever come under my observation none but a master mind and talent could have produced it it would just fill the space that i have reserved for its possible use thacker looked anxious what kind of stuff is it he asked eight thousand words sounds suspicious the oldest families must have been collaborating is there going to be another secession the author of the article continued the colonel ignoring thacker s allusions is a writer of some reputation he has also distinguished himself in other ways i do not feel at liberty to reveal to you his name at least not until i have decided whether or not to accept his contribution well said thacker nervously is it a continued story or an account of the unveiling of the new town pump in whitmire south carolina or a revised list of general lee s body servants or what you are disposed to be facetious said colonel telfair calmly the article is from the pen of a thinker a philosopher a lover of mankind a student and a rhetorician of high degree it must have been written by a syndicate said thacker but honestly colonel you want to go slow i don t know of any eight thousand word single doses of written matter that are read by anybody these days except supreme court briefs and reports of murder trials you haven t by any accident gotten hold of a copy of one of daniel webster s speeches have you colonel telfair swung a little in his chair and looked steadily from under his bushy eyebrows at the magazine promoter mr thacker he said gravely i am willing to segregate the somewhat crude expression of your sense of humor from the solicitude that your business investments undoubtedly have conferred upon you but i must ask you to cease your jibes and derogatory comments upon the south and the southern people they sir will not be tolerated in the office of the rose of dixie for one moment and before you proceed with more of your covert insinuations that i the editor of this magazine am not a competent judge of the merits of the matter submitted to its consideration i beg that you will first present some evidence or proof that you are my superior in any way shape or form relative to the question in hand oh come colonel said thacker good naturedly i didn t do anything like that to you it sounds like an indictment by the fourth assistant attorney general let s get back to business what s this to shot about the article said colonel telfair acknowledging the apology by a slight bow covers a wide area of knowledge it takes up theories and questions that have puzzled the world for centuries and disposes of them logically and concisely one by one it holds up to view the evils of the world points out the way of eradicating them and then conscientiously and in detail comments the good there is hardly a phase of human life that it does not discuss wisely calmly and equitably the great policies of governments the duties of private citizens the obligations of home life law ethics morality all these important subjects are handled with a calm wisdom and confidence that i must confess has captured my admiration it must be a crackerjack said thacker impressed it is a great contribution to the world s wisdom said the colonel the only doubt remaining in my mind as to the tremendous advantage it would be to us to give it publication in the rose of dixie is that i have not yet sufficient information about the author to give his work publicity in our magazine i thought you said he is a distinguished man said thacker he is replied the colonel both in literary and in other more diversified and extraneous fields but i am extremely careful about the matter that i accept for publication my contributors are people of unquestionable repute and connections which fact can be verified at any time as i said i am holding this article until i can acquire more information about its author i do not know whether i will publish it or not if i decide against it i shall be much pleased mr thacker to substitute the matter that you are leaving with me in its place thacker was somewhat at sea i don t seem to gather said he much about the gist of this inspired piece of literature it sounds more like a dark horse than pegasus to me it is a human document said the colonel editor confidently from a man of great accomplishments who in my opinion has obtained a stronger grasp on the world and its outcomes than that of any man living to day thacker rose to his feet excitedly say he said it isn t possible that you ve cornered john d rockefeller s memoirs is it don t tell me that all at once no sir said colonel telfair i am speaking of mentality and literature not of the less worthy intricacies of trade well what s the trouble about running the article asked thacker a little impatiently if the man s well known and has got the stuff colonel telfair sighed mr thacker said he for once i have been tempted nothing has yet appeared in the rose of dixie that has not been from the pen of one of its sons or daughters i know little about the author of this article except that he has acquired prominence in a section of the country that has always been inimical to my heart and mind but i recognize his genius and as i have told you i have instituted an investigation of his personality perhaps it will be futile but i shall pursue the inquiry until that is finished i must leave open the question of filling the vacant space in our january number thacker arose to leave all right colonel he said as cordially as he could you use your own judgment if you ve really got a scoop or something that will make em sit up run it instead of my stuff i ll drop in again in about two weeks good luck colonel telfair and the magazine promoter shook hands returning a fortnight later thacker dropped off a very rocky pullman at toombs city he found the january number of the magazine made up and the forms closed the vacant space that had been yawning for type was filled by an article that was headed thus second message to congress written for the rose of dixie by a member of the well known bulloch family of georgia t roosevelt the third ingredient the so called vallambrosa apartment house is not an apartment house it is composed of two old fashioned brownstone front residences welded into one the parlor floor of one side is gay with the wraps and head gear of a modiste the other is lugubrious with the sophistical promises and grisly display of a painless dentist you may have a room there for two dollars a week or you may have one for twenty dollars among the vallambrosa s roomers are stenographers musicians brokers shop girls space rate writers art students wire tappers and other people who lean far over the banister rail when the door bell rings this treatise shall have to do with but two of the vallambrosians though meaning no disrespect to the others at six o clock one afternoon hetty pepper came back to her third floor rear room in the vallambrosa with her nose and chin more sharply pointed than usual to be discharged from the department store where you have been working four years and with only fifteen cents in your purse does have a tendency to make your features appear more finely chiseled and now for hetty s thumb nail biography while she climbs the two flights of stairs she walked into the biggest store one morning four years before with seventy five other girls applying for a job behind the waist department counter the phalanx of wage earners formed a bewildering scene of beauty carrying a total mass of blond hair sufficient to have justified the horseback gallops of a hundred lady godivas the capable cool eyed impersonal young bald headed man whose task it was to engage six of the contestants was aware of a feeling of suffocation as if he were drowning in a sea of frangipanni while white clouds hand embroidered floated about him and then a sail hove in sight hetty pepper homely of countenance with small contemptuous green eyes and chocolate colored hair dressed in a suit of plain burlap and a common sense hat stood before him with every one of her twenty nine years of life unmistakably in sight you re on shouted the bald headed young man and was saved and that is how hetty came to be employed in the biggest store the story of her rise to an eight dollar a week salary is the combined stories of hercules joan of arc una job and little red riding hood you shall not learn from me the salary that was paid her as a beginner there is a sentiment growing about such things and i want no millionaire store proprietors climbing the fire escape of my tenement house to throw dynamite bombs into my skylight boudoir the story of hetty s discharge from the biggest store is so nearly a repetition of her engagement as to be monotonous in each department of the store there is an omniscient omnipresent and omnivorous person carrying always a mileage book and a red necktie and referred to as a buyer the destinies of the girls in his department who live on see bureau of victual statistics so much per week are in his hands this particular buyer was a capable cool eyed impersonal young bald headed man as he walked along the aisles of his department lie seemed to be sailing on a sea of frangipanni while white clouds machine embroidered floated around him too many sweets bring surfeit he looked upon hetty pepper s homely countenance emerald eyes and chocolate colored hair as a welcome oasis of green in a desert of cloying beauty in a quiet angle of a counter he pinched her arm kindly three inches above the elbow she slapped him three feet away with one good blow of her muscular and not especially lily white right so now you know why hetty pepper came to leave the biggest store at thirty minutes notice with one dime and a nickel in her purse this morning s quotations list the price of rib beef at six cents per butcher s pound but on the day that hetty was released by the b s the price was seven and one half cents that fact is what makes this story possible otherwise the extra four cents would have but the plot of nearly all the good stories in the world is concerned with shorts who were unable to cover so you can find no fault with this one hetty mounted with her rib beef to her third floor back one hot savory beef stew for supper a night s good sleep and she would be fit in the morning to apply again for the tasks of hercules joan of arc una job and little red riding hood in her room she got the granite ware stew pan out of the x foot china er i mean earthenware closet and began to dig down in a rats nest of paper bags for the potatoes and onions she came out with her nose and chin just a little sharper pointed there was neither a potato nor an onion now what kind of a beef stew can you make out of simply beef you can make oyster soup without oysters turtle soup without turtles coffee cake without coffee but you can t make beef stew without potatoes and onions but rib beef alone in an emergency can make an ordinary pine door look like a wrought iron gambling house portal to the wolf with salt and pepper and a tablespoonful of flour first well stirred in a little cold water twill serve tis not so deep as a lobster a la newburg nor so wide as a church festival doughnut but twill serve hetty took her stew pan to the rear of the third floor hall according to the advertisements of the vallambrosa there was running water to be found there between you and me and the water meter it only ambled or walked through the faucets but technicalities have no place here there was also a sink where housekeeping roomers often met to dump their coffee grounds and glare at one another s kimonos at this sink hetty found a girl with heavy gold brown artistic hair and plaintive eyes washing two large irish potatoes hetty knew the vallambrosa as well as any one not owning double hextra magnifying eyes could compass its mysteries the kimonos were her encyclopedia her who s what her clearinghouse of news of goers and comers from a rose pink kimono edged with nile green she had learned that the girl with the potatoes was a miniature painter living in a kind of attic or studio as they prefer to call it on the top floor hetty was not certain in her mind what a miniature was but it certainly wasn t a house because house painters although they wear splashy overalls and poke ladders in your face on the street are known to indulge in a riotous profusion of food at home the potato girl was quite slim and small and handled her potatoes as an old bachelor uncle handles a baby who is cutting teeth she had a dull shoemaker s knife in her right hand and she had begun to peel one of the potatoes with it hetty addressed her in the punctiliously formal tone of one who intends to be cheerfully familiar with you in the second round beg pardon she said for butting into what s not my business but if you peel them potatoes you lose out they re new bermudas you want to scrape em lemme show you she took a potato and the knife and began to demonstrate oh thank you breathed the artist i didn t know and i did hate to see the thick peeling go it seemed such a waste but i thought they always had to be peeled when you ve got only potatoes to eat the peelings count you know say kid said hetty staying her knife you ain t up against it too are you the miniature artist smiled starvedly i suppose i am art or at least the way i interpret it doesn t seem to be much in demand i have only these potatoes for my dinner but they aren t so bad boiled and hot with a little butter and salt child said hetty letting a brief smile soften her rigid features fate has sent me and you together i ve had it handed to me in the neck too but i ve got a chunk of meat in my room as big as a lap dog and i ve done everything to get potatoes except pray for em let s me and you bunch our commissary departments and make a stew of em we ll cook it in my room if we only had an onion to go in it say kid you haven t got a couple of pennies that ve slipped down into the lining of your last winter s sealskin have you i could step down to the corner and get one at old giuseppe s stand a stew without an onion is worse n a matinee without candy you may call me cecilia said the artist no i spent my last penny three days ago then we ll have to cut the onion out instead of slicing it in said hetty i d ask the janitress for one but i don t want em hep just yet to the fact that i m pounding the asphalt for another job but i wish we did have an onion in the shop girl s room the two began to prepare their supper cecilia s part was to sit on the couch helplessly and beg to be allowed to do something in the voice of a cooing ring dove hetty prepared the rib beef putting it in cold salted water in the stew pan and setting it on the one burner gas stove i wish we had an onion said hetty as she scraped the two potatoes on the wall opposite the couch was pinned a flaming gorgeous advertising picture of one of the new ferry boats of the p u f f railroad that had been built to cut down the time between los angeles and new york city one eighth of a minute hetty turning her head during her continuous monologue saw tears running from her guest s eyes as she gazed on the idealized presentment of the speeding foam girdled transport why say cecilia kid said hetty poising her knife is it as bad art as that i ain t a critic but i thought it kind of brightened up the room of course a manicure painter could tell it was a bum picture in a minute i ll take it down if you say so i wish to the holy saint potluck we had an onion but the miniature miniature painter had tumbled down sobbing with her nose indenting the hard woven drapery of the couch something was here deeper than the artistic temperament offended at crude lithography hetty knew she had accepted her role long ago how scant the words with which we try to describe a single quality of a human being when we reach the abstract we are lost the nearer to nature that the babbling of our lips comes the better do we understand figuratively let us say some people are bosoms some are hands some are heads some are muscles some are feet some are backs for burdens hetty was a shoulder hers was a sharp sinewy shoulder but all her life people had laid their heads upon it metaphorically or actually and had left there all or half their troubles looking at life anatomically which is as good a way as any she was preordained to be a shoulder there were few truer collar bones anywhere than hers hetty was only thirty three and she had not yet outlived the little pang that visited her whenever the head of youth and beauty leaned upon her for consolation but one glance in her mirror always served as an instantaneous pain killer so she gave one pale look into the crinkly old looking glass on the wall above the gas stove turned down the flame a little lower from the bubbling beef and potatoes went over to the couch and lifted cecilia s head to its confessional go on and tell me honey she said i know now that it ain t art that s worrying you you met him on a ferry boat didn t you go on cecilia kid and tell your your aunt hetty about it but youth and melancholy must first spend the surplus of sighs and tears that waft and float the barque of romance to its harbor in the delectable isles presently through the stringy tendons that formed the bars of the confessional the penitent or was it the glorified communicant of the sacred flame told her story without art or illumination it was only three days ago i was coming back on the ferry from jersey city old mr schrum an art dealer told me of a rich man in newark who wanted a miniature of his daughter painted i went to see him and showed him some of my work when i told him the price would be fifty dollars he laughed at me like a hyena he said an enlarged crayon twenty times the size would cost him only eight dollars i had just enough money to buy my ferry ticket back to new york i felt as if i didn t want to live another day i must have looked as i felt for i saw him on the row of seats opposite me looking at me as if he understood he was nice looking but oh above everything else he looked kind when one is tired or unhappy or hopeless kindness counts more than anything else when i got so miserable that i couldn t fight against it any longer i got up and walked slowly out the rear door of the ferry boat cabin no one was there and i slipped quickly over the rail and dropped into the water oh friend hetty it was cold cold for just one moment i wished i was back in the old vallambrosa starving and hoping and then i got numb and didn t care and then i felt that somebody else was in the water close by me holding me up he had followed me and jumped in to save me somebody threw a thing like a big white doughnut at us and he made me put my arms through the hole then the ferry boat backed and they pulled us on board oh hetty i was so ashamed of my wickedness in trying to drown myself and besides my hair had all tumbled down and was sopping wet and i was such a sight and then some men in blue clothes came around and he gave them his card and i heard him tell them he had seen me drop my purse on the edge of the boat outside the rail and in leaning over to get it i had fallen overboard and then i remembered having read in the papers that people who try to kill themselves are locked up in cells with people who try to kill other people and i was afraid but some ladies on the boat took me downstairs to the furnace room and got me nearly dry and did up my hair when the boat landed he came and put me in a cab he was all dripping himself but laughed as if he thought it was all a joke he begged me but i wouldn t tell him my name nor where i lived i was so ashamed you were a fool child said hetty kindly wait till i turn the light up a bit i wish to heaven we had an onion then he raised his hat went on cecilia and said very well but i ll find you anyhow i m going to claim my rights of salvage then he gave money to the cab driver and told him to take me where i wanted to go and walked away what is salvage hetty the edge of a piece of goods that ain t hemmed said the shop girl you must have looked pretty well frazzled out to the little hero boy it s been three days moaned the miniature painter and he hasn t found me yet extend the time said hetty this is a big town think of how many girls he might have to see soaked in water with their hair down before he would recognize you the stew s getting on fine but oh for an onion i d even use a piece of garlic if i had it the beef and potatoes bubbled merrily exhaling a mouth watering savor that yet lacked something leaving a hunger on the palate a haunting wistful desire for some lost and needful ingredient i came near drowning in that awful river said cecilia shuddering it ought to have more water in it said hetty the stew i mean i ll go get some at the sink it smells good said the artist that nasty old north river objected hetty it smells to me like soap factories and wet setter dogs oh you mean the stew well i wish we had an onion for it did he look like he had money first he looked kind said cecilia i m sure he was rich but that matters so little when he drew out his bill folder to pay the cab man you couldn t help seeing hundreds and thousands of dollars in it and i looked over the cab doors and saw him leave the ferry station in a motor car and the chauffeur gave him his bearskin to put on for he was sopping wet and it was only three days ago what a fool said hetty shortly oh the chauffeur wasn t wet breathed cecilia and he drove the car away very nicely i mean you said hetty for not giving him your address i never give my address to chauffeurs said cecilia haughtily i wish we had one said hetty disconsolately what for for the stew of course oh i mean an onion hetty took a pitcher and started to the sink at the end of the hall a young man came down the stairs from above just as she was opposite the lower step he was decently dressed but pale and haggard his eyes were dull with the stress of some burden of physical or mental woe in his hand he bore an onion a pink smooth solid shining onion as large around as a ninety eight cent alarm clock hetty stopped so did the young man there was something joan of arc ish herculean and una ish in the look and pose of the shoplady she had cast off the roles of job and little red riding hood the young man stopped at the foot of the stairs and coughed distractedly he felt marooned held up attacked assailed levied upon sacked assessed panhandled browbeaten though he knew not why it was the look in hetty s eyes that did it in them he saw the jolly roger fly to the masthead and an able seaman with a dirk between his teeth scurry up the ratlines and nail it there but as yet he did not know that the cargo he carried was the thing that had caused him to be so nearly blown out of the water without even a parley beg your pardon said hetty as sweetly as her dilute acetic acid tones permitted but did you find that onion on the stairs there was a hole in the paper bag and i ve just come out to look for it the young man coughed for half a minute the interval may have given him the courage to defend his own property also he clutched his pungent prize greedily and with a show of spirit faced his grim waylayer no he said huskily i didn t find it on the stairs it was given to me by jack bevens on the top floor if you don t believe it ask him i ll wait until you do i know about bevens said hetty sourly he writes books and things up there for the paper and rags man we can hear the postman guy him all over the house when he brings them thick envelopes back say do you live in the vallambrosa i do not said the young man i come to see bevens sometimes he s my friend i live two blocks west what are you going to do with the onion begging your pardon said hetty i m going to eat it raw yes as soon as i get home haven t you got anything else to eat with it the young man considered briefly no he confessed there s not another scrap of anything in my diggings to eat i think old jack is pretty hard up for grub in his shack too he hated to give up the onion but i worried him into parting with it man said hetty fixing him with her world sapient eyes and laying a bony but impressive finger on his sleeve you ve known trouble too haven t you lots said the onion owner promptly but this onion is my own property honestly come by if you will excuse me i must be going listen said hetty paling a little with anxiety raw onion is a mighty poor diet and so is a beef stew without one now if you re jack bevens friend i guess you re nearly right there s a little lady a friend of mine in my room there at the end of the hall both of us are out of luck and we had just potatoes and meat between us they re stewing now but it ain t got any soul there s something lacking to it there s certain things in life that are naturally intended to fit and belong together one is pink cheese cloth and green roses and one is ham and eggs and one is irish and trouble and the other one is beef and potatoes with onions and still another one is people who are up against it and other people in the same fix the young man went into a protracted paroxysm of coughing with one hand he hugged his onion to his bosom no doubt no doubt said he at length but as i said i must be going because hetty clutched his sleeve firmly don t be a dago little brother don t cat raw onions chip it in toward the dinner and line yourself inside with the best stew you ever licked a spoon over must two ladies knock a young gentleman down and drag him inside for the honor of dining with em no harm shall befall you little brother loosen up and fall into line the young man s pale face relaxed into a grin believe i ll go you he said brightening if my onion is good as a credential i ll accept the invitation gladly it s good as that but better as seasoning said hetty you come and stand outside the door till i ask my lady friend if she has any objections and don t run away with that letter of recommendation before i come out hetty went into her room and closed the door the young man waited outside cecilia kid said the shop girl oiling the sharp saw of her voice as well as she could there s an onion outside with a young man attached i ve asked him in to dinner you ain t going to kick are you oh dear said cecilia sitting up and patting her artistic hair she cast a mournful glance at the ferry boat poster on the wall nit said hetty it ain t him you re up against real life now i believe you said your hero friend had money and automobiles this is a poor skeezicks that s got nothing to eat but an onion but he s easy spoken and not a freshy i imagine he s been a gentleman he s so low down now and we need the onion shall i bring him in i ll guarantee his behavior hetty dear sighed cecilia i m so hungry what difference does it make whether he s a prince or a burglar i don t care bring him in if he s got anything to eat with him hetty went back into the hall the onion man was gone her heart missed a beat and a gray look settled over her face except on her nose and cheek bones and then the tides of life flowed in again for she saw him leaning out of the front window at the other end of the hall she hurried there he was shouting to some one below the noise of the street overpowered the sound of her footsteps she looked down over his shoulder saw whom he was speaking to and heard his words he pulled himself in from the window sill and saw her standing over him hetty s eyes bored into him like two steel gimlets don t lie to me she said calmly what were you going to do with that onion the young man suppressed a cough and faced her resolutely his manner was that of one who had been bearded sufficiently i was going to eat it said he with emphatic slowness just as i told you before and you have nothing else to eat at home not a thing what kind of work do you do i am not working at anything just now then why said hetty with her voice set on its sharpest edge do you lean out of windows and give orders to chauffeurs in green automobiles in the street below the young man flushed and his dull eyes began to sparkle because madam said he in accelerando tones i pay the chauffeur s wages and i own the automobile and also this onion this onion madam he flourished the onion within an inch of hetty s nose the shop lady did not retreat a hair s breadth then why do you eat onions she said with biting contempt and nothing else i never said i did retorted the young man heatedly i said i had nothing else to eat where i live i am not a delicatessen store keeper then why pursued hetty inflexibly were you going to eat a raw onion my mother said the young man always made me eat one for a cold pardon my referring to a physical infirmity but you may have noticed that i have a very very severe cold i was going to eat the onion and go to bed i wonder why i am standing here and apologizing to you for it how did you catch this cold went on hetty suspiciously the young man seemed to have arrived at some extreme height of feeling there were two modes of descent open to him a burst of rage or a surrender to the ridiculous he chose wisely and the empty hall echoed his hoarse laughter you re a dandy said he and i don t blame you for being careful i don t mind telling you i got wet i was on a north river ferry a few days ago when a girl jumped overboard of course i hetty extended her hand interrupting his story give me the onion she said the young man set his jaw a trifle harder give me the onion she repeated he grinned and laid it in her hand then hetty s infrequent grim melancholy smile showed itself she took the young man s arm and pointed with her other hand to the door of her room little brother she said go in there the little fool you fished out of the river is there waiting for you go on in i ll give you three minutes before i come potatoes is in there waiting go on in onions after he had tapped at the door and entered hetty began to peel and wash the onion at the sink she gave a gray look at the gray roofs outside and the smile on her face vanished by little jerks and twitches but it s us she said grimly to herself it s us that furnishes the beef the hiding of black bill a lank strong red faced man with a wellington beak and small fiery eyes tempered by flaxen lashes sat on the station platform at los pinos swinging his legs to and fro at his side sat another man fat melancholy and seedy who seemed to be his friend they had the appearance of men to whom life had appeared as a reversible coat seamy on both sides ain t seen you in about four years ham said the seedy man which way you been travelling texas said the red faced man it was too cold in alaska for me and i found it warm in texas i ll tell you about one hot spell i went through there one morning i steps off the international at a water tank and lets it go on without me twas a ranch country and fuller of spite houses than new york city only out there they build em twenty miles away so you can t smell what they ve got for dinner instead of running em up two inches from their neighbors windows there wasn t any roads in sight so i footed it cross country the grass was shoe top deep and the mesquite timber looked just like a peach orchard it was so much like a gentleman s private estate that every minute you expected a kennelful of bulldogs to run out and bite you but i must have walked twenty miles before i came in sight of a ranch house it was a little one about as big as an elevated railroad station there was a little man in a white shirt and brown overalls and a pink handkerchief around his neck rolling cigarettes under a tree in front of the door greetings says i any refreshment welcome emoluments or even work for a comparative stranger oh come in says he in a refined tone sit down on that stool please i didn t hear your horse coming he isn t near enough yet says i i walked i don t want to be a burden but i wonder if you have three or four gallons of water handy you do look pretty dusty says he but our bathing arrangements it s a drink i want says i never mind the dust that s on the outside he gets me a dipper of water out of a red jar hanging up and then goes on do you want work for a time says i this is a rather quiet section of the country isn t it it is says he sometimes so i have been told one sees no human being pass for weeks at a time i ve been here only a month i bought the ranch from an old settler who wanted to move farther west it suits me says i quiet and retirement are good for a man sometimes and i need a job i can tend bar salt mines lecture float stock do a little middle weight slugging and play the piano can you herd sheep asks the little ranch man do you mean have i heard sheep says i can you herd em take charge of a flock of em says he oh says i now i understand you mean chase em around and bark at em like collie dogs well i might says i i ve never exactly done any sheep herding but i ve often seen em from car windows masticating daisies and they don t look dangerous i m short a herder says the ranchman you never can depend on the mexicans i ve only got two flocks you may take out my bunch of muttons there are only eight hundred of em in the morning if you like the pay is twelve dollars a month and your rations furnished you camp in a tent on the prairie with your sheep you do your own cooking but wood and water are brought to your camp it s an easy job i m on says i i ll take the job even if i have to garland my brow and hold on to a crook and wear a loose effect and play on a pipe like the shepherds do in pictures so the next morning the little ranchman helps me drive the flock of muttons from the corral to about two miles out and let em graze on a little hillside on the prairie he gives me a lot of instructions about not letting bunches of them stray off from the herd and driving em down to a water hole to drink at noon i ll bring out your tent and camping outfit and rations in the buckboard before night says he fine says i and don t forget the rations nor the camping outfit and be sure to bring the tent your name s zollicoffer ain t it my name says he is henry ogden all right mr ogden says i mine is mr percival saint clair i herded sheep for five days on the rancho chiquito and then the wool entered my soul that getting next to nature certainly got next to me i was lonesomer than crusoe s goat i ve seen a lot of persons more entertaining as companions than those sheep were i d drive em to the corral and pen em every evening and then cook my corn bread and mutton and coffee and lie down in a tent the size of a table cloth and listen to the coyotes and whippoorwills singing around the camp the fifth evening after i had corralled my costly but uncongenial muttons i walked over to the ranch house and stepped in the door mr ogden says i you and me have got to get sociable sheep are all very well to dot the landscape and furnish eight dollar cotton suitings for man but for table talk and fireside companions they rank along with five o clock teazers if you ve got a deck of cards or a parcheesi outfit or a game of authors get em out and let s get on a mental basis i ve got to do something in an intellectual line if it s only to knock somebody s brains out this henry ogden was a peculiar kind of ranchman he wore finger rings and a big gold watch and careful neckties and his face was calm and his nose spectacles was kept very shiny i saw once in muscogee an outlaw hung for murdering six men who was a dead ringer for him but i knew a preacher in arkansas that you would have taken to be his brother i didn t care much for him either way what i wanted was some fellowship and communion with holy saints or lost sinners anything sheepless would do well saint clair says he laying down the book he was reading i guess it must be pretty lonesome for you at first and i don t deny that it s monotonous for me are you sure you corralled your sheep so they won t stray out they re shut up as tight as the jury of a millionaire murderer says i and i ll be back with them long before they ll need their trained nurse so ogden digs up a deck of cards and we play casino after five days and nights of my sheep camp it was like a toot on broadway when i caught big casino i felt as excited as if i had made a million in trinity and when h o loosened up a little and told the story about the lady in the pullman car i laughed for five minutes that showed what a comparative thing life is a man may see so much that he d be bored to turn his head to look at a fire or joe weber or the adriatic sea but let him herd sheep for a spell and you ll see him splitting his ribs laughing at curfew shall not ring to night or really enjoying himself playing cards with ladies by and by ogden gets out a decanter of bourbon and then there is a total eclipse of sheep do you remember reading in the papers about a month ago says he about a train hold up on the m k t the express agent was shot through the shoulder and about in currency taken and it s said that only one man did the job seems to me i do says i but such things happen so often they don t linger long in the human texas mind did they overtake overhaul seize or lay hands upon the despoiler he escaped says ogden and i was just reading in a paper to day that the officers have tracked him down into this part of the country it seems the bills the robber got were all the first issue of currency to the second national bank of espinosa city and so they ve followed the trail where they ve been spent and it leads this way ogden pours out some more bourbon and shoves me the bottle i imagine says i after ingurgitating another modicum of the royal boose that it wouldn t be at all a disingenuous idea for a train robber to run down into this part of the country to hide for a spell a sheep ranch now says i would be the finest kind of a place who d ever expect to find such a desperate character among these song birds and muttons and wild flowers and by the way says i kind of looking h ogden over was there any description mentioned of this single handed terror was his lineaments or height and thickness or teeth fillings or style of habiliments set forth in print why no says ogden they say nobody got a good sight of him because he wore a mask but they know it was a train robber called black bill because he always works alone and because he dropped a handkerchief in the express car that had his name on it all right says i i approve of black bill s retreat to the sheep ranges i guess they won t find him there s one thousand dollars reward for his capture says ogden i don t need that kind of money says i looking mr sheepman straight in the eye the twelve dollars a month you pay me is enough i need a rest and i can save up until i get enough to pay my fare to texarkana where my widowed mother lives if black bill i goes on looking significantly at ogden was to have come down this way say a month ago and bought a little sheep ranch and stop says ogden getting out of his chair and looking pretty vicious do you mean to insinuate nothing says i no insinuations i m stating a hypodermical case i say if black bill had come down here and bought a sheep ranch and hired me to little boy blue em and treated me square and friendly as you ve done he d never have anything to fear from me a man is a man regardless of any complications he may have with sheep or railroad trains now you know where i stand ogden looks black as camp coffee for nine seconds and then he laughs amused you ll do saint clair says he if i was black bill i wouldn t be afraid to trust you let s have a game or two of seven up to night that is if you don t mind playing with a train robber i ve told you says i my oral sentiments and there s no strings to em while i was shuffling after the first hand i asks ogden as if the idea was a kind of a casualty where he was from oh says he from the mississippi valley that s a nice little place says i i ve often stopped over there but didn t you find the sheets a little damp and the food poor now i hail says i from the pacific slope ever put up there too draughty says ogden but if you ve ever in the middle west just mention my name and you ll get foot warmers and dripped coffee well says i i wasn t exactly fishing for your private telephone number and the middle name of your aunt that carried off the cumberland presbyterian minister it don t matter i just want you to know you are safe in the hands of your shepherd now don t play hearts on spades and don t get nervous still harping says ogden laughing again don t you suppose that if i was black bill and thought you suspected me i d put a winchester bullet into you and stop my nervousness if i had any not any says i a man who s got the nerve to hold up a train single handed wouldn t do a trick like that i ve knocked about enough to know that them are the kind of men who put a value on a friend not that i can claim being a friend of yours mr ogden says i being only your sheep herder but under more expeditious circumstances we might have been forget the sheep temporarily i beg says ogden and cut for deal about four days afterward while my muttons was nooning on the water hole and i deep in the interstices of making a pot of coffee up rides softly on the grass a mysterious person in the garb of the being he wished to represent he was dressed somewhere between a kansas city detective buffalo bill and the town dog catcher of baton rouge his chin and eye wasn t molded on fighting lines so i knew he was only a scout herdin sheep he asks me well says i to a man of your evident gumptional endowments i wouldn t have the nerve to state that i am engaged in decorating old bronzes or oiling bicycle sprockets you don t talk or look like a sheep herder to me says he but you talk like what you look like to me says i and then he asks me who i was working for and i shows him rancho chiquito two miles away in the shadow of a low hill and he tells me he s a deputy sheriff there s a train robber called black bill supposed to be somewhere in these parts says the scout he s been traced as far as san antonio and maybe farther have you seen or heard of any strangers around here during the past month i have not says i except a report of one over at the mexican quarters of loomis ranch on the frio what do you know about him asks the deputy he s three days old says i what kind of a looking man is the man you work for he asks does old george ramey own this place yet he s run sheep here for the last ten years but never had no success the old man has sold out and gone west i tells him another sheep fancier bought him out about a month ago what kind of a looking man is he asks the deputy again oh says i a big fat kind of a dutchman with long whiskers and blue specs i don t think he knows a sheep from a ground squirrel i guess old george soaked him pretty well on the deal says i after indulging himself in a lot more non communicative information and two thirds of my dinner the deputy rides away that night i mentions the matter to ogden they re drawing the tendrils of the octopus around black bill says i and then i told him about the deputy sheriff and how i d described him to the deputy and what the deputy said about the matter oh well says ogden let s don t borrow any of black bill s troubles we ve a few of our own get the bourbon out of the cupboard and we ll drink to his health unless says he with his little cackling laugh you re prejudiced against train robbers i ll drink says i to any man who s a friend to a friend and i believe that black bill i goes on would be that so here s to black bill and may he have good luck and both of us drank about two weeks later comes shearing time the sheep had to be driven up to the ranch and a lot of frowzy headed mexicans would snip the fur off of them with back action scissors so the afternoon before the barbers were to come i hustled my underdone muttons over the hill across the dell down by the winding brook and up to the ranch house where i penned em in a corral and bade em my nightly adieus i went from there to the ranch house i find h ogden esquire lying asleep on his little cot bed i guess he had been overcome by anti insomnia or diswakefulness or some of the diseases peculiar to the sheep business his mouth and vest were open and he breathed like a second hand bicycle pump i looked at him and gave vent to just a few musings imperial caesar says i asleep in such a way might shut his mouth and keep the wind away a man asleep is certainly a sight to make angels weep what good is all his brain muscle backing nerve influence and family connections he s at the mercy of his enemies and more so of his friends and he s about as beautiful as a cab horse leaning against the metropolitan opera house at a m dreaming of the plains of arabia now a woman asleep you regard as different no matter how she looks you know it s better for all hands for her to be that way well i took a drink of bourbon and one for ogden and started in to be comfortable while he was taking his nap he had some books on his table on indigenous subjects such as japan and drainage and physical culture and some tobacco which seemed more to the point after i d smoked a few and listened to the sartorial breathing of h o i happened to look out the window toward the shearing pens where there was a kind of a road coming up from a kind of a road across a kind of a creek farther away i saw five men riding up to the house all of em carried guns across their saddles and among em was the deputy that had talked to me at my camp they rode up careful in open formation with their guns ready i set apart with my eye the one i opinionated to be the boss muck raker of this law and order cavalry good evening gents says i won t you light and tie your horses the boss rides up close and swings his gun over till the opening in it seems to cover my whole front elevation don t you move your hands none says he till you and me indulge in a adequate amount of necessary conversation i will not says i i am no deaf mute and therefore will not have to disobey your injunctions in replying we are on the lookout says he for black bill the man that held up the katy for in may we are searching the ranches and everybody on em what is your name and what do you do on this ranch captain says i percival saint clair is my occupation and my name is sheep herder i ve got my flock of veals no muttons penned here to night the shearers are coming to morrow to give them a hair cut with baa a rum i suppose where s the boss of this ranch the captain of the gang asks me wait just a minute cap n says i wasn t there a kind of a reward offered for the capture of this desperate character you have referred to in your preamble there s a thousand dollars reward offered says the captain but it s for his capture and conviction there don t seem to be no provision made for an informer it looks like it might rain in a day or so says i in a tired way looking up at the cerulean blue sky if you know anything about the locality disposition or secretiveness of this here black bill says he in a severe dialect you are amiable to the law in not reporting it i heard a fence rider say says i in a desultory kind of voice that a mexican told a cowboy named jake over at pidgin s store on the nueces that he heard that black bill had been seen in matamoras by a sheepman s cousin two weeks ago tell you what i ll do tight mouth says the captain after looking me over for bargains if you put us on so we can scoop black bill i ll pay you a hundred dollars out of my own out of our own pockets that s liberal says he you ain t entitled to anything now what do you say cash down now i asks the captain has a sort of discussion with his helpmates and they all produce the contents of their pockets for analysis out of the general results they figured up in cash and worth of plug tobacco come nearer capitan meeo says i and listen he so did i am mighty poor and low down in the world says i i am working for twelve dollars a month trying to keep a lot of animals together whose only thought seems to be to get asunder although says i i regard myself as some better than the state of south dakota it s a come down to a man who has heretofore regarded sheep only in the form of chops i m pretty far reduced in the world on account of foiled ambitions and rum and a kind of cocktail they make along the p r r all the way from scranton to cincinnati dry gin french vermouth one squeeze of a lime and a good dash of orange bitters if you re ever up that way don t fail to let one try you and again says i i have never yet went back on a friend i ve stayed by em when they had plenty and when adversity s overtaken me i ve never forsook em but i goes on this is not exactly the case of a friend twelve dollars a month is only bowing acquaintance money and i do not consider brown beans and corn bread the food of friendship i am a poor man says i and i have a widowed mother in texarkana you will find black bill says i lying asleep in this house on a cot in the room to your right he s the man you want as i know from his words and conversation he was in a way a friend i explains and if i was the man i once was the entire product of the mines of gondola would not have tempted me to betray him but says i every week half of the beans was wormy and not nigh enough wood in camp better go in careful gentlemen says i he seems impatient at times and when you think of his late professional pursuits one would look for abrupt actions if he was come upon sudden so the whole posse unmounts and ties their horses and unlimbers their ammunition and equipments and tiptoes into the house and i follows like delilah when she set the philip stein on to samson the leader of the posse shakes ogden and wakes him up and then he jumps up and two more of the reward hunters grab him ogden was mighty tough with all his slimness and he gives em as neat a single footed tussle against odds as i ever see what does this mean he says after they had him down you re scooped in mr black bill says the captain that s all it s an outrage says h ogden madder yet it was says the peace and good will man the katy wasn t bothering you and there s a law against monkeying with express packages and he sits on h ogden s stomach and goes through his pockets symptomatically and careful i ll make you perspire for this says ogden perspiring some himself i can prove who i am so can i says the captain as he draws from h ogden s inside coat pocket a handful of new bills of the second national bank of espinosa city your regular engraved tuesdays and fridays visiting card wouldn t have a louder voice in proclaiming your indemnity than this here currency you can get up now and prepare to go with us and expatriate your sins h ogden gets up and fixes his necktie he says no more after they have taken the money off of him a well greased idea says the sheriff captain admiring to slip off down here and buy a little sheep ranch where the hand of man is seldom heard it was the slickest hide out i ever see says the captain so one of the men goes to the shearing pen and hunts up the other herder a mexican they call john sallies and he saddles ogden s horse and the sheriffs all ride tip close around him with their guns in hand ready to take their prisoner to town before starting ogden puts the ranch in john sallies hands and gives him orders about the shearing and where to graze the sheep just as if he intended to be back in a few days and a couple of hours afterward one percival saint clair an ex sheep herder of the rancho chiquito might have been seen with a hundred and nine dollars wages and blood money in his pocket riding south on another horse belonging to said ranch the red faced man paused and listened the whistle of a coming freight train sounded far away among the low hills the fat seedy man at his side sniffed and shook his frowzy head slowly and disparagingly what is it snipy asked the other got the blues again no i ain t said the seedy one sniffing again but i don t like your talk you and me have been friends off and on for fifteen year and i never yet knew or heard of you giving anybody up to the law not no one and here was a man whose saleratus you had et and at whose table you had played games of cards if casino can be so called and yet you inform him to the law and take money for it it never was like you i say this h ogden resumed the red faced man through a lawyer proved himself free by alibis and other legal terminalities as i so heard afterward he never suffered no harm he did me favors and i hated to hand him over how about the bills they found in his pocket asked the seedy man i put em there said the red faced man while he was asleep when i saw the posse riding up i was black bill look out snipy here she comes we ll board her on the bumpers when she takes water at the tank schools and schools i old jerome warren lived in a hundred thousand dollar house at east fifty soforth street he was a down town broker so rich that he could afford to walk for his health a few blocks in the direction of his office every morning and then call a cab he had an adopted son the son of an old friend named gilbert cyril scott could play him nicely who was becoming a successful painter as fast as he could squeeze the paint out of his tubes another member of the household was barbara ross a stepniece man is born to trouble so as old jerome had no family of his own he took up the burdens of others gilbert and barbara got along swimmingly there was a tacit and tactical understanding all round that the two would stand up under a floral bell some high noon and promise the minister to keep old jerome s money in a state of high commotion but at this point complications must be introduced thirty years before when old jerome was young jerome there was a brother of his named dick dick went west to seek his or somebody else s fortune nothing was heard of him until one day old jerome had a letter from his brother it was badly written on ruled paper that smelled of salt bacon and coffee grounds the writing was asthmatic and the spelling st vitusy it appeared that instead of dick having forced fortune to stand and deliver he had been held up himself and made to give hostages to the enemy that is as his letter disclosed he was on the point of pegging out with a complication of disorders that even whiskey had failed to check all that his thirty years of prospecting had netted him was one daughter nineteen years old as per invoice whom he was shipping east charges prepaid for jerome to clothe feed educate comfort and cherish for the rest of her natural life or until matrimony should them part old jerome was a board walk everybody knows that the world is supported by the shoulders of atlas and that atlas stands on a rail fence and that the rail fence is built on a turtle s back now the turtle has to stand on something and that is a board walk made of men like old jerome i do not know whether immortality shall accrue to man but if not so i would like to know when men like old jerome get what is due them they met nevada warren at the station she was a little girl deeply sunburned and wholesomely good looking with a manner that was frankly unsophisticated yet one that not even a cigar drummer would intrude upon without thinking twice looking at her somehow you would expect to see her in a short skirt and leather leggings shooting glass balls or taming mustangs but in her plain white waist and black skirt she sent you guessing again with an easy exhibition of strength she swung along a heavy valise which the uniformed porters tried in vain to wrest from her i am sure we shall be the best of friends said barbara pecking at the firm sunburned cheek i hope so said nevada dear little niece said old jerome you are as welcome to my home as if it were your father s own thanks said nevada and i am going to call you cousin said gilbert with his charming smile take the valise please said nevada it weighs a million pounds it s got samples from six of dad s old mines in it she explained to barbara i calculate they d assay about nine cents to the thousand tons but i promised him to bring them along ii it is a common custom to refer to the usual complication between one man and two ladies or one lady and two men or a lady and a man and a nobleman or well any of those problems as the triangle but they are never unqualified triangles they are always isosceles never equilateral so upon the coming of nevada warren she and gilbert and barbara ross lined up into such a figurative triangle and of that triangle barbara formed the hypotenuse one morning old jerome was lingering long after breakfast over the dullest morning paper in the city before setting forth to his down town fly trap he had become quite fond of nevada finding in her much of his dead brother s quiet independence and unsuspicious frankness a maid brought in a note for miss nevada warren a messenger boy delivered it at the door please she said he s waiting for an answer nevada who was whistling a spanish waltz between her teeth and watching the carriages and autos roll by in the street took the envelope she knew it was from gilbert before she opened it by the little gold palette in the upper left hand corner after tearing it open she pored over the contents for a while absorbedly then with a serious face she went and stood at her uncle s elbow uncle jerome gilbert is a nice boy isn t he why bless the child said old jerome crackling his paper loudly of course he is i raised him myself he wouldn t write anything to anybody that wasn t exactly i mean that everybody couldn t know and read would he i d just like to see him try it said uncle tearing a handful from his newspaper why what read this note he just sent me uncle and see if you think it s all right and proper you see i don t know much about city people and their ways old jerome threw his paper down and set both his feet upon it he took gilbert s note and fiercely perused it twice and then a third time why child said he you had me almost excited although i was sure of that boy he s a duplicate of his father and he was a gilt edged diamond he only asks if you and barbara will be ready at four o clock this afternoon for an automobile drive over to long island i don t see anything to criticise in it except the stationery i always did hate that shade of blue would it be all right to go asked nevada eagerly yes yes yes child of course why not still it pleases me to see you so careful and candid go by all means i didn t know said nevada demurely i thought i d ask you couldn t you go with us uncle i no no no no i ve ridden once in a car that boy was driving never again but it s entirely proper for you and barbara to go yes yes but i will not no no no no nevada flew to the door and said to the maid you bet we ll go i ll answer for miss barbara tell the boy to say to mr warren you bet we ll go nevada called old jerome pardon me my dear but wouldn t it be as well to send him a note in reply just a line would do no i won t bother about that said nevada gayly gilbert will understand he always does i never rode in an automobile in my life but i ve paddled a canoe down little devil river through the lost horse canon and if it s any livelier than that i d like to know iii two months are supposed to have elapsed barbara sat in the study of the hundred thousand dollar house it was a good place for her many places are provided in the world where men and women may repair for the purpose of extricating themselves from divers difficulties there are cloisters wailing places watering places confessionals hermitages lawyer s offices beauty parlors air ships and studies and the greatest of these are studies it usually takes a hypotenuse a long time to discover that it is the longest side of a triangle but it s a long line that has no turning barbara was alone uncle jerome and nevada had gone to the theatre barbara had not cared to go she wanted to stay at home and study in the study if you miss were a stunning new york girl and saw every day that a brown ingenuous western witch was getting hobbles and a lasso on the young man you wanted for yourself you too would lose taste for the oxidized silver setting of a musical comedy barbara sat by the quartered oak library table her right arm rested upon the table and her dextral fingers nervously manipulated a sealed letter the letter was addressed to nevada warren and in the upper left hand corner of the envelope was gilbert s little gold palette it had been delivered at nine o clock after nevada had left barbara would have given her pearl necklace to know what the letter contained but she could not open and read it by the aid of steam or a pen handle or a hair pin or any of the generally approved methods because her position in society forbade such an act she had tried to read some of the lines of the letter by holding the envelope up to a strong light and pressing it hard against the paper but gilbert had too good a taste in stationery to make that possible at eleven thirty the theatre goers returned it was a delicious winter night even so far as from the cab to the door they were powdered thickly with the big flakes downpouring diagonally from the cast old jerome growled good naturedly about villanous cab service and blockaded streets nevada colored like a rose with sapphire eyes babbled of the stormy nights in the mountains around dad s cabin during all these wintry apostrophes barbara cold at heart sawed wood the only appropriate thing she could think of to do old jerome went immediately up stairs to hot water bottles and quinine nevada fluttered into the study the only cheerfully lighted room subsided into an arm chair and while at the interminable task of unbuttoning her elbow gloves gave oral testimony as to the demerits of the show yes i think mr fields is really amusing sometimes said barbara here is a letter for you dear that came by special delivery just after you had gone who is it from asked nevada tugging at a button well really said barbara with a smile i can only guess the envelope has that queer little thing in one corner that gilbert calls a palette but which looks to me rather like a gilt heart on a school girl s valentine i wonder what he s writing to me about remarked nevada listlessly we re all alike said barbara all women we try to find out what is in a letter by studying the postmark as a last resort we use scissors and read it from the bottom upward here it is she made a motion as if to toss the letter across the table to nevada great catamounts exclaimed nevada these centre fire buttons are a nuisance i d rather wear buckskins oh barbara please shuck the hide off that letter and read it it ll be midnight before i get these gloves off why dear you don t want me to open gilbert s letter to you it s for you and you wouldn t wish any one else to read it of course nevada raised her steady calm sapphire eyes from her gloves nobody writes me anything that everybody mightn t read she said go on barbara maybe gilbert wants us to go out in his car again to morrow curiosity can do more things than kill a cat and if emotions well recognized as feminine are inimical to feline life then jealousy would soon leave the whole world catless barbara opened the letter with an indulgent slightly bored air well dear said she i ll read it if you want me to she slit the envelope and read the missive with swift travelling eyes read it again and cast a quick shrewd glance at nevada who for the time seemed to consider gloves as the world of her interest and letters from rising artists as no more than messages from mars for a quarter of a minute barbara looked at nevada with a strange steadfastness and then a smile so small that it widened her mouth only the sixteenth part of an inch and narrowed her eyes no more than a twentieth flashed like an inspired thought across her face since the beginning no woman has been a mystery to another woman swift as light travels each penetrates the heart and mind of another sifts her sister s words of their cunningest disguises reads her most hidden desires and plucks the sophistry from her wiliest talk like hairs from a comb twiddling them sardonically between her thumb and fingers before letting them float away on the breezes of fundamental doubt long ago eve s son rang the door bell of the family residence in paradise park bearing a strange lady on his arm whom he introduced eve took her daughter in law aside and lifted a classic eyebrow the land of nod said the bride languidly flirting the leaf of a palm i suppose you ve been there of course not lately said eve absolutely unstaggered don t you think the apple sauce they serve over there is execrable i rather like that mulberry leaf tunic effect dear but of course the real fig goods are not to be had over there come over behind this lilac bush while the gentlemen split a celery tonic i think the caterpillar holes have made your dress open a little in the back so then and there according to the records was the alliance formed by the only two who s who ladies in the world then it was agreed that woman should forever remain as clear as a pane of glass though glass was yet to be discovered to other women and that she should palm herself off on man as a mystery barbara seemed to hesitate really nevada she said with a little show of embarrassment you shouldn t have insisted on my opening this i i m sure it wasn t meant for any one else to know nevada forgot her gloves for a moment then read it aloud she said since you ve already read it what s the difference if mr warren has written to me something that any one else oughtn t to know that is all the more reason why everybody should know it well said barbara this is what it says dearest nevada come to my studio at twelve o clock to night do not fail barbara rose and dropped the note in nevada s lap i m awfully sorry she said that i knew it isn t like gilbert there must be some mistake just consider that i am ignorant of it will you dear i must go up stairs now i have such a headache i m sure i don t understand the note perhaps gilbert has been dining too well and will explain good night iv nevada tiptoed to the hall and heard barbara s door close upstairs the bronze clock in the study told the hour of twelve was fifteen minutes away she ran swiftly to the front door and let herself out into the snow storm gilbert warren s studio was six squares away by aerial ferry the white silent forces of the storm attacked the city from beyond the sullen east river already the snow lay a foot deep on the pavements the drifts heaping themselves like scaling ladders against the walls of the besieged town the avenue was as quiet as a street in pompeii cabs now and then skimmed past like white winged gulls over a moonlit ocean and less frequent motor cars sustaining the comparison hissed through the foaming waves like submarine boats on their jocund perilous journeys nevada plunged like a wind driven storm petrel on her way she looked up at the ragged sierras of cloud capped buildings that rose above the streets shaded by the night lights and the congealed vapors to gray drab ashen lavender dun and cerulean tints they were so like the wintry mountains of her western home that she felt a satisfaction such as the hundred thousand dollar house had seldom brought her a policeman caused her to waver on a corner just by his eye and weight hello mabel said he kind of late for you to be out ain t it i i am just going to the drug store said nevada hurrying past him the excuse serves as a passport for the most sophisticated does it prove that woman never progresses or that she sprang from adam s rib full fledged in intellect and wiles turning eastward the direct blast cut down nevada s speed one half she made zigzag tracks in the snow but she was as tough as a pinon sapling and bowed to it as gracefully suddenly the studio building loomed before her a familiar landmark like a cliff above some well remembered canon the haunt of business and its hostile neighbor art was darkened and silent the elevator stopped at ten up eight flights of stygian stairs nevada climbed and rapped firmly at the door numbered she had been there many times before with barbara and uncle jerome gilbert opened the door he had a crayon pencil in one hand a green shade over his eyes and a pipe in his mouth the pipe dropped to the floor am i late asked nevada i came as quick as i could uncle and me were at the theatre this evening here i am gilbert gilbert did a pygmalion and galatea act he changed from a statue of stupefaction to a young man with a problem to tackle he admitted nevada got a whiskbroom and began to brush the snow from her clothes a great lamp with a green shade hung over an easel where the artist had been sketching in crayon you wanted me said nevada simply and i came you said so in your letter what did you send for me for you read my letter inquired gilbert sparring for wind barbara read it to me i saw it afterward it said come to my studio at twelve to night and do not fail i thought you were sick of course but you don t seem to be aha said gilbert irrelevantly i ll tell you why i asked you to come nevada i want you to marry me immediately to night what s a little snow storm will you do it you might have noticed that i would long ago said nevada and i m rather stuck on the snow storm idea myself i surely would hate one of these flowery church noon weddings gilbert i didn t know you had grit enough to propose it this way let s shock em it s our funeral ain t it you bet said gilbert where did i hear that expression he added to himself wait a minute nevada i want to do a little phoning he shut himself in a little dressing room and called upon the lightnings of tile heavens condensed into unromantic numbers and districts that you jack you confounded sleepyhead yes wake up this is me or i oh bother the difference in grammar i m going to be married right away yes wake up your sister don t answer me back bring her along too you must remind agnes of the time i saved her from drowning in lake ronkonkoma i know it s caddish to refer to it but she must come with you yes nevada is here waiting we ve been engaged quite a while some opposition among the relatives you know and we have to pull it off this way we re waiting here for you don t let agnes out talk you bring her you will good old boy i ll order a carriage to call for you double quick time confound you jack you re all right gilbert returned to the room where nevada waited my old friend jack peyton and his sister were to have been here at a quarter to twelve he explained but jack is so confoundedly slow i ve just phoned them to hurry they ll be here in a few minutes i m the happiest man in the world nevada what did you do with the letter i sent you to day i ve got it cinched here said nevada pulling it out from beneath her opera cloak gilbert drew the letter from the envelope and looked it over carefully then he looked at nevada thoughtfully didn t you think it rather queer that i should ask you to come to my studio at midnight he asked why no said nevada rounding her eyes not if you needed me out west when a pal sends you a hurry call ain t that what you say here we get there first and talk about it after the row is over and it s usually snowing there too when things happen so i didn t mind gilbert rushed into another room and came back burdened with overcoats warranted to turn wind rain or snow put this raincoat on he said holding it for her we have a quarter of a mile to go old jack and his sister will be here in a few minutes he began to struggle into a heavy coat oh nevada he said just look at the head lines on the front page of that evening paper on the table will you it s about your section of the west and i know it will interest you he waited a full minute pretending to find trouble in the getting on of his overcoat and then turned nevada had not moved she was looking at him with strange and pensive directness her cheeks had a flush on them beyond the color that had been contributed by the wind and snow but her eyes were steady i was going to tell you she said anyhow before you before we before well before anything dad never gave me a day of schooling i never learned to read or write a darned word now if pounding their uncertain way up stairs the feet of jack the somnolent and agnes the grateful were heard v when mr and mrs gilbert warren were spinning softly homeward in a closed carriage after the ceremony gilbert s said nevada would you really like to know what i wrote you in the letter that you received to night fire away said his bride word for word said gilbert it was this my dear miss warren you were right about the flower it was a hydrangea and not a lilac all right said nevada but let s forget it the joke s on barbara anyway thimble thimble these are the directions for finding the i office of carteret carteret mill supplies and leather belting you follow the broadway trail down until you pass the crosstown line the bread line and the dead line and come to the big canons of the moneygrubber tribe then you turn to the left to the right dodge a push cart and the tongue of a two ton four horse dray and hop skip and jump to a granite ledge on the side of a twenty one story synthetic mountain of stone and iron in the twelfth story is the office of carteret carteret the factory where they make the mill supplies and leather belting is in brooklyn those commodities to say nothing of brooklyn not being of interest to you let us hold the incidents within the confines of a one act one scene play thereby lessening the toil of the reader and the expenditure of the publisher so if you have the courage to face four pages of type and carteret carteret s office boy percival you shall sit on a varnished chair in the inner office and peep at the little comedy of the old nigger man the hunting case watch and the open faced question mostly borrowed from the late mr frank stockton as you will conclude first biography but pared to the quick must intervene i am for the inverted sugar coated quinine pill the bitter on the outside the carterets were or was columbia college professors please rule an old virginia family long time ago the gentlemen of the family had worn lace ruffles and carried tinless foils and owned plantations and had slaves to burn but the war had greatly reduced their holdings of course you can perceive at once that this flavor has been shoplifted from mr f hopkinson smith in spite of the et after carter well anyhow in digging up the carteret history i shall not take you farther back than the year the two original american carterets came over in that year but by different means of transportation one brother named john came in the mayflower and became a pilgrim father you ve seen his picture on the covers of the thanksgiving magazines hunting turkeys in the deep snow with a blunderbuss blandford carteret the other brother crossed the pond in his own brigantine landed on the virginia coast and became an f f v john became distinguished for piety and shrewdness in business blandford for his pride juleps marksmanship and vast slave cultivated plantations then came the civil war i must condense this historical interpolation stonewall jackson was shot lee surrendered grant toured the world cotton went to nine cents old crow whiskey and jim crow cars were invented the seventy ninth massachusetts volunteers returned to the ninety seventh alabama zouaves the battle flag of lundy s lane which they bought at a second hand store in chelsea kept by a man named skzchnzski georgia sent the president a sixty pound watermelon and that brings us up to the time when the story begins my but that was sparring for an opening i really must brush op on my aristotle the yankee carterets went into business in new york long before the war their house as far as leather belting and mill supplies was concerned was as musty and arrogant and solid as one of those old east india tea importing concerns that you read about in dickens there were some rumors of a war behind its counters but not enough to affect the business during and after the war blandford carteret f f v lost his plantations juleps marksmanship and life he bequeathed little more than his pride to his surviving family so it came to pass that blandford carteret the fifth aged fifteen was invited by the leather and millsupplies branch of that name to come north and learn business instead of hunting foxes and boasting of the glory of his fathers on the reduced acres of his impoverished family the boy jumped at the chance and at the age of twenty five sat in the office of the firm equal partner with john the fifth of the blunderbuss and turkey branch here the story begins again the young men were about the same age smooth of face alert easy of manner and with an air that promised mental and physical quickness they were razored blue serged straw hatted and pearl stick pinned like other young new yorkers who might be millionaires or bill clerks one afternoon at four o clock in the private office of the firm blandford carteret opened a letter that a clerk had just brought to his desk after reading it he chuckled audibly for nearly a minute john looked around from his desk inquiringly it s from mother said blandford i ll read you the funny part of it she tells me all the neighborhood news first of course and then cautions me against getting my feet wet and musical comedies after that come some vital statistics about calves and pigs and an estimate of the wheat crop and now i ll quote some and what do you think old uncle jake who was seventy six last wednesday must go travelling nothing would do but he must go to new york and see his young marster blandford old as he is he has a deal of common sense so i ve let him go i couldn t refuse him he seemed to have concentrated all his hopes and desires into this one adventure into the wide world you know he was born on the plantation and has never been ten miles away from it in his life and he was your father s body servant during the war and has been always a faithful vassal and servant of the family he has often seen the gold watch the watch that was your father s and your father s father s i told him it was to be yours and he begged me to allow him to take it to you and to put it into your hands himself so he has it carefully inclosed in a buck skin case and is bringing it to you with all the pride and importance of a king s messenger i gave him money for the round trip and for a two weeks stay in the city i wish you would see to it that he gets comfortable quarters jake won t need much looking after he s able to take care of himself but i have read in the papers that african bishops and colored potentates generally have much trouble in obtaining food and lodging in the yankee metropolis that may be all right but i don t see why the best hotel there shouldn t take jake in still i suppose it s a rule i gave him full directions about finding you and packed his valise myself you won t have to bother with him but i do hope you ll see that he is made comfortable take the watch that he brings you it s almost a decoration it has been worn by true carterets and there isn t a stain upon it nor a false movement of the wheels bringing it to you is the crowning joy of old jake s life i wanted him to have that little outing and that happiness before it is too late you have often heard us talk about how jake pretty badly wounded himself crawled through the reddened grass at chancellorsville to where your father lay with the bullet in his dear heart and took the watch from his pocket to keep it from the yanks so my son when the old man comes consider him as a frail but worthy messenger from the old time life and home you have been so long away from home and so long among the people that we have always regarded as aliens that i m not sure that jake will know you when he sees you but jake has a keen perception and i rather believe that he will know a virginia carteret at sight i can t conceive that even ten years in yankee land could change a boy of mine anyhow i m sure you will know jake i put eighteen collars in his valise if he should have to buy others he wears a number please see that he gets the right ones he will be no trouble to you at all if you are not too busy i d like for you to find him a place to board where they have white meal corn bread and try to keep him from taking his shoes off in your office or on the street his right foot swells a little and he likes to be comfortable if you can spare the time count his handkerchiefs when they come back from the wash i bought him a dozen new ones before he left he should be there about the time this letter reaches you i told him to go straight to your office when he arrives as soon as blandford had finished the reading of this something happened as there should happen in stories and must happen on the stage percival the office boy with his air of despising the world s output of mill supplies and leather belting came in to announce that a colored gentleman was outside to see mr blandford carteret bring him in said blandford rising john carteret swung around in his chair and said to percival ask him to wait a few minutes outside we ll let you know when to bring him in then he turned to his cousin with one of those broad slow smiles that was an inheritance of all the carterets and said bland i ve always had a consuming curiosity to understand the differences that you haughty southerners believe to exist between you all and the people of the north of course i know that you consider yourselves made out of finer clay and look upon adam as only a collateral branch of your ancestry but i don t know why i never could understand the differences between us well john said blandford laughing what you don t understand about it is just the difference of course i suppose it was the feudal way in which we lived that gave us our lordly baronial airs and feeling of superiority but you are not feudal now went on john since we licked you and stole your cotton and mules you ve had to go to work just as we damyankees as you call us have always been doing and you re just as proud and exclusive and upper classy as you were before the war so it wasn t your money that caused it maybe it was the climate said blandford lightly or maybe our negroes spoiled us i ll call old jake in now i ll be glad to see the old villain again wait just a moment said john i ve got a little theory i want to test you and i are pretty much alike in our general appearance old jake hasn t seen you since you were fifteen let s have him in and play fair and see which of us gets the watch the old darky surrey ought to be able to pick out his young marster without any trouble the alleged aristocratic superiority of a reb ought to be visible to him at once he couldn t make the mistake of handing over the timepiece to a yankee of course the loser buys the dinner this evening and two dozen collars for jake is it a go blandford agreed heartily percival was summoned and told to usher the colored gentleman in uncle jake stepped inside the private office cautiously he was a little old man as black as soot wrinkled and bald except for a fringe of white wool cut decorously short that ran over his ears and around his head there was nothing of the stage uncle about him his black suit nearly fitted him his shoes shone and his straw hat was banded with a gaudy ribbon in his right hand he carried something carefully concealed by his closed fingers uncle jake stopped a few steps from the door two young men sat in their revolving desk chairs ten feet apart and looked at him in friendly silence his gaze slowly shifted many times from one to the other he felt sure that he was in the presence of one at least of the revered family among whose fortunes his life had begun and was to end one had the pleasing but haughty carteret air the other had the unmistakable straight long family nose both had the keen black eyes horizontal brows and thin smiling lips that had distinguished both the carteret of the mayflower and him of the brigantine old jake had thought that he could have picked out his young master instantly from a thousand northerners but he found himself in difficulties the best he could do was to use strategy howdy marse blandford howdy suh he said looking midway between the two young men howdy uncle jake they both answered pleasantly and in unison sit down have you brought the watch uncle jake chose a hard bottom chair at a respectful distance sat on the edge of it and laid his hat carefully on the floor the watch in its buckskin case he gripped tightly he had not risked his life on the battle field to rescue that watch from his old marster s foes to hand it over again to the enemy without a struggle yes suh i got it in my hand suh i m gwine give it to you right away in jus a minute old missus told me to put it in young marse blandford s hand and tell him to wear it for the family pride and honor it was a mighty longsome trip for an old nigger man to make ten thousand miles it must be back to old vi ginia suh you ve growed mightily young marster i wouldn t have reconnized you but for yo powerful resemblance to old marster with admirable diplomacy the old man kept his eyes roaming in the space between the two men his words might have been addressed to either though neither wicked nor perverse he was seeking for a sign blandford and john exchanged winks i reckon you done got you ma s letter went on uncle jake she said she was gwine to write to you bout my comin along up this er way yes yes uncle jake said john briskly my cousin and i have just been notified to expect you we are both carterets you know although one of us said blandford was born and raised in the north so if you will hand over the watch said john my cousin and i said blandford will then see to it said john that comfortable quarters are found for you said blandford with creditable ingenuity old jake set up a cackling high pitched protracted laugh he beat his knee picked up his hat and bent the brim in an apparent paroxysm of humorous appreciation the seizure afforded him a mask behind which he could roll his eyes impartially between above and beyond his two tormentors i sees what he chuckled after a while you gen lemen is tryin to have fun with the po old nigger but you can t fool old jake i knowed you marse blandford the minute i sot eyes on you you was a po skimpy little boy no mo than about fo teen when you lef home to come no th but i knowed you the minute i sot eyes on you you is the mawtal image of old marster the other gen leman resembles you mightily suh but you can t fool old jake on a member of the old vi ginia family no suh at exactly the same time both carterets smiled and extended a hand for the watch uncle jake s wrinkled black face lost the expression of amusement to which he had vainly twisted it he knew that he was being teased and that it made little real difference as far as its safety went into which of those outstretched hands he placed the family treasure but it seemed to him that not only his own pride and loyalty but much of the virginia carterets was at stake he had heard down south during the war about that other branch of the family that lived in the north and fought on the yuther side and it had always grieved him he had followed his old marster s fortunes from stately luxury through war to almost poverty and now with the last relic and reminder of him blessed by old missus and intrusted implicitly to his care he had come ten thousand miles as it seemed to deliver it into the hands of the one who was to wear it and wind it and cherish it and listen to it tick off the unsullied hours that marked the lives of the carterets of virginia his experience and conception of the yankees had been an impression of tyrants low down common trash in blue laying waste with fire and sword he had seen the smoke of many burning homesteads almost as grand as carteret hall ascending to the drowsy southern skies and now he was face to face with one of them and he could not distinguish him from his young marster whom he had come to find and bestow upon him the emblem of his kingship even as the arm clothed in white samite mystic wonderful laid excalibur in the right hand of arthur he saw before him two young men easy kind courteous welcoming either of whom might have been the one he sought troubled bewildered sorely grieved at his weakness of judgment old jake abandoned his loyal subterfuges his right hand sweated against the buckskin cover of the watch he was deeply humiliated and chastened seriously now his prominent yellow white eyes closely scanned the two young men at the end of his scrutiny he was conscious of but one difference between them one wore a narrow black tie with a white pearl stickpin the other s four in hand was a narrow blue one pinned with a black pearl and then to old jake s relief there came a sudden distraction drama knocked at the door with imperious knuckles and forced comedy to the wings and drama peeped with a smiling but set face over the footlights percival the hater of mill supplies brought in a card which he handed with the manner of one bearing a cartel to blue tie olivia de ormond read blue tie from the card he looked inquiringly at his cousin why not have her in said black tie and bring matters to a conclusion uncle jake said one of the young men would you mind taking that chair over there in the corner for a while a lady is coming in on some business we ll take up your case afterward the lady whom percival ushered in was young and petulantly decidedly freshly consciously and intentionally pretty she was dressed with such expensive plainness that she made you consider lace and ruffles as mere tatters and rags but one great ostrich plume that she wore would have marked her anywhere in the army of beauty as the wearer of the merry helmet of navarre miss de ormond accepted the swivel chair at blue tie s desk then the gentlemen drew leather upholstered seats conveniently near and spoke of the weather yes said she i noticed it was warmer but i mustn t take up too much of your time during business hours that is she continued unless we talk business she addressed her words to blue tie with a charming smile very well said he you don t mind my cousin being present do you we are generally rather confidential with each other especially in business matters oh no caroled miss de ormond i d rather he did hear he knows all about it anyhow in fact he s quite a material witness because he was present when you when it happened i thought you might want to talk things over before well before any action is taken as i believe the lawyers say have you anything in the way of a proposition to make asked black tie miss de ormond looked reflectively at the neat toe of one of her dull kid pumps i had a proposal made to me she said if the proposal sticks it cuts out the proposition let s have that settled first well as far as began blue tie excuse me cousin interrupted black tie if you don t mind my cutting in and then he turned with a good natured air toward the lady now let s recapitulate a bit he said cheerfully all three of us besides other mutual acquaintances have been out on a good many larks together i m afraid i ll have to call the birds by another name said miss de ormond all right responded black tie with unimpaired cheerfulness suppose we say squabs when we talk about the proposal and larks when we discuss the proposition you have a quick mind miss de ormond two months ago some half dozen of us went in a motor car for day s run into the country we stopped at a road house for dinner my cousin proposed marriage to you then and there he was influenced to do so of course by the beauty and charm which no one can deny that you possess i wish i had you for a press agent mr carteret said the beauty with a dazzling smile you are on the stage miss de ormond went on black tie you have had doubtless many admirers and perhaps other proposals you must remember too that we were a party of merrymakers on that occasion there were a good many corks pulled that the proposal of marriage was made to you by my cousin we cannot deny but hasn t it been your experience that by common consent such things lose their seriousness when viewed in the next day s sunlight isn t there something of a code among good sports i use the word in its best sense that wipes out each day the follies of the evening previous oh yes said miss de ormond i know that very well and i ve always played up to it but as you seem to be conducting the case with the silent consent of the defendant i ll tell you something more i ve got letters from him repeating the proposal and they re signed too i understand said black tie gravely what s your price for the letters i m not a cheap one said miss de ormond but i had decided to make you a rate you both belong to a swell family well if i am on the stage nobody can say a word against me truthfully and the money is only a secondary consideration it isn t the money i was after i i believed him and and i liked him she cast a soft entrancing glance at blue tie from under her long eyelashes and the price went on black tie inexorably ten thousand dollars said the lady sweetly or or the fulfillment of the engagement to marry i think it is time interrupted blue tie for me to be allowed to say a word or two you and i cousin belong to a family that has held its head pretty high you have been brought up in a section of the country very different from the one where our branch of the family lived yet both of us are carterets even if some of our ways and theories differ you remember it is a tradition of the family that no carteret ever failed in chivalry to a lady or failed to keep his word when it was given then blue tie with frank decision showing on his countenance turned to miss de ormond olivia said he on what date will you marry me before she could answer black tie again interposed it is a long journey said he from plymouth rock to norfolk bay between the two points we find the changes that nearly three centuries have brought in that time the old order has changed we no longer burn witches or torture slaves and to day we neither spread our cloaks on the mud for ladies to walk over nor treat them to the ducking stool it is the age of common sense adjustment and proportion all of us ladies gentlemen women men northerners southerners lords caitiffs actors hardware drummers senators hodcarriers and politicians are coming to a better understanding chivalry is one of our words that changes its meaning every day family pride is a thing of many constructions it may show itself by maintaining a moth eaten arrogance in cobwebbed colonial mansion or by the prompt paying of one s debts now i suppose you ve had enough of my monologue i ve learned something of business and a little of life and i somehow believe cousin that our great great grandfathers the original carterets would indorse my view of this matter black tie wheeled around to his desk wrote in a check book and tore out the check the sharp rasp of the perforated leaf making the only sound in the room he laid the check within easy reach of miss de ormond s hand business is business said he we live in a business age there is my personal check for what do you say miss de ormond will it he orange blossoms or cash miss de ormond picked up the cheek carelessly folded it indifferently and stuffed it into her glove oh this do she said calmly i just thought i d call and put it up to you i guess you people are all right but a girl has feelings you know i ve heard one of you was a southerner i wonder which one of you it is she arose smiled sweetly and walked to the door there with a flash of white teeth and a dip of the heavy plume she disappeared both of the cousins had forgotten uncle jake for the time but now they heard the shuffling of his shoes as he came across the rug toward them from his seat in the corner young marster he said take yo watch and without hesitation he laid the ancient timepiece in the hand of its rightful owner supply and demand finch keeps a hats cleaned by electricity while you wait establishment nine feet by twelve in third avenue once a customer you are always his i do not know his secret process but every four days your hat needs to be cleaned again finch is a leathern sallow slowfooted man between twenty and forty you would say he had been brought up a bushelman in essex street when business is slack he likes to talk so i had my hat cleaned even oftener than it deserved hoping finch might let me into some of the secrets of the sweatshops one afternoon i dropped in and found finch alone he began to anoint my headpiece de panama with his mysterious fluid that attracted dust and dirt like a magnet they say the indians weave em under water said i for a leader don t you believe it said finch no indian or white man could stay under water that long say do you pay much attention to politics i see in the paper something about a law they ve passed called the law of supply and demand i explained to him as well as i could that the reference was to a politico economical law and not to a legal statute i didn t know said finch i heard a good deal about it a year or so ago but in a one sided way yes said i political orators use it a great deal in fact they never give it a rest i suppose you heard some of those cart tail fellows spouting on the subject over here on the east side i heard it from a king said finch the white king of a tribe of indians in south america i was interested but not surprised the big city is like a mother s knee to many who have strayed far and found the roads rough beneath their uncertain feet at dusk they come home and sit upon the door step i know a piano player in a cheap cafe who has shot lions in africa a bell boy who fought in the british army against the zulus an express driver whose left arm had been cracked like a lobster s claw for a stew pot of patagonian cannibals when the boat of his rescuers hove in sight so a hat cleaner who had been a friend of a king did not oppress me a new band asked finch with his dry barren smile yes said i and half an inch wider i had had a new band five days before i meets a man one night said finch beginning his story a man brown as snuff with money in every pocket eating schweinerknuckel in schlagel s that was two years ago when i was a hose cart driver for no his discourse runs to the subject of gold he says that certain mountains in a country down south that he calls gaudymala is full of it he says the indians wash it out of the streams in plural quantities oh geronimo says i indians there s no indians in the south i tell him except elks maccabees and the buyers for the fall dry goods trade the indians are all on the reservations says i i m telling you this with reservations says he they ain t buffalo bill indians they re squattier and more pedigreed they call em inkers and aspics and they was old inhabitants when mazuma was king of mexico they wash the gold out of the mountain streams says the brown man and fill quills with it and then they empty em into red jars till they are full and then they pack it in buckskin sacks of one arroba each an arroba is twenty five pounds and store it in a stone house with an engraving of a idol with marcelled hair playing a flute over the door how do they work off this unearth increment i asks they don t says the man it s a case of ill fares the land with the great deal of velocity where wealth accumulates and there ain t any reciprocity after this man and me got through our conversation which left him dry of information i shook hands with him and told him i was sorry i couldn t believe him and a month afterward i landed on the coast of this gaudymala with that i had been saving up for five years i thought i knew what indians liked and i fixed myself accordingly i loaded down four pack mules with red woollen blankets wrought iron pails jewelled side combs for the ladies glass necklaces and safety razors i hired a black mozo who was supposed to be a mule driver and an interpreter too it turned out that he could interpret mules all right but he drove the english language much too hard his name sounded like a yale key when you push it in wrong side up but i called him mcclintock which was close to the noise well this gold village was forty miles up in the mountains and it took us nine days to find it but one afternoon mcclintock led the other mules and myself over a rawhide bridge stretched across a precipice five thousand feet deep it seemed to me the hoofs of the beasts drummed on it just like before george m cohan makes his first entrance on the stage this village was built of mud and stone and had no streets some few yellow and brown persons popped their heads out of doors looking about like welsh rabbits with worcester sauce on em out of the biggest house that had a kind of a porch around it steps a big white man red as a beet in color dressed in fine tanned deerskin clothes with a gold chain around his neck smoking a cigar i ve seen united states senators of his style of features and build also head waiters and cops he walks up and takes a look at us while mcclintock disembarks and begins to interpret to the lead mule while he smokes a cigarette hello buttinsky says the fine man to me how did you get in the game i didn t see you buy any chips who gave you the keys of the city i m a poor traveller says i especially mule back you ll excuse me do you run a hack line or only a bluff segregate yourself from your pseudo equine quadruped says he and come inside he raises a finger and a villager runs up this man will take care of your outfit says he and i ll take care of you he leads me into the biggest house and sets out the chairs and a kind of a drink the color of milk it was the finest room i ever saw the stone walls was hung all over with silk shawls and there was red and yellow rugs on the floor and jars of red pottery and angora goat skins and enough bamboo furniture to misfurnish half a dozen seaside cottages in the first place says the man you want to know who i am i m sole lessee and proprietor of this tribe of indians they call me the grand yacuma which is to say king or main finger of the bunch i ve got more power here than a charge d affaires a charge of dynamite and a charge account at tiffany s combined in fact i m the big stick with as many extra knots on it as there is on the record run of the lusitania oh i read the papers now and then says he now let s hear your entitlements he goes on and the meeting will be open well says i i am known as one w d finch occupation capitalist address east thirty second new york chips in the noble grand i know says he grinning it ain t the first time you ve seen it go down on the blotter i can tell by the way you hand it out well explain capitalist i tells this boss plain what i come for and how i come to came gold dust says he looking as puzzled as a baby that s got a feather stuck on its molasses finger that s funny this ain t a gold mining country and you invested all your capital on a stranger s story well well these indians of mine they are the last of the tribe of peehes are simple as children they know nothing of the purchasing power of gold i m afraid you ve been imposed on says he maybe so says i but it sounded pretty straight to me w d says the king all of a sudden i ll give you a square deal it ain t often i get to talk to a white man and i ll give you a show for your money it may be these constituents of mine have a few grains of gold dust hid away in their clothes to morrow you may get out these goods you ve brought up and see if you can make any sales now i m going to introduce myself unofficially my name is shane patrick shane i own this tribe of peche indians by right of conquest single handed and unafraid i drifted up here four years ago and won em by my size and complexion and nerve i learned their language in six weeks it s easy you simply emit a string of consonants as long as your breath holds out and then point at what you re asking for i conquered em spectacularly goes on king shane and then i went at em with economical politics law sleight of hand and a kind of new england ethics and parsimony every sunday or as near as i can guess at it i preach to em in the council house i m the council on the law of supply and demand i praise supply and knock demand i use the same text every time you wouldn t think w d says shane that i had poetry in me would you well says i i wouldn t know whether to call it poetry or not tennyson says shane furnishes the poetic gospel i preach i always considered him the boss poet here s the way the text goes for not to admire if a man could learn it were more than to walk all day like a sultan of old in a garden of spice you see i teach em to cut out demand that supply is the main thing i teach em not to desire anything beyond their simplest needs a little mutton a little cocoa and a little fruit brought up from the coast that s all they want to make cm happy i ve got em well trained they make their own clothes and hats out of a vegetable fibre and straw and they re a contented lot it s a great thing winds up shane to have made a people happy by the incultivation of such simple institutions well the next day with the king s permission i has the mcclintock open up a couple of sacks of my goods in the little plaza of the village the indians swarmed around by the hundred and looked the bargain counter over i shook red blankets at em flashed finger rings and ear bobs tried pearl necklaces and sidecombs on the women and a line of red hosiery on the men twas no use they looked on like hungry graven images but i never made a sale i asked mcclintock what was the trouble mac yawned three or four times rolled a cigarette made one or two confidential side remarks to a mule and then condescended to inform me that the people had no money just then up strolls king patrick big and red and royal as usual with the gold chain over his chest and his cigar in front of him how s business w d he asks fine says i it s a bargain day rush i ve got one more line of goods to offer before i shut up shop i ll try em with safety razors i ve got two gross that i bought at a fire sale shane laughs till some kind of mameluke or private secretary he carries with him has to hold him up my sainted aunt jerusha says he ain t you one of the babes in the goods w d don t you know that no indians ever shave they pull out their whiskers instead well says i that s just what these razors would do for em they wouldn t have any kick coming if they used em once shane went away and i could hear him laughing a block if there had been any block tell em says i to mcclintock it ain t money i want tell em i ll take gold dust tell em i ll allow em sixteen dollars an ounce for it in trade that s what i m out for the dust mac interprets and you d have thought a squadron of cops had charged the crowd to disperse it every uncle s nephew and aunt s niece of em faded away inside of two minutes at the royal palace that night me and the king talked it over they ve got the dust hid out somewhere says i or they wouldn t have been so sensitive about it they haven t says shane what s this gag you ve got about gold you been reading edward allen poe they ain t got any gold they put it in quills says i and then they empty it in jars and then into sacks of twenty five pounds each i got it straight w d says shane laughing and chewing his cigar i don t often see a white man and i feel like putting you on i don t think you ll get away from here alive anyhow so i m going to tell you come over here he draws aside a silk fibre curtain in a corner of the room and shows me a pile of buckskin sacks forty of em says shane one arroba in each one in round numbers worth of gold dust you see there it s all mine it belongs to the grand yacuma they bring it all to me two hundred and twenty thousand dollars think of that you glass bead peddler says shane and all mine little good it does you says i contemptuously and hatefully and so you are the government depository of this gang of money less money makers don t you pay enough interest on it to enable one of your depositors to buy an augusta maine pullman carbon diamond worth for listen says patrick shane with the sweat coming out on his brow i m confidant with you as you have somehow enlisted my regards did you ever he says feel the avoirdupois power of gold not the troy weight of it but the sixteen ounces to the pound force of it never says i i never take in any bad money shane drops down on the floor and throws his arms over the sacks of gold dust i love it says he i want to feel the touch of it day and night it s my pleasure in life i come in this room and i m a king and a rich man i ll be a millionaire in another year the pile s getting bigger every month i ve got the whole tribe washing out the sands in the creeks i m the happiest man in the world w d i just want to be near this gold and know it s mine and it s increasing every day now you know says he why my indians wouldn t buy your goods they can t they bring all the dust to me i m their king i ve taught em not to desire or admire you might as well shut up shop i ll tell you what you are says i you re a plain contemptible miser you preach supply and you forget demand now supply i goes on is never anything but supply on the contrary says i demand is a much broader syllogism and assertion demand includes the rights of our women and children and charity and friendship and even a little begging on the street corners they ve both got to harmonize equally and i ve got a few things up my commercial sleeve yet says i that may jostle your preconceived ideas of politics and economy the next morning i had mcclintock bring tip another mule load of goods to the plaza and open it up the people gathered around the same as before i got out the finest line of necklaces bracelets hair combs and earrings that i carried and had the women put em on and then i played trumps out of my last pack i opened up a half gross of hand mirrors with solid tinfoil backs and passed em around among the ladies that was the first introduction of looking glasses among the peche indians shane walks by with his big laugh business looking up any he asks it s looking at itself right now says i by and by a kind of a murmur goes through the crowd the women had looked into the magic crystal and seen that they were beautiful and was confiding the secret to the men the men seemed to be urging the lack of money and the hard times just before the election but their excuses didn t go then was my time i called mcclintock away from an animated conversation with his mules and told him to do some interpreting tell em says i that gold dust will buy for them these befitting ornaments for kings and queens of the earth tell em the yellow sand they wash out of the waters for the high sanctified yacomay and chop suey of the tribe will buy the precious jewels and charms that will make them beautiful and preserve and pickle them from evil spirits tell em the pittsburg banks are paying four per cent interest on deposits by mail while this get rich frequently custodian of the public funds ain t even paying attention keep telling em mac says i to let the gold dust family do their work talk to em like a born anti bryanite says i remind em that tom watson s gone back to georgia says i mcclintock waves his hand affectionately at one of his mules and then hurls a few stickfuls of minion type at the mob of shoppers a gutta percha indian man with a lady hanging on his arm with three strings of my fish scale jewelry and imitation marble beads around her neck stands up on a block of stone and makes a talk that sounds like a man shaking dice in a box to fill aces and sixes he says says mcclintock that the people not know that gold dust will buy their things the women very mad the grand yacuma tell them it no good but for keep to make bad spirits keep away you can t keep bad spirits away from money says i they say goes on mcclintock the yacuma fool them they raise plenty row going going says i gold dust or cash takes the entire stock the dust weighed before you and taken at sixteen dollars the ounce the highest price on the gaudymala coast then the crowd disperses all of a sudden and i don t know what s up mac and me packs away the hand mirrors and jewelry they had handed back to us and we had the mules back to the corral they had set apart for our garage while we was there we hear great noises of shouting and down across the plaza runs patrick shane hotfoot with his clothes ripped half off and scratches on his face like a cat had fought him hard for every one of its lives they re looting the treasury w d he sings out they re going to kill me and you too unlimber a couple of mules at once we ll have to make a get away in a couple of minutes they ve found out says i the truth about the law of supply and demand it s the women mostly says the king and they used to admire me so they hadn t seen looking glasses then says i they ve got knives and hatchets says shane hurry take that roan mule says i you and your law of supply i ll ride the dun for he s two knots per hour the faster the roan has a stiff knee but he may make it says i if you d included reciprocity in your political platform i might have given you the dun says i shane and mcclintock and me mounted our mules and rode across the rawhide bridge just as the peches reached the other side and began firing stones and long knives at us we cut the thongs that held up our end of the bridge and headed for the coast a tall bulky policeman came into finch s shop at that moment and leaned an elbow on the showcase finch nodded at him friendly i heard down at casey s said the cop in rumbling husky tones that there was going to be a picnic of the hat cleaners union over at bergen beach sunday is that right sure said finch there ll be a dandy time gimme five tickets said the cop throwing a five dollar bill on the showcase why said finch ain t you going it a little too go to h said the cop you got em to sell ain t you somebody s got to buy em wish i could go along i was glad to see finch so well thought of in his neighborhood and then in came a wee girl of seven with dirty face and pure blue eyes and a smutched and insufficient dress mamma says she recited shrilly that you must give me eighty cents for the grocer and nineteen for the milkman and five cents for me to buy hokey pokey with but she didn t say that the elf concluded with a hopeful but honest grin finch shelled out the money counting it twice but i noticed that the total sum that the small girl received was one dollar and four cents that s the right kind of a law remarked finch as he carefully broke some of the stitches of my hatband so that it would assuredly come off within a few days the law of supply and demand but they ve both got to work together i ll bet he went on with his dry smile she ll get jelly beans with that nickel she likes em what s supply if there s no demand for it what ever became of the king i asked curiously oh i might have told you said finch that was shane came in and bought the tickets he came back with me and he s on the force now buried treasure there are many kinds of fools now will everybody please sit still until they are called upon specifically to rise i had been every kind of fool except one i had expended my patrimony pretended my matrimony played poker lawn tennis and bucket shops parted soon with my money in many ways but there remained one rule of the wearer of cap and bells that i had not played that was the seeker after buried treasure to few does the delectable furor come but of all the would be followers in the hoof prints of king midas none has found a pursuit so rich in pleasurable promise but going back from my theme a while as lame pens must do i was a fool of the sentimental soft i saw may martha mangum and was hers she was eighteen the color of the white ivory keys of a new piano beautiful and possessed by the exquisite solemnity and pathetic witchery of an unsophisticated angel doomed to live in a small dull texas prairie town she had a spirit and charm that could have enabled her to pluck rubies like raspberries from the crown of belgium or any other sporty kingdom but she did not know it and i did not paint the picture for her you see i wanted may martha mangum for to have and to hold i wanted her to abide with me and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings may martha s father was a man hidden behind whiskers and spectacles he lived for bugs and butterflies and all insects that fly or crawl or buzz or get down your back or in the butter he was an etymologist or words to that effect he spent his life seining the air for flying fish of the june bug order and then sticking pins through em and calling em names he and may martha were the whole family he prized her highly as a fine specimen of the racibus humanus because she saw that he had food at times and put his clothes on right side before and kept his alcohol bottles filled scientists they say are apt to be absent minded there was another besides myself who thought may martha mangum one to be desired that was goodloe banks a young man just home from college he had all the attainments to be found in books latin greek philosophy and especially the higher branches of mathematics and logic if it hadn t been for his habit of pouring out this information and learning on every one that he addressed i d have liked him pretty well but even as it was he and i were you would have thought great pals we got together every time we could because each of us wanted to pump the other for whatever straws we could to find which way the wind blew from the heart of may martha mangum rather a mixed metaphor goodloe banks would never have been guilty of that that is the way of rivals you might say that goodloe ran to books manners culture rowing intellect and clothes i would have put you in mind more of baseball and friday night debating societies by way of culture and maybe of a good horseback rider but in our talks together and in our visits and conversation with may martha neither goodloe banks nor i could find out which one of us she preferred may martha was a natural born non committal and knew in her cradle how to keep people guessing as i said old man mangum was absentminded after a long time he found out one day a little butterfly must have told him that two young men were trying to throw a net over the head of the young person a daughter or some such technical appendage who looked after his comforts i never knew scientists could rise to such occasions old mangum orally labelled and classified goodloe and myself easily among the lowest orders of the vertebrates and in english too without going any further into latin than the simple references to orgetorix rex helvetii which is as far as i ever went myself and he told us that if he ever caught us around his house again he would add us to his collection goodloe banks and i remained away five days expecting the storm to subside when we dared to call at the house again may martha mangum and her father were gone gone the house they had rented was closed their little store of goods and chattels was gone also and not a word of farewell to either of us from may martha not a white fluttering note pinned to the hawthorn bush not a chalk mark on the gate post nor a post card in the post office to give us a clew for two months goodloe banks and i separately tried every scheme we could think of to track the runaways we used our friendship and influence with the ticket agent with livery stable men railroad conductors and our one lone lorn constable but without results then we became better friends and worse enemies than ever we forgathered in the back room of snyder s saloon every afternoon after work and played dominoes and laid conversational traps to find out from each other if anything had been discovered that is the way of rivals now goodloe banks had a sarcastic way of displaying his own learning and putting me in the class that was reading poor jane ray her bird is dead she cannot play well i rather liked goodloe and i had a contempt for his college learning and i was always regarded as good natured so i kept my temper and i was trying to find out if he knew anything about may martha so i endured his society in talking things over one afternoon he said to me suppose you do find her ed whereby would you profit miss mangum has a mind perhaps it is yet uncultured but she is destined for higher things than you could give her i have talked with no one who seemed to appreciate more the enchantment of the ancient poets and writers and the modern cults that have assimilated and expended their philosophy of life don t you think you are wasting your time looking for her my idea said i of a happy home is an eight room house in a grove of live oaks by the side of a charco on a texas prairie a piano i went on with an automatic player in the sitting room three thousand head of cattle under fence for a starter a buckboard and ponies always hitched at a post for the missus and may martha mangum to spend the profits of the ranch as she pleases and to abide with me and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings that said i is what is to be and a fig a dried smyrna dago stand fig for your curriculums cults and philosophy she is meant for higher things repeated goodloe banks whatever she is meant for i answered just now she is out of pocket and i shall find her as soon as i can without aid of the colleges the game is blocked said goodloe putting down a domino and we had the beer shortly after that a young farmer whom i knew came into town and brought me a folded blue paper he said his grandfather had just died i concealed a tear and he went on to say that the old man had jealously guarded this paper for twenty years he left it to his family as part of his estate the rest of which consisted of two mules and a hypotenuse of non arable land the sheet of paper was of the old blue kind used during the rebellion of the abolitionists against the secessionists it was dated june and it described the hiding place of ten burro loads of gold and silver coin valued at three hundred thousand dollars old rundle grandfather of his grandson sam was given the information by a spanish priest who was in on the treasure burying and who died many years before no afterward in old rundle s house old rundle wrote it down from dictation why didn t your father look this up i asked young rundle he went blind before he could do so he replied why didn t you hunt for it yourself i asked well said he i ve only known about the paper for ten years first there was the spring ploughin to do and then choppin the weeds out of the corn and then come takin fodder and mighty soon winter was on us it seemed to run along that way year after year that sounded perfectly reasonable to me so i took it up with young lee rundle at once the directions on the paper were simple the whole burro cavalcade laden with the treasure started from an old spanish mission in dolores county they travelled due south by the compass until they reached the alamito river they forded this and buried the treasure on the top of a little mountain shaped like a pack saddle standing in a row between two higher ones a heap of stones marked the place of the buried treasure all the party except the spanish priest were killed by indians a few days later the secret was a monopoly it looked good to me lee rundle suggested that we rig out a camping outfit hire a surveyor to run out the line from the spanish mission and then spend the three hundred thousand dollars seeing the sights in fort worth but without being highly educated i knew a way to save time and expense we went to the state land office and had a practical what they call a working sketch made of all the surveys of land from the old mission to the alamito river on this map i drew a line due southward to the river the length of lines of each survey and section of land was accurately given on the sketch by these we found the point on the river and had a connection made with it and an important well identified corner of the los animos five league survey a grant made by king philip of spain by doing this we did not need to have the line run out by a surveyor it was a great saving of expense and time so lee rundle and i fitted out a two horse wagon team with all the accessories and drove a hundred and forty nine miles to chico the nearest town to the point we wished to reach there we picked up a deputy county surveyor he found the corner of the los animos survey for us ran out the five thousand seven hundred and twenty varas west that our sketch called for laid a stone on the spot had coffee and bacon and caught the mail stage back to chico i was pretty sure we would get that three hundred thousand dollars lee rundle s was to be only one third because i was paying all the expenses with that two hundred thousand dollars i knew i could find may martha mangum if she was on earth and with it i could flutter the butterflies in old man mangum s dove cot too if i could find that treasure but lee and i established camp across the river were a dozen little mountains densely covered by cedar brakes but not one shaped like a pack saddle that did not deter us appearances are deceptive a pack saddle like beauty may exist only in the eye of the beholder i and the grandson of the treasure examined those cedar covered hills with the care of a lady hunting for the wicked flea we explored every side top circumference mean elevation angle slope and concavity of every one for two miles up and down the river we spent four days doing so then we hitched up the roan and the dun and hauled the remains of the coffee and bacon the one hundred and forty nine miles back to concho city lee rundle chewed much tobacco on the return trip i was busy driving because i was in a hurry as shortly as could be after our empty return goodloe banks and i forgathered in the back room of snyder s saloon to play dominoes and fish for information i told goodloe about my expedition after the buried treasure if i could have found that three hundred thousand dollars i said to him i could have scoured and sifted the surface of the earth to find may martha mangum she is meant for higher things said goodloe i shall find her myself but tell me how you went about discovering the spot where this unearthed increment was imprudently buried i told him in the smallest detail i showed him the draughtsman s sketch with the distances marked plainly upon it after glancing over it in a masterly way he leaned back in his chair and bestowed upon me an explosion of sardonic superior collegiate laughter well you are a fool jim he said when he could speak it s your play said i patiently fingering my double six twenty said goodloe making two crosses on the table with his chalk why am i a fool i asked buried treasure has been found before in many places because said he in calculating the point on the river where your line would strike you neglected to allow for the variation the variation there would be nine degrees west let me have your pencil goodloe banks figured rapidly on the back of an envelope the distance from north to south of the line run from the spanish mission said he is exactly twenty two miles it was run by a pocket compass according to your story allowing for the variation the point on the alamito river where you should have searched for your treasure is exactly six miles and nine hundred and forty five varas farther west than the place you hit upon oh what a fool you are jim what is this variation that you speak of i asked i thought figures never lied the variation of the magnetic compass said goodloe from the true meridian he smiled in his superior way and then i saw come out in his face the singular eager consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried treasure sometimes he said with the air of the oracle these old traditions of hidden money are not without foundation suppose you let me look over that paper describing the location perhaps together we might the result was that goodloe banks and i rivals in love became companions in adventure we went to chico by stage from huntersburg the nearest railroad town in chico we hired a team drawing a covered spring wagon and camping paraphernalia we had the same surveyor run out our distance as revised by goodloe and his variations and then dismissed him and sent him on his homeward road it was night when we arrived i fed the horses and made a fire near the bank of the river and cooked supper goodloe would have helped but his education had not fitted him for practical things but while i worked he cheered me with the expression of great thoughts handed down from the dead ones of old he quoted some translations from the greek at much length anacreon he explained that was a favorite passage with miss mangum as i recited it she is meant for higher things said i repeating his phrase can there be anything higher asked goodloe than to dwell in the society of the classics to live in the atmosphere of learning and culture you have often decried education what of your wasted efforts through your ignorance of simple mathematics how soon would you have found your treasure if my knowledge had not shown you your error we ll take a look at those hills across the river first said i and see what we find i am still doubtful about variations i have been brought up to believe that the needle is true to the pole the next morning was a bright june one we were up early and had breakfast goodloe was charmed he recited keats i think it was and kelly or shelley while i broiled the bacon we were getting ready to cross the river which was little more than a shallow creek there and explore the many sharp peaked cedar covered hills on the other side my good ulysses said goodloe slapping me on the shoulder while i was washing the tin breakfast plates let me see the enchanted document once more i believe it gives directions for climbing the hill shaped like a pack saddle i never saw a pack saddle what is it like jim score one against culture said i i ll know it when i see it goodloe was looking at old rundle s document when he ripped out a most uncollegiate swear word come here he said holding the paper up against the sunlight look at that he said laying his finger against it on the blue paper a thing i had never noticed before i saw stand out in white letters the word and figures malvern what about it i asked it s the water mark said goodloe the paper was manufactured in the writing on the paper is dated this is a palpable fraud oh i don t know said i the rundles are pretty reliable plain uneducated country people maybe the paper manufacturers tried to perpetrate a swindle and then goodloe banks went as wild as his education permitted he dropped the glasses off his nose and glared at me i ve often told you you were a fool he said you have let yourself be imposed upon by a clodhopper and you have imposed upon me how i asked have i imposed upon you by your ignorance said he twice i have discovered serious flaws in your plans that a common school education should have enabled you to avoid and he continued i have been put to expense that i could ill afford in pursuing this swindling quest i am done with it i rose and pointed a large pewter spoon at him fresh from the dish water goodloe banks i said i care not one parboiled navy bean for your education i always barely tolerated it in any one and i despised it in you what has your learning done for you it is a curse to yourself and a bore to your friends away i said away with your water marks and variations they are nothing to me they shall not deflect me from the quest i pointed with my spoon across the river to a small mountain shaped like a pack saddle i am going to search that mountain i went on for the treasure decide now whether you are in it or not if you wish to let a water mark or a variation shake your soul you are no true adventurer decide a white cloud of dust began to rise far down the river road it was the mail wagon from hesperus to chico goodloe flagged it i am done with the swindle said he sourly no one but a fool would pay any attention to that paper now well you always were a fool jim i leave you to your fate he gathered his personal traps climbed into the mail wagon adjusted his glasses nervously and flew away in a cloud of dust after i had washed the dishes and staked the horses on new grass i crossed the shallow river and made my way slowly through the cedar brakes up to the top of the hill shaped like a pack saddle it was a wonderful june day never in my life had i seen so many birds so many butter flies dragon flies grasshoppers and such winged and stinged beasts of the air and fields i investigated the hill shaped like a pack saddle from base to summit i found an absolute absence of signs relating to buried treasure there was no pile of stones no ancient blazes on the trees none of the evidences of the three hundred thousand dollars as set forth in the document of old man rundle i came down the hill in the cool of the afternoon suddenly out of the cedar brake i stepped into a beautiful green valley where a tributary small stream ran into the alamito river and there i was started to see what i took to be a wild man with unkempt beard and ragged hair pursuing a giant butterfly with brilliant wings perhaps he is an escaped madman i thought and wondered how he had strayed so far from seats of education and learning and then i took a few more steps and saw a vine covered cottage near the small stream and in a little grassy glade i saw may martha mangum plucking wild flowers she straightened up and looked at me for the first time since i knew her i saw her face which was the color of the white keys of a new piano turn pink i walked toward her without a word she let the gathered flowers trickle slowly from her hand to the grass i knew you would come jim she said clearly father wouldn t let me write but i knew you would come what followed you may guess there was my wagon and team just across the river i ve often wondered what good too much education is to a man if he can t use it for himself if all the benefits of it are to go to others where does it come in for may martha mangum abides with me there is an eight room house in a live oak grove and a piano with an automatic player and a good start toward the three thousand head of cattle is under fence and when i ride home at night my pipe and slippers are put away in places where they cannot be found but who cares for that who cares who cares to him who waits the hermit of the hudson was hustling about his cave with unusual animation the cave was on or in the top of a little spur of the catskills that had strayed down to the river s edge and not having a ferry ticket had to stop there the bijou mountains were densely wooded and were infested by ferocious squirrels and woodpeckers that forever menaced the summer transients like a badly sewn strip of white braid a macadamized road ran between the green skirt of the hills and the foamy lace of the river s edge a dim path wound from the comfortable road up a rocky height to the hermit s cave one mile upstream was the viewpoint inn to which summer folk from the city came leaving cool electric fanned apartments that they might be driven about in burning sunshine shrieking in gasoline launches by spindle legged modreds bearing the blankest of shields train your lorgnette upon the hermit and let your eye receive the personal touch that shall endear you to the hero a man of forty judging him fairly with long hair curling at the ends dramatic eyes and a forked brown beard like those that were imposed upon the west some years ago by self appointed divine healers who succeeded the grasshopper crop his outward vesture appeared to be kind of gunny sacking cut and made into a garment that would have made the fortune of a london tailor his long well shaped fingers delicate nose and poise of manner raised him high above the class of hermits who fear water and bury money in oyster cans in their caves in spots indicated by rude crosses chipped in the stone wall above the hermit s home was not altogether a cave the cave was an addition to the hermitage which was a rude hut made of poles daubed with clay and covered with the best quality of rust proof zinc roofing in the house proper there were stone slabs for seats a rustic bookcase made of unplaned poplar planks and a table formed of a wooden slab laid across two upright pieces of granite something between the furniture of a druid temple and that of a broadway beefsteak dungeon hung against the walls were skins of wild animals purchased in the vicinity of eighth street and university place new york the rear of the cabin merged into the cave there the hermit cooked his meals on a rude stone hearth with infinite patience and an old axe he had chopped natural shelves in the rocky walls on them stood his stores of flour bacon lard talcum powder kerosene baking powder soda mint tablets pepper salt and olivo cremo emulsion for chaps and roughness of the hands and face the hermit had hermited there for ten years he was an asset of the viewpoint inn to its guests he was second in interest only to the mysterious echo in the haunted glen and the lover s leap beat him only a few inches flat footed he was known far but not very wide on account of the topography as a scholar of brilliant intellect who had forsworn the world because he had been jilted in a love affair every saturday night the viewpoint inn sent to him surreptitiously a basket of provisions he never left the immediate outskirts of his hermitage guests of the inn who visited him said his store of knowledge wit and scintillating philosophy were simply wonderful you know that summer the viewpoint inn was crowded with guests so on saturday nights there were extra cans of tomatoes and sirloin steak instead of rounds in the hermit s basket now you have the material allegations in the case so make way for romance evidently the hermit expected a visitor he carefully combed his long hair and parted his apostolic beard when the ninety eight cent alarm clock on a stone shelf announced the hour of five he picked up his gunny sacking skirts brushed them carefully gathered an oaken staff and strolled slowly into the thick woods that surrounded the hermitage he had not long to wait up the faint pathway slippery with its carpet of pine needles toiled beatrix youngest and fairest of the famous trenholme sisters she was all in blue from hat to canvas pumps varying in tint from the shade of the tinkle of a bluebell at daybreak on a spring saturday to the deep hue of a monday morning at nine when the washer woman has failed to show up beatrix dug her cerulean parasol deep into the pine needles and sighed the hermit on the q t removed a grass burr from the ankle of one sandalled foot with the big toe of his other one she blued and almost starched and ironed him with her cobalt eyes it must be so nice she said in little tremulous gasps to be a hermit and have ladies climb mountains to talk to you the hermit folded his arms and leaned against a tree beatrix with a sigh settled down upon the mat of pine needles like a bluebird upon her nest the hermit followed suit drawing his feet rather awkwardly under his gunny sacking it must be nice to be a mountain said he with ponderous lightness and have angels in blue climb up you instead of flying over you mamma had neuralgia said beatrix and went to bed or i couldn t have come it s dreadfully hot at that horrid old inn but we hadn t the money to go anywhere else this summer last night said the hermit i climbed to the top of that big rock above us i could see the lights of the inn and hear a strain or two of the music when the wind was right i imagined you moving gracefully in the arms of others to the dreamy music of the waltz amid the fragrance of flowers think how lonely i must have been the youngest handsomest and poorest of the famous trenholme sisters sighed you haven t quite hit it she said plaintively i was moving gracefully at the arms of another mamma had one of her periodical attacks of rheumatism in both elbows and shoulders and i had to rub them for an hour with that horrid old liniment i hope you didn t think that smelled like flowers you know there were some west point boys and a yachtload of young men from the city at last evening s weekly dance i ve known mamma to sit by an open window for three hours with one half of her registering degrees and the other half frostbitten and never sneeze once but just let a bunch of ineligibles come around where i am and she ll begin to swell at the knuckles and shriek with pain and i have to take her to her room and rub her arms to see mamma dressed you d be surprised to know the number of square inches of surface there are to her arms i think it must be delightful to be a hermit that cassock gabardine isn t it that you wear is so becoming do you make it or them of course you must have changes yourself and what a blessed relief it must be to wear sandals instead of shoes think how we must suffer no matter how small i buy my shoes they always pinch my toes oh why can t there be lady hermits too the beautifulest and most adolescent trenholme sister extended two slender blue ankles that ended in two enormous blue silk bows that almost concealed two fairy oxfords also of one of the forty seven shades of blue the hermit as if impelled by a kind of reflex telepathic action drew his bare toes farther beneath his gunny sacking i have heard about the romance of your life said miss trenholme softly they have it printed on the back of the menu card at the inn was she very beautiful and charming on the bills of fare muttered the hermit but what do i care for the world s babble yes she was of the highest and grandest type then he continued then i thought the world could never contain another equal to her so i forsook it and repaired to this mountain fastness to spend the remainder of my life alone to devote and dedicate my remaining years to her memory it s grand said miss trenholme absolutely grand i think a hermit s life is the ideal one no bill collectors calling no dressing for dinner how i d like to be one but there s no such luck for me if i don t marry this season i honestly believe mamma will force me into settlement work or trimming hats it isn t because i m getting old or ugly but we haven t enough money left to butt in at any of the swell places any more and i don t want to marry unless it s somebody i like that s why i d like to be a hermit hermits don t ever marry do they hundreds of em said the hermit when they ve found the right one but they re hermits said the youngest and beautifulest because they ve lost the right one aren t they because they think they have answered the recluse fatuously wisdom comes to one in a mountain cave as well as to one in the world of swells as i believe they are called in the argot when one of the swells brings it to them said miss trenholme and my folks are swells that s the trouble but there are so many swells at the seashore in the summer time that we hardly amount to more than ripples so we ve had to put all our money into river and harbor appropriations we were all girls you know there were four of us i m the only surviving one the others have been married off all to money mamma is so proud of my sisters they send her the loveliest pen wipers and art calendars every christmas i m the only one on the market now i m forbidden to look at any one who hasn t money but began the hermit but oh said the beautifulest of course hermits have great pots of gold and doubloons buried somewhere near three great oak trees they all have i have not said the hermit regretfully i m so sorry said miss trenholme i always thought they had i think i must go now oh beyond question she was the beautifulest fair lady began the hermit i am beatrix trenholme some call me trix she said you must come to the inn to see me i haven t been a stone s throw from my cave in ten years said the hermit you must come to see me there she repeated any evening except thursday the hermit smiled weakly good bye she said gathering the folds of her pale blue skirt i shall expect you but not on thursday evening remember what an interest it would give to the future menu cards of the viewpoint inn to have these printed lines added to them only once during the more than ten years of his lonely existence did the mountain hermit leave his famous cave that was when he was irresistibly drawn to the inn by the fascinations of miss beatrix trenholme youngest and most beautiful of the celebrated trenholme sisters whose brilliant marriage to aye to whom the hermit walked back to the hermitage at the door stood bob binkley his old friend and companion of the days before he had renounced the world bob himself arrayed like the orchids of the greenhouse in the summer man s polychromatic garb bob the millionaire with his fat firm smooth shrewd face his diamond rings sparkling fob chain and pleated bosom he was two years older than the hermit and looked five years younger you re hamp ellison in spite of those whiskers and that going away bathrobe he shouted i read about you on the bill of fare at the inn they ve run your biography in between the cheese and not responsible for coats and umbrellas what d you do it for hamp and ten years too geewhilikins you re just the same said the hermit come in and sit down sit on that limestone rock over there it s softer than the granite i can t understand it old man said binkley i can see how you could give up a woman for ten years but not ten years for a woman of course i know why you did it everybody does edith carr she jilted four or five besides you but you were the only one who took to a hole in the ground the others had recourse to whiskey the klondike politics and that similia similibus cure but say hamp edith carr was just about the finest woman in the world high toned and proud and noble and playing her ideals to win at all kinds of odds she certainly was a crackerjack after i renounced the world said the hermit i never heard of her again she married me said binkley the hermit leaned against the wooden walls of his ante cave and wriggled his toes i know how you feel about it said binkley what else could she do there were her four sisters and her mother and old man carr you remember how he put all the money he had into dirigible balloons well everything was coming down and nothing going up with em as you might say well i know edith as well as you do although i married her i was worth a million then but i ve run it up since to between five and six it wasn t me she wanted as much as well it was about like this she had that bunch on her hands and they had to be taken care of edith married me two months after you did the ground squirrel act i thought she liked me too at the time and now inquired the recluse we re better friends than ever now she got a divorce from me two years ago just incompatibility i didn t put in any defence well well well hamp this is certainly a funny dugout you ve built here but you always were a hero of fiction seems like you d have been the very one to strike edith s fancy maybe you did but it s the bank roll that catches em my boy your caves and whiskers won t do it honestly hamp don t you think you ve been a darned fool the hermit smiled behind his tangled beard he was and always had been so superior to the crude and mercenary binkley that even his vulgarities could not anger him moreover his studies and meditations in his retreat had raised him far above the little vanities of the world his little mountain side had been almost an olympus over the edge of which he saw smiling the bolts hurled in the valleys of man below had his ten years of renunciation of thought of devotion to an ideal of living scorn of a sordid world been in vain up from the world had come to him the youngest and beautifulest fairer than edith one and three seventh times lovelier than the seven years served rachel so the hermit smiled in his beard when binkley had relieved the hermitage from the blot of his presence and the first faint star showed above the pines the hermit got the can of baking powder from his cupboard he still smiled behind his beard there was a slight rustle in the doorway there stood edith carr with all the added beauty and stateliness and noble bearing that ten years had brought her she was never one to chatter she looked at the hermit with her large thinking dark eyes the hermit stood still surprised into a pose as motionless as her own only his subconscious sense of the fitness of things caused him to turn the baking powder can slowly in his hands until its red label was hidden against his bosom i am stopping at the inn said edith in low but clear tones i heard of you there i told myself that i must see you i want to ask your forgiveness i sold my happiness for money there were others to be provided for but that does not excuse me i just wanted to see you and ask your forgiveness you have lived here ten years they tell me cherishing my memory i was blind hampton i could not see then that all the money in the world cannot weigh in the scales against a faithful heart if but it is too late now of course her assertion was a question clothed as best it could be in a loving woman s pride but through the thin disguise the hermit saw easily that his lady had come back to him if he chose he had won a golden crown if it pleased him to take it the reward of his decade of faithfulness was ready for his hand if he desired to stretch it forth for the space of one minute the old enchantment shone upon him with a reflected radiance and then by turns he felt the manly sensations of indignation at having been discarded and of repugnance at having been as it were sought again and last of all how strange that it should have come at last the pale blue vision of the beautifulest of the trenholme sisters illuminated his mind s eye and left him without a waver it is too late he said in deep tones pressing the baking powder can against his heart once she turned after she had gone slowly twenty yards down the path the hermit had begun to twist the lid off his can but he hid it again under his sacking robe he could see her great eyes shining sadly through the twilight but he stood inflexible in the doorway of his shack and made no sign just as the moon rose on thursday evening the hermit was seized by the world madness up from the inn fainter than the horns of elf land came now and then a few bars of music played by the casino band the hudson was broadened by the night into an illimitable sea those lights dimly seen on its opposite shore were not beacons for prosaic trolley lines but low set stars millions of miles away the waters in front of the inn were gay with fireflies or were they motor boats smelling of gasoline and oil once the hermit had known these things and had sported with amaryllis in the shade of the red and white striped awnings but for ten years he had turned a heedless ear to these far off echoes of a frivolous world but to night there was something wrong the casino band was playing a waltz a waltz what a fool he had been to tear deliberately ten years of his life from the calendar of existence for one who had given him up for the false joys that wealth tum ti tum ti tum ti how did that waltz go but those years had not been sacrificed had they not brought him the star and pearl of all the world the youngest and beautifulest of but do not come on thursday evening she had insisted perhaps by now she would be moving slowly and gracefully to the strains of that waltz held closely by west pointers or city commuters while he who had read in her eyes things that had recompensed him for ten lost years of life moped like some wild animal in its mountain den why should damn it said the hermit suddenly i ll do it he threw down his marcus aurelius and threw off his gunny sack toga he dragged a dust covered trunk from a corner of the cave and with difficulty wrenched open its lid candles he had in plenty and the cave was soon aglow clothes ten years old in cut scissors razors hats shoes all his discarded attire and belongings were dragged ruthlessly from their renunciatory rest and strewn about in painful disorder a pair of scissors soon reduced his beard sufficiently for the dulled razors to perform approximately their office cutting his own hair was beyond the hermit s skill so he only combed and brushed it backward as smoothly as he could charity forbids us to consider the heartburnings and exertions of one so long removed from haberdashery and society at the last the hermit went to an inner corner of his cave and began to dig in the soft earth with a long iron spoon out of the cavity he thus made he drew a tin can and out of the can three thousand dollars in bills tightly rolled and wrapped in oiled silk he was a real hermit as this may assure you you may take a brief look at him as he hastens down the little mountain side a long wrinkled black frock coat reached to his calves white duck trousers unacquainted with the tailor s goose a pink shirt white standing collar with brilliant blue butterfly tie and buttoned congress gaiters but think sir and madam ten years from beneath a narrow brimmed straw hat with a striped band flowed his hair seeing him with all your shrewdness you could not have guessed him you would have said that he played hamlet or the tuba or pinochle you would never have laid your hand on your heart and said he is a hermit who lived ten years in a cave for love of one lady to win another the dancing pavilion extended above the waters of the river gay lanterns and frosted electric globes shed a soft glamour within it a hundred ladies and gentlemen from the inn and summer cottages flitted in and about it to the left of the dusty roadway down which the hermit had tramped were the inn and grill room something seemed to be on there too the windows were brilliantly lighted and music was playing music different from the two steps and waltzes of the casino band a negro man wearing a white jacket came through the iron gate with its immense granite posts and wrought iron lamp holders what is going on here to night asked the hermit well sah said the servitor dey is having de reg lar thursday evenin dance in de casino and in de grill room dere s a beefsteak dinner sah the hermit glanced up at the inn on the hillside whence burst suddenly a triumphant strain of splendid harmony and up there said he they are playing mendelssohn what is going on up there up in de inn said the dusky one dey is a weddin goin on mr binkley a mighty rich man am marryin miss trenholme sah de young lady who am quite de belle of de place sah he also serves if i could have a thousand years just one little thousand years more of life i might in that time draw near enough to true romance to touch the hem of her robe up from ships men come and from waste places and forest and road and garret and cellar to maunder to me in strangely distributed words of the things they have seen and considered the recording of their tales is no more than a matter of ears and fingers there are only two fates i dread deafness and writer s cramp the hand is yet steady let the ear bear the blame if these printed words be not in the order they were delivered to me by hunky magee true camp follower of fortune biography shall claim you but an instant i first knew hunky when he was head waiter at chubb s little beefsteak restaurant and cafe on third avenue there was only one waiter besides then successively i caromed against him in the little streets of the big city after his trip to alaska his voyage as cook with a treasure seeking expedition to the caribbean and his failure as a pearl fisher in the arkansas river between these dashes into the land of adventure he usually came back to chubb s for a while chubb s was a port for him when gales blew too high but when you dined there and hunky went for your steak you never knew whether he would come to anchor in the kitchen or in the malayan archipelago you wouldn t care for his description he was soft of voice and hard of face and rarely had to use more than one eye to quell any approach to a disturbance among chubb s customers one night i found hunky standing at a corner of twenty third street and third avenue after an absence of several months in ten minutes we had a little round table between us in a quiet corner and my ears began to get busy i leave out my sly ruses and feints to draw hunky s word of mouth blows it all came to something like this speaking of the next election said hunky did you ever know much about indians no i don t mean the cooper beadle cigar store or laughing water kind i mean the modern indian the kind that takes greek prizes in colleges and scalps the half back on the other side in football games the kind that eats macaroons and tea in the afternoons with the daughter of the professor of biology and fills up on grasshoppers and fried rattlesnake when they get back to the ancestral wickiup well they ain t so bad i like em better than most foreigners that have come over in the last few hundred years one thing about the indian is this when he mixes with the white race he swaps all his own vices for them of the pale faces and he retains all his own virtues well his virtues are enough to call out the reserves whenever he lets em loose but the imported foreigners adopt our virtues and keep their own vices and it s going to take our whole standing army some day to police that gang but let me tell you about the trip i took to mexico with high jack snakefeeder a cherokee twice removed a graduate of a pennsylvania college and the latest thing in pointed toed rubber heeled patent kid moccasins and madras hunting shirt with turned back cuffs he was a friend of mine i met him in tahlequah when i was out there during the land boom and we got thick he had got all there was out of colleges and had come back to lead his people out of egypt he was a man of first class style and wrote essays and had been invited to visit rich guys houses in boston and such places there was a cherokee girl in muscogee that high jack was foolish about he took me to see her a few times her name was florence blue feather but you want to clear your mind of all ideas of squaws with nose rings and army blankets this young lady was whiter than you are and better educated than i ever was you couldn t have told her from any of the girls shopping in the swell third avenue stores i liked her so well that i got to calling on her now and then when high jack wasn t along which is the way of friends in such matters she was educated at the muscogee college and was making a specialty of let s see eth yes ethnology that s the art that goes back and traces the descent of different races of people leading up from jelly fish through monkeys and to the o briens high jack had took up that line too and had read papers about it before all kinds of riotous assemblies chautauquas and choctaws and chowder parties and such having a mutual taste for musty information like that was what made em like each other i suppose but i don t know what they call congeniality of tastes ain t always it now when miss blue feather and me was talking together i listened to her affidavits about the first families of the land of nod being cousins german well if the germans don t nod who does to the mound builders of ohio with incomprehension and respect and when i d tell her about the bowery and coney island and sing her a few songs that i d heard the jamaica niggers sing at their church lawn parties she didn t look much less interested than she did when high jack would tell her that he had a pipe that the first inhabitants of america originally arrived here on stilts after a freshet at tenafly new jersey but i was going to tell you more about high jack about six months ago i get a letter from him saying he d been commissioned by the minority report bureau of ethnology at washington to go down to mexico and translate some excavations or dig up the meaning of some shorthand notes on some ruins or something of that sort and if i d go along he could squeeze the price into the expense account well i d been holding a napkin over my arm at chubb s about long enough then so i wired high jack yes and he sent me a ticket and i met him in washington and he had a lot of news to tell me first of all was that florence blue feather had suddenly disappeared from her home and environments run away i asked vanished says high jack disappeared like your shadow when the sun goes under a cloud she was seen on the street and then she turned a corner and nobody ever seen her afterward the whole community turned out to look for her but we never found a clew that s bad that s bad says i she was a mighty nice girl and as smart as you find em high jack seemed to take it hard i guess he must have esteemed miss blue feather quite highly i could see that he d referred the matter to the whiskey jug that was his weak point and many another man s i ve noticed that when a man loses a girl he generally takes to drink either just before or just after it happens from washington we railroaded it to new orleans and there took a tramp steamer bound for belize and a gale pounded us all down the caribbean and nearly wrecked us on the yucatan coast opposite a little town without a harbor called boca de coacoyula suppose the ship had run against that name in the dark better fifty years of europe than a cyclone in the bay says high jack snakefeeder so we get the captain to send us ashore in a dory when the squall seemed to cease from squalling we will find ruins here or make em says high the government doesn t care which we do an appropriation is an appropriation boca de coacoyula was a dead town them biblical towns we read about tired and siphon after they was destroyed they must have looked like forty second street and broadway compared to this boca place it still claimed inhabitants as estimated and engraved on the stone court house by the census taker in the citizens were a mixture of indians and other indians but some of em was light colored which i was surprised to see the town was huddled up on the shore with woods so thick around it that a subpoena server couldn t have reached a monkey ten yards away with the papers we wondered what kept it from being annexed to kansas but we soon found out that it was major bing major bing was the ointment around the fly he had the cochineal sarsaparilla log wood annatto hemp and all other dye woods and pure food adulteration concessions cornered he had five sixths of the boca de thingama jiggers working for him on shares it was a beautiful graft we used to brag about morgan and e h and others of our wisest when i was in the provinces but now no more that peninsula has got our little country turned into a submarine without even the observation tower showing major bing s idea was this he had the population go forth into the forest and gather these products when they brought em in he gave em one fifth for their trouble sometimes they d strike and demand a sixth the major always gave in to em the major had a bungalow so close on the sea that the nine inch tide seeped through the cracks in the kitchen floor me and him and high jack snakefeeder sat on the porch and drank rum from noon till midnight he said he had piled up in new orleans banks and high and me could stay with him forever if we would but high jack happened to think of the united states and began to talk ethnology ruins says major bing the woods are full of em i don t know how far they date back but they was here before i came high jack asks what form of worship the citizens of that locality are addicted to why says the major rubbing his nose i can t hardly say i imagine it s infidel or aztec or nonconformist or something like that there s a church here a methodist or some other kind with a parson named skidder he claims to have converted the people to christianity he and me don t assimilate except on state occasions i imagine they worship some kind of gods or idols yet but skidder says he has em in the fold a few days later high jack and me prowling around strikes a plain path into the forest and follows it a good four miles then a branch turns to the left we go a mile maybe down that and run up against the finest ruin you ever saw solid stone with trees and vines and under brush all growing up against it and in it and through it all over it was chiselled carvings of funny beasts and people that would have been arrested if they d ever come out in vaudeville that way we approached it from the rear high jack had been drinking too much rum ever since we landed in boca you know how an indian is the palefaces fixed his clock when they introduced him to firewater he d brought a quart along with him hunky says he we ll explore the ancient temple it may be that the storin that landed us here was propitious the minority report bureau of ethnology says he may yet profit by the vagaries of wind and tide we went in the rear door of the bum edifice we struck a kind of alcove without bath there was a granite davenport and a stone wash stand without any soap or exit for the water and some hardwood pegs drove into holes in the wall and that was all to go out of that furnished apartment into a harlem hall bedroom would make you feel like getting back home from an amateur violoncello solo at an east side settlement house while high was examining some hieroglyphics on the wall that the stone masons must have made when their tools slipped i stepped into the front room that was at least thirty by fifty feet stone floor six little windows like square port holes that didn t let much light in i looked back over my shoulder and sees high jack s face three feet away high says i of all the and then i noticed he looked funny and i turned around he d taken off his clothes to the waist and he didn t seem to hear me i touched him and came near beating it high jack had turned to stone i had been drinking some rum myself ossified i says to him loudly i knew what would happen if you kept it up and then high jack comes in from the alcove when he hears me conversing with nobody and we have a look at mr snakefeeder no it s a stone idol or god or revised statute or something and it looks as much like high jack as one green pea looks like itself it s got exactly his face and size and color but it s steadier on its pins it stands on a kind of rostrum or pedestal and you can see it s been there ten million years he s a cousin of mine sings high and then he turns solemn hunky he says putting one hand on my shoulder and one on the statue s i m in the holy temple of my ancestors well if looks goes for anything says i you ve struck a twin stand side by side with buddy and let s see if there s any diff erence there wasn t you know an indian can keep his face as still as an iron dog s when he wants to so when high jack froze his features you couldn t have told him from the other one there s some letters says i on his nob s pedestal but i can t make em out the alphabet of this country seems to be composed of sometimes a e i o and u but generally z s l s and t s high jack s ethnology gets the upper hand of his rum for a minute and he investigates the inscription hunky says he this is a statue of tlotopaxl one of the most powerful gods of the ancient aztecs glad to know him says i but in his present condition he reminds me of the joke shakespeare got off on julius caesar we might say about your friend imperious what s his name dead and tunied to stone no use to write or call him on the phone hunky says high jack snakefeeder looking at me funny do you believe in reincarnation it sounds to me says i like either a clean up of the slaughter houses or a new kind of boston pink i don t know i believe says he that i am the reincarnation of tlotopaxl my researches have convinced me that the cherokees of all the north american tribes can boast of the straightest descent from the proud aztec race that says he was a favorite theory of mine and florence blue feather s and she what if she high jack grabs my arm and walls his eyes at me just then he looked more like his eminent co indian murderer crazy horse well says i what if she what if she what if she you re drunk says i impersonating idols and believing in what was it recarnalization let s have a drink says i it s as spooky here as a brooklyn artificial limb factory at midnight with the gas turned down just then i heard somebody coming and i dragged high jack into the bedless bedchamber there was peep holes bored through the wall so we could see the whole front part of the temple major bing told me afterward that the ancient priests in charge used to rubber through them at the congregation in a few minutes an old indian woman came in with a big oval earthen dish full of grub she set it on a square block of stone in front of the graven image and laid down and walloped her face on the floor a few times and then took a walk for herself high jack and me was hungry so we came out and looked it over there was goat steaks and fried rice cakes and plantains and cassava and broiled land crabs and mangoes nothing like what you get at chubb s we ate hearty and had another round of rum it must be old tecumseh s or whatever you call him birthday says i or do they feed him every day i thought gods only drank vanilla on mount catawampus then some more native parties in short kimonos that showed their aboriginees punctured the near horizon and me and high had to skip back into father axletree s private boudoir they came by ones twos and threes and left all sorts of offerings there was enough grub for bingham s nine gods of war with plenty left over for the peace conference at the hague they brought jars of honey and bunches of bananas and bottles of wine and stacks of tortillas and beautiful shawls worth one hundred dollars apiece that the indian women weave of a kind of vegetable fibre like silk all of em got down and wriggled on the floor in front of that hard finish god and then sneaked off through the woods again i wonder who gets this rake off remarks high jack oh says i there s priests or deputy idols or a committee of disarrangements somewhere in the woods on the job wherever you find a god you ll find somebody waiting to take charge of the burnt offerings and then we took another swig of rum and walked out to the parlor front door to cool off for it was as hot inside as a summer camp on the palisades and while we stood there in the breeze we looks down the path and sees a young lady approaching the blasted ruin she was bare footed and had on a white robe and carried a wreath of white flowers in her hand when she got nearer we saw she had a long blue feather stuck through her black hair and when she got nearer still me and high jack snakefeeder grabbed each other to keep from tumbling down on the floor for the girl s face was as much like florence blue feather s as his was like old king toxicology s and then was when high jack s booze drowned his system of ethnology he dragged me inside back of the statue and says lay hold of it hunky we ll pack it into the other room i felt it all the time says he i m the reconsideration of the god locomotorataxia and florence blue feather was my bride a thousand years ago she has come to seek me in the temple where i used to reign all right says i there s no use arguing against the rum question you take his feet we lifted the three hundred pound stone god and carried him into the back room of the cafe the temple i mean and leaned him against the wall it was more work than bouncing three live ones from an all night broadway joint on new year s eve then high jack ran out and brought in a couple of them indian silk shawls and began to undress himself oh figs says i is it thus strong drink is an adder and subtractor too is it the heat or the call of the wild that s got you but high jack is too full of exaltation and cane juice to reply he stops the disrobing business just short of the manhattan beach rules and then winds them red and white shawls around him and goes out and stands on the pedestal as steady as any platinum deity you ever saw and i looks through a peek hole to see what he is up to in a few minutes in comes the girl with the flower wreath danged if i wasn t knocked a little silly when she got close she looked so exactly much like florence blue feather i wonder says i to myself if she has been reincarcerated too if i could see says i to myself whether she has a mole on her left but the next minute i thought she looked one eighth of a shade darker than florence but she looked good at that and high jack hadn t drunk all the rum that had been drank the girl went up within ten feet of the bum idol and got down and massaged her nose with the floor like the rest did then she went nearer and laid the flower wreath on the block of stone at high jack s feet rummy as i was i thought it was kind of nice of her to think of offering flowers instead of household and kitchen provisions even a stone god ought to appreciate a little sentiment like that on top of the fancy groceries they had piled up in front of him and then high jack steps down from his pedestal quiet and mentions a few words that sounded just like the hieroglyphics carved on the walls of the ruin the girl gives a little jump backward and her eyes fly open as big as doughnuts but she don t beat it why didn t she i ll tell you why i think why it don t seem to a girl so supernatural unlikely strange and startling that a stone god should come to life for her if he was to do it for one of them snub nosed brown girls on the other side of the woods now it would be different but her i ll bet she said to herself well goodness me you ve been a long time getting on your job i ve half a mind not to speak to you but she and high jack holds hands and walks away out of the temple together by the time i d had time to take another drink and enter upon the scene they was twenty yards away going up the path in the woods that the girl had come down with the natural scenery already in place it was just like a play to watch em she looking up at him and him giving her back the best that an indian can hand out in the way of a goo goo eye but there wasn t anything in that recarnification and revulsion to tintype for me hey injun i yells out to high jack we ve got a board bill due in town and you re leaving me without a cent brace up and cut out the neapolitan fisher maiden and let s go back home but on the two goes without looking once back until as you might say the forest swallowed em up and i never saw or heard of high jack snakefeeder from that day to this i don t know if the cherokees came from the aspics but if they did one of em went back all i could do was to hustle back to that boca place and panhandle major bing he detached himself from enough of his winnings to buy me a ticket home and i m back again on the job at chubb s sir and i m going to hold it steady come round and you ll find the steaks as good as ever i wondered what hunky magee thought about his own story so i asked him if he had any theories about reincarnation and transmogrification and such mysteries as he had touched upon nothing like that said hunky positively what ailed high jack was too much booze and education they ll do an indian up every time but what about miss blue feather i persisted say said hunky with a grin that little lady that stole high jack certainly did give me a jar when i first took a look at her but it was only for a minute you remember i told you high jack said that miss florence blue feather disappeared from home about a year ago well where she landed four days later was in as neat a five room flat on east twenty third street as you ever walked sideways through and she s been mrs magee ever since the moment of victory ben granger is a war veteran aged twenty nine which should enable you to guess the war he is also principal merchant and postmaster of cadiz a little town over which the breezes from the gulf of mexico perpetually blow ben helped to hurl the don from his stronghold in the greater antilles and then hiking across half the world he marched as a corporal usher up and down the blazing tropic aisles of the open air college in which the filipino was schooled now with his bayonet beaten into a cheese slicer he rallies his corporal s guard of cronies in the shade of his well whittled porch instead of in the matted jungles of mindanao always have his interest and choice been for deeds rather than for words but the consideration and digestion of motives is not beyond him as this story which is his will attest what is it he asked me one moonlit eve as we sat among his boxes and barrels that generally makes men go through dangers and fire and trouble and starvation and battle and such rucouses what does a man do it for why does he try to outdo his fellow humans and be braver and stronger and more daring and showy than even his best friends are what s his game what does he expect to get out of it he don t do it just for the fresh air and exercise what would you say now bill that an ordinary man expects generally speaking for his efforts along the line of ambition and extraordinary hustling in the marketplaces forums shooting galleries lyceums battle fields links cinder paths and arenas of the civilized and vice versa places of the world well ben said i with judicial seriousness i think we might safely limit the number of motives of a man who seeks fame to three to ambition which is a desire for popular applause to avarice which looks to the material side of success and to love of some woman whom he either possesses or desires to possess ben pondered over my words while a mocking bird on the top of a mesquite by the porch trilled a dozen bars i reckon said he that your diagnosis about covers the case according to the rules laid down in the copy books and historical readers but what i had in my mind was the case of willie robbins a person i used to know i ll tell you about him before i close up the store if you don t mind listening willie was one of our social set up in san augustine i was clerking there then for brady murchison wholesale dry goods and ranch supplies willie and i belonged to the same german club and athletic association and military company he played the triangle in our serenading and quartet crowd that used to ring the welkin three nights a week somewhere in town willie jibed with his name considerable he weighed about as much as a hundred pounds of veal in his summer suitings and he had a where is mary expression on his features so plain that you could almost see the wool growing on him and yet you couldn t fence him away from the girls with barbed wire you know that kind of young fellows a kind of a mixture of fools and angels they rush in and fear to tread at the same time but they never fail to tread when they get the chance he was always on hand when a joyful occasion was had as the morning paper would say looking as happy as a king full and at the same time as uncomfortable as a raw oyster served with sweet pickles he danced like he had hind hobbles on and he had a vocabulary of about three hundred and fifty words that he made stretch over four germans a week and plagiarized from to get him through two ice cream suppers and a sunday night call he seemed to me to be a sort of a mixture of maltese kitten sensitive plant and a member of a stranded two orphans company i ll give you an estimate of his physiological and pictorial make up and then i ll stick spurs into the sides of my narrative willie inclined to the caucasian in his coloring and manner of style his hair was opalescent and his conversation fragmentary his eyes were the same blue shade as the china dog s on the right hand corner of your aunt ellen s mantelpiece he took things as they come and i never felt any hostility against him i let him live and so did others but what does this willie do but coax his heart out of his boots and lose it to myra allison the liveliest brightest keenest smartest and prettiest girl in san augustine i tell you she had the blackest eyes the shiniest curls and the most tantalizing oh no you re off i wasn t a victim i might have been but i knew better i kept out joe granberry was it from the start he had everybody else beat a couple of leagues and thence east to a stake and mound but anyhow myra was a nine pound full merino fall clip fleece sacked and loaded on a four horse team for san antone one night there was an ice cream sociable at mrs colonel spraggins in san augustine we fellows had a big room up stairs opened up for us to put our hats and things in and to comb our hair and put on the clean collars we brought along inside the sweat bands of our hats in short a room to fix up in just like they have everywhere at high toned doings a little farther down the hall was the girls room which they used to powder up in and so forth downstairs we that is the san augustine social cotillion and merrymakers club had a stretcher put down in the parlor where our dance was going on willie robbins and me happened to be up in our cloak room i believe we called it when myra allison skipped through the hall on her way down stairs from the girls room willie was standing before the mirror deeply interested in smoothing down the blond grass plot on his head which seemed to give him lots of trouble myra was always full of life and devilment she stopped and stuck her head in our door she certainly was good looking but i knew how joe granberry stood with her so did willie but he kept on ba a a ing after her and following her around he had a system of persistence that didn t coincide with pale hair and light eyes hello willie says myra what are you doing to yourself in the glass i m trying to look fly says willie well you never could be fly says myra with her special laugh which was the provokingest sound i ever heard except the rattle of an empty canteen against my saddle horn i looked around at willie after myra had gone he had a kind of a lily white look on him which seemed to show that her remark had as you might say disrupted his soul i never noticed anything in what she said that sounded particularly destructive to a man s ideas of self consciousness but he was set back to an extent you could scarcely imagine after we went down stairs with our clean collars on willie never went near myra again that night after all he seemed to be a diluted kind of a skim milk sort of a chap and i never wondered that joe granberry beat him out the next day the battleship maine was blown up and then pretty soon somebody i reckon it was joe bailey or ben tillman or maybe the government declared war against spain well everybody south of mason hamlin s line knew that the north by itself couldn t whip a whole country the size of spain so the yankees commenced to holler for help and the johnny rebs answered the call we re coming father william a hundred thousand strong and then some was the way they sang it and the old party lines drawn by sherman s march and the kuklux and nine cent cotton and the jim crow street car ordinances faded away we became one undivided country with no north very little east a good sized chunk of west and a south that loomed up as big as the first foreign label on a new eight dollar suit case of course the dogs of war weren t a complete pack without a yelp from the san augustine rifles company d of the fourteenth texas regiment our company was among the first to land in cuba and strike terror into the hearts of the foe i m not going to give you a history of the war i m just dragging it in to fill out my story about willie robbins just as the republican party dragged it in to help out the election in if anybody ever had heroitis it was that willie robbins from the minute he set foot on the soil of the tyrants of castile he seemed to engulf danger as a cat laps up cream he certainly astonished every man in our company from the captain up you d have expected him to gravitate naturally to the job of an orderly to the colonel or typewriter in the commissary but not any he created the part of the flaxen haired boy hero who lives and gets back home with the goods instead of dying with an important despatch in his hands at his colonel s feet our company got into a section of cuban scenery where one of the messiest and most unsung portions of the campaign occurred we were out every day capering around in the bushes and having little skirmishes with the spanish troops that looked more like kind of tired out feuds than anything else the war was a joke to us and of no interest to them we never could see it any other way than as a howling farce comedy that the san augustine rifles were actually fighting to uphold the stars and stripes and the blamed little senors didn t get enough pay to make them care whether they were patriots or traitors now and then somebody would get killed it seemed like a waste of life to me i was at coney island when i went to new york once and one of them down hill skidding apparatuses they call roller coasters flew the track and killed a man in a brown sack suit whenever the spaniards shot one of our men it struck me as just about as unnecessary and regrettable as that was but i m dropping willie robbins out of the conversation he was out for bloodshed laurels ambition medals recommendations and all other forms of military glory and he didn t seem to be afraid of any of the recognized forms of military danger such as spaniards cannon balls canned beef gunpowder or nepotism he went forth with his pallid hair and china blue eyes and ate up spaniards like you would sardines a la canopy wars and rumbles of wars never flustered him he would stand guard duty mosquitoes hardtack treat and fire with equally perfect unanimity no blondes in history ever come in comparison distance of him except the jack of diamonds and queen catherine of russia i remember one time a little caballard of spanish men sauntered out from behind a patch of sugar cane and shot bob turner the first sergeant of our company while we were eating dinner as required by the army regulations we fellows went through the usual tactics of falling into line saluting the enemy and loading and firing kneeling that wasn t the texas way of scrapping but being a very important addendum and annex to the regular army the san augustine rifles had to conform to the red tape system of getting even by the time we had got out our upton s tactics turned to page fifty seven said one two three one two three a couple of times and got blank cartridges into our springfields the spanish outfit had smiled repeatedly rolled and lit cigarettes by squads and walked away contemptuously i went straight to captain floyd and says to him sam i don t think this war is a straight game you know as well as i do that bob turner was one of the whitest fellows that ever threw a leg over a saddle and now these wirepullers in washington have fixed his clock he s politically and ostensibly dead it ain t fair why should they keep this thing up if they want spain licked why don t they turn the san augustine rifles and joe seely s ranger company and a car load of west texas deputy sheriffs onto these spaniards and let us exonerate them from the face of the earth i never did says i care much about fighting by the lord chesterfield ring rules i m going to hand in my resignation and go home if anybody else i am personally acquainted with gets hurt in this war if you can get somebody in my place sam says i i ll quit the first of next week i don t want to work in an army that don t give its help a chance never mind my wages says i let the secretary of the treasury keep em well ben says the captain to me your allegations and estimations of the tactics of war government patriotism guard mounting and democracy are all right but i ve looked into the system of international arbitration and the ethics of justifiable slaughter a little closer maybe than you have now you can hand in your resignation the first of next week if you are so minded but if you do says sam i ll order a corporal s guard to take you over by that limestone bluff on the creek and shoot enough lead into you to ballast a submarine air ship i m captain of this company and i ve swore allegiance to the amalgamated states regardless of sectional secessional and congressional differences have you got any smoking tobacco winds up sam mine got wet when i swum the creek this morning the reason i drag all this non ex parte evidence in is because willie robbins was standing there listening to us i was a second sergeant and he was a private then but among us texans and westerners there never was as much tactics and subordination as there was in the regular army we never called our captain anything but sam except when there was a lot of major generals and admirals around so as to preserve the discipline and says willie robbins to me in a sharp construction of voice much unbecoming to his light hair and previous record you ought to be shot ben for emitting any such sentiments a man that won t fight for his country is worse than a horse thief if i was the cap i d put you in the guard house for thirty days on round steak and tamales war says willie is great and glorious i didn t know you were a coward i m not says i if i was i d knock some of the pallidness off of your marble brow i m lenient with you i says just as i am with the spaniards because you have always reminded me of something with mushrooms on the side why you little lady of shalott says i you underdone leader of cotillions you glassy fashion and moulded form you white pine soldier made in the cisalpine alps in germany for the late new year trade do you know of whom you are talking to we ve been in the same social circle says i and i ve put up with you because you seemed so meek and self un satisfying i don t understand why you have so sudden taken a personal interest in chivalrousness and murder your nature s undergone a complete revelation now how is it well you wouldn t understand ben says willie giving one of his refined smiles and turning away come back here says i catching him by the tail of his khaki coat you ve made me kind of mad in spite of the aloofness in which i have heretofore held you you are out for making a success in this hero business and i believe i know what for you are doing it either because you are crazy or because you expect to catch some girl by it now if it s a girl i ve got something here to show you i wouldn t have done it but i was plumb mad i pulled a san augustine paper out of my hip pocket and showed him an item it was a half a column about the marriage of myra allison and joe granberry willie laughed and i saw i hadn t touched him oh says he everybody knew that was going to happen i heard about that a week ago and then he gave me the laugh again all right says i then why do you so recklessly chase the bright rainbow of fame do you expect to be elected president or do you belong to a suicide club and then captain sam interferes you gentlemen quit jawing and go back to your quarters says he or i ll have you escorted to the guard house now scat both of you before you go which one of you has got any chewing tobacco we re off sam says i it s supper time anyhow but what do you think of what we was talking about i ve noticed you throwing out a good many grappling hooks for this here balloon called fame what s ambition anyhow what does a man risk his life day after day for do you know of anything he gets in the end that can pay him for the trouble i want to go back home says i i don t care whether cuba sinks or swims and i don t give a pipeful of rabbit tobacco whether queen sophia christina or charlie culberson rules these fairy isles and i don t want my name on any list except the list of survivors but i ve noticed you sam says i seeking the bubble notoriety in the cannon s larynx a number of times now what do you do it for is it ambition business or some freckle faced pheebe at home that you are heroing for well ben says sam kind of hefting his sword out from between his knees as your superior officer i could court martial you for attempted cowardice and desertion but i won t and i ll tell you why i m trying for promotion and the usual honors of war and conquest a major gets more pay than a captain and i need the money correct for you says i i can understand that your system of fame seeking is rooted in the deepest soil of patriotism but i can t comprehend says i why willie robbins whose folks at home are well off and who used to be as meek and undesirous of notice as a cat with cream on his whiskers should all at once develop into a warrior bold with the most fire eating kind of proclivities and the girl in his case seems to have been eliminated by marriage to another fellow i reckon says i it s a plain case of just common ambition he wants his name maybe to go thundering down the coroners of time it must be that well without itemizing his deeds willie sure made good as a hero he simply spent most of his time on his knees begging our captain to send him on forlorn hopes and dangerous scouting expeditions in every fight he was the first man to mix it at close quarters with the don alfonsos he got three or four bullets planted in various parts of his autonomy once he went off with a detail of eight men and captured a whole company of spanish he kept captain floyd busy writing out recommendations of his bravery to send in to head quarters and he began to accumulate medals for all kinds of things heroism and target shooting and valor and tactics and uninsubordination and all the little accomplishments that look good to the third assistant secretaries of the war department finally cap floyd got promoted to be a major general or a knight commander of the main herd or something like that he pounded around on a white horse all desecrated up with gold leaf and hen feathers and a good templar s hat and wasn t allowed by the regulations to speak to us and willie robbins was made captain of our company and maybe he didn t go after the wreath of fame then as far as i could see it was him that ended the war he got eighteen of us boys friends of his too killed in battles that he stirred up himself and that didn t seem to me necessary at all one night he took twelve of us and waded through a little nil about a hundred and ninety yards wide and climbed a couple of mountains and sneaked through a mile of neglected shrubbery and a couple of rock quarries and into a rye straw village and captured a spanish general named as they said benny veedus benny seemed to me hardly worth the trouble being a blackish man without shoes or cuffs and anxious to surrender and throw himself on the commissary of his foe but that job gave willie the big boost he wanted the san augustine news and the galveston st louis new york and kansas city papers printed his picture and columns of stuff about him old san augustine simply went crazy over its gallant son the news had an editorial tearfully begging the government to call off the regular army and the national guard and let willie carry on the rest of the war single handed it said that a refusal to do so would be regarded as a proof that the northern jealousy of the south was still as rampant as ever if the war hadn t ended pretty soon i don t know to what heights of gold braid and encomiums willie would have climbed but it did there was a secession of hostilities just three days after he was appointed a colonel and got in three more medals by registered mail and shot two spaniards while they were drinking lemonade in an ambuscade our company went back to san augustine when the war was over there wasn t anywhere else for it to go and what do you think the old town notified us in print by wire cable special delivery and a nigger named saul sent on a gray mule to san antone that they was going to give us the biggest blow out complimentary alimentary and elementary that ever disturbed the kildees on the sand flats outside of the immediate contiguity of the city i say we but it was all meant for ex private captain de facto and colonel elect willie robbins the town was crazy about him they notified us that the reception they were going to put up would make the mardi gras in new orleans look like an afternoon tea in bury st edmunds with a curate s aunt well the san augustine rifles got back home on schedule time everybody was at the depot giving forth roosevelt democrat they used to be called rebel yells there was two brass bands and the mayor and schoolgirls in white frightening the street car horses by throwing cherokee roses in the streets and well maybe you ve seen a celebration by a town that was inland and out of water they wanted brevet colonel willie to get into a carriage and be drawn by prominent citizens and some of the city aldermen to the armory but he stuck to his company and marched at the head of it up sam houston avenue the buildings on both sides was covered with flags and audiences and everybody hollered robbins or hello willie as we marched up in files of fours i never saw a illustriouser looking human in my life than willie was he had at least seven or eight medals and diplomas and decorations on the breast of his khaki coat he was sunburnt the color of a saddle and he certainly done himself proud they told us at the depot that the courthouse was to be illuminated at half past seven and there would be speeches and chili con came at the palace hotel miss delphine thompson was to read an original poem by james whitcomb ryan and constable hooker had promised us a salute of nine guns from chicago that he had arrested that day after we had disbanded in the armory willie says to me want to walk out a piece with me why yes says i if it ain t so far that we can t hear the tumult and the shouting die away i m hungry myself says i and i m pining for some home grub but i ll go with you willie steered me down some side streets till we came to a little white cottage in a new lot with a twenty by thirty foot lawn decorated with brickbats and old barrel staves halt and give the countersign says i to willie don t you know this dugout it s the bird s nest that joe granberry built before he married myra allison what you going there for but willie already had the gate open he walked up the brick walk to the steps and i went with him myra was sitting in a rocking chair on the porch sewing her hair was smoothed back kind of hasty and tied in a knot i never noticed till then that she had freckles joe was at one side of the porch in his shirtsleeves with no collar on and no signs of a shave trying to scrape out a hole among the brickbats and tin cans to plant a little fruit tree in he looked up but never said a word and neither did myra willie was sure dandy looking in his uniform with medals strung on his breast and his new gold handled sword you d never have taken him for the little white headed snipe that the girls used to order about and make fun of he just stood there for a minute looking at myra with a peculiar little smile on his face and then he says to her slow and kind of holding on to his words with his teeth oh i don t know maybe i could if i tried that was all that was said willie raised his hat and we walked away and somehow when he said that i remembered all of a sudden the night of that dance and willie brushing his hair before the looking glass and myra sticking her head in the door to guy him when we got back to sam houston avenue willie says well so long ben i m going down home and get off my shoes and take a rest you says i what s the matter with you ain t the court house jammed with everybody in town waiting to honor the hero and two brass bands and recitations and flags and jags and grub to follow waiting for you willie sighs all right ben says he darned if i didn t forget all about that and that s why i say concluded ben granger that you can t tell where ambition begins any more than you can where it is going to wind up the head hunter when the war between spain and george dewey was over i went to the philippine islands there i remained as bushwhacker correspondent for my paper until its managing editor notified me that an eight hundred word cablegram describing the grief of a pet carabao over the death of an infant moro was not considered by the office to be war news so i resigned and came home on board the trading vessel that brought me back i pondered much upon the strange things i had sensed in the weird archipelago of the yellow brown people the manoeuvres and skirmishings of the petty war interested me not i was spellbound by the outlandish and unreadable countenance of that race that had turned its expressionless gaze upon us out of an unguessable past particularly during my stay in mindanao had i been fascinated and attracted by that delightfully original tribe of heathen known as the head hunters those grim flinty relentless little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed presence paralleling the trail of their prey through unmapped forests across perilous mountain tops adown bottomless chasms into uninhabitable jungles always near with the invisible hand of death uplifted betraying their pursuit only by such signs as a beast or a bird or a gliding serpent might make a twig crackling in the awful sweat soaked night a drench of dew showering from the screening foliage of a giant tree a whisper at even from the rushes of a water level a hint of death for every mile and every hour they amused me greatly those little fellows of one idea when you think of it their method is beautifully and almost hilariously effective and simple you have your hut in which you live and carry out the destiny that was decreed for you spiked to the jamb of your bamboo doorway is a basket made of green withes plaited from time to time as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move you you creep forth with your snickersnee and take up the silent trail back from it you come triumphant bearing the severed gory head of your victim which you deposit with pardonable pride in the basket at the side of your door it may be the head of your enemy your friend or a stranger according as competition jealousy or simple sportiveness has been your incentive to labor in any case your reward is certain the village men in passing stop to congratulate you as your neighbor on weaker planes of life stops to admire and praise the begonias in your front yard your particular brown maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft tiger s eyes at the evidence of your love for her you chew betel nut and listen content to the intermittent soft drip from the ends of the severed neck arteries and you show your teeth and grunt like a water buffalo which is as near as you can come to laughing at the thought that the cold acephalous body of your door ornament is being spotted by wheeling vultures in the mindanaoan wilds truly the life of the merry head hunter captivated me he had reduced art and philosophy to a simple code to take your adversary s head to basket it at the portal of your castle to see it lying there a dead thing with its cunning and stratagems and power gone is there a better way to foil his plots to refute his arguments to establish your superiority over his skill and wisdom the ship that brought me home was captained by an erratic swede who changed his course and deposited me with genuine compassion in a small town on the pacific coast of one of the central american republics a few hundred miles south of the port to which he had engaged to convey me but i was wearied of movement and exotic fancies so i leaped contentedly upon the firm sands of the village of mojada telling myself i should be sure to find there the rest that i craved after all far better to linger there i thought lulled by the sedative plash of the waves and the rustling of palm fronds than to sit upon the horsehair sofa of my parental home in the east and there cast down by currant wine and cake and scourged by fatuous relatives drivel into the ears of gaping neighbors sad stories of the death of colonial governors when i first saw chloe greene she was standing all in white in the doorway of her father s tile roofed dobe house she was polishing a silver cup with a cloth and she looked like a pearl laid against black velvet she turned on me a flatteringly protracted but a wiltingly disapproving gaze and then went inside humming a light song to indicate the value she placed upon my existence small wonder for dr stamford the most disreputable professional man between juneau and valparaiso and i were zigzagging along the turfy street tunelessly singing the words of auld lang syne to the air of muzzer s little coal black coon we had come from the ice factory which was mojada s palace of wickedness where we had been playing billiards and opening black bottles white with frost that we dragged with strings out of old sandoval s ice cold vats i turned in sudden rage to dr stamford as sober as the verger of a cathedral in a moment i had become aware that we were swine cast before a pearl you beast i said this is half your doing and the other half is the fault of this cursed country i d better have gone back to sleepy town and died in a wild orgy of currant wine and buns than to have had this happen stamford filled the empty street with his roaring laughter you too he cried and all as quick as the popping of a cork well she does seem to strike agreeably upon the retina but don t burn your fingers all mojada will tell you that louis devoe is the man we will see about that said i and perhaps whether he is a man as well as the man i lost no time in meeting louis devoe that was easily accomplished for the foreign colony in mojada numbered scarce a dozen and they gathered daily at a half decent hotel kept by a turk where they managed to patch together the fluttering rags of country and civilization that were left them i sought devoe before i did my pearl of the doorway because i had learned a little of the game of war and knew better than to strike for a prize before testing the strength of the enemy a sort of cold dismay something akin to fear filled me when i had estimated him i found a man so perfectly poised so charming so deeply learned in the world s rituals so full of tact courtesy and hospitality so endowed with grace and ease and a kind of careless haughty power that i almost overstepped the bounds in probing him in turning him on the spit to find the weak point that i so craved for him to have but i left him whole i had to make bitter acknowledgment to myself that louis devoe was a gentleman worthy of my best blows and i swore to give him them he was a great merchant of the country a wealthy importer and exporter all day he sat in a fastidiously appointed office surrounded by works of art and evidences of his high culture directing through glass doors and windows the affairs of his house in person he was slender and hardly tall his small well shaped head was covered with thick brown hair trimmed short and he wore a thick brown beard also cut close and to a fine point his manners were a pattern before long i had become a regular and a welcome visitor at the greene home i shook my wild habits from me like a worn out cloak i trained for the conflict with the care of a prize fighter and the self denial of a brahmin as for chloe greene i shall weary you with no sonnets to her eyebrow she was a splendidly feminine girl as wholesome as a november pippin and no more mysterious than a windowpane she had whimsical little theories that she had deduced from life and that fitted the maxims of epictetus like princess gowns i wonder after all if that old duffer wasn t rather wise chloe had a father the reverend homer greene and an intermittent mother who sometimes palely presided over a twilight teapot the reverend homer was a burr like man with a life work he was writing a concordance to the scriptures and had arrived as far as kings being presumably a suitor for his daughter s hand i was timber for his literary outpourings i had the family tree of israel drilled into my head until i used to cry aloud in my sleep and aminadab begat jay eye see and so forth until he had tackled another book i once made a calculation that the reverend homer s concordance would be worked up as far as the seven vials mentioned in revelations about the third day after they were opened louis devoe as well as i was a visitor and an intimate friend of the greenes it was there i met him the oftenest and a more agreeable man or a more accomplished i have never hated in my life luckily or unfortunately i came to be accepted as a boy my appearance was youthful and i suppose i had that pleading and homeless air that always draws the motherliness that is in women and the cursed theories and hobbies of pater familiases chloe called me tommy and made sisterly fun of my attempts to woo her with devoe she was vastly more reserved he was the man of romance one to stir her imagination and deepest feelings had her fancy leaned toward him i was closer to her but standing in no glamour i had the task before me of winning her in what seems to me the american way of fighting with cleanness and pluck and everyday devotion to break away the barriers of friendship that divided us and to take her if i could between sunrise and dark abetted by neither moonlight nor music nor foreign wiles chloe gave no sign of bestowing her blithe affections upon either of us but one day she let out to me an inkling of what she preferred in a man it was tremendously interesting to me but not illuminating as to its application i had been tormenting her for the dozenth time with the statement and catalogue of my sentiments toward her tommy said she i don t want a man to show his love for me by leading an army against another country and blowing people off the earth with cannons if you mean that the opposite way i answered as they say women do i ll see what i can do the papers are full of this diplomatic row in russia my people know some big people in washington who are right next to the army people and i could get an artillery commission and i m not that way interrupted chloe i mean what i say it isn t the big things that are done in the world tommy that count with a woman when the knights were riding abroad in their armor to slay dragons many a stay at home page won a lonesome lady s hand by being on the spot to pick up her glove and be quick with her cloak when the wind blew the man i am to like best whoever he shall be must show his love in little ways he must never forget after hearing it once that i do not like to have any one walk at my left side that i detest bright colored neckties that i prefer to sit with my back to a light that i like candied violets that i must not be talked to when i am looking at the moonlight shining on water and that i very very often long for dates stuffed with english walnuts frivolity i said with a frown any well trained servant would be equal to such details and he must remember went on chloe to remind me of what i want when i do not know myself what i want you re rising in the scale i said what you seem to need is a first class clairvoyant and if i say that i am dying to hear a beethoven sonata and stamp my foot when i say it he must know by that that what my soul craves is salted almonds and he will have them ready in his pocket now said i i am at a loss i do not know whether your soul s affinity is to be an impresario or a fancy grocer chole turned her pearly smile upon me take less than half of what i said as a jest she went on and don t think too lightly of the little things boy be a paladin if you must but don t let it show on you most women are only very big children and most men are only very little ones please us don t try to overpower us when we want a hero we can make one out of even a plain grocer the third time he catches our handkerchief before it falls to the ground that evening i was taken down with pernicious fever that is a kind of coast fever with improvements and high geared attachments your temperature goes up among the threes and fours and remains there laughing scornfully and feverishly at the cinchona trees and the coal tar derivatives pernicious fever is a case for a simple mathematician instead of a doctor it is merely this formula vitality the desire to live the duration of the fever the result i took to my bed in the two roomed thatched hut where i had been comfortably established and sent for a gallon of rum that was not for myself drunk stamford was the best doctor between the andes and the pacific he came sat at my bedside and drank himself into condition my boy said he my lily white and reformed romeo medicine will do you no good but i will give you quinine which being bitter will arouse in you hatred and anger two stimulants that will add ten per cent to your chances you are as strong as a caribou calf and you will get well if the fever doesn t get in a knockout blow when you re off your guard for two weeks i lay on my back feeling like a hindoo widow on a burning ghat old atasca an untrained indian nurse sat near the door like a petrified statue of what s the use attending to her duties which were mainly to see that time went by without slipping a cog sometimes i would fancy myself back in the philippines or at worse times sliding off the horsehair sofa in sleepytown one afternoon i ordered atasca to vamose and got up and dressed carefully i took my temperature which i was pleased to find i paid almost dainty attention to my dress choosing solicitously a necktie of a dull and subdued hue the mirror showed that i was looking little the worse from my illness the fever gave brightness to my eyes and color to my face and while i looked at my reflection my color went and came again as i thought of chloe greene and the millions of eons that had passed since i d seen her and of louis devoe and the time he had gained on me i went straight to her house i seemed to float rather than walk i hardly felt the ground under my feet i thought pernicious fever must be a great boon to make one feel so strong i found chloe and louis devoe sitting under the awning in front of the house she jumped up and met me with a double handshake i m glad glad glad to see you out again she cried every word a pearl strung on the string of her sentence you are well tommy or better of course i wanted to come to see you but they wouldn t let me oh yes said i carelessly it was nothing merely a little fever i am out again as you see we three sat there and talked for half an hour or so then chloe looked out yearningly and almost piteously across the ocean i could see in her sea blue eyes some deep and intense desire devoe curse him saw it too what is it we asked in unison cocoanut pudding said chloe pathetically i ve wanted some oh so badly for two days it s got beyond a wish it s an obsession the cocoanut season is over said devoe in that voice of his that gave thrilling interest to his most commonplace words i hardly think one could be found in mojada the natives never use them except when they are green and the milk is fresh they sell all the ripe ones to the fruiterers wouldn t a broiled lobster or a welsh rabbit do as well i remarked with the engaging idiocy of a pernicious fever convalescent chloe came as near to pouting as a sweet disposition and a perfect profile would allow her to come the reverend homer poked his ermine lined face through the doorway and added a concordance to the conversation sometimes said he old campos keeps the dried nuts in his little store on the hill but it would be far better my daughter to restrain unusual desires and partake thankfully of the daily dishes that the lord has set before us stuff said i how was that asked the reverend homer sharply i say it s tough said i to drop into the vernacular that miss greene should be deprived of the food she desires a simple thing like kalsomine pudding perhaps i continued solicitously some pickled walnuts or a fricassee of hungarian butternuts would do as well every one looked at me with a slight exhibition of curiosity louis devoe arose and made his adieus i watched him until he had sauntered slowly and grandiosely to the corner around which he turned to reach his great warehouse and store chloe made her excuses and went inside for a few minutes to attend to some detail affecting the seven o clock dinner she was a passed mistress in housekeeping i had tasted her puddings and bread with beatitude when all had gone i turned casually and saw a basket made of plaited green withes hanging by a nail outside the door jamb with a rush that made my hot temples throb there came vividly to my mind recollections of the head hunters those grim flinty relentless little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed presence from time to time as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move him one creeps forth with his snickersnee and takes up the silent trail back he comes triumphant bearing the severed gory head of his victim his particular brown or white maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft tiger s eyes at the evidence of his love for her i stole softly from the house and returned to my hut from its supporting nails in the wall i took a machete as heavy as a butcher s cleaver and sharper than a safety razor and then i chuckled softly to myself and set out to the fastidiously appointed private office of monsieur louis devoe usurper to the hand of the pearl of the pacific he was never slow at thinking he gave one look at my face and another at the weapon in my hand as i entered his door and then he seemed to fade from my sight i ran to the back door kicked it open and saw him running like a deer up the road toward the wood that began two hundred yards away i was after him with a shout i remember hearing children and women screaming and seeing them flying from the road he was fleet but i was stronger a mile and i had almost come up with him he doubled cunningly and dashed into a brake that extended into a small canon i crashed through this after him and in five minutes had him cornered in an angle of insurmountable cliffs there his instinct of self preservation steadied him as it will steady even animals at bay he turned to me quite calm with a ghastly smile oh rayburn he said with such an awful effort at ease that i was impolite enough to laugh rudely in his face oh rayburn said he come let s have done with this nonsense of course i know it s the fever and you re not yourself but collect yourself man give me that ridiculous weapon now and let s go back and talk it over i will go back said i carrying your head with me we will see how charmingly it can discourse when it lies in the basket at her door come said he persuasively i think better of you than to suppose that you try this sort of thing as a joke but even the vagaries of a fever crazed lunatic come some time to a limit what is this talk about heads and baskets get yourself together and throw away that absurd cane chopper what would miss greene think of you he ended with the silky cajolery that one would use toward a fretful child listen said i at last you have struck upon the right note what would she think of me listen i repeated there are women i said who look upon horsehair sofas and currant wine as dross to them even the calculated modulation of your well trimmed talk sounds like the dropping of rotten plums from a tree in the night they are the maidens who walk back and forth in the villages scorning the emptiness of the baskets at the doors of the young men who would win them one such as they i said is waiting only a fool would try to win a woman by drooling like a braggart in her doorway or by waiting upon her whims like a footman they are all daughters of herodias and to gain their hearts one must lay the heads of his enemies before them with his own hands now bend your neck louis devoe do not be a coward as well as a chatterer at a lady s tea table there there said devoe falteringly you know me don t you rayburn oh yes i said i know you i know you i know you but the basket is empty the old men of the village and the young men and both the dark maidens and the ones who are as fair as pearls walk back and forth and see its emptiness will you kneel now or must we have a scuffle it is not like you to make things go roughly and with bad form but the basket is waiting for your head with that he went to pieces i had to catch him as he tried to scamper past me like a scared rabbit i stretched him out and got a foot on his chest but he squirmed like a worm although i appealed repeatedly to his sense of propriety and the duty he owed to himself as a gentleman not to make a row but at last he gave me the chance and i swung the machete it was not hard work he flopped like a chicken during the six or seven blows that it took to sever his head but finally he lay still and i tied his head in my handkerchief the eyes opened and shut thrice while i walked a hundred yards i was red to my feet with the drip but what did that matter with delight i felt under my hands the crisp touch of his short thick brown hair and close trimmed beard i reached the house of the greenes and dumped the head of louis devoe into the basket that still hung by the nail in the door jamb i sat in a chair under the awning and waited the sun was within two hours of setting chloe came out and looked surprised where have you been tommy she asked you were gone when i came out look in the basket i said rising to my feet she looked and gave a little scream of delight i was pleased to note oh tommy she said it was just what i wanted you to do it s leaking a little but that doesn t matter wasn t i telling you it s the little things that count and you remembered little things she held the ensanguined head of louis devoe in her white apron tiny streams of red widened on her apron and dripped upon the floor her face was bright and tender little things indeed i thought again the head hunters are right these are the things that women like you to do for them chloe came close to me there was no one in sight she looked tip at me with sea blue eyes that said things they had never said before you think of me she said you are the man i was describing you think of the little things and they are what make the world worth living in the man for me must consider my little wishes and make me happy in small ways he must bring me little red peaches in december if i wish for them and then i will love him till june i will have no knight in armor slaying his rival or killing dragons for me you please me very well tommy i stooped and kissed her then a moisture broke out on my forehead and i began to feel weak i saw the red stains vanish from chloe s apron and the head of louis devoe turn to a brown dried cocoanut there will be cocoanut pudding for dinner tommy boy said chloe gayly and you must come i must go in for a little while she vanished in a delightful flutter dr stamford tramped up hurriedly he seized my pulse as though it were his own property that i had escaped with you are the biggest fool outside of any asylum he said angrily why did you leave your bed and the idiotic things you ve been doing and no wonder with your pulse going like a sledge hammer name some of them said i devoe sent for me said stamford he saw you from his window go to old campos store chase him up the hill with his own yardstick and then come back and make off with his biggest cocoanut it s the little things that count after all said i it s your little bed that counts with you just now said the doctor you come with me at once or i ll throw up the case you re as loony as a loon so i got no cocoanut pudding that evening but i conceived a distrust as to the value of the method of the head hunters perhaps for many centuries the maidens of the villages may have been looking wistfully at the heads in the baskets at the doorways longing for other and lesser trophies no story to avoid having this book hurled into corner of the room by the suspicious reader i will assert in time that this is not a newspaper story you will encounter no shirt sleeved omniscient city editor no prodigy cub reporter just off the farm no scoop no story no anything but if you will concede me the setting of the first scene in the reporters room of the morning beacon i will repay the favor by keeping strictly my promises set forth above i was doing space work on the beacon hoping to be put on a salary some one had cleared with a rake or a shovel a small space for me at the end of a long table piled high with exchanges congressional records and old files there i did my work i wrote whatever the city whispered or roared or chuckled to me on my diligent wanderings about its streets my income was not regular one day tripp came in and leaned on my table tripp was something in the mechanical department i think he had something to do with the pictures for he smelled of photographers supplies and his hands were always stained and cut up with acids he was about twenty five and looked forty half of his face was covered with short curly red whiskers that looked like a door mat with the welcome left off he was pale and unhealthy and miserable and fawning and an assiduous borrower of sums ranging from twenty five cents to a dollar one dollar was his limit he knew the extent of his credit as well as the chemical national bank knows the amount of h that collateral will show on analysis when he sat on my table he held one hand with the other to keep both from shaking whiskey he had a spurious air of lightness and bravado about him that deceived no one but was useful in his borrowing because it was so pitifully and perceptibly assumed this day i had coaxed from the cashier five shining silver dollars as a grumbling advance on a story that the sunday editor had reluctantly accepted so if i was not feeling at peace with the world at least an armistice had been declared and i was beginning with ardor to write a description of the brooklyn bridge by moonlight well tripp said i looking up at him rather impatiently how goes it he was looking to day more miserable more cringing and haggard and downtrodden than i had ever seen him he was at that stage of misery where he drew your pity so fully that you longed to kick him have you got a dollar asked tripp with his most fawning look and his dog like eyes that blinked in the narrow space between his high growing matted beard and his low growing matted hair i have said i and again i said i have more loudly and inhospitably and four besides and i had hard work corkscrewing them out of old atkinson i can tell you and i drew them i continued to meet a want a hiatus a demand a need an exigency a requirement of exactly five dollars i was driven to emphasis by the premonition that i was to lose one of the dollars on the spot i don t want to borrow any said tripp and i breathed again i thought you d like to get put onto a good story he went on i ve got a rattling fine one for you you ought to make it run a column at least it ll make a dandy if you work it up right it ll probably cost you a dollar or two to get the stuff i don t want anything out of it myself i became placated the proposition showed that tripp appreciated past favors although he did not return them if he had been wise enough to strike me for a quarter then he would have got it what is the story i asked poising my pencil with a finely calculated editorial air i ll tell you said tripp it s a girl a beauty one of the howlingest amsden s junes you ever saw rosebuds covered with dew violets in their mossy bed and truck like that she s lived on long island twenty years and never saw new york city before i ran against her on thirty fourth street she d just got in on the east river ferry i tell you she s a beauty that would take the hydrogen out of all the peroxides in the world she stopped me on the street and asked me where she could find george brown asked me where she could find george brown in new york city what do you think of that i talked to her and found that she was going to marry a young farmer named dodd hiram dodd next week but it seems that george brown still holds the championship in her youthful fancy george had greased his cowhide boots some years ago and came to the city to make his fortune but he forgot to remember to show up again at greenburg and hiram got in as second best choice but when it comes to the scratch ada her name s ada lowery saddles a nag and rides eight miles to the railroad station and catches the a m train for the city looking for george you know you understand about women george wasn t there so she wanted him well you know i couldn t leave her loose in wolftown on the hudson i suppose she thought the first person she inquired of would say george brown why yes lemme see he s a short man with light blue eyes ain t he oh yes you ll find george on one hundred and twenty fifth street right next to the grocery he s bill clerk in a saddle and harness store that s about how innocent and beautiful she is you know those little long island water front villages like greenburg a couple of duck farms for sport and clams and about nine summer visitors for industries that s the kind of a place she comes from but say you ought to see her what could i do i don t know what money looks like in the morning and she d paid her last cent of pocket money for her railroad ticket except a quarter which she had squandered on gum drops she was eating them out of a paper bag i took her to a boarding house on thirty second street where i used to live and hocked her she s in soak for a dollar that s old mother mcginnis price per day i ll show you the house what words are these tripp said i i thought you said you had a story every ferryboat that crosses the east river brings or takes away girls from long island the premature lines on tripp s face grew deeper he frowned seriously from his tangle of hair he separated his hands and emphasized his answer with one shaking forefinger can t you see he said what a rattling fine story it would make you could do it fine all about the romance you know and describe the girl and put a lot of stuff in it about true love and sling in a few stickfuls of funny business joshing the long islanders about being green and well you know how to do it you ought to get fifteen dollars out of it anyhow and it ll cost you only about four dollars you ll make a clear profit of eleven how will it cost me four dollars i asked suspiciously one dollar to mrs mcginnis tripp answered promptly and two dollars to pay the girl s fare back home and the fourth dimension i inquired making a rapid mental calculation one dollar to me said tripp for whiskey are you on i smiled enigmatically and spread my elbows as if to begin writing again but this grim abject specious subservient burr like wreck of a man would not be shaken off his forehead suddenly became shiningly moist don t you see he said with a sort of desperate calmness that this girl has got to be sent home to day not to night nor to morrow but to day i can t do anything for her you know i m the janitor and corresponding secretary of the down and out club i thought you could make a newspaper story out of it and win out a piece of money on general results but anyhow don t you see that she s got to get back home before night and then i began to feel that dull leaden soul depressing sensation known as the sense of duty why should that sense fall upon one as a weight and a burden i knew that i was doomed that day to give up the bulk of my store of hard wrung coin to the relief of this ada lowery but i swore to myself that tripp s whiskey dollar would not be forthcoming he might play knight errant at my expense but he would indulge in no wassail afterward commemorating my weakness and gullibility in a kind of chilly anger i put on my coat and hat tripp submissive cringing vainly endeavoring to please conducted me via the street cars to the human pawn shop of mother mcginnis i paid the fares it seemed that the collodion scented don quixote and the smallest minted coin were strangers tripp pulled the bell at the door of the mouldly red brick boarding house at its faint tinkle he paled and crouched as a rabbit makes ready to spring away at the sound of a hunting dog i guessed what a life he had led terror haunted by the coming footsteps of landladies give me one of the dollars quick he said the door opened six inches mother mcginnis stood there with white eyes they were white i say and a yellow face holding together at her throat with one hand a dingy pink flannel dressing sack tripp thrust the dollar through the space without a word and it bought us entry she s in the parlor said the mcginnis turning the back of her sack upon us in the dim parlor a girl sat at the cracked marble centre table weeping comfortably and eating gum drops she was a flawless beauty crying had only made her brilliant eyes brighter when she crunched a gum drop you thought only of the poetry of motion and envied the senseless confection eve at the age of five minutes must have been a ringer for miss ada lowery at nineteen or twenty i was introduced and a gum drop suffered neglect while she conveyed to me a naive interest such as a puppy dog a prize winner might bestow upon a crawling beetle or a frog tripp took his stand by the table with the fingers of one hand spread upon it as an attorney or a master of ceremonies might have stood but he looked the master of nothing his faded coat was buttoned high as if it sought to be charitable to deficiencies of tie and linen i thought of a scotch terrier at the sight of his shifty eyes in the glade between his tangled hair and beard for one ignoble moment i felt ashamed of having been introduced as his friend in the presence of so much beauty in distress but evidently tripp meant to conduct the ceremonies whatever they might be i thought i detected in his actions and pose an intention of foisting the situation upon me as material for a newspaper story in a lingering hope of extracting from me his whiskey dollar my friend i shuddered mr chalmers said tripp will tell you miss lowery the same that i did he s a reporter and he can hand out the talk better than i can that s why i brought him with me tripp wasn t it the silver tongued orator you wanted he s wise to a lot of things and he ll tell you now what s best to do i stood on one foot as it were as i sat in my rickety chair why er miss lowery i began secretly enraged at tripp s awkward opening i am at your service of course but er as i haven t been apprized of the circumstances of the case i er oh said miss lowery beaming for a moment it ain t as bad as that there ain t any circumstances it s the first time i ve ever been in new york except once when i was five years old and i had no idea it was such a big town and i met mr mr snip on the street and asked him about a friend of mine and he brought me here and asked me to wait i advise you miss lowery said tripp to tell mr chalmers all he s a friend of mine i was getting used to it by this time and he ll give you the right tip why certainly said miss ada chewing a gum drop toward me there ain t anything to tell except that well everything s fixed for me to marry hiram dodd next thursday evening hi has got two hundred acres of land with a lot of shore front and one of the best truck farms on the island but this morning i had my horse saddled up he s a white horse named dancer and i rode over to the station i told em at home i was going to spend the day with susie adams it was a story i guess but i don t care and i came to new york on the train and i met mr mr flip on the street and asked him if he knew where i could find g g now miss lowery broke in tripp loudly and with much bad taste i thought as she hesitated with her word you like this young man hiram dodd don t you he s all right and good to you ain t he of course i like him said miss lowery emphatically hi s all right and of course he s good to me so is everybody i could have sworn it myself throughout miss ada lowery s life all men would be to good to her they would strive contrive struggle and compete to hold umbrellas over her hat check her trunk pick up her handkerchief buy for her soda at the fountain but went on miss lowery last night got to thinking about g george and i down went the bright gold head upon dimpled clasped hands on the table such a beautiful april storm unrestrainedly sobbed i wished i could have comforted her but i was not george and i was glad i was not hiram and yet i was sorry too by and by the shower passed she straightened up brave and half way smiling she would have made a splendid wife for crying only made her eyes more bright and tender she took a gum drop and began her story i guess i m a terrible hayseed she said between her little gulps and sighs but i can t help it g george brown and i were sweet hearts since he was eight and i was five when he was nineteen that was four years ago he left greenburg and went to the city he said he was going to be a policeman or a railroad president or something and then he was coming back for me but i never heard from him any more and i i liked him another flow of tears seemed imminent but tripp hurled himself into the crevasse and dammed it confound him i could see his game he was trying to make a story of it for his sordid ends and profit go on mr chalmers said he and tell the lady what s the proper caper that s what i told her you d hand it to her straight spiel up i coughed and tried to feel less wrathful toward tripp i saw my duty cunningly i had been inveigled but i was securely trapped tripp s first dictum to me had been just and correct the young lady must be sent back to greenburg that day she must be argued with convinced assured instructed ticketed and returned without delay i hated hiram and despised george but duty must be done noblesse oblige and only five silver dollars are not strictly romantic compatibles but sometimes they can be made to jibe it was mine to be sir oracle and then pay the freight so i assumed an air that mingled solomon s with that of the general passenger agent of the long island railroad miss lowery said i as impressively as i could life is rather a queer proposition after all there was a familiar sound to these words after i had spoken them and i hoped miss lowery had never heard mr cohan s song those whom we first love we seldom wed our earlier romances tinged with the magic radiance of youth often fail to materialize the last three words sounded somewhat trite when they struck the air but those fondly cherished dreams i went on may cast a pleasant afterglow on our future lives however impracticable and vague they may have been but life is full of realities as well as visions and dreams one cannot live on memories may i ask miss lowery if you think you could pass a happy that is a contented and harmonious life with mr er dodd if in other ways than romantic recollections he seems to er fill the bill as i might say oh hi s all right answered miss lowery yes i could get along with him fine he s promised me an automobile and a motor boat but somehow when it got so close to the time i was to marry him i couldn t help wishing well just thinking about george something must have happened to him or he d have written on the day he left he and me got a hammer and a chisel and cut a dime into two pieces i took one piece and he took the other and we promised to be true to each other and always keep the pieces till we saw each other again i ve got mine at home now in a ring box in the top drawer of my dresser i guess i was silly to come up here looking for him i never realized what a big place it is and then tripp joined in with a little grating laugh that he had still trying to drag in a little story or drama to earn the miserable dollar that he craved oh the boys from the country forget a lot when they come to the city and learn something i guess george maybe is on the bum or got roped in by some other girl or maybe gone to the dogs on account of whiskey or the races you listen to mr chalmers and go back home and you ll be all right but now the time was come for action for the hands of the clock were moving close to noon frowning upon tripp i argued gently and philosophically with miss lowery delicately convincing her of the importance of returning home at once and i impressed upon her the truth that it would not be absolutely necessary to her future happiness that she mention to hi the wonders or the fact of her visit to the city that had swallowed up the unlucky george she said she had left her horse unfortunate rosinante tied to a tree near the railroad station tripp and i gave her instructions to mount the patient steed as soon as she arrived and ride home as fast as possible there she was to recount the exciting adventure of a day spent with susie adams she could fix susie i was sure of that and all would be well and then being susceptible to the barbed arrows of beauty i warmed to the adventure the three of us hurried to the ferry and there i found the price of a ticket to greenburg to be but a dollar and eighty cents i bought one and a red red rose with the twenty cents for miss lowery we saw her aboard her ferryboat and stood watching her wave her handkerchief at us until it was the tiniest white patch imaginable and then tripp and i faced each other brought back to earth left dry and desolate in the shade of the sombre verities of life the spell wrought by beauty and romance was dwindling i looked at tripp and almost sneered he looked more careworn contemptible and disreputable than ever i fingered the two silver dollars remaining in my pocket and looked at him with the half closed eyelids of contempt he mustered up an imitation of resistance can t you get a story out of it he asked huskily some sort of a story even if you have to fake part of it not a line said i i can fancy the look on grimes face if i should try to put over any slush like this but we ve helped the little lady out and that ll have to be our only reward i m sorry said tripp almost inaudibly i m sorry you re out your money now it seemed to me like a find of a big story you know that is a sort of thing that would write up pretty well let s try to forget it said i with a praiseworthy attempt at gayety and take the next car cross town i steeled myself against his unexpressed but palpable desire he should not coax cajole or wring from me the dollar he craved i had had enough of that wild goose chase tripp feebly unbuttoned his coat of the faded pattern and glossy seams to reach for something that had once been a handkerchief deep down in some obscure and cavernous pocket as he did so i caught the shine of a cheap silver plated watch chain across his vest and something dangling from it caused me to stretch forth my hand and seize it curiously it was the half of a silver dime that had been cut in halves with a chisel what i said looking at him keenly oh yes he responded dully george brown alias tripp what s the use barring the w c t u i d like to know if anybody disapproves of my having produced promptly from my pocket tripp s whiskey dollar and unhesitatingly laying it in his hand the higher pragmatism i where to go for wisdom has become a question of serious import the ancients are discredited plato is boiler plate aristotle is tottering marcus aurelius is reeling aesop has been

we know a thing we know it but very often we are not wise to it that we are wise and but let s go on with the story ii once upon a time i found a ten cent magazine lying on a bench in a little city park anyhow that was the amount he asked me for when i sat on the bench next to him he was a musty dingy and tattered magazine with some queer stories bound in him i was sure he turned out to be a scrap book i am a newspaper reporter i said to him to try him i have been detailed to write up some of the experiences of the unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in this park may i ask you to what you attribute your downfall in i was interrupted by a laugh from my purchase a laugh so rusty and unpractised that i was sure it had been his first for many a day oh no no said he you ain t a reporter reporters don t talk that way they pretend to be one of us and say they ve just got in on the blind baggage from st louis i can tell a reporter on sight us park bums get to be fine judges of human nature we sit here all day and watch the people go by i can size up anybody who walks past my bench in a way that would surprise you well i said go on and tell me how do you size me up i should say said the student of human nature with unpardonable hesitation that you was say in the contracting business or maybe worked in a store or was a sign painter you stopped in the park to finish your cigar and thought you d get a little free monologue out of me still you might be a plasterer or a lawyer it s getting kind of dark you see and your wife won t let you smoke at home i frowned gloomily but judging again went on the reader of men i d say you ain t got a wife no said i rising restlessly no no no i ain t but i will have by the arrows of cupid that is if my voice must have trailed away and muffled itself in uncertainty and despair i see you have a story yourself said the dusty vagrant impudently it seemed to me suppose you take your dime back and spin your yarn for me i m interested myself in the ups and downs of unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in the park somehow that amused me i looked at the frowsy derelict with more interest i did have a story why not tell it to him i had told none of my friends i had always been a reserved and bottled up man it was psychical timidity or sensitiveness perhaps both and i smiled to myself in wonder when i felt an impulse to confide in this stranger and vagabond jack said i mack said he mack said i i ll tell you do you want the dime back in advance said he i handed him a dollar the dime said i was the price of listening to your story right on the point of the jaw said he go on and then incredible as it may seem to the lovers in the world who confide their sorrows only to the night wind and the gibbous moon i laid bare my secret to that wreck of all things that you would have supposed to be in sympathy with love i told him of the days and weeks and months that i had spent in adoring mildred telfair i spoke of my despair my grievous days and wakeful nights my dwindling hopes and distress of mind i even pictured to this night prowler her beauty and dignity the great sway she had in society and the magnificence of her life as the elder daughter of an ancient race whose pride overbalanced the dollars of the city s millionaires why don t you cop the lady out asked mack bringing me down to earth and dialect again i explained to him that my worth was so small my income so minute and my fears so large that i hadn t the courage to speak to her of my worship i told him that in her presence i could only blush and stammer and that she looked upon me with a wonderful maddening smile of amusement she kind of moves in the professional class don t she asked mack the telfair family i began haughtily i mean professional beauty said my hearer she is greatly and widely admired i answered cautiously any sisters one you know any more girls why several i answered and a few others say said mack tell me one thing can you hand out the dope to other girls can you chin em and make matinee eyes at em and squeeze em you know what i mean you re just shy when it comes to this particular dame the professional beauty ain t that right in a way you have outlined the situation with approximate truth i admitted i thought so said mack grimly now that reminds me of my own case i ll tell you about it i was indignant but concealed it what was this loafer s case or anybody s case compared with mine besides i had given him a dollar and ten cents feel my muscle said my companion suddenly flexing his biceps i did so mechanically the fellows in gyms are always asking you to do that his arm was as hard as cast iron four years ago said mack i could lick any man in new york outside of the professional ring your case and mine is just the same i come from the west side between thirtieth and fourteenth i won t give the number on the door i was a scrapper when i was ten and when i was twenty no amateur in the city could stand up four rounds with me s a fact you know bill mccarty no he managed the smokers for some of them swell clubs well i knocked out everything bill brought up before me i was a middle weight but could train down to a welter when necessary i boxed all over the west side at bouts and benefits and private entertainments and was never put out once but say the first time i put my foot in the ring with a professional i was no more than a canned lobster i dunno how it was i seemed to lose heart i guess i got too much imagination there was a formality and publieness about it that kind of weakened my nerve i never won a fight in the ring light weights and all kinds of scrubs used to sign up with my manager and then walk up and tap me on the wrist and see me fall the minute i seen the crowd and a lot of gents in evening clothes down in front and seen a professional come inside the ropes i got as weak as ginger ale of course it wasn t long till i couldn t get no backers and i didn t have any more chances to fight a professional or many amateurs either but lemme tell you i was as good as most men inside the ring or out it was just that dumb dead feeling i had when i was up against a regular that always done me up well sir after i had got out of the business i got a mighty grouch on i used to go round town licking private citizens and all kinds of unprofessionals just to please myself i d lick cops in dark streets and car conductors and cab drivers and draymen whenever i could start a row with em it didn t make any difference how big they were or how much science they had i got away with em if i d only just have had the confidence in the ring that i had beating up the best men outside of it i d be wearing black pearls and heliotrope silk socks to day one evening i was walking along near the bowery thinking about things when along comes a slumming party about six or seven they was all in swallowtails and these silk hats that don t shine one of the gang kind of shoves me off the sidewalk i hadn t had a scrap in three days and i just says de lighted and hits him back of the ear well we had it that johnnie put up as decent a little fight as you d want to see in the moving pictures it was on a side street and no cops around the other guy had a lot of science but it only took me about six minutes to lay him out some of the swallowtails dragged him up against some steps and began to fan him another one of em comes over to me and says young man do you know what you ve done oh beat it says i i ve done nothing but a little punching bag work take freddy back to yale and tell him to quit studying sociology on the wrong side of the sidewalk my good fellow says he i don t know who you are but i d like to you ve knocked out reddy burns the champion middle weight of the world he came to new york yesterday to try to get a match on with jim jeifries if you but when i come out of my faint i was laying on the floor in a drug store saturated with aromatic spirits of ammonia if i d known that was reddy burns i d have got down in the gutter and crawled past him instead of handing him one like i did why if i d ever been in a ring and seen him climbing over the ropes i d have been all to the sal volatile so that s what imagination does concluded mack and as i said your case and mine is simultaneous you ll never win out you can t go up against the professionals i tell you it s a park bench for yours in this romance business mack the pessimist laughed harshly i m afraid i don t see the parallel i said coldly i have only a very slight acquaintance with the prize ring the derelict touched my sleeve with his forefinger for emphasis as he explained his parable every man said he with some dignity has got his lamps on something that looks good to him with you it s this dame that you re afraid to say your say to with me it was to win out in the ring well you ll lose just like i did why do you think i shall lose i asked warmly cause said he you re afraid to go in the ring you dassen t stand up before a professional your case and mine is just the same you re a amateur and that means that you d better keep outside of the ropes well i must be going i said rising and looking with elaborate care at my watch when i was twenty feet away the park bencher called to me much obliged for the dollar he said and for the dime but you ll never get er you re in the amateur class serves you right i said to myself for hobnobbing with a tramp his impudence but as i walked his words seemed to repeat themselves over and over again in my brain i think i even grew angry at the man i ll show him i finally said aloud i ll show him that i can fight reddy burns too even knowing who he is i hurried to a telephone booth and rang up the telfair residence a soft sweet voice answered didn t i know that voice my hand holding the receiver shook is that you said i employing the foolish words that form the vocabulary of every talker through the telephone yes this is i came back the answer in the low clear cut tones that are an inheritance of the telfairs who is it please it s me said i less ungrammatically than egotistically it s me and i ve got a few things that i want to say to you right now and immediately and straight to the point dear me said the voice oh it s you mr arden i wondered if any accent on the first word was intended mildred was fine at saying things that you had to study out afterward yes said i i hope so and now to come down to brass tacks i thought that rather a vernacularism if there is such a word as soon as i had said it but i didn t stop to apologize you know of course that i love you and that i have been in that idiotic state for a long time i don t want any more foolish ness about it that is i mean i want an answer from you right now will you marry me or not hold the wire please keep out central hello hello will you or will you not that was just the uppercut for reddy burns chin the answer came back why phil dear of course i will i didn t know that you that is you never said oh come up to the house please i can t say what i want to over the phone you are so importunate but please come up to the house won t you would i i rang the bell of the telfair house violently some sort of a human came to the door and shooed me into the drawing room oh well said i to myself looking at the ceiling any one can learn from any one that was a pretty good philosophy of mack s anyhow he didn t take advantage of his experience but i get the benefit of it if you want to get into the professional class you ve got to i stopped thinking then some one was coming down the stairs my knees began to shake i knew then how mack had felt when a professional began to climb over the ropes i looked around foolishly for a door or a window by which i might escape if it had been any other girl approaching i mightn t have but just then the door opened and bess mildred s younger sister came in i d never seen her look so much like a glorified angel she walked straight tip to me and and i d never noticed before what perfectly wonderful eyes and hair elizabeth telfair had phil she said in the telfair sweet thrilling tones why didn t you tell me about it before i thought it was sister you wanted all the time until you telephoned to me a few minutes ago i suppose mack and i always will be hopeless amateurs but as the thing has turned out in my case i m mighty glad of it best seller i one day last summer i went to pittsburgh well i had to go there on business my chair car was profitably well filled with people of the kind one usually sees on chair cars most of them were ladies in brown silk dresses cut with square yokes with lace insertion and dotted veils who refused to have the windows raised then there was the usual number of men who looked as if they might be in almost any business and going almost anywhere some students of human nature can look at a man in a pullman and tell you where he is from his occupation and his stations in life both flag and social but i never could the only way i can correctly judge a fellow traveller is when the train is held up by robbers or when he reaches at the same time i do for the last towel in the dressing room of the sleeper the porter came and brushed the collection of soot on the window sill off to the left knee of my trousers i removed it with an air of apology the temperature was eighty eight one of the dotted veiled ladies demanded the closing of two more ventilators and spoke loudly of interlaken i leaned back idly in chair no and looked with the tepidest curiosity at the small black bald spotted head just visible above the back of no suddenly no hurled a book to the floor between his chair and the window and looking i saw that it was the rose lady and trevelyan one of the best selling novels of the present day and then the critic or philistine whichever he was veered his chair toward the window and i knew him at once for john a pescud of pittsburgh travelling salesman for a plate glass company an old acquaintance whom i had not seen in two years in two minutes we were faced had shaken hands and had finished with such topics as rain prosperity health residence and destination politics might have followed next but i was not so ill fated i wish you might know john a pescud he is of the stuff that heroes are not often lucky enough to be made of he is a small man with a wide smile and an eye that seems to be fixed upon that little red spot on the end of your nose i never saw him wear but one kind of necktie and he believes in cuff holders and button shoes he is as hard and true as anything ever turned out by the cambria steel works and he believes that as soon as pittsburgh makes smoke consumers compulsory st peter will come down and sit at the foot of smithfield street and let somebody else attend to the gate up in the branch heaven he believes that our plate glass is the most important commodity in the world and that when a man is in his home town he ought to be decent and law abiding during my acquaintance with him in the city of diurnal night i had never known his views on life romance literature and ethics we had browsed during our meetings on local topics and then parted after chateau margaux irish stew flannel cakes cottage pudding and coffee hey there with milk separate now i was to get more of his ideas by way of facts he told me that business had picked up since the party conventions and that he was going to get off at coketown ii say said pescud stirring his discarded book with the toe of his right shoe did you ever read one of these best sellers i mean the kind where the hero is an american swell sometimes even from chicago who falls in love with a royal princess from europe who is travelling under an alias and follows her to her father s kingdom or principality i guess you have they re all alike sometimes this going away masher is a washington newspaper correspondent and sometimes he is a van something from new york or a chicago wheat broker worthy fifty millions but he s always ready to break into the king row of any foreign country that sends over their queens and princesses to try the new plush seats on the big four or the b and there doesn t seem to be any other reason in the book for their being here well this fellow chases the royal chair warmer home as i said and finds out who she is he meets here on the corso or the strasse one evening and gives us ten pages of conversation she reminds him of the difference in their stations and that gives him a chance to ring in three solid pages about america s uncrowned sovereigns if you d take his remarks and set em to music and then take the music away from em they d sound exactly like one of george cohan s songs well you know how it runs on if you ve read any of em he slaps the king s swiss body guards around like everything whenever they get in his way he s a great fencer too now i ve known of some chicago men who were pretty notorious fences but i never heard of any fencers coming from there he stands on the first landing of the royal staircase in castle schutzenfestenstein with a gleaming rapier in his hand and makes a baltimore broil of six platoons of traitors who come to massacre the said king and then he has to fight duels with a couple of chancellors and foil a plot by four austrian archdukes to seize the kingdom for a gasoline station but the great scene is when his rival for the princess hand count feodor attacks him between the portcullis and the ruined chapel armed with a mitrailleuse a yataghan and a couple of siberian bloodhounds this scene is what runs the best seller into the twenty ninth edition before the publisher has had time to draw a check for the advance royalties the american hero shucks his coat and throws it over the heads of the bloodhounds gives the mitrailleuse a slap with his mitt says yah to the yataghan and lands in kid mccoy s best style on the count s left eye of course we have a neat little prize fight right then and there the count in order to make the go possible seems to be an expert at the art of self defence himself and here we have the corbett sullivan fight done over into literature the book ends with the broker and the princess doing a john cecil clay cover under the linden trees on the gorgonzola walk that winds up the love story plenty good enough but i notice that the book dodges the final issue even a best seller has sense enough to shy at either leaving a chicago grain broker on the throne of lobsterpotsdam or bringing over a real princess to eat fish and potato salad in an italian chalet on michigan avenue what do you think about em why said i i hardly know john there s a saying love levels all ranks you know yes said pescud but these kind of love stories are rank on the level i know something about literature even if i am in plate glass these kind of books are wrong and yet i never go into a train but what they pile em up on me no good can come out of an international clinch between the old world aristocracy and one of us fresh americans when people in real life marry they generally hunt up somebody in their own station a fellow usually picks out a girl that went to the same high school and belonged to the same singing society that he did when young millionaires fall in love they always select the chorus girl that likes the same kind of sauce on the lobster that he does washington newspaper correspondents always many widow ladies ten years older than themselves who keep boarding houses no sir you can t make a novel sound right to me when it makes one of c d gibson s bright young men go abroad and turn kingdoms upside down just because he s a taft american aud took a course at a gymnasium and listen how they talk too pescud picked up the best seller and hunted his page listen at this said he trevelyan is chinning with the princess alwyna at the back end of the tulip garden this is how it goes say not so dearest and sweetest of earth s fairest flowers would i aspire you are a star set high above me in a royal heaven i am only myself yet i am a man and i have a heart to do and dare i have no title save that of an uncrowned sovereign but i have an arm and a sword that yet might free schutzenfestenstein from the plots of traitors think of a chicago man packing a sword and talking about freeing anything that sounded as much like canned pork as that he d be much more likely to fight to have an import duty put on it i think i understand you john said i you want fiction writers to be consistent with their scenes and characters they shouldn t mix turkish pashas with vermont farmers or english dukes with long island clam diggers or italian countesses with montana cowboys or cincinnati brewery agents with the rajahs of india or plain business men with aristocracy high above em added pescud it don t jibe people are divided into classes whether we admit it or not and it s everybody s impulse to stick to their own class they do it too i don t see why people go to work and buy hundreds of thousands of books like that you don t see or hear of any such didoes and capers in real life iii well john said i i haven t read a best seller in a long time maybe i ve had notions about them somewhat like yours but tell me more about yourself getting along all right with the company bully said pescud brightening at once i ve had my salary raised twice since i saw you and i get a commission too i ve bought a neat slice of real estate out in the east end and have run up a house on it next year the firm is going to sell me some shares of stock oh i m in on the line of general prosperity no matter who s elected met your affinity yet john i asked oh i didn t tell you about that did i said pescud with a broader grin ho i said so you ve taken time enough off from your plate glass to have a romance no no said john no romance nothing like that but i ll tell you about it i was on the south bound going to cincinnati about eighteen months ago when i saw across the aisle the finest looking girl i d ever laid eyes on nothing spectacular you know but just the sort you want for keeps well i never was up to the flirtation business either handkerchief automobile postage stamp or door step and she wasn t the kind to start anything she read a book and minded her business which was to make the world prettier and better just by residing on it i kept on looking out of the side doors of my eyes and finally the proposition got out of the pullman class into a case of a cottage with a lawn and vines running over the porch i never thought of speaking to her but i let the plate glass business go to smash for a while she changed cars at cincinnati and took a sleeper to louisville over the l and n there she bought another ticket and went on through shelbyville frankfort and lexington along there i began to have a hard time keeping up with her the trains came along when they pleased and didn t seem to be going anywhere in particular except to keep on the track and the right of way as much as possible then they began to stop at junctions instead of towns and at last they stopped altogether i ll bet pinkerton would outbid the plate glass people for my services any time if they knew how i managed to shadow that young lady i contrived to keep out of her sight as much as i could but i never lost track of her the last station she got off at was away down in virginia about six in the afternoon there were about fifty houses and four hundred niggers in sight the rest was red mud mules and speckled hounds a tall old man with a smooth face and white hair looking as proud as julius caesar and roscoe conkling on the same post card was there to meet her his clothcs were frazzled but i didn t notice that till later he took her little satchel and they started over the plank walks and went up a road along the hill i kept along a piece behind em trying to look like i was hunting a garnet ring in the sand that my sister had lost at a picnic the previous saturday they went in a gate on top of the hill it nearly took my breath away when i looked up up there in the biggest grove i ever saw was a tremendous house with round white pillars about a thousand feet high and the yard was so full of rose bushes and box bushes and lilacs that you couldn t have seen the house if it hadn t been as big as the capitol at washington here s where i have to trail says i to myself i thought before that she seemed to be in moderate circumstances at least this must be the governor s mansion or the agricultural building of a new world s fair anyhow i d better go back to the village and get posted by the postmaster or drug the druggist for some information in the village i found a pine hotel called the bay view house the only excuse for the name was a bay horse grazing in the front yard i set my sample case down and tried to be ostensible i told the landlord i was taking orders for plate glass i don t want no plates says he but i do need another glass molasses pitcher by and by i got him down to local gossip and answering questions why says he i thought everybody knowed who lived in the big white house on the hill it s colonel allyn the biggest man and the finest quality in virginia or anywhere else they re the oldest family in the state that was his daughter that got off the train she s been up to illinois to see her aunt who is sick i registered at the hotel and on the third day i caught the young lady walking in the front yard down next to the paling fence i stopped and raised my hat there wasn t any other way excuse me says i can you tell me where mr hinkle lives she looks at me as cool as if i was the man come to see about the weeding of the garden but i thought i saw just a slight twinkle of fun in her eyes no one of that name lives in birchton says she that is she goes on as far as i know is the gentleman you are seeking white well that tickled me no kidding says i i m not looking for smoke even if i do come from pittsburgh you are quite a distance from home says she i d have gone a thousand miles farther says i not if you hadn t waked up when the train started in shelbyville says she and then she turned almost as red as one of the roses on the bushes in the yard i remembered i had dropped off to sleep on a bench in the shelbyville station waiting to see which train she took and only just managed to wake up in time and then i told her why i had come as respectful and earnest as i could and i told her everything about myself and what i was making and how that all i asked was just to get acquainted with her and try to get her to like me she smiles a little and blushes some but her eyes never get mixed up they look straight at whatever she s talking to i never had any one talk like this to me before mr pescud says she what did you say your name is john john a says i and you came mighty near missing the train at powhatan junction too says she with a laugh that sounded as good as a mileage book to me how did you know i asked men are very clumsy said she i knew you were on every train i thought you were going to speak to me and i m glad you didn t then we had more talk and at last a kind of proud serious look came on her face and she turned and pointed a finger at the big house the allyns says she have lived in elmcroft for a hundred years we are a proud family look at that mansion it has fifty rooms see the pillars and porches and balconies the ceilings in the reception rooms and the ball room are twenty eight feet high my father is a lineal descendant of belted earls i belted one of em once in the duquesne hotel in pittsburgh says i and he didn t offer to resent it he was there dividing his attentions between monongahela whiskey and heiresses and he got fresh of course she goes on my father wouldn t allow a drummer to set his foot in elmeroft if he knew that i was talking to one over the fence he would lock me in my room would you let me come there says i would you talk to me if i was to call for i goes on if you said i might come and see you the earls might be belted or suspendered or pinned up with safety pins as far as i am concerned i must not talk to you she says because we have not been introduced it is not exactly proper so i will say good bye mr say the name says i you haven t forgotten it pescud says she a little mad the rest of the name i demands cool as could be john says she john what i says john a says she with her head high are you through now i m coming to see the belted earl to morrow i says he ll feed you to his fox hounds says she laughing if he does it ll improve their running says i i m something of a hunter myself i must be going in now says she i oughtn t to have spoken to you at all i hope you ll have a pleasant trip back to minneapolis or pittsburgh was it good bye good night says i and it wasn t minneapolis what s your name first please she hesitated then she pulled a leaf off a bush and said my name is jessie says she good night miss allyn says i the next morning at eleven sharp i rang the door bell of that world s fair main building after about three quarters of an hour an old nigger man about eighty showed up and asked what i wanted i gave him my business card and said i wanted to see the colonel he showed me in say did you ever crack open a wormy english walnut that s what that house was like there wasn t enough furniture in it to fill an eight dollar flat some old horsehair lounges and three legged chairs and some framed ancestors on the walls were all that met the eye but when colonel allyn comes in the place seemed to light up you could almost hear a band playing and see a bunch of old timers in wigs and white stockings dancing a quadrille it was the style of him although he had on the same shabby clothes i saw him wear at the station for about nine seconds he had me rattled and i came mighty near getting cold feet and trying to sell him some plate glass but i got my nerve back pretty quick he asked me to sit down and i told him everything i told him how i followed his daughter from cincinnati and what i did it for and all about my salary and prospects and explained to him my little code of living to be always decent and right in your home town and when you re on the road never take more than four glasses of beer a day or play higher than a twenty five cent limit at first i thought he was going to throw me out of the window but i kept on talking pretty soon i got a chance to tell him that story about the western congressman who had lost his pocket book and the grass widow you remember that story well that got him to laughing and i ll bet that was the first laugh those ancestors and horsehair sofas had heard in many a day we talked two hours i told him everything i knew and then he began to ask questions and i told him the rest all i asked of him was to give me a chance if i couldn t make a hit with the little lady i d clear out and not bother any more at last he says there was a sir courtenay pescud in the time of charles i if i remember rightly if there was says i he can t claim kin with our bunch we ve always lived in and around pittsburgh i ve got an uncle in the real estate business and one in trouble somewhere out in kansas you can inquire about any of the rest of us from anybody in old smoky town and get satisfactory replies did you ever run across that story about the captain of the whaler who tried to make a sailor say his prayers says i it occurs to me that i have never been so fortunate says the colonel so i told it to him laugh i was wishing to myself that he was a customer what a bill of glass i d sell him and then he says the relating of anecdotes and humorous occurrences has always seemed to me mr pescud to be a particularly agreeable way of promoting and perpetuating amenities between friends with your permission i will relate to you a fox hunting story with which i was personally connected and which may furnish you some amusement so he tells it it takes forty minutes by the watch did i laugh well say when i got my face straight he calls in old pete the super annuated darky and sends him down to the hotel to bring up my valise it was elmcroft for me while i was in the town two evenings later i got a chance to speak a word with miss jessie alone on the porch while the colonel was thinking up another story it s going to be a fine evening says i he s coming says she he s going to tell you this time the story about the old negro and the green watermelons it always comes after the one about the yankees and the game rooster there was another time she goes on that you nearly got left it was at pulaski city yes says i i remember my foot slipped as i was jumping on the step and i nearly tumbled off i know says she and and i i was afraid you had john a i was afraid you had and then she skips into the house through one of the big windows iv coketown droned the porter making his way through the slowing car pescud gathered his hat and baggage with the leisurely promptness of an old traveller i married her a year ago said john i told you i built a house in the east end the belted i mean the colonel is there too i find him waiting at the gate whenever i get back from a trip to hear any new story i might have picked up on the road i glanced out of the window coketown was nothing more than a ragged hillside dotted with a score of black dismal huts propped up against dreary mounds of slag and clinkers it rained in slanting torrents too and the rills foamed and splashed down through the black mud to the railroad tracks you won t sell much plate glass here john said i why do you get off at this end o the world why said pescud the other day i took jessie for a little trip to philadelphia and coming back she thought she saw some petunias in a pot in one of those windows over there just like some she used to raise down in the old virginia home so i thought i d drop off here for the night and see if i could dig up some of the cuttings or blossoms for her here we are good night old man i gave you the address come out and see us when you have time the train moved forward one of the dotted brown ladies insisted on having windows raised now that the rain beat against them the porter came along with his mysterious wand and began to light the car i glanced downward and saw the best seller i picked it up and set it carefully farther along on the floor of the car where the rain drops would not fall upon it and then suddenly i smiled and seemed to see that life has no geographical metes and bounds good luck to you trevelyan i said and may you get the petunias for your princess rus in urbe considering men in relation to money there are three kinds whom i dislike men who have more money than they can spend men who have more money than they do spend and men who spend more money than they have of the three varieties i believe i have the least liking for the first but as a man i liked spencer grenville north pretty well although he had something like two or ten or thirty millions i ve forgotten exactly how many i did not leave town that summer i usually went down to a village on the south shore of long island the place was surrounded by duck farms and the ducks and dogs and whippoorwills and rusty windmills made so much noise that i could sleep as peacefully as if i were in my own flat six doors from the elevated railroad in new york but that summer i did not go remember that one of my friends asked me why i did not i replied because old man new york is the finest summer resort in the world you have heard that phrase before but that is what i told him i was press agent that year for binkly bing the theatrical managers and producers of course you know what a press agent is well he is not that is the secret of being one binkly was touring france in his new c n williamson car and bing had gone to scotland to learn curling which he seemed to associate in his mind with hot tongs rather than with ice before they left they gave me june and july on salary for my vacation which act was in accord with their large spirit of liberality but i remained in new york which i had decided was the finest summer resort in but i said that before on july the th north came to town from his camp in the adirondacks try to imagine a camp with sixteen rooms plumbing eiderdown quilts a butler a garage solid silver plate and a long distance telephone of course it was in the woods if mr pinchot wants to preserve the forests let him give every citizen two or ten or thirty million dollars and the trees will all gather around the summer camps as the birnam woods came to dunsinane and be preserved north came to see me in my three rooms and bath extra charge for light when used extravagantly or all night he slapped me on the back i would rather have my shins kicked any day and greeted me with out door obstreperousness and revolting good spirits he was insolently brown and healthy looking and offensively well dressed just ran down for a few days said he to sign some papers and stuff like that my lawyer wired me to come well you indolent cockney what are you doing in town i took a chance and telephoned and they said you were here what s the matter with that utopia on long island where you used to take your typewriter and your villanous temper every summer anything wrong with the er swans weren t they that used to sing on the farms at night ducks said i the songs of swans are for luckier ears they swim and curve their necks in artificial lakes on the estates of the wealthy to delight the eyes of the favorites of fortune also in central park said north to delight the eyes of immigrants and bummers i ve seen em there lots of times but why are you in the city so late in the summer new york city i began to recite is the finest sum no you don t said north emphatically you don t spring that old one on me i know you know better man you ought to have gone up with us this summer the prestons are there and tom volney and the monroes and lulu stanford and the miss kennedy and her aunt that you liked so well i never liked miss kennedy s aunt i said i didn t say you did said north we are having the greatest time we ve ever had the pickerel and trout are so ravenous that i believe they would swallow your hook with a montana copper mine prospectus fastened on it and we ve a couple of electric launches and i ll tell you what we do every night or two we tow a rowboat behind each one with a big phonograph and a boy to change the discs in em on the water and twenty yards behind you they are not so bad and there are passably good roads through the woods where we go motoring i shipped two cars up there and the pinecliff inn is only three miles away you know the pinecliff some good people are there this season and we run over to the dances twice a week can t you go back with me for a week old man i laughed northy said i if i may be so familiar with a millionaire because i hate both the names spencer and grenville your invitation is meant kindly but the city in the summer time for me here while the bourgeoisie is away i can live as nero lived barring thank heaven the fiddling while the city burns at ninety in the shade the tropics and the zones wait upon me like handmaidens i

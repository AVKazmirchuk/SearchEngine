the old homestead yard once he muttered to himself will the crazy fool try it or did i dream half of it it was when he came opposite the little family burying ground that he saw what he had been looking for a puff of white smoke coming from the thick cedars in one comer he toppled so slowly to the left that coltrane had time to urge his horse to that side and catch him with one arm the squirrel hunter had not overpraised his aim he had sent the bullet where he intended and where goree had expected that it would pass through the breast of colonel abner coltrane s black frock coat goree leaned heavily against coltrane but he did not fall the horses kept pace side by side and the colonel s arm kept him steady the little white houses of laurel shone through the trees half a mile away goree reached out one hand and groped until it rested upon coltrane s fingers which held his bridle good friend he said and that was all thus did yancey goree as be rode past his old home make considering all things the best showing that was in his power the song and the sergeant half a dozen people supping at a table in one of the upper broadway all night restaurants were making too much noise three times the manager walked past them with a politely warning glance but their argument had waxed too warm to be quelled by a manager s gaze it was midnight and the restaurant was filled with patrons from the theatres of that district some among the dispersed audiences must have recognized among the quarrelsome sextet the faces of the players belonging to the carroll comedy company four of

lately has fallen so flat that the piece is about to become a failure we may have been rather noisy and intolerant of interruption by the restaurant people but the matter was of considerable

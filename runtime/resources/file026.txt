logic and the most of his creed mcguire was the seventh invalid whom raidler had picked up thus casually in san antonio where so many thousand go for the ozone that is said to linger about its contracted streets five of them had been guests of solito ranch until they had been able to leave cured or better and exhausting the vocabulary of tearful gratitude one came too late but rested very comfortably at last under a ratama tree in the garden so then it was no surprise to the ranchhold when the buckboard spun to the door and raidler took up his debile protege like a handful of rags and set him down upon the gallery mcguire looked upon things strange to him the ranch house was the best in the country it was built of brick hauled one hundred miles by wagon but it was of but one story and its four rooms were completely encircled by a mud floor gallery the miscellaneous setting of horses dogs saddles wagons guns and cow punchers paraphernalia oppressed the metropolitan eyes of the wrecked sportsman well here we are at home said raidler cheeringly it s a h l of a looking place said mcguire promptly as he rolled upon the gallery floor in a fit of coughing we ll try to make it comfortable for you buddy said the cattleman gently it ain t fine inside but it s the outdoors anyway that ll do you the most good this ll be your room in here anything we got you ask for it he led mcguire into the east room the floor was bare and clean white curtains waved in the gulf breeze through the open windows a big willow rocker two straight chairs a long table covered with newspapers pipes tobacco spurs and cartridges stood in the centre some well mounted heads of deer and one of an enormous black javeli projected from the walls a wide cool cot bed stood in a corner nueces county people regarded this guest chamber as fit for a prince mcguire showed his eyeteeth at it he took out his nickel and spun it up to the ceiling t ought i was lyin about the money did ye well you can frisk me if you wanter dat s the last simoleon in the treasury who s goin to pay the cattleman s clear grey eyes looked steadily from under his grizzly brows into the huckleberry optics of his guest after a little he said simply and not ungraciously i ll be much obliged to you son if you won t mention money any more once was quite a plenty folks i ask to my ranch don t have to pay anything and they very scarcely ever offers it supper ll be ready in half an hour there s water in the pitcher and some cooler to drink in that red jar hanging on the gallery where s the bell asked mcguire looking about bell for what bell to ring for things i can t see here he exploded in a sudden weak fury i never asked you to bring me here i never held you up for a cent i never gave you a hard luck story till you asked me here i am fifty miles from a bellboy or a cocktail i m sick i can t hustle gee but i m up against it mcguire fell upon the cot and sobbed shiveringly raidler went to the door and called a slender bright complexioned mexican youth about twenty came quickly raidler spoke to him in spanish ylario it is in my mind that i promised you the position of vaquero on the san carlos range at the fall rodeo si senor such was your goodness listen this senorito is my friend he is very sick place yourself at his side attend to his wants at all times have much patience and care with him and when he is well or and when he is well instead of vaquero i will make you mayordomo of the rancho de las piedras esta bueno si si mil gracias senor ylario tried to kneel upon the floor in his gratitude but the cattleman kicked at him benevolently growling none of your opery house antics now ten minutes later ylario came from mcguire s room and stood before raidler the little senor he announced presents his compliments raidler credited ylario with the preliminary and desires some pounded ice one hot bath one gin feez z that the windows be all closed toast one shave one newyorkheral cigarettes and to send one telegram raidler took a quart bottle of whisky from his medicine cabinet here take him this he said thus was instituted the reign of terror at the solito ranch for a few weeks mcguire blustered and boasted and swaggered before the cow punchers who rode in for miles around to see this latest importation of raidler s he was an absolutely new experience to them he explained to them all the intricate points of sparring and the tricks of training and defence he opened to their minds view all the indecorous life of a tagger after professional sports his jargon of slang was a continuous joy and surprise to them his gestures his strange poses his frank ribaldry of tongue and principle fascinated them he was like a being from a new world strange to say this new world he had entered did not exist to him he was an utter egoist of bricks and mortar he had dropped out he felt into open space for a time and all it contained was an audience for his reminiscences neither the limitless freedom of the prairie days nor the grand hush of the close drawn spangled nights touched him all the hues of aurora could not win him from the pink pages of a sporting journal get something for nothing was his mission in life thirty seventh

he always carried in his hip pocket a movement that has preceded the death of at least a dozen men at his hands quick as the motion was the bystanders assert that it was met by the most beautiful exhibition of lightning gun pulling ever witnessed in the southwest as sharp s pistol was being raised and the act was really quicker than the eye could follow a glittering appeared as if by some conjuring trick in the right hand of mr standifer who without a perceptible movement of his arm shot benton sharp through the heart it seems that the new commissioner of insurance statistics and history has been an old time indian fighter and ranger for many years which accounts for the happy knack he has of handling a it is not believed that mr standifer will be put to any inconvenience beyond a necessary formal hearing to day as all the witnesses who were present unite in declaring that the deed was done in self defence when mrs sharp appeared at the office of the commissioner according to appointment she found that gentleman calmly eating a golden russet apple he greeted her without embarrassment and without hesitation at approaching the subject that was the topic of the day i had to do it ma am he said simply or get it myself mr kauffman he added turning to the old clerk please look up the records of the security life insurance company and see if they are all right no need to look grunted kauffman who had everything in his head it s all o k they pay all losses within ten days mrs sharp soon rose to depart she had arranged to remain in town until the policy was paid the commissioner did not detain her she was a woman and he did not know just what to say to her at present rest and time would bring her what she needed but as she was leaving luke standifer indulged himself in an official remark the department of insurance statistics and history ma am has done the best it could with your case twas a case hard to cover according to red tape statistics failed and history missed fire but if i may be permitted to say it we came out particularly strong on insurance the renaissance at charleroi grandemont charles was a little creole gentleman aged thirty four with a bald spot on the top of his head and the manners of a prince by day he was a clerk in a cotton broker s office in one of those cold rancid mountains of oozy brick down near the levee in new orleans by night in his three story high chambre garnier in the old french quarter he was again the last male descendant of the charles family that noble house that had lorded it in france and had pushed its way smiling rapiered and courtly into louisiana s early and brilliant days of late years the charleses had subsided into the more republican but scarcely less royally carried magnificence and ease of plantation life along the mississippi perhaps grandemont was even marquis de brasse there was that title in the family but a marquis on seventy five dollars per month vraiment still it has been done on less grandemont had saved out of his salary the sum of six hundred dollars enough you would say for any man to marry on so after a silence of two years on that subject he reopened that most hazardous question to mlle adele fauquier riding down to meade d or her father s plantation her answer was the same that it had been any time during the last ten years first find my

had grandemont conned in his mind the scene of victor s disappearance and at each time that adele had set her stubborn but pitiful alternative against his suit still clearer it repeated itself in his brain the boy had been the family favourite daring winning reckless his unwise fancy had been captured by a girl on the plantation the daughter of an overseer victor s family was in ignorance of the intrigue as far as it had gone to save them the inevitable pain that his course promised grandemont strove to prevent it omnipotent money smoothed the way the overseer and his daughter left between a sunset and dawn for an undesignated bourne grandemont was confident that this stroke would bring the boy to reason he rode over to meade d or to talk with him the two strolled out of the house and

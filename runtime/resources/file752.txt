expect by all writers who have evolved romances of literary new york something was decidedly wrong with tradition i could not assume the blame so i fixed it upon the sparrows i began to hate them with intensity and heat at that moment an individual wearing an excess of whiskers two hats and a pestilential air slid into the seat beside me say willie he muttered cajolingly could you cough up a dime out of your coffers for a cup of coffee this morning i m lung weary my friend said i the best i can do is three cents and you look like a gentleman too said he what brung you down boozer birds i said fiercely the brown throated songsters carolling songs of hope and cheer to weary man toiling amid the city s dust and din the little feathered couriers from the meadows and woods chirping sweetly to us of blue skies and flowering fields the confounded little squint eyed nuisances yawping like a flock of steam pianos and stuffing themselves like aldermen with grass seeds and bugs while a man sits on a bench and goes without his breakfast yes sir birds look at them as i spoke i picked up a dead tree branch that lay by the bench and hurled it with all my force into a close congregation of the sparrows on the grass the flock flew to the trees with a babel of shrill cries but two of them remained prostrate upon the turf in a moment my unsavory friend had leaped over the row of benches and secured the fluttering victims which he thrust hurriedly into his pockets then he beckoned me with a dirty forefinger come on cully he said hoarsely you re in on the feed thank you very much weakly i followed my dingy acquaintance he led me away from the park down a side street and through a crack in a fence into a vacant lot where some excavating had been going on behind a pile of old stones and lumber he paused and took out his birds i got matches said he you got any paper to start a fire with i drew forth my manuscript story of the sparrows and offered it for burnt sacrifice there were old planks splinters and chips for our fire my frowsy friend produced from some interior of his frayed clothing half a loaf of bread pepper and salt in ten minutes each of us was holding a sparrow spitted upon a stick over the leaping flames say said my fellow bivouacker this ain t so bad when a fellow s hungry it reminds me of when i struck new york first about fifteen years ago i come in from the west to see if i could get a job on a newspaper i hit the madison square park the first mornin after and was sitting around on the benches i noticed the sparrows chirpin and the grass and trees so nice and green that i thought i was back in the country again then i got some papers out of my pocket and i know i interrupted you sent it to the sun and got say said my friend suspiciously you seem to know a good deal where was you i went to sleep on the bench there in the sun and somebody touched me for every cent i had hearts and hands at denver there was an influx of passengers into the coaches on the eastbound b m express in one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler among the newcomers were two young men one of handsome presence with a bold frank countenance and manner the other a ruffled glum faced person heavily built and roughly dressed the two were handcuffed together as they passed down the aisle of the coach the only vacant seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman here the linked couple seated themselves the young woman s glance fell upon them with a distant swift disinterest then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks she held out a little gray gloved hand when she spoke her voice full sweet and deliberate proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard well mr easton if you will make me speak first i suppose i must don t vou ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the west the younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly and then clasped her fingers with his left hand it s miss fairchild he said with a smile i ll ask you to excuse the other hand it s otherwise engaged just at present he slightly raised his right hand bound at the wrist by the shining bracelet to the left one of his companion the glad look in the girl s eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror the glow faded from her cheeks her lips parted in a vague relaxing distress easton with a little laugh as if amused was about to speak again when the other forestalled him the glum faced man had been watching the girl s countenance with veiled glances from his keen shrewd eyes you ll excuse me for speaking miss but i see you re acquainted with the marshall here if you ll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen he ll do it and it ll make things easier for me there he s taking me to leavenworth prison it s seven years for counterfeiting oh said the girl with a deep breath and returning color so that is what you are doing out here a marshal my dear miss fairchild

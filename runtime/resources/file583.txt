had outstripped all their comrades that day in the pursuit of the mexican raiders and how the boy had gone down upholding the honour of the company the ranger troop herded close and a simultaneous wild yell arose from their lips the outburst was at once a dirge an apology an epitaph and a paean of triumph a strange requiem you may say over the body of a fallen comrade but if jimmy hayes could have heard it he would have understood the door of unrest i sat an hour by sun in the editor s room of the montopolis weekly bugle i was the editor the saffron rays of the declining sunlight filtered through the cornstalks in micajah widdup s garden patch and cast an amber glory upon my paste pot i sat at the editorial desk in my non rotary revolving chair and prepared my editorial against the oligarchies the room with its one window was already a prey to the twilight one by one with my trenchant sentences i lopped off the heads of the political hydra while i listened full of kindly peace to the home coming cow bells and wondered what mrs flanagan was going to have for supper then in from the dusky quiet street there drifted and perched himself upon a corner of my desk old father time s younger brother his face was beardless and as gnarled as an english walnut i never saw clothes such as he wore they would have reduced joseph s coat to a monochrome but the colours were not the dyer s stains and patches and the work of sun and rust were responsible for the diversity on his coarse shoes was the dust conceivably of a thousand leagues i can describe him no further except to say that he was little and weird and old old i began to estimate in centuries when i saw him yes and i remember that there was an odour a faint odour like aloes or possibly like myrrh or leather and i thought of museums and then i reached for a pad and pencil for business is business and visits of the oldest inhabitants are sacred and honourable requiring to be chronicled i am glad to see you sir i said i would offer you a chair but you see sir i went on i have lived in montopolis only three weeks and i have not met many of our citizens i turned a doubtful eye upon his dust stained shoes and concluded with a newspaper phrase i suppose that you reside in our midst my visitor fumbled in his raiment drew forth a soiled card and handed it to me upon it was written in plain but unsteadily formed characters the name michob ader i am glad you called mr ader i said as one of our older citizens you must view with pride the recent growth and enterprise of montopolis among other improvements i think i can promise that the town will now be provided with a live enterprising newspa do ye know the name on that card asked my caller interrupting me it is not a familiar one to me i said again he visited the depths of his ancient vestments this time he brought out a torn leaf of some book or journal brown and flimsy with age the heading of the page was the turkish spy in old style type the printing upon it was this there is a man come to paris in this year who pretends to have lived these sixteen hundred years he says of himself that he was a shoemaker in jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion that his name is michob ader and that when jesus the christian messias was condemned by pontius pilate the roman president he paused to rest while bearing his cross to the place of crucifixion before the door of michob ader the shoemaker struck jesus with his fist saying go why tarriest thou the messias a nswered him i indeed am going but thou shalt tarry until i come thereby condemning him to live until the day of judgment he lives forever but at the end of every hundred years he falls into a fit or trance on recovering from which he finds himself in the same state of youth in which he was when jesus suffered being then about thirty years of age such is the story of the wandering jew as told by michob ader who relates here the printing ended i must have muttered aloud something to myself about the wandering jew for the old man spake up bitterly and loudly tis a lie said he like nine tenths of what ye call history tis a gentile i am and no jew i am after footing it out of jerusalem my son but if that makes me a jew then everything that comes out of a bottle is babies milk ye have my name on the card ye hold and ye have read the bit of paper they call the turkish spy that printed the news when i stepped into their office on the th day of june in the year just as i have called upon ye to day i laid down my pencil and pad clearly it would not do here

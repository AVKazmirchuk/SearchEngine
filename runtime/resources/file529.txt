cope under a bewildering variety of conditions especially when childish sorrows overwhelm them are we put to our wits end we exhaust our paltry store of consolation and then beat them sobbing to sleep then we grovel in the dust of a million years and ask god why thus we call out of the rat trap as for the children no one understands them except old maids hunchbacks and shepherd dogs now comes the facts in the case of the rag doll the tatterdemalion and the twenty fifth of december on the tenth of that month the child of the millionaire lost her rag doll there were many servants in the millionaire s palace on the hudson and these ransacked the house and grounds but without finding the lost treasure the child was a girl of five and one of those perverse little beasts that often wound the sensibilities of wealthy parents by fixing their affections upon some vulgar inexpensive toy instead of upon diamond studded automobiles and pony phaetons the child grieved sorely and truly a thing inexplicable to the millionaire to whom the rag doll market was about as interesting as bay state gas and to the lady the child s mother who was all form that is nearly all as you shall see the child cried inconsolably and grew hollow eyed knock kneed spindling and corykilverty in many other respects the millionaire smiled and tapped his coffers confidently the pick of the output of the french and german toymakers was rushed by special delivery to the mansion but rachel refused to be comforted she was weeping for her rag child and was for a high protective tariff against all foreign foolishness then doctors with the finest bedside manners and stop watches were called in one by one they chattered futilely about peptomanganate of iron and sea voyages and hypophosphites until their stop watches showed that bill rendered was under the wire for show or place then as men they advised that the rag doll be found as soon as possible and restored to its mourning parent the child sniffed at therapeutics chewed a thumb and wailed for her betsy and all this time cablegrams were coming from santa claus saying that he would soon be here and enjoining us to show a true christian spirit and let up on the pool rooms and tontine policies and platoon systems long enough to give him a welcome everywhere the spirit of christmas was diffusing itself the banks were refusing loans the pawn brokers had doubled their gang of helpers people bumped your shins on the streets with red sleds thomas and jeremiah bubbled before you on the bars while you waited on one foot holly wreaths of hospitality were hung in windows of the stores they who had em were getting their furs you hardly knew which was the best bet in balls three high moth or snow it was no time at which to lose the rag doll or your heart if doctor watson s investigating friend had been called in to solve this mysterious disappearance he might have observed on the millionaire s wall a copy of the vampire that would have quickly suggested by induction a rag and a bone and a hank of hair flip a scotch terrier next to the rag doll in the child s heart frisked through the halls the hank of hair aha x the unfound quantity represented the rag doll but the bone well when dogs find bones they done it were an easy and a fruitful task to examine flip s forefeet look watson earth dried earth between the toes of course the dog but sherlock was not there therefore it devolves but topography and architecture must intervene the millionaire s palace occupied a lordly space in front of it was a lawn close mowed as a south ireland man s face two days after a shave at one side of it and fronting on another street was a pleasuance trimmed to a leaf and the garage and stables the scotch pup had ravished the rag doll from the nursery dragged it to a corner of the lawn dug a hole and buried it after the manner of careless undertakers there you have the mystery solved and no checks to write for the hypodermical wizard of fi pun notes to toss to the sergeant then let s get down to the heart of the thing tiresome readers the christmas heart of the thing fuzzy was drunk not riotously or helplessly or loquaciously as you or i might get but decently appropriately and inoffensively as becomes a gentleman down on his luck fuzzy was a soldier of misfortune the road the haystack the park bench the

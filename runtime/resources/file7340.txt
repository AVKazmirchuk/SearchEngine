later his smile became crooked the left side of his mouth slanting upward and quicksand got ready to stand from under at this stage calliope generally began to drink finally about midnight he was seen going homeward saluting those whom he met with exaggerated but inoffensive courtesy not yet was calliope s melancholy at the danger point he would seat himself at the window of the room he occupied over silvester s tonsorial parlours and there chant lugubrious and tuneless ballads until morning accompanying the noises by appropriate maltreatment of a jangling guitar more magnanimous than nero he would thus give musical warning of the forthcoming municipal upheaval that quicksand was scheduled to endure a quiet amiable man was calliope catesby at other times quiet to indolence and amiable to worthlessness at best he was a loafer and a nuisance at worst he was the terror of quicksand his ostensible occupation was something subordinate in the real estate line he drove the beguiled easterner in buckboards out to look over lots and ranch property originally he came from one of the gulf states his lank six feet slurring rhythm of speech and sectional idioms giving evidence of his birthplace and yet after taking on western adjustments this languid pine box whittler cracker barrel hugger shady corner lounger of the cotton fields and sumac hills of the south became famed as a bad man among men who had made a life long study of the art of truculence at nine the next morning calliope was fit inspired by his own barbarous melodies and the contents of his jug he was ready primed to gather fresh laurels from the diffident brow of quicksand encircled and criss crossed with cartridge belts abundantly garnished with revolvers and copiously drunk he poured forth into quicksand s main street too chivalrous to surprise and capture a town by silent sortie he paused at the nearest corner and emitted his slogan that fearful brassy yell so reminiscent of the steam piano that had gained for him the classic appellation that had superseded his own baptismal name following close upon his vociferation came three shots from his forty five by way of limbering up the guns and testing his aim a yellow dog the personal property of colonel swazey the proprietor of the occidental fell feet upward in the dust with one farewell yelp a mexican who was crossing the street from the blue front grocery carrying in his hand a bottle of kerosene was stimulated to a sudden and admirable burst of speed still grasping the neck of the shattered bottle the new gilt weather cock on judge riley s lemon and ultramarine two story residence shivered flapped and hung by a splinter the sport of the wanton breezes the artillery was in trim calliope s hand was steady the high calm ecstasy of habitual battle was upon him though slightly embittered by the sadness of alexander in that his conquests were limited to the small world of quicksand down the street went calliope shooting right and left glass fell like hail dogs vamosed chickens flew squawking feminine voices shrieked concernedly to youngsters at large the din was perforated at intervals by the staccato of the terror s guns and was drowned periodically by the brazen screech that quicksand knew so well the occasions of calliope s low spirits were legal holidays in quicksand all along the main street in advance of his coming clerks were putting up shutters and closing doors business would languish for a space the right of way was calliope s and as he advanced observing the dearth of opposition and the few opportunities for distraction his ennui perceptibly increased but some four squares farther down lively preparations were being made to minister to mr catesby s love for interchange of compliments and repartee on the previous night numerous messengers had hastened to advise buck patterson the city marshal of calliope s impending eruption the patience of that official often strained in extending leniency toward the disturber s misdeeds had been overtaxed in quicksand some indulgence was accorded the natural ebullition of human nature providing that the lives of the more useful citizens were not recklessly squandered or too much property needlessly laid waste the community sentiment was against a too strict enforcement of the law but calliope had raised the limit his outbursts had been too frequent and too violent to come within the classification of a normal and sanitary relaxation of spirit buck patterson had been expecting and awaiting in his little ten by twelve frame office that preliminary yell announcing that calliope was feeling blue when the signal came the city marshal rose to his feet and buckled on his guns two deputy sheriffs and three citizens who had proven the edible qualities of fire also stood up ready to bandy with calliope s leaden jocularities gather that fellow in said buck patterson setting forth the lines of the campaign don t have no talk but shoot as soon as you can get a show keep behind cover and bring him down he s a nogood un it s up to calliope to turn up his toes this time i reckon go to him all spraddled out boys and don t git too reckless for what calliope shoots at he hits buck patterson tall muscular and solemn faced with his bright city marshal badge shining on the breast of his blue flannel shirt gave his posse directions for the onslaught upon calliope the plan was to accomplish the downfall of the quicksand terror without loss to the attacking party if possible the splenetic calliope unconscious of retributive plots was steaming down the channel cannonading on either side when he suddenly became aware of breakers ahead the city marshal and one of the deputies rose up behind some dry goods boxes half a square to the front and opened fire at the same time the rest of the posse divided shelled him from two side streets up which they were cautiously manoeuvring from a well executed detour the first volley broke the lock of one of calliope s guns cut a neat underbit in his right ear and exploded a cartridge in his crossbelt scorching his ribs as it burst feeling braced up by this unexpected tonic to his spiritual depression calliope executed a fortissimo note from his upper register and returned the fire like an echo the upholders of the law dodged at his flash but a trifle too late to save one of the deputies a bullet just above the elbow and the marshal a bleeding cheek from a splinter that a ball tore from the box he had ducked behind and now calliope met the enemy s tactics in kind choosing with a rapid eye the street from which the weakest and least accurate fire had come he invaded it at a double quick abandoning the unprotected middle of the street with rare cunning the opposing force in that direction one of the deputies and two of the valorous volunteers waited concealed by beer barrels until calliope had passed their retreat and then peppered him from the rear in another moment they were reinforced by the marshal and his other men and then calliope felt that in order to successfully prolong the delights of the controversy he must find some means of reducing the great odds against him his eye fell upon a structure that seemed to hold out this promise providing he could reach it not far away was the little railroad station its building a strong box house ten by twenty feet resting upon a platform four feet above ground windows were in each of its walls something like a fort it might become to a man thus sorely pressed by superior numbers calliope made a bold and rapid spurt for it the marshal s crowd smoking him as he ran he reached the haven in safety the station agent leaving the building by a window like a flying squirrel as the garrison entered the door patterson and his supporters halted under protection of a pile of lumber and held consultations in the station was an unterrified desperado who was an excellent shot and carried an abundance of ammunition for thirty yards on either side of the besieged was a stretch of bare open ground it was a sure thing that the man who attempted to enter that unprotected area would be stopped by one of calliope s bullets the city marshal was resolved he had decided that calliope catesby should no more wake the echoes of quicksand with his strident whoop he had so announced officially and personally he felt imperatively bound to put the soft pedal on that instrument of discord it played bad tunes standing near was a hand truck used in the manipulation of small freight it stood by a shed full of sacked wool a consignment from one of the sheep ranches on this truck the marshal and his men piled three heavy sacks of wool stooping low buck patterson started for calliope s fort slowly pushing this loaded truck before him for protection the posse scattering broadly stood ready to nip the besieged in case he should show himself in an effort to repel the juggernaut of justice that was creeping upon him only once did calliope make demonstration he fired from a window and some tufts of wool spurted from the marshal s trustworthy bulwark the return shots from the posse pattered against the window frame of the fort no loss resulted on either side the marshal was too deeply engrossed in steering his protected battleship to be aware of the approach of the morning train until he was within a few feet of the platform the train was coming up on the other side of it it stopped only one minute at quicksand what an opportunity it would offer to calliope he had only to step out the other door mount the train and away abandoning his breastwork buck with his gun ready dashed up the steps and into the room driving upon the closed door with one heave of his weighty shoulder the members of the posse heard one shot fired inside and then there was silence at length the wounded man opened his eyes after a blank space he again could see and hear and feel and think turning his eyes about he found himself lying on a wooden bench a tall man with a perplexed countenance wearing a big badge with city marshal engraved upon it stood over him a little old woman in black with a wrinkled face and sparkling black eyes was holding a wet handkerchief against one of his temples he was trying to get these facts fixed in his mind and connected with past events when the old woman began to talk there now great big strong man that bullet never tetched ye jest skeeted along the side of your head and sort of paralysed ye for a spell i ve heerd of sech things afore cun cussion is

veined and calloused hand and took one of her son s then smiling cheerily down at the prostrate man she continued to dip the handkerchief in the waiting room tin washbasin and gently apply it to his temple she had the benevolent garrulity of old age i ain t seen my son before she continued in eight years one of my nephews elkanah price he s a conductor on one of them railroads and he got me a

help sot you up i think i ll sit up now said the concussion patient i m feeling pretty fair by this time he sat somewhat weakly yet leaning against the wall he was a rugged man big boned and straight his eyes steady and keen seemed to linger upon the face of the man standing so still above him his look wandered often from the face he studied to the marshal s badge upon the other s breast yes yes you ll be all right said the old woman patting his arm if you don t get to cuttin up agin and havin folks shooting at you son told me about you sir while you was layin senseless on the floor don t you

you let me advise you sir not to do so no more be a good man and leave liquor alone and live peaceably and goodly keep away from bad company and work honest and sleep sweet the black mitted hand of the old pleader gently touched the breast of the man she addressed very earnest and candid her old worn face looked in her rusty black dress and antique bonnet she sat near the close of a long life and epitomised the experience of the world still the man to whom she spoke gazed above her head contemplating the silent son of the old mother what does the marshal say he asked does he believe the advice is good suppose the marshal speaks up and says if the talk s all right the tall man moved uneasily he fingered the badge on his breast for a moment and then he put an arm around the old woman and drew her close to him she smiled the unchanging mother smile of three score years and patted his big brown hand with her crooked mittened fingers while her son spake i says this he said looking squarely into the eyes of the other man that if i was in your place i d follow it if i was a drunken desp rate character without shame or hope i d follow it if i was in your place and you was in mine i d say marshal i m willin to swear if you ll give me the chance i ll quit the racket i ll drop the tanglefoot and the gun play and won t play hoss no more i ll be a good citizen and go to work and

place and said that and i was marshal i d say go free and do your best to keep your promise lawsy exclaimed the old woman in a sudden flutter ef i didn t clear forget that trunk of mine i see a man settin it on the platform jest as i seen son s face in the window and it went plum out of my head there s eight jars of home made quince jam in that trunk that i made myself i wouldn t have nothin happen to them jars for a red apple away to the door she trotted spry and anxious and then calliope catesby spoke out to buck patterson i just couldn t help it buck i seen her through the window a comin in she never had heard a word bout my tough ways i didn t have the nerve to let her know i was a worthless cuss bein hunted down by the community there you was lyin where my shot laid you like you was dead the idea struck me sudden and i just took your badge off and fastened it onto myself and i fastened my reputation onto you i told her i was the marshal and you was a holy terror you can take your badge back now buck with shaking fingers calliope began to unfasten the disc of metal from his shirt easy there said buck patterson you keep that badge right where it is calliope catesby don

that nobody won t give the thing away to her and say you leather headed rip roarin low down son of a locoed cyclone you follow that advice she give me i m goin to take some of it myself too buck said calliope feelingly ef i don t i hope i may shut up said buck she s a comin back cabbages and kings the proem by the carpenter they will tell you in anchuria that president miraflores of that volatile republic died by his own hand in the coast town of coralio that he had reached thus far in flight from the inconveniences of an imminent revolution and that one hundred thousand dollars government funds which he carried with him in an american leather valise as a souvenir of his tempestuous administration was never afterward recovered for a real a boy will show you his grave it is back of the town near a little bridge that spans a mangrove swamp a plain slab of wood stands at its head some one has burned upon the headstone with a hot iron this inscription ramon angel de las cruzes y miraflores presidente de la republica de anchuria que sea su juez dios it is characteristic of this buoyant people that they pursue no man beyond the grave let god be his judge even with the hundred thousand unfound though they greatly coveted the hue and cry went no further than that to the stranger or the guest the people of coralio will relate the story of the tragic end of their former president how he strove to escape from the country with the publice funds and also with dona isabel guilbert the young american opera singer and how being apprehended by members of the opposing political party in coralio he shot himself through the head rather than give up the funds and in consequence the senorita guilbert they will relate further that dona isabel her adventurous bark of fortune shoaled by the simultaneous loss of her distinguished admirer and the souvenir hundred thousand dropped anchor on this stagnant coast awaiting a rising tide they say in coralio that she found a prompt and prosperous tide in the form of frank goodwin an american resident of the town an investor who had grown wealthy by dealing in the products of the country a banana king a rubber prince a sarsaparilla indigo and mahogany baron the senorita guilbert you will be told married senor goodwin one month after the president s death thus in the very moment when fortune had ceased to smile wresting from her a gift greater than the prize withdrawn of the american don frank goodwin and of his wife the natives have nothing but good to say don frank has lived among them for years and has compelled their respect his lady is easily queen of what social life the sober coast affords the wife of the governor of the district herself who was of the proud castilian family of monteleon y dolorosa de los santos y mendez feels honored to unfold her napkin with olive hued ringed hands at the table of senora goodwin were you to refer with your northern prejudices to the vivacious past of mrs goodwin when her audacious and gleeful abandon in light opera captured the mature president s fancy or to her share in that statesman s downfall and malfeasance the latin shrug of the shoulder would be your only answer and rebuttal what prejudices there were in coralio concerning senora goodwin seemed now to be in her favor whatever they had been in the past it would seem that the story is ended instead of begun that the close of tragedy and the climax of a romance have covered the ground of interest but to the more curious reader it shall be some slight instruction to trace the close threads that underlie the ingenious web of circumstances the headpiece bearing the name of president miraflores is daily scrubbed with soap bark and sand an old half breed indian tends the grave with fidelity and the dawdling minuteness of inherited sloth he chops down the weeds and ever springing grass with his machete he plucks ants and scorpions and beetles from it with his horny fingers and sprinkles its turf with water from the plaza fountain there is no grave anywhere so well kept and ordered only by following out the underlying threads will it be made clear why the old indian galves is secretly paid to keep green the grave of president miraflores by one who never saw that unfortunate statesman in life or in death and why that one was wont to walk in the twilight casting from a distance looks of gentle sadness upon that unhonored mound elsewhere than at coralio one learns of the impetuous career of isabel guilbert new orleans gave her birth and the mingled french and spanish creole nature that tinctured her life with such turbulence and warmth she had little education but a knowledge of men and motives that seemed to have come by instinct far beyond the common woman was she endowed with intrepid rashness with a love for the pursuit of adventure to the brink of danger and with desire for the pleasures of life her spirit was one to chafe under any curb she was eve after the fall but before the bitterness of it was felt she wore life as a rose in her bosom of the legion of men who had been at her feet it was said that but one was so fortunate as to engage her fancy to president miraflores the brilliant but unstable ruler of anchuria she yielded the key to her resolute heart how then do we find her as the coralians would have told you the wife of frank goodwin and happily living a life of dull and dreamy inaction the underlying threads reach far stretching across the sea following them out it will be made plain why shorty o day of the columbia detective agency resigned his position and for a lighter pastime it shall be a duty and a pleasing sport to wander with momus beneath the tropic stars where melpomene once stalked austere now to cause laughter to echo from those lavish jungles and frowing crags where formerly rang the cries of pirate s victims to lay aside pike and cutlass and attack with quip and jollity to draw one saving titter of mirth from the rusty casque of romance this were pleasant to do in the shade of the lemon trees on that coast that is curved like lips set for smiling for there are yet tales of the spanish main that segment of continent washed by the tempestuous caribbean and presenting to the sea a formidable border of tropicle jungle topped by the overweening cordilleras is still begirt by mystery and romance in past times buccaneers and revolutionists roused the echoes of its cliffs and the condor wheeled perpetually above where in the green groves they made food for him with their matchlocks and toledos taken and retaken by sea rovers by adverse powers and by sudden uprising of rebellious factions the historic miles of adventurous coast has scarcely known for hundreds of years whom rightly to call its master pizarro balboa sir francis drake and bolivar did what they could to make it a part of christendom sir john morgan lafitte and other eminent swashbucklers bombarded and pounded it in the name of abaddon the game still goes on the guns of the rovers are silenced but the tintype man the enlarged photograph brigand the kodaking tourist and the scouts of the gentle brigade of fakirs have found it out and carry on the work the hucksters of germany france and sicily now bag in small change across their counters gentlemen adventurers throng the waiting rooms of its rulers with proposals for railways and concessions the little opera bouffe nations play at government and intrigue until some day a big silent gunboat glides into the offing and warns them not to break their toys and with these changes comes also the small adventurer with empty pockets to fill light of heart busy brained the modern fairy prince bearing an alarm clock with which more surely than by the sentimental kiss to awaken the beautiful tropics from their centuries sleep generally he wears a shamrock which he matches pridefully against the extravagant palms and it is he who had driven melpomene to the wings and set comedy to dancing before the footlights of the southern cross so there is a little tale to tell of many things perhaps to the promiscuous ear of the walrus it shall come with most avail for in it there are indeed shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbage palms and presidents instead of kings add to these a little love and counterplotting and scatter everywhere throughout the maze a trail of tropical dollars dollars warmed no more by the torrid sun than by the hot palms of the scouts of fortune and after all here seems to be life itself with talk enough to weary the most garrulous of walruses i fox in the morning coralio reclined in the mid day heat like some vacuous beauty lounging in a guarded harem the town lay at the sea s edge on a strip of alluvial coast it was set like a little pearl in an emerald band behind it and seeming almost to topple imminent above it rose the sea following range of the cordilleras in front the sea was spread a smiling jailer but even more incorruptible than the frowning mountains the waves swished along the smooth beach the parrots screamed in the orange and ceiba trees the palms waved their limber fronds foolishly like an awkward chorus at the prima donna s cue to enter suddenly the town was full of excitement a native boy dashed down a grass grown street shrieking busca el senor goodwin ha venido un telegrafo por el the word passed quickly telegrams do not come to any one in coralio the cry for senor goodwin was taken up by a dozen officious voices the main street running parallel to the beach became populated with those who desired to expedite the delivery of the dispatch knots of women with complexions varying from palest olive to deepest brown gathered at street corners and plaintively carolled un telegrafo por senor goodwin the comandante don senor el coronel encarnacion rios who was loyal to the ins and suspected goodwin s devotion to the outs hissed aha and wrote in his secret memorandum book the accusive fact that senor goodwin had on that momentous date received a telegram in the midst of the hullabaloo a man stepped to the door of a small wooden building and looked out above the door was a sign that read keogh and clancy a nomenclature that seemed not to be indigenous to that tropical soil the man in the door was billy keogh scout of fortune and progress and latter day rover of the spanish main tintypes and photographs were the weapons with which keogh and clancy were at that time assailing the hopeless shores outside the shop were set two large frames filled with specimens fo their art and skill keogh leaned in the doorway his bold and humorous countenance wearing a look of interest at the unusual influx of life and sound in the street when the meaning of the disturbance became clear to him he placed a hand beside his mouth and shouted hey frank in such a robustious voice that the feeble clamor of the natives was drowned and silenced fifty yards away on the seaward side of the street stood the abode of the consul for the united states out from the door of this building tumbled goodwin at the call he had been smoking with willard geddie the consul on the back porch of the consulate which was conceded to be the coolest spot in coralio hurry up shouted keogh there s a riot in town on account of a telegram that s come for you you want to be careful about these things my boy it won t do to trifle with the feelings of the public this way you ll be getting a pink note some day with violet scent on it and then the country ll be steeped in the throes of a revolution goodwin had strolled up the street and met the boy with the message the ox eyed women gazed at him with shy admiration for his type drew them he was big blond and jauntily dressed in white linen with buckskin zapatos his manner was courtly with a merciful eye when the telegram had been delivered and the bearer of it dismissed with a gratuity the relieved populace returned to the contiguities of shade from which curiosity had drawn it the women to their baking in the mud ovens under the orange trees or to the interminable combing of their long straight hair the men to their cigarettes and gossip in the cantinas goodwin sat on keogh s doorstep and read his telegram it was from bob englehart an american who lived in san mateo the capital city of anchuria eighty miles in the interior englehart was a gold miner an ardent revolutionist and good people that he was a man of resource and imagination was proven by the telegram he had sent it had had been his task to send a confidential message to his friend in coralio this could not have been accomplished in either spanish or english for the eye politic in anchuria was an active one but englehart was a diplomatist there existed but one code upon which he might make requisition with promise of safety the great and potent code of slang so here is the message that slipped unconstrued through the fingers of curious officials and came to the eye of goodwin his nibs skedaddled yesterday per jack rabbit line with all the coin in the kitty and the bundle of muslin he s spoony about the boodle is six figures short our crowd in good shape but we need the spondulicks you collar it the main guy and the dry goods are headed for the briny you to know what to do bob this screed remarkable as it was had no mystery for goodwin he was the most successful of the small advance guard of speculative americans that had invaded anchuria and he had not reached that enviable pinnacle without having well exercised the arts of foresight and deduction he had taken up political intrigue as a matter of business he was acute enough to wield a certain influence among the leading schemers and he was prosperous enough to be able to purchase the respect of the petty officeholders there was always a revolutionary party and to it he had allied himself for the adherents of a new administration received the rewards of their labors there was now a liberal party seeking to overturn president miraflores if the wheel successfully revolved goodwin stood to win a concession to manzanas of the finest coffee lands in the interior certain incidents in the recent career of president miraflores had excited a shrewd suspicion in goodwin s mind that the government was near a dissolution from another cause than that of a revolution and now englehart s telegram had come as a corroboration of his wisdom the telegram which had remained unintelligible to the anchurian linguists who had applied to it in vain their knowledge of spanish and elemental english conveyed a stimulating piece of news to goodwin s understanding it informed him that the president of the republic had decamped from the capital city with the contents of the treasury furthermore that he was accompanied in his flight by that winning adventuress isabel guilbert the opera singer whose troupe of performers had been entertained by the president at san mateo during the past month on a scale less modest than that with which royal visitors are often content the reference to the jackrabbit line could mean nothing else than the mule back system of transport that prevailed between coralio and the capital the hint that the boodle was six figures short made the condition of the national treasury lamentably clear also it was convincingly true that the ingoing party its way now made a pacific one would need the spondulicks unless its pledges should be fulfilled and the spoils held for the delectation of the victors precarious indeed would be the position of the new government therefore it was exceeding necessary to collar the main guy and recapture the sinews of war and government goodwin handed the message to keogh read that billy he said it s from bob englehart can you manage the cipher keogh sat in the other half of the doorway and carefully perused the telegram tis not a cipher he said finally tis what they call literature and that s a system of language put in the mouths of people that they ve never been introduced to by writers of imagination the magazines invented it but i never knew before that president norvin green had stamped it with the seal of his approval tis now no longer literature but language the dictionaries tried but they couldn t make it go for anything but dialect sure now that the western union indorses it it won t be long till a race of people will spring up that speaks it you re running too much to philology billy said goodwin do you make out the meaning of it sure replied the philosopher of fortune all languages come easy to the man who must know em i ve even failed to misunderstand an order to evacuate in classical chinese when it was backed up by the muzzle of a breech loader this little literary essay i hold in my hands means a game of fox in the morning ever play that frank when you was a kid i think so said goodwin laughing you join hands all round and you do not interrupted keogh you ve got a fine sporting game mixed up in your head with all around the rosebush the spirit of fox in the morning is opposed to the holding of hands i ll tell you how it s played this president man and his companion in play they stand up over in san mateo ready for the run and shout fox in the morning me and you standing here we say goose and gander they say how many miles is it to london town we say only a few if your legs are long enough how many comes out they say more than you re able to catch and then the game commences i catch the idea said goodwin it won t do to let the goose and gander slip through your fingers billy their feathers are too valuable our crowd is prepared and able to step into the shoes of the government at once but with the treasury empty we d stay in power about as long as a tenderfoot would stick on an untamed bronco we must play the fox on every foot of the coast to prevent their getting out of the country by the mule back schedule said keogh it s five days down from san mateo we ve got plenty of time to set our outposts there s only three places on the coast where they can hope to sail from here and solitas and alazan they re the only points we ll have to guard it s as easy as a chess problem fox to play and mate in three moves oh goosey goosey gander whither do you wander by the blessing of the literary telegraph the boodle of this benighted fatherland shall be preserved to the honest political party that is seeking to overthrow it the situation had been justly outlined by keogh the down trail from the capital was at all times a weary road to travel a jiggety joggety journey it was ice cold and hot wet and dry the trail climbed appalling mountains wound like a rotten string about the brows of breathless precipices plunged through chilling snow fed streams and wriggled like a snake through sunless forests teeming with menacing insect and animal life after descending to the foothills it turned to a trident the central prong ending at alazan another branched off to coralio the third penetrated to solitas between the sea and the foothills stretched the five miles breadth of alluvial coast here was the flora ofthe tropics in its rankest and most prodigal growth spaces here and there had been wrested from the jungle and planted with bananas and cane and orange groves the rest was a riot of wild vegetation the home of monkeys tapirs jaguars alligators and prodigious reptiles and insects where no road was cut a serpent could scarcely make its way through the tangle of vines and creepers across the treacherous mangrove swamps few things without wings could safely pass therefore the fugitives could hope to reach the coast only by one of the routes named keep the matter quiet billy advised goodwin we don t want the ins to know that the president is in flight i suppose bob s information is something of a scoop in the capital as yet otherwise he would not have tried to make his message a confidential one and besides everybody would have heard the news i m going around now to see dr zavalla and start a man up the trail to cut the telegraph wire as goodwin rose keogh threw his hat upon the grass by the door and expelled a tremendous sigh what s the trouble billy asked goodwin pausing that s the first time i heard you sigh tis the last said keogh with that sorrowful puff of wind i resign myself to a life of praiseworthy but harassing honesty what are tintypes if you please to the opportunities of the great and hilarious class of ganders and geese not that i would be a president frank and the boodle he s got is too big for me to handle but in some ways i feel my conscience hurting me for addicting myself to photographing a nation instead of running away with it frank did you ever see the bundle of muslin that his excellency has wrapped up and carried off isabel guilbert said goodwin laughing no i never did from what i ve heard of her though i imagine that she wouldn t stick at anything to carry her point don t get romantic billy sometimes i begin to fear that there s irish blood in your ancestry i never saw her either went on keogh but they say she s got all the ladies of mythology sculpture and fiction reduced to chromos they say she can look at a man once and he ll turn monkey and climb trees to pick coconuts for her think of that president man with lord know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars in one hand and this muslin siren in the other galloping down the hill on a sympathetic mule amid songbirds and flowers and here is billy keogh because he is virtuous condemned to the unprofitable swindle of slandering the faces of missing links on tin for an honest living tis an injustice of nature cheer up said goodwin you are a pretty poor fox to be envying a gander maybe the enchanting guilbert will take a fancy to you and your tintypes after we impoverish her royal escort she could do worse reflected keogh but she won t tis not a tintype gallery but a gallery of the gods that she s fitted to adorn she s a very wicked lady and the president man is in luck but i hear clancy swearing in the back room for having to do all the work and keogh plunged for the rear of the gallery whistling gaily in a spontaneous way that belied his recent sigh over the questionable good luck of the flying president goodwin turned from the main street into a much narrower one that intersected it at a right angle these side streets were covered by a growth of thick rank grass which was kept to a navigable shortness by the machetes of the police stone sidewalks little more than a ledge in width ran along the base of the mean and monotonous adobe houses at the outskirts of the village these streets dwindled to nothing and here were set the palm thatched huts of the caribs and the poorer natives and the shabby cabins of negroes from jamaica and the west india islands a few structures raised their heads above the red tiled roofs of the one story houses the bell tower of the calaboza the hotel de los extranjeros the residence of the vesuvius fruit company s agent the store and residence of bernard brannigan a ruined cathedral in which columbus had once set foot and most imposing of all the casa morena the summer white house of the president of anchuria on the principal street running along the beach the broadway of coralio were the larger stores the government bodega and post office the cuartel the rum shops and the market place on his way goodwin passed the house of bernard brannigan it was a modern wooden building two stories in height the ground floor was occupied by brannigan s store the upper one contained the living apartments a wide cool porch ran around the house half way up its outer walls a handsome vivacious girl neatly dressed in flowing white leaned over the railing and smiled down upon goodwin she was no darker than many an andalusian of high descent and she sparkled and glowed like a tropical moonlight good evening miss paula said goodwin taking off his hat with his ready smile there was little difference in his manner whether he addressed women or men everybody in coralio liked to receive the salutation of the big american is there any news mr goodwin please don t say no isn t it warm i feel just like mariana in her moated grange or was it a range it s hot enough no there s no news to tell i believe said goodwin with a mischievous look in his eye except that old geddie is getting grumpier and crosser every day if something doesn t happen to relieve his mind i ll have to quit smoking on his back porch and there s no other place available that is cool enough he isn t grumpy said paula brannigan impulsively when he but she ceased suddenly and drew back with a deepening color for her mother had been a mestizo lady and the spanish blood had brought to paula a certain shyness that was an adornment to the other half of her demonstrative nature ii the lotus and the bottle willard greddie consul for the united states in coralio was working leisurely on his yearly report goodwin who had strolled in as he did daily for a smoke on the much coveted porch had found him so absorbed in his work that he departed after roundly abusing the consul for his lack of hospitality i shall complain to the civil service department said goodwin or is it a department perhaps it s only a theory one gets neither civility nor service from you you won t talk and you won t set out anything to drink what kind of a way is that of representing your government goodwin strolled out and across to the hotel to see if he could bully the quarantine doctor into a game on coralio s solitary billiard table his plans were completed for the interception of the fugitives from the capital and now it was but a waiting game that he had to play the consul was interested in his report he was only twenty four and he had not been in coralio long enough for his enthusiasm to cool in the heat of the tropics a paradox that may be allowed between cancer and capricorn so many thousand bunches of bananas so mnay thousand oranges and coconuts so many ounces of gold dust pounds of rubber coffee indigo and sarparilla actually exports were twenty per cent greater than for the previous year a little thrill of satisfaction ran through the consul perhaps he thought the state department upon reading his introduction would notice and then he leaned back in his chair and laughed he was getting as bad as the others for the moment he had forgotten that coralio was an insignificant republic lying along the by ways of a second rate sea he thought of gregg the quarantine doctor who subscribed for the london lancet expecting to find it quoting his reports to the home board of health concerning the yellow fever germ the consul knew that not one in fifty of his acquaintances in the states had ever heard of coralio he knew that two men at any rate would have to read his report some underling in the state department and a compositor in the public printing office perhaps the typesticker would note the increase of commerce in coralio and speak of it over the cheese and beer to a friend he had just written most unaccountable is the supineness of the large exporters in the united states in permitting the french and german houses to practically control the trade interests of this rich and productive country when he heard the hoarse notes of a steamer s siren geddie laid down his pen and gathered his panama hat and umbrella by the sound he knew it to be the valhalla one of the line of fruit vessels plying for the vesuvius company down to ninos of five years every one in coralio could name you each incoming steamer by the note of her siren the consul sauntered by a roundabout shaded way to the beach by reason of long practice he gauged his stroll so accurately that by the time he arrived on the sandy shore the boat of the customs officials was rowing back from the steamer which had been boarded and inspected according to the laws of anchuria there is no harbor at coralio vessels of the draught of the valhalla must ride at anchor a mile from shore when they take on fruit it is conveyed on lighters and freighter sloops at solitas where there was a fine harbor ships of many kinds were to be seen but in the roadstead off coralio scarcely any save the fruiters paused now and then a tramp coaster or a mysterious brig from spain and then a tramp coaster or a mysterious brig from spain or a saucy french barque would hang innocently for a few days in the offing then the custom house crew would become doubly vigilant and wary at night a sloop or two would be making strange trips in and out along the shore and in the morning the stock of three star hennessey wines and drygoods in coralio would be found vastly increased it has also been said that the customs officials jingled more silver in the pockets of their red striped trousers and that the record books showed no increase in import duties received the custom s boat and the valhalla gig reached the shore at the same time when they grounded in the shallow water there was still five yards of rolling surf between them and dry sand then half clothed caribs dashed into the water and brought in on their backs the valhalla s purser and the little native officials in their cotton undershirts blue trousers with red stripes and flapping straw hats at college geddie had been a treasure as a first baseman he now closed his umbrella stuck it upright in the sand and stooped with his hands resting upon his knees the purser burlesquing the pitcher s contortions hurled at the consul the heavy roll of newspapers tied with a string that the steamer always brought for him geddie leaped high and caught the roll with a sounding thwack the loungers on the beach about a third of the population of the town laughed and applauded delightedly every week they expected to see that roll of papers delivered and received in that same manner and they were never disappointed innovations did not flourish in coralio the consul re hoisted his umbrella and walked back to the consulate this home of a great nation s representative was a wooden structure of two rooms with a native built gallery of poles bamboo and nipa palm running on three sides of it one room was the official apartment furnished chastely with a flat top desk a hammock and three uncomfortable cane seated chairs engravings of the first and latest president of the country represented hung against the wall the other room was the consul s living apartment it was eleven o clock when he returned from the beach and therefore breakfast time chanca the carib woman who cooked for him was just serving the meal on the side of the gallery facing the sea a spot famous as the coolest in coralio the breakfast consisted of shark s fin soup stew of land crabs breadfruit a boiled iguana steak aquacates a freshly cut pineapple claret and coffee geddie took his seat and unrolled with luxurious laziness his bundle of newspapers here in coralio for two days or longer he would read the goings on in the world very much as we of the world read those whimsical contributions to inexact science that assume to portray the doings of the martians after he had finished with the papers they would be sent on the rounds of the other english speaking residents of the town the paper that came first to his hand was one of those bulky mattresses of printed stuff upon which the readers of certain new york journals are supposed to take their sabbath literary nap opening this the consul rested it upon the table supporting its weight with the aid of the back of a chair then he partook of his meal deliberately turning the leaves from time to time and glancing half idly at the contents presently he was struck by something familiar to him in a picture a half page badly printed reproduction of a photograph of a vessel languidly interested he leaned for a nearer scrutiny and a view of the florid headlines of the column next to the picture yes he was not mistaken the engraving was of the eight hundred ton yacht idalia belonging to that prince of good fellows midas of the money market and society s pink of perfection j ward tolliver slowly sipping his black coffee geddie read the column of print following a listed statement of mr tolliver s real estate and bonds came a description of the yacht s furnishings and then the grain of news no bigger than a mustard seed mr tolliver with a party of favored guests would sail the next day on a six weeks cruise along the central american and south american coasts and among the bahama islands among the guests were mrs cumberland payne and miss ida payne of norfolk the writer with the fatuous presumption that was demanded of him by his readers had concocted a romance suited to their palates he bracketed the names of miss payne and mr tolliver until he had well nigh read the marriage ceremony over them he played coyly and insinuatingly upon the strings of on dit and madame rumor and a little bird and no one would be surprised and ended with congratulations geddie having finished his breakfast took his papers to the edge of the gallery and sat there in his favorite steamer chair with his feet on the bamboo railing he lighted a cigar and looked out upon the sea he felt a glow of satisfaction at finding he was so little disturbed by what he had read he told himself that he had conquered the distress that had sent him a voluntary exile to this far land of the lotus he could never forget ida of course but there was no longer any pain in thinking about her when they had had that misunderstanding and quarrel he had impulsively sought this consulship with the desire to retaliate upon her by detaching himself from her world and presence he had succeeded thoroughly in that during the twelve months of his life in coralio no word had passed between them though he had sometimes heard of her through the dilatory correspondence with the few friends to whom he still wrote still he could not repress a little thrill of satisfaction at knowing that she had not yet married tolliver or any one else but evidently tolliver had not yet abandoned hope well it made no difference to him now he had eaten of the lotus he was happy and content in this land of perpetual afternoon those old days of life in the states seemed like an irritating dream he hoped ida would be as happy as he was the climate as balmy as that of distant avalon the fetterless idyllic round of enchanted days the life among this indolent romantic people a life full of music flowers and low laughter the influence of the imminent sea and mountains and the many shapes of love and magic and beauty that bloomed in the white tropic nights with all he was more than content also there was paula brannigan geddie intended to marry paula if of course she would consent but he felt rather sure that she would do that somehow he kept postponing his proposal several times he had been quite near to it but a mysterious something always held him back perhaps it was only the unconscious instinctive conviction that the act would sever the last tie that bound him to his old world he could be very happy with paula few of the native girls could be compared with her she had attended a convent school in new orleans for two years and when she chose to display her accomplishments no one could detect any difference between her and the girls of norfolk and manhattan but it was delicious to see her at home dressed as she sometimes was in the native costume with bare shoulders and flowing sleeves bernard brannigan was the great merchant of coralio besides his store he maintained a train of pack mules and carried on a lively trade with the interior towns and villages he had married a native lady of high castilian descent but with a tinge of indian brown showing through her olive cheek the union of the irish and the spanish had produced as it so often has an offshoot of rare beauty and variety they were very excellent people indeed and the upper story of the house was ready to be placed at the service of geddie and paula as soon as he should make up his mind to speak about it by the time two hours were whiled away the consul tired of reading the papers lay scattered about him on the gallery reclining there he gazed dreamily out upon an eden a clump of banana plants interposed their broad shields between him and the sun the gentle slope from the consulate to the sea was covered with the dark green foliage of lemon trees and orange trees just bursting into bloom a lagoon pierced the land like a dark jagged crystal and above it a pale ceiba tree rose almost to the clouds the waving coconut palms on the beach flared their decorative green leaves against the slate of an almost quiescent sea his senses were cognizant of brilliant scarlet and ochres and the vert of the coppice of odors of fruit and bloom and the smoke from chanca s clay oven under the calabash tree of the treble laughter of the native women in their huts the song of the robin the salt taste of the breeze the diminuendo of the faint surf running along the shore and gradually of a white speck growing to a blur that intruded itself upon the drab prospect of the sea lazily interested he watched this blur increase until it became the idalia steaming at full speed coming down the coast without changing his position he kept his eyes upon the beautiful white yacht as she drew swiftly near and came opposite to coralio then sitting upright he saw her float steadily past and on he had seen the frequent splash of her polished brass work and the stripes of her deck awnings so much and no more like

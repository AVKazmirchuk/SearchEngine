result of their own presumption and haughtiness but what hurts me more than all says sir percival is the desecration that has been done to this splendid rindslosh the confiscation of its halberdier to serve menially at the banquet board even i could see that this stuff was piffle but it caught the boss mein gott says he you vas right ein halberdier have not got der right to dish up soup him i vill not discharge have anoder waiter if you like und let mein halberdier go back und stand mit his halberd but gentlemen he says pointing to the old man you go ahead and sue mit der dress sue me for or i stand der suit and the boss puffs off down stairs old brockmann was an all right dutchman just then the clock strikes twelve and the old guy laughs loud you win deering says he and let me explain to all he goes on some time ago mr deering asked me for something that i did not want to give him i looks at the girl and she turns as red as a pickled beet i told him says the old guy if he would earn his own living for three months without being discharged for incompetence i would give him what he wanted it seems that the time was up at twelve o clock to night i came near fetching you though deering on that soup question says the old boy standing up and grabbing sir percival s hand the halberdier lets out a yell and jumps three feet high look out for those hands says he and he holds em up you never saw such hands except on a labourer in a limestone quarry heavens boy says old side whiskers what have you been doing to em oh says sir percival little chores like hauling coal and excavating rock till they went back on me and when i couldn t hold a pick or a whip i took up halberdiering to give em a rest tureens full of hot soup don t seem to be a particularly soothing treatment i would have bet on that girl that high tempered kind always go as far the other way according to my experience she whizzes round the table like a cyclone and catches both his hands in hers poor hands dear hands she sings out and sheds tears on em and holds em close to her bosom well sir with all that rindslosh scenery it was just like a play and the halberdier sits down at the table at the girl s side and i served the rest of the supper and that was about all except that when they left he shed his hardware store and went with em i dislike to be side tracked from an original proposition but you haven t told me eighteen said i how the cigar case came to be broken oh that was last night said eighteen sir percival and the girl drove up in a cream coloured motor car and had dinner in the rindslosh the same table billy i heard her say as they went up i waited on em we ve got a new halberdier now a bow legged guy with a face like a sheep as they came down stairs sir percival passes him a ten case note the new halberdier drops his halberd and it falls on the cigar case that s how that happened two renegades in the gate city of the south the confederate veterans were reuniting and i stood to see them march beneath the tangled flags of the great conflict to the hall of their oratory and commemoration while the irregular and halting line was passing i made onslaught upon it and dragged from the ranks my friend barnard o keefe who had no right to be there for he was a northerner born and bred and what should he be doing halloing for the stars and bars among those gray and moribund veterans and why should he be trudging with his shining martial humorous broad face among those warriors of a previous and alien generation i say i dragged him forth and held him till the last hickory leg and waving goatee had stumbled past and then i hustled him out of the crowd into a cool interior for the gate city was stirred that day and the hand organs wisely eliminated marching through georgia from their repertories now what deviltry are you up to i asked of o keefe when there were a table and things in glasses between us o keefe wiped his heated face and instigated a commotion among the floating ice in his glass before he chose to answer i am assisting at the wake said he of the only nation on earth that ever did me a good turn as one gentleman to another i am ratifying and celebrating the foreign policy of the late jefferson davis as fine a statesman as ever settled the financial question of a country equal ratio that was his platform a barrel of money for a barrel of flour a pair of bills for a pair of boots a hatful of currency for a new hat say ain t that simple compared with w j b s little old oxidized plank what talk is this i asked your financial digression is merely a subterfuge why were you marching in the ranks of the confederate veterans because my lad answered o keefe the confederate government in its might and power interposed to protect and defend barnard o keefe against immediate and dangerous assassination at the hands of a blood thirsty foreign country after the unites states of america had overruled his appeal for protection and had instructed private secretary cortelyou to reduce his estimate of the republican majority for by one vote come barney said i the confederate states of america has been out of existence nearly forty

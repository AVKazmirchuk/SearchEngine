house was uninhabited he said and bare of furniture but it contained a great fireplace and they had discovered an ample store of chopped wood in a lean to at the rear housing and warmth against the shivering night were thus assured for the placation of bildad rose there was news of a stable not ruined beyond service with hay in a loft near the house gentlemen cried bildad rose from his seat swathed in coats and robes tear me down two panels of that fence so i can drive in that is old man redruth s shanty i thought we must be nigh it they took him to the foolish house in august cheerfully the four passengers sprang at the snow capped rails the exhorted team tugged the coach up the slant to the door of the edifice from which a mid summer madness had ravished its proprietor the driver and two of the passengers began to unhitch judge menefee opened the door of the coach and removed his hat i have to announce miss garland said he the enforced suspension of our journey the driver asserts that the risk in travelling the mountain road by night is too great even to consider it will be necessary to remain in the shelter of this house until morning i beg that you will feel that there is nothing to fear beyond a temporary inconvenience i have personally inspected the house and find that there are means to provide against the rigour of the weather at least you shall be made as comfortable as possible permit me to assist you to alight to the judge s side came the passenger whose pursuit in life was the placing of the little goliath windmill his name was dunwoody but that matters not much in travelling merely from paradise to sunrise city one needs little or no name still one who would seek to divide honours with judge madison l menefee deserves a cognomenal peg upon which fame may hang a wreath thus spake loudly and buoyantly the aerial miller guess you ll have to climb out of the ark mrs mcfarland this wigwam isn t exactly the palmer house but it turns snow and they won t search your grip for souvenir spoons when you leave we ve got a fire going and we ll fix you up with dry tilbys and keep the mice away anyhow all right all right one of the two passengers who were struggling in a melee of horses harness snow and the sarcastic injunctions of bildad rose called loudly from the whirl of his volunteer duties say some of you fellows get miss solomon into the house will you whoa there you confounded brute again must it be gently urged that in travelling from paradise to sunrise city an accurate name is prodigality when judge menefee sanctioned to the act by his grey hair and widespread repute had introduced himself to the lady passenger she had herself sweetly breathed a name in response that the hearing of the male passengers had variously interpreted in the not unjealous spirit of rivalry that eventuated each clung stubbornly to his own theory for the lady passenger to have reasseverated or corrected would have seemed didactic if not unduly solicitous of a specific acquaintance therefore the lady passenger permitted herself to be garlanded and mcfarlanded and solomoned with equal and discreet complacency it is thirty five miles from paradise to sunrise city compagnon de voyage is name enough by the gripsack of the wandering jew for so brief a journey soon the little party of wayfarers were happily seated in a cheerful arc

blown through the air by a storm but the floral kingdom was not responsible for that swirl of petalous whiteness you saw the filmy brief skirt of miss rosalie ray as she made a complete heels over head turn in her wistaria entwined swing far out from the stage high above the heads of the audience you saw the cam era s inadequate representation of the graceful strong kick with which she at this exciting moment sent flying high and far the yellow silk garter that each evening spun from her agile limb and descended upon the delighted audience below you saw too amid the black clothed mainly mas culine patrons of select vaudeville a hundred hands raised with the hope of staying the flight of the bril liant aerial token forty weeks of the best circuits this act had brought miss rosalie ray for each of two years she did other things during her twelve minutes a song and dance imitations of two or three actors who are but imitations of themselves and a balancing feat with a step ladder and feather duster but when the blossom decked swing was let down from the flies and miss rosalie sprang smiling into the seat with the golden circlet conspicuous in the place whence it was soon to slide and become a soaring and coveted guerdon then it was that the audience rose in its seat as a single man or presumably so and in dorsed the specialty that made miss ray s name a favorite in the booking offices at the end of the two years miss ray suddenly an nounced to her dear friend miss d armande that she was going to spend the summer at an antediluvian village on the north shore of long island and that the stage would see her no more seventeen minutes after miss lynnette d armande had expressed her wish to know the whereabouts of her old chum there were sharp raps at her door doubt not that it was rosalie ray at the shrill command to enter she did so with something of a tired flutter and dropped a heavy hand bag on the floor upon my word it was rosalie in a loose travel stained automobileless coat closely tied brown veil with yard long flying ends gray walking suit and tan oxfords with lavender overgaiters when she threw off her veil and hat you saw a pretty enough face now flushed and disturbed by some unusual emotion and restless large eyes with discontent marring their brightness a heavy pile of dull auburn hair hastily put up was escaping in crinkly waving strands and curling small locks from the confining combs and pins the meeting of the two was not marked by the effusion vocal gymnastical osculatory and catecheti cal that distinguishes the greetings of their unpro fessional sisters in society there was a brief clinch two simultaneous labial dabs and they stood on the same footing of the old days very much like the short salutations of soldiers or of travellers in for eign wilds are the welcomes between the strollers at the corners of their crisscross roads i ve got the hall room two flights up above yours said rosalie but i came straight to see you before going up i didn t know you were here till they told me i ve been in since the last of april said lyn nette and i m going on the road with a fatal inheritance company we open next week in eliz abeth i thought you d quit the stage lee tell me about yourself rosalie settled herself with a skilful wriggle on the top of miss d armande s wardrobe trunk and leaned her head against the papered wall from long habit thus can peripatetic leading ladies and their sisters make themselves as comfort able as though the deepest armchairs embraced them i m going to tell you lynn she said with a strangely sardonic and yet carelessly resigned look on her youthful face and then to morrow i ll strike the old broadway trail again and wear some more paint off the chairs in the agents offices if anybody had told me any time in the last three months up to four o clock this afternoon that i d ever listen to that leave your name and address rot of the booking bunch again i d have given em the real mrs fiske laugh loan me a handkerchief lynn gee but those long island trains are fierce i ve got enough soft coal cinders on my face to go on and play topsy without using the cork and speaking of corks got anything to drink lynn miss d armande opened a door of the wash stand and took out a bottle there s nearly a pint of manhattan there s a cluster of carnations in the drinking glass but oh pass the bottle save the glass for com pany thanks that hits the spot the same to you my first drink in three months yes lynn i quit the stage at the end of last season i quit it because i was sick of the life and especially because my heart and soul were sick of men of the kind of men we stage people have to be up against you know what the game is to us it s a fight against em all the way down the line from the manager who wants us to try his new motor car to the bill posters who want to call us by our front names and the men we have to meet after the show are the worst of all the stage door kind and the man ager s friends who take us to supper and show their diamonds and talk about seeing dan and dave and charlie for us they re beasts and i hate em i tell you lynn it s the girls like us on the

into his crisp brown hair that would never do how would it work to see the same ghost again minus the overalls and have gold bricks in the hod that would elevate the spectre from degrading toil to a financial plane don t you think that would be respectable enough there was an ancestor who fought against the britishers wasn t there your mother said something to that effect i believe so one of those old chaps in raglan vests and golf trousers i don t care a continental for a continental myself but the mother has set her heart on pomp and heraldry and pyrotechnics and i want her to be happy you are a good boy terence said mrs bellmore sweeping her silks close to one side of her not to beat your mother sit here by me and let s look at the album just as people used to do twenty years ago now tell me about every one of them who is this tall dignified gentleman leaning against the horizon with one arm on the corinthian column that old chap with the big feet inquired terence craning his neck that s great uncle o brannigan he used to keep a rathskeller on the bowery i asked you to sit down terence if you are not going to amuse or obey me i shall report in the morning that i saw a ghost wearing an apron and carrying schooners of beer now that is better to be shy at your age terence is a thing that you should blush to acknowledge at breakfast on the last morning of her visit mrs bellmore startled and entranced every one present by announcing positively that she had seen the ghost did it have a a a mrs kinsolving in her suspense and agitation could not bring out the word no indeed far from it there was a chorus of questions from others at the table were n t you frightened what did it do how did it look how was it dressed did it say anything didn t you scream i ll try to answer everything at once said mrs bellmore heroically although i m frightfully hungry something awakened me i m not sure whether it was a noise or a touch and there stood the phantom i never burn a light at night so the room was quite dark but i saw it plainly i wasn t dreaming it was a tall man all misty white from head to foot it wore the full dress of the old colonial days powdered hair baggy coat skirts lace ruffles and a sword it looked intangible and luminous in the dark and moved without a sound yes i was a little frightened at first or startled i should say it was the first ghost i had ever seen no it didn t say anything i didn t scream i raised up on my elbow and then it glided silently away and disappeared when it reached the door mrs kinsolving was in the seventh heaven the description is that of captain kinsolving of general greene s army one of our ancestors she said in a voice that trembled with pride and relief i really think i must apologize for our ghostly relative mrs bellmore i am afraid he must have badly disturbed your rest terence sent a smile of pleased congratulation toward his mother attainment was mrs kinsolving s at last and he loved to see her happy i suppose i ought to be ashamed to confess said mrs bellmore who was now enjoying her breakfast that i wasn t very much disturbed i presume it would have been the customary thing to scream and faint and have all of you running about in picturesque costumes but after the first alarm was over i really couldn t work myself up to a panic the ghost retired from the stage quietly and peacefully after doing its little turn and i went to sleep again nearly all listened politely accepted mrs bellmore s story as a made up affair charitably offered as an offset to the unkind vision seen by mrs fischer suympkins but one or two present perceived that her assertions bore the genuine stamp of her own convictions truth and candour seemed to attend upon every word even a scoffer at ghosts if he were very observant would have been forced to admit that she had at least in a very vivid dream been honestly aware of the weird visitor soon mrs bellmore s maid was packing in two hours the auto would come to convey her to the station as terence was strolling upon the east piazza mrs bellmore came up to him with a confidential sparkle in her eye i didn t wish to tell the others all of it she said but i will tell you in a way i think you should be held responsible can you guess in what manner that ghost awakened me last night rattled chains suggested terence after some thought or groaned they usually do one or the other do you happen to know continued mrs bellmore with sudden irrelevancy if i resemble any one of the female relatives of your restless ancestor captain kinsolving don t think so said terence with an extremely puzzled air never heard of any of them being noted beauties then why said mrs bellmore looking the young man gravely in the eye should that ghost have kissed me as i m sure it did heavens exclaimed terence in wide eyed amazement you don t mean that mrs bellmore did he actually kiss you i said it corrected mrs bellmore i hope the impersonal pronoun is correctly used but why did you say i was responsible because you are the only living male relative of the ghost i see unto the third and fourth generation but seriously did he did it how do you know how does any one know i was asleep and that is what awakened me i m almost certain almost well i awoke just as oh can t you understand what i mean when anything arouses you suddenly you are not positive whether you dreamed or and yet you know that dear me terence must i dissect the most elementary sensations in order to accommodate your extremely practical intelligence but about kissing ghosts you know said terence humbly i require the most primary instruction i never kissed a ghost is it is it the sensation said mrs bellmore with deliberate but slightly smiling emphasis since you are seeking instruction is a mingling of the material and the spiritual of course said terence suddenly growing serious it was a dream or some kind of an hallucination nobody believes in spirits these days if you told the tale out of kindness of heart mrs bellmore i can t express how grateful i am to you it has made my mother supremely happy that revolutionary ancestor was a stunning idea mrs bellmore sighed the usual fate of ghost seers is mine she said resignedly my privileged encounter with a spirit is attributed to lobster salad or mendacity well i have at least one memory left from the wreck a kiss from the unseen world was captain kinsolving a very brave man do you know terence he was licked at yorktown i believe said terence reflecting they say he skedaddled with his company after the first battle there i thought he must have been timid said mrs bellmore absently he might have had another another battle asked terence dully what else could i mean i must go and get ready now the auto will be here in an hour i ve enjoyed clifftop immensely such a lovely morning isn t it terence on her way to the station mrs bellmore took from her bag a silk handkerchief and looked at it with a little peculiar smile then she tied it in several very hard knots and threw it at a convenient moment over the edge of the cliff along which the road ran in his room terence was giving some directions to his man brooks have this stuff done up in a parcel he said and ship it to the address on that card the card was that of a new york costumer the stuff was a gentleman s costume of the days of made of white satin with silver buckles white silk stockings and white kid shoes a powdered wig and a sword completed the dress and look about brooks added terence a little anxiously for a silk handkerchief with my initials in one corner i must have dropped it somewhere it was a month later when mrs bellmore and one or two others of the smart crowd were making up a list of names for a coaching trip through the catskills mrs bellmore looked over the list for a final censoring the name of terence kinsolving was there mrs bellmore ran her prohibitive pencil lightly through the name too shy she murmured sweetly in explanation jimmy hayes and muriel i supper was over and there had fallen upon the camp the silence that accompanies the rolling of corn husk cigarettes the water hole shone from the dark earth like a patch of fallen sky coyotes yelped dull thumps indicated the rocking horse movements of the hobbled ponies as they moved to fresh grass a half troop of the frontier battalion of texas rangers were distributed about the fire a well known sound the fluttering and scraping of chaparral against wooden stirrups came from the thick brush above the camp the rangers listened cautiously they heard a loud and cheerful voice call out reassuringly brace up muriel old girl we re most there now been a long ride for ye ain t it ye old antediluvian handful of animated carpet tacks hey now quit a tryin to kiss me don t hold on to my neck so tight this here paint hoss ain t any too shore footed let me tell ye he s liable to dump us both off if we don t watch out two minutes of waiting brought a tired paint pony single footing into camp a gangling youth of twenty lolled in the saddle of the muriel whom he had been addressing nothing was to be seen hi fellows shouted the rider cheerfully this here s a letter fer lieutenant manning he dismounted unsaddled dropped the coils of his stake rope and got his hobbles from the saddle horn while lieutenant manning in command was reading the letter the newcomer rubbed solicitously at some dried mud in the loops of the hobbles showing a consideration for the forelegs of his mount boys said the lieutenant waving his hand to the rangers this is mr james hayes he s a new member of the company captain mclean sends him down from el paso the boys will see that you have some supper hayes as soon as you get your pony hobbled the recruit was received cordially by the rangers still they observed him shrewdly and with suspended judgment picking a comrade on the border is done with ten times the care and discretion with which a girl chooses a sweetheart on your side kicker s nerve loyalty aim and coolness your own life may depend many times after a hearty supper hayes joined the smokers about the fire his appearance did not settle all the questions in the minds of his brother rangers they saw simply a loose lank youth with tow coloured sun burned hair and a berry brown ingenuous face that wore a quizzical good natured smile fellows said the new ranger i m goin to interduce to you a lady friend of mine ain t ever heard anybody call her a beauty but you ll all admit she s got some fine points about her come along muriel he held open the front of his blue flannel shirt out of it crawled a horned frog a bright red ribbon was tied jauntily around its spiky neck it crawled to its owner s knee and sat there motionless this here muriel said hayes with an oratorical wave of his hand has got qualities she never talks back she always stays at home and she s satisfied with one red dress for every day and sunday too look at that blame insect said one of the rangers with a grin i ve seen plenty of them horny frogs but i never knew anybody to have one for a side partner does the blame thing know you from anybody else take it over there and see said hayes the stumpy little lizard known as the horned frog is harmless he has the hideousness of the prehistoric monsters whose reduced descendant he is but he is gentler than the dove the ranger took muriel from hayes s knee and went back to his seat on a roll of blankets the captive twisted and clawed and struggled vigorously in his hand after holding it for a moment or two the ranger set it upon the ground awkwardly but swiftly the frog worked its four oddly moving legs until it stopped close by hayes s foot well dang my hide said the other ranger the little cuss knows you never thought them insects had that much sense ii jimmy hayes became a favourite in the ranger camp he had an endless store of good nature and a mild perennial quality of humour that is well adapted to camp life he was never without his horned frog in the bosom of his shirt during rides on h is knee or shoulder in camp under his blankets at night the ugly little beast never left him jimmy was a humourist of a type that prevails in the rural south and west unskilled in originating methods of amusing or in witty conceptions he had hit upon a comical idea and clung to it reverently it had seemed to jimmy a very funny thing to have about his person with which to amuse his friends a tame horned frog with a red ribbon around its neck as it was a happy idea why not perpetuate it the sentiments existing between jimmy and the frog cannot be exactly determined the capability of the horned frog for lasting affection is a subject upon which we have had no symposiums it is easier to guess jimmy s feelings muriel was his chef d oeuvre of wit and as such he cherished her he caught flies for her and shielded her from sudden northers yet his care was half selfish and when the time came she repaid him a thousand fold other muriels have thus overbalanced the light attentions of other jimmies not at once did jimmy hayes attain full brotherhood with his comrades they loved him for his simplicity and drollness but there hung above him a great sword of suspended judgment to make merry in camp is not all of a ranger s life there are horse thieves to trail desperate criminals to run down bravos to battle with bandits to rout out of the chaparral peace and order to be compelled at the muzzle of a six shooter jimmy had been most generally a cow puncher he said he was inexperienced in ranger methods of warfare therefore the rangers speculated apart and solemnly as to how he would stand fire for let it be known the honour and pride of each ranger company is the individual bravery of its members for two months the border was quiet the rangers lolled listless in camp and then bringing joy to the rusting guardians of the frontier sebastiano saldar an eminent mexican desperado and cattle thief crossed the rio grande with his gang and began to lay waste the texas side there were indications that jimmy hayes would soon have the opportunity to show his mettle the rangers patrolled with alacrity but saldar s men were mounted like lochinvar and were hard to catch one evening about sundown the rangers halted for supper after a long ride their horses stood panting with their saddles on the men were frying bacon and boiling coffee suddenly out of the brush sebastiano saldar and his gang dashed upon them with blazing six shooters and high voiced yells it was a neat surprise the rangers swore in annoyed tones and got their winchesters busy but the attack was only a spectacular dash of the purest mexican type after the florid demonstration the raiders galloped away yelling down the river the rangers mounted and pursued but in less than two miles the fagged ponies laboured so that lieutenant manning gave the word to abandon the chase and return to the camp then it was discovered that jimmy hayes was missing some one remembered having seen him run for his pony when the attack began but no one had set eyes on him since morning came but no jimmy they searched the country around on the theory that he had been killed or wounded but without success then they followed after saldar s gang but it seemed to have disappeared manning concluded that the wily mexican had recrossed the river after his theatric farewell and indeed no further depredations f rom him were reported this gave the rangers time to nurse a soreness they had as has been said the pride and honour of the company is the individual bravery of its members and now they believed that jimmy hayes had turned coward at the whiz of mexican bullets there was no other deduction buck davis pointed out that not a shot was fired by saldar s gang after jimmy was seen running for his horse there was no way for him to have been shot no he had fled from his first fight and afterward he would not return aware that the scorn of his comrades would be a worse thing to face than the muzzles of many rifles so manning s detachment of mclean s company frontier battalion was gloomy it was the first blot on its escutcheon never before in the history of the service had a ranger shown the white feather all of them had liked jimmy hayes and that made it worse days weeks and months went by and still that little cloud of unforgotten cowardice hung above the camp iii nearly a year afterward after many camping grounds and many hundreds of miles guarded and defended lieutenant manning with almost the same detachment of men was sent to a point only a few miles below their old camp on the river to look after some smuggling there one afternoon while they were riding through a dense mesquite flat they came upon a patch of open hog wallow prairie there they rode upon the scene of an unwritten tragedy in a big hog wallow lay the skeletons of three mexicans their clothing alone served to identify them the largest of the figures had once been sebastiano saldar his great costly sombrero heavy with gold ornamentation a hat famous all along the rio grande lay there pierced by three bullets along the ridge of the hog wallow rested the rusting winchesters of the mexicans all pointing in the same direction the rangers rode in that direction for fifty yards there in a little depression of the ground with his rifle still bearing upon the three lay another skeleton it had been a battle of extermination there was nothing to identify the solitary defender his clothing such as the elements had left distinguishable seemed to be of the kind that any ranchman or cowboy might have worn some cow puncher said manning that they caught out alone good boy he put up a dandy scrap before they got him so that s why we didn t hear from don sebastiano any more and then from beneath the weather beaten rags of the dead man there wriggled out a horned frog with a faded red ribbon around its neck and sat upon the shoulder of its long quiet master mutely it told the story of the untried youth and the swift paint pony how they had outstripped all their comrades that day in the pursuit of the mexican raiders and how the boy had gone down upholding the honour of the company the ranger troop herded close and a simultaneous wild yell arose from their lips the outburst was at once a dirge an apology an epitaph and a paean of triumph a strange requiem you may say over the body of a fallen comrade but if jimmy hayes could have heard it he would have understood the door of unrest i sat an hour by sun in the editor s room of the montopolis weekly bugle i was the editor the saffron rays of the declining sunlight filtered through the cornstalks in micajah widdup s garden patch and cast an amber glory upon my paste pot i sat at the editorial desk in my non rotary revolving chair and prepared my editorial against the oligarchies the room with its one window was already a prey to the twilight one by one with my trenchant sentences i lopped off the heads of the political hydra while i listened full of kindly peace to the home coming cow bells and wondered what mrs flanagan was going to have for supper then in from the dusky quiet street there drifted and perched himself upon a corner of my desk old father time s younger brother his face was beardless and as gnarled as an english walnut i never saw clothes such as he wore they would have reduced joseph s coat to a monochrome but the colours were not the dyer s stains and patches and the work of sun and rust were responsible for the diversity on his coarse shoes was the dust conceivably of a thousand leagues i can describe him no further except to say that he was little and weird and old old i began to estimate in centuries when i saw him yes and i remember that there was an odour a faint odour like aloes or possibly like myrrh or leather and i thought of museums and then i reached for a pad and pencil for business is business and visits of the oldest inhabitants are sacred and honourable requiring to be chronicled i am glad to see you sir i said i would offer you a chair but you see sir i went on i have lived in montopolis only three weeks and i have not met many of our citizens i turned a doubtful eye upon his dust stained shoes and concluded with a newspaper phrase i suppose that you reside in our midst my visitor fumbled in his raiment drew forth a soiled card and handed it to me upon it was written in plain but unsteadily formed characters the name michob ader i am glad you called mr ader i said as one of our older citizens you must view with pride the recent growth and enterprise of montopolis among other improvements i think i can promise that the town will now be provided with a live enterprising newspa do ye know the name on that card asked my caller interrupting me it is not a familiar one to me i said again he visited the depths of his ancient vestments this time he brought out a torn leaf of some book or journal brown and flimsy with age the heading of the page was the turkish spy in old style type the printing upon it was this there is a man come to paris in this year who pretends to have lived these sixteen hundred years he says of himself that he was a shoemaker in jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion that his name is michob ader and that when jesus the christian messias was condemned by pontius pilate the roman president he paused to rest while bearing his cross to the place of crucifixion before the door of michob ader the shoemaker struck jesus with his fist saying go why tarriest thou the messias a nswered him i indeed am going but thou shalt tarry until i come thereby condemning him to live until the day of judgment he lives forever but at the end of every hundred years he falls into a fit or trance on recovering from which he finds himself in the same state of youth in which he was when jesus suffered being then about thirty years of age such is the story of the wandering jew as told by michob ader who relates here the printing ended i must have muttered aloud something to myself about the wandering jew for the old man spake up bitterly and loudly tis a lie said he like nine tenths of what ye call history tis a gentile i am and no jew i am after footing it out of jerusalem my son but if that makes me a jew then everything that comes out of a bottle is babies milk ye have my name on the card ye hold and ye have read the bit of paper they call the turkish spy that printed the news when i stepped into their office on the th day of june in the year just as i have called upon ye to day i laid down my pencil and pad clearly it would not do here was an item for the local column of the bugle that but it would not do still fragments of the impossible personal began to flit through my conventionalized brain uncle michob is as spry on his legs as a young chap of only a thousand or so our venerable caller relates with pride that george wash no ptolemy the great once dandled him on his knee at his father s house uncle michob says that our wet spring was nothing in comparison with the dampness that ruined the crops around mount ararat when he was a boy but no no it would not do i was trying to think of some conversational subject with which to interest my visitor and was hesitating between walking matches and the pliocene age when the old man suddenly began to weep poignantly and distressfully cheer up mr ader i said a little awkwardly this matter may blow over in a few hundred years more there has already been a decided reaction in favour of judas iscariot and colonel burr and the celebrated violinist signor nero this is the age of whitewash you must not allow yourself to become down hearted unknowingly i had struck a chord the old man blinked belligerently through his senile tears tis time he said that the liars be doin justice to somebody yer historians are no more than a pack of old women gabblin at a wake a finer man than the imperor nero niver wore sandals man i was at the burnin of rome i knowed the imperor well for in them days i was a well known char acter in thim days they had rayspect for a man that lived forever but twas of the imperor nero i was goin to tell ye i struck into rome up the appian way on the night of july the th the year i had just stepped down by way of siberia and afghanistan and one foot of me had a frost bite and the other a blister burned by the sand of the desert and i was feelin a bit blue from doin patrol duty from the north pole down to the last chance corner in patagonia and bein miscalled a jew in the bargain well i m tellin ye i was passin the circus maximus and it was dark as pitch over the way and then i heard somebody sing out is that you michob over ag inst the wall hid out amongst a pile of barrels and old dry goods boxes was the imperor nero wid his togy wrapped around his toes smokin a long black segar have one michob says he none of the weeds for me says i nayther pipe nor segar what s the use says i of smokin when ye ve not got the ghost of a chance of killin yeself by doin it true for ye michob ader my perpetual jew says the imperor ye re not always wandering sure tis danger gives the spice of our pleasures next to their bein forbidden and for what says i do ye smoke be night in dark places widout even a cinturion in plain clothes to attend ye have ye ever heard michob says the imperor of predestinarianism i ve had the cousin of it says i i ve been on the trot with pedestrianism for many a year and more to come as ye well know the longer word says me friend nero is the tachin of this new sect of people they call the christians tis them that s raysponsible for me smokin be night in holes and corners of the dark and then i sets down and takes off a shoe and rubs me foot that is frosted and the imperor tells me about it it seems that since i passed that way before the imperor had mandamused the impress wid a divorce suit and misses poppaea a cilibrated lady was ingaged widout riferences as housekeeper at the palace all in one day says the imperor she puts up new lace windy curtains in the palace and joins the anti tobacco society and whin i feels the need of a smoke i must be after sneakin out to these piles of lumber in the dark so there in the dark me and the imperor sat and i told him of me travels and when they say the imperor was an incindiary they lie twas that night the fire started that burnt the city tis my opinion that it began from a stump of segar that he threw down among the boxes and tis a lie that he fiddled he did all he could for six days to stop it sir and now i detected a new flavour to mr michob ader it had not been myrrh or balm or hyssop that i had smelled the emanation was the odour of bad whiskey and worse still of low comedy the sort that small humorists manufacture by clothing the grave and reverend things of legend and history in the vulgar topical frippery that passes for a certain kind of wit michob ader as an impostor claiming nineteen hundred years and playing his part with the decency of respectable lunacy i could endure but as a tedious wag cheapening his egregious story with song book levity his importance as an entertainer grew less and then as if he suspected my thoughts he suddenly shifted his key you ll excuse me sir he whined but sometimes i get a little mixed in my head i am a very old man and it is hard to remember everything i knew that he was right and that i should not try to reconcile him with roman history so i asked for news concerning other ancients with whom he had walked familiar above my desk hung an engraving of raphael s cherubs you could yet make out their forms though the dust blurred their outlines strangely ye calls them cher rubs cackled the old man babes ye fancy they are with wings and there s one wid legs and a bow and arrow that ye call cupid i know where they was found the great great great grandfather of thim all was a billy goat bein an editor sir do ye happen to know where solomon s temple stood i fancied that it was in in persia well i did not know tis not in history nor in the bible where it was but i saw it meself the first pictures of cher rubs and cupids was sculptured upon thim walls and pillars two of the biggest sir stood in the adytum to form the baldachin over the ark but the wings of thim sculptures was intindid for horns and the faces was the faces of goats ten thousand goats there was in and about the temple and your cher rubs was billy goats in the days of king solomon but the painters misconstrued the horns into wings and i knew tamerlane the lame timour sir very well i saw him at keghut and at zaranj he was a little man no larger than yerself with hair the colour of an amber pipe stem they buried him at samarkand i was at the wake sir oh he was a fine built man in his coffin six feet long with black whiskers to his face and i see em throw turnips at the imperor vispacian in africa all over the world i have tramped sir without the body of me findin any rest twas so commanded i saw jerusalem destroyed and pompeii go up in the fireworks and i was at the coronation of charlemagne and the lynchin of joan of arc and everywhere i go there comes storms and revolutions and plagues and fires twas so commanded ye have heard of the wandering jew tis all so except that divil a bit am i a jew but history lies as i have told ye are ye quite sure sir that ye haven t a drop of whiskey convenient ye well know that i have many miles of walking before me i have none said i and if you please i am about to leave for my supper i pushed my chair back creakingly this ancient landlubber was becoming as great an affliction as any cross bowed mariner he shook a musty effluvium from his piebald clothes overturned my inkstand and went on with his insufferable nonsense i wouldn t mind it so much he complained if it wasn t for the work i must do on good fridays ye know about pontius pilate sir of course his body whin he killed himself was pitched into a lake on the alps mountains now listen to the job that tis mine to perform on the night of ivery good friday the ould divil goes down in the pool and drags up pontius and the water is bilin and spewin like a wash pot and the ould divil sets the body on top of a throne on the rocks and thin comes me share of the job oh sir ye would pity me thin ye would pray for the poor wandering jew that niver was a jew if ye could see the horror of the thing that i must do tis i that must fetch a bowl of water and kneel down before it till it washes its hands i declare to ye that pontius pilate a man dead two hundred years dragged up with the lake slime coverin him and fishes wrigglin inside of him widout eyes and in the discomposition of the body sits there sir and washes his hands in the bowl i hold for him on good fridays twas so commanded clearly the matter had progressed far beyond the scope of the bugle s local column there might have been employment here for the alienist or for those who circulate the pledge but i had had enough of it i got up and repeated that i must go at this he seized my coat grovelled upon my desk and burst again into distressful weeping whatever it was about i said to myself that his grief was genuine come now mr ader i said soothingly what is the matter the answer came brokenly through his racking sobs because i would not let the poor christ rest upon the step his hallucination seemed beyond all reasonable answer yet the effect of it upon him scarcely merited disrespect but i knew nothing that might assuage it and i told him once more that both of us should be leaving the office at once obedient at last he raised himself from my dishevelled desk and permitted me to half lift him to the floor the gale of his grief had blown away his words his freshet of tears had soaked away the crust of his grief reminiscence died in him at least the coherent part of it twas me that did it he muttered as i led him toward the door me the shoemaker of jerusalem i got him to the sidewalk and in the augmented light i saw that his face was seared and lined and warped by a sadness almost incredibly the product of a single lifetime and then high up in the firmamental darkness we heard the clamant cries of some great passing birds my wandering jew lifted his hand with side tilted head the seven whistlers he said as one introduces well known friends wild geese said i but i confess that their number is beyond me they follow me everywhere he said twas so commanded what ye hear is the souls of the seven jews that helped with the crucifixion sometimes they re plovers and sometimes geese but ye ll find them always flyin where i go i stood uncertain how to take my leave i looked down the street shuffled my feet looked back again and felt my hair rise the old man had disappeared and then my capillaries relaxed for i dimly saw him footing it away through the darkness but he walked so swiftly and silently and contrary to the gait promised by his age that my composure was not all restored though i knew not why that night i was foolish enough to take down some dust covered volumes from my modest shelves i searched hermippus redivvus and salathiel and the pepys collection in vain and then in a book called the citizen of the world and in one two centuries old i came upon what i desired michob ader had indeed come to paris in the year and related to the turkish spy an extraordinary story he claimed to be the wandering jew and that but here i fell asleep for my editorial duties had not been light that day judge hoover was the bugle s candidate for congress having to confer with him i sought his home early the next morning and we walked together down town through a little street with which i was unfamiliar did you ever hear of michob ader i asked him smiling why yes said the judge and that reminds me of my shoes he has for mending here is his shop now judge hoover stepped into a dingy small shop i looked up at the sign and saw mike o bader boot and shoe maker on it some wild geese passed above honking clearly i scratched my ear and frowned and then trailed into the shop there sat my wandering jew on his shoemaker s bench trimming a half sole he was drabbled with dew grass stained unkempt and miserable and on his face was still the unexplained wretchedness the problematic sorrow the esoteric woe that had been written there by nothing less it seemed than the stylus of the centuries judge hoover inquired kindly concerning his shoes the old shoemaker looked up and spoke sanely enough he had been ill he said for a few days the next day the shoes would be ready he looked at me and i could see that i had no place in his memory so out we went and on our way old mike remarked the candidate has been on one of his sprees he gets crazy drunk regularly once a month but he s a good shoemaker what is his history i inquired whiskey epitomized judge hoover that explains him i was silent but i did not accept the explanation and so when i had the chance i asked old man sellers who browsed daily on my exchanges mike o bader said he was makin shoes in montopolis when i come here goin on fifteen year ago i guess whiskey s his trouble once a month he gets off the track and stays so a week he s got a rigmarole somethin about his bein a jew pedler that he tells ev rybody nobody won t listen to him any more when he s sober he ain t sich a fool he s got a sight of books in the back room of his shop that he reads i guess you can lay all his trouble to whiskey but again i would not not yet was my wandering jew rightly construed for me i trust that women may not be allowed a title to all the curiosity in the world so when montopolis s oldest inhabitant some ninety score years younger than michob ader dropped in to acquire promulgation in print i siphoned his perpetual trickle of reminiscence in the direction of the uninterpreted maker of shoes uncle abner was the complete history of montopolis bound in butternut o bader he quavered come here in he was the first shoemaker in the place folks generally considers him crazy at times now but he don t harm nobody i s pose drinkin upset his mind yes drinkin very likely done it it s a powerful bad thing drinkin i m an old old man sir and i never see no good in drinkin i felt disappointment i was willing to admit drink in the case of my shoemaker but i preferred it as a recourse instead of a cause why had he pitched upon his perpetual strange note of the wandering jew why his unutterable grief during his aberration i could not yet accept whiskey as an explanation did mike o bader ever have a great loss or trouble of any kind i asked lemme see about thirty year ago there was somethin of the kind i recollect montopolis sir in them days used to be a mighty strict place well mike o bader had a daughter then a right pretty girl she was too gay a sort for montopolis so one day she slips off to another town and runs away with a circus it was two years before she comes back all fixed up in fine clothes and rings and jewellery to see mike he wouldn t have nothin to do with her so she stays around town awhile anyway i reckon the men folks wouldn t have raised no objections but the women egged em on to order her to leave town but she had plenty of spunk and told em to mind their own business so one night they decided to run her away a crowd of men and women drove her out of her house and chased her with sticks and stones she run to her father s door callin for help mike opens it and when he sees who it is he hits her with his fist and knocks her down and shuts the door and then the crowd kept on chunkin her till she run clear out of town and the next day they finds her drowned dead in hunter s mill pond i mind it all now that was thirty year ago i leaned back in my non rotary revolving chair and nodded gently like a mandarin at my paste pot when old mike has a spell went on uncle abner tepidly garrulous he thinks he s the wanderin jew he is said i nodding away and uncle abner cackled insinuatingly at the editor s remark for he was expecting at least a stickful in the personal notes of the bugle the duplicity of hargraves when major pendleton talbot of mobile sir and his daughter miss lydia talbot came to washington to reside they selected for a boarding place a house that stood fifty yards back from one of the quietest avenues it was an old fashioned brick building with a portico upheld by tall white pillars the yard was shaded by stately locusts and elms and a catalpa tree in season rained its pink and white blossoms upon the grass rows of high box bushes lined the fence and walks it was the southern style and aspect of the place that pleased the eyes of the talbots in this pleasant private boarding house they engaged rooms including a study for major talbot who was adding the finishing chapters to his book anecdotes and reminiscences of the alabama army bench and bar major talbot was of the old old south the present day had little interest or excellence in his eyes his mind lived in that period before the civil war when the talbots owned thousands of acres of fine cotton land and the slaves to till them when the family mansion was the scene of princely hospitality and drew its guests from the aristocracy of the south out of that period he had brought all its old pride and scruples of honour an antiquated and punctilious politeness and you would think its wardrobe such clothes were surely never made within fifty years the major was tall but whenever he made that wonderful archaic genuflexion he called a bow the corners of his frock coat swept the floor that garment was a surprise even to washington which has long ago ceased to shy at the frocks and broadbrimmed hats of southern congressmen one of the boarders christened it a father hubbard and it certainly was high in the waist and full in the skirt but the major with all his queer clothes his immense area of plaited ravelling shirt bosom and the little black string tie with the bow always slipping on one side both was smiled at and liked in mrs vardeman s select boarding house some of the young department clerks would often string him as they called it getting him started upon the subject dearest to him the traditions and history of his beloved southland during his talks he would quote freely from the anecdotes and reminiscences but they were very careful not to let him see their designs for in spite of his sixty eight years he could make the boldest of them uncomfortable under the steady regard of his piercing gray eyes miss lydia was a plump little old maid of thirty five with smoothly drawn tightly twisted hair that made her look still older old fashioned too she was but ante bellum glory did not radiate from her as it did from the major she possessed a thrifty common sense and it was she who handled the finances of the family and met all comers when there were bills to pay the major regarded board bills and wash bills as contemptible nuisances they kept coming in so persistently and so often why the major wanted to know could they not be filed and paid in a lump sum at some convenient period say when the anecdotes and reminiscences had been published and paid for miss lydia would calmly go on with her sewing and say we ll pay as we go as long as the money lasts and then perhaps they ll have to lump it most of mrs vardeman s boarders were away during the day being nearly all department clerks and business men but there was one of them who was about the house a great deal from morning to night this was a young man named henry hopkins hargraves every one in the house addressed him by his full name who was engaged at one of the popular vaudeville theatres vaudeville has risen to such a respectable plane in the last few years and mr hargraves was such a modest and well mannered person that mrs vardeman could find no objection to enrolling him upon her list of boarders at the theatre hargraves was known as an all round dialect comedian having a large repertoire of german irish swede and black face specialties but mr hargraves was ambitious and often spoke of his great desire to succeed in legitimate comedy this young man appeared to conceive a strong fancy for major talbot whenever that gentleman would begin his southern reminiscences or repeat some of the liveliest of the anecdotes hargraves could always be found the most attentive among his listeners for a time the major showed an inclination to discourage the advances of the play actor as he privately termed him but soon the young man s agreeable manner and indubitable appreciation of the old gentleman s stories completely won him over it was not long before the two were like old chums the major set apart each afternoon to read to him the manuscript of his book during the anecdotes hargraves never failed to laugh at exactly the right point the major was moved to declare to miss lydia one day that young hargraves possessed remarkable perception and a gratifying respect for the old regime and when it came to talking of those old days if major talbot liked to talk mr hargraves was entranced to listen like almost all old people who talk of the past the major loved to linger over details in describing the splendid almost royal days of the old planters he would hesitate until he had recalled the name of the negro who held his horse or the exact date of certain minor happenings or the number of bales of cotton raised in such a year but hargraves never grew impatient or lost interest on the contrary he would advance questions on a variety of subjects connected with the life of that time and he n ever failed to extract ready replies the fox hunts the possum suppers the hoe downs and jubilees in the negro quarters the banquets in the plantation house hall when invitations went for fifty miles around the occasional feuds with the neighbouring gentry the major s duel with rathbone culbertson about kitty chalmers who afterward married a thwaite of south carolina and private yacht races for fabulous sums on mobile bay the quaint beliefs improvident habits and loyal virtues of the old slaves all these were subjects that held both the major and hargraves absorbed for hours at a time sometimes at night when the young man would be coming upstairs to his room after his turn at the theatre was over the major would appear at the door of his study and beckon archly to him going in hargraves would find a little table set with a decanter sugar bowl fruit and a big bunch of fresh green mint it occurred to me the major would begin he was always ceremonious that perhaps you might have found your duties at the at your place of occupation sufficiently arduous to enable you mr hargraves to appreciate what the poet might well have had in his mind when he wrote tired nature s sweet restorer one of our southern juleps it was a fascination to hargraves to watch him make it he took rank among artists when he began and he never varied the process with what delicacy he bruised the mint with what exquisite nicety he estimated the ingredients with what solicitous care he capped the compound with the scarlet fruit glowing against the dark green fringe and then the hospitality and grace with which he offered it after the selected oat straws had been plunged into its tinkling depths after about four months in washington miss lydia discovered one morning that they were almost without money the anecdotes and reminiscences was completed but publishers had not jumped at the collected gems of alabama sense and wit the rental of a small house which they still owned in mobile was two months in arrears their board money for the month would be due in three days miss lydia called her father to a consultation no money said he with a surprised look it is quite annoying to be called on so frequently for these petty sums really i the major searched his pockets he found only a two dollar bill which he returned to his vest pocket i must attend to this at once lydia he said kindly get me my umbrella and i will go down town immediately the congressman from our district general fulghum assured me some days ago that he would use his influence to get my book published at an early date i will go to his hotel at once and see what arrangement has been made with a sad little smile miss lydia watched him button his father hubbard and depart pausing at the door as he always did to bow profoundly that evening at dark he returned it seemed that congressman fulghum had seen the publisher who had the major s manuscript for reading that person had said that if the anecdotes etc were carefully pruned down about one half in order to eliminate the sectional and class prejudice with which the book was dyed from end to end he might consider its publication the major was in a white heat of anger but regained his equanimity according to his code of manners as soon as he was in miss lydia s presence we must have money said miss lydia with a little wrinkle above her nose give me the two dollars and i will telegraph to uncle ralph for some to night the major drew a small envelope from his upper vest pocket and tossed it on the table perhaps it was injudicious he said mildly but the sum was so merely nominal that i bought tickets to the theatre to night it s a new war drama lydia i thought you would be pleased to witness its first production in washington i am told that the south has very fair treatment in the play i confess i should like to see the performance myself miss lydia threw up her hands in silent despair still as the tickets were bought they might as well be used so that evening as they sat in the theatre listening to the lively overture even miss lydia was minded to relegate their troubles for the hour to second place the major in spotless linen with his extraordinary coat showing only where it was closely buttoned and his white hair smoothly roached looked really fine and distinguished the curtain went up on the first act of a magnolia flower revealing a typical southern plantation scen e major talbot betrayed some interest oh see exclaimed miss lydia nudging his arm and pointing to her programme the major put on his glasses and read the line in the cast of characters that her finger indicated col webster calhoun h hopkins hargraves it s our mr hargraves said miss lydia it must be his first appearance in what he calls the legitimate i m so glad for him not until the second act did col webster calhoun appear upon the stage when he made his entry major talbot gave an audible sniff glared at him and seemed to freeze solid miss lydia uttered a little ambiguous squeak and crumpled her programme in her hand for colonel calhoun was made up as nearly resembling major talbot as one pea does another the long thin white hair curly at the ends the aristocratic beak of a nose the crumpled wide ravelling shirt front the string tie with the bow nearly under one ear were almost exactly duplicated and then to clinch the imitation he wore the twin to the major s supposed to be unparalleled coat high collared baggy empire waisted ample skirted hanging a foot lower in front than behind the garment could have been designed from no other pattern from then on the major and miss lydia sat bewitched and saw the counterfeit presentment of a haughty talbot dragged as the major afterward expressed it through the slanderous mire of a corrupt st age mr hargraves had used his opportunities well he had caught the major s little idiosyncrasies of speech accent and intonation and his pompous courtliness to perfection exaggerating all to the purposes of the stage when he performed that marvellous bow that the major fondly imagined to be the pink of all salutations the audience sent forth a sudden round of hearty applause miss lydia sat immovable not daring to glance toward her father sometimes her hand next to him would be laid against her cheek as if to conceal the smile which in spite of her disapproval she could not entirely suppress the culmination of hargraves s audacious imitation took place in the third act the scene is where colonel calhoun entertains a few of the neighbouring planters in his den standing at a table in the centre of the stage with his friends grouped about him he delivers that inimitable rambling character monologue so famous in a magnolia flower at the same time that he deftly makes juleps for the party major talbot sitting quietly but white with indignation heard his best stories retold his pet theories and hobbies advanced and expanded and the dream of the anecdotes and reminiscences served exaggerated and garbled his favourite narrative that of his duel with rathbone culbertson was not omitted and it was delivered with more fire egotism and gusto than the major himself put into it the monologue concluded with a quaint delicious witty little lecture on the art of concocting a julep illustrated by the act here major talbot s delicate but showy science was reproduced to a hair s breadth from his dainty handling of the fragrant weed the one thousandth part of a grain too much pressure gentlemen and you extract the bitterness instead of the aroma of this heaven bestowed plant to his solicitous selection of the oaten straws at the close of the scene the audience raised a tumultuous roar of appreciation the portrayal of the type was so exact so sure and thorough that the leading characters in the play were forgotten after repeated calls hargraves came before the curtain and bowed his rather boyish face bright and flushed with the knowledge of success at last miss lydia turned and looked at the major his thin nostrils were working like the gills of a fish he laid both shaking hands upon the arms of his chair to rise we will go lydia he said chokingly this is an abominable desecration before he could rise she pulled him back into his seat we will stay it out she declared do you want to advertise the copy by exhibiting the original coat so they remained to the end hargraves s success must have kept him up late that night for neither at the breakfast nor at the dinner table did he appear about three in the afternoon he tapped at the door of major talbot s study the major opened it and hargraves walked in with his hands full of the morning papers too full of his triumph to notice anything unusual in the major s demeanour i put it all over em last night major he began exultantly i had my inning and i think scored here s what the post says his conception and portrayal of the old time southern colonel with his absurd grandiloquence his eccentric garb his quaint idioms and phrases his moth eaten pride of family and his really kind heart fastidious sense of honour and lovable simplicity is the best delineation of a character role on the boards to day the coat worn by colonel calhoun is itself nothing less than

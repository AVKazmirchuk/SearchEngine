that are always advertising the extenuating circumstances of love and romance had been there to see there was ed collier a fine man full of contrivances and flirtations abandoning the girl of his heart and ripping out into the contiguous territory in the pursuit of sordid grub twas a rebuke to the poets and a slap at the best paying element of fiction an empty stomach is a sure antidote to an overfull heart i was naturally anxious to know how far mame was infatuated with collier and his stratagems i went inside the unparalleled exhibition and there she was she looked surprised to see me but unguilty it s an elegant evening outside says i the coolness is quite nice and gratifying and the stars are lined out first class up where they belong wouldn t you shake these by products of the animal kingdom long enough to take a walk with a common human who never was on a programme in his life mame gave a sort of sly glance around and i knew what that meant oh says i i hate to tell you but the curiosity that lives on wind has flew the coop he just crawled out under the tent by this time he has amalgamated himself with half the delicatessen truck in town you mean ed collier says mame i do i answers and a pity it is that he has gone back to crime again i met him outside the tent and he exposed his intentions of devastating the food crop of the world tis enormously sad when one s ideal descends from his pedestal to make a seventeen year locust of himself mame looked me straight in the eye until she had corkscrewed my reflections jeff says she it isn t quite like you to talk that way i don t care to hear ed collier ridiculed a man may do ridiculous things but they don t look ridiculous to the girl he does em for that was one man in a hundred he stopped eating just to please me i d be hard hearted and ungrateful if i didn t feel kindly toward him could you do what he did i know says i seeing the point i m condemned i can t help it the brand of the consumer is upon my brow mrs eve settled that business for me when she made the dicker with the snake i fell from the fire into the frying pan i guess i m the champion feaster of the universe i spoke humble and mame mollified herself a little ed collier and i are good friends she said the same as me and you i gave him the same answer i did you no marrying for me i liked to be with ed and talk with him there was something mighty pleasant to me in the thought that here was a man who never used a knife and fork and all for my sake wasn t you in love with him i asks all injudicious wasn t there a deal on for you to become mrs curiosity all of us do it sometimes all of us get jostled out of the line of profitable talk now and then mame put on that little lemon glace smile that runs between ice and sugar and says much too pleasant you re short on credentials for asking that question mr peters suppose you do a forty nine day fast just to give you ground to stand on and then maybe i ll answer it so even after collier was kidnapped out of the way by the revolt of his appetite my own prospects with mame didn t seem to be improved and then business played out in guthrie i had stayed too long there the brazilians i had sold commenced to show signs of wear and the kindler refused to light up right frequent on wet mornings there is always a time in my business when the star of success says move on to the next town i was travelling by wagon at that time so as not to miss any of the small towns so i hitched up a few days later and went down to tell mame good bye i wasn t abandoning the game i intended running over to oklahoma city and work it for a week or two then i was coming back to institute fresh proceedings against mame what do i find at the dugans but mame all conspicuous in a blue travelling dress with her little trunk at the door it seems that sister lottie bell who is a typewriter in terre haute is going to be married next thursday and mame is off for a week s visit to be an accomplice at the ceremony mame is waiting for a freight wagon that is going to take her to oklahoma but i condemns the freight wagon with promptness and scorn and offers to deliver the goods myself ma dugan sees no reason why not as mr freighter wants pay for the job so thirty minutes later mame and i pull out in my light spring wagon with white canvas cover and head due south that morning was of a praiseworthy sort the breeze was lively and smelled excellent of flowers and grass and the little cottontail rabbits entertained themselves with skylarking across the road my two kentucky bays went for the horizon until it come sailing in so fast you wanted to dodge it like a clothesline mame was full of talk and rattled on like a kid about her old home and her school pranks and the things she liked and the hateful ways of those johnson girls just across the street way up in indiana not a word was said about ed collier or victuals or such solemn subjects about noon mame looks and finds that the lunch she had put up in a basket had been left behind i could have managed quite a collation but mame didn t seem to be grieving over nothing to eat so i made no lamentations it was a sore subject with me and i ruled provender in all its branches out of my conversation i am minded to touch light on explanations how i came to lose the way the road was dim and well grown with grass and there was mame by my side confiscating my intellects and attention the excuses are good or they are not as they may appear to you but i lost it and at dusk that afternoon when we should have been in oklahoma city we were seesawing along the edge of nowhere in some undiscovered river bottom and the rain was falling in large wet bunches down there in the swamps we saw a little log house on a small knoll of high ground the bottom grass and the chaparral and the lonesome timber crowded all around it it seemed to be a melancholy little house and you felt sorry for it twas that house for the night the way i reasoned it i explained to mame and she leaves it to me to decide she doesn t become galvanic and prosecuting as most women would but she says it s all right she knows i didn t mean to do it we found the house was deserted it had two empty rooms there was a little shed in the yard where beasts had once been kept in a loft of it was a lot of old hay i put my horses in there and gave them some of it for which they looked at me sorrowful expecting apologies the rest of the hay i carried into the house by armfuls with a view to accommodations i also brought in the patent kindler and the brazilians neither of which are guaranteed against the action of water mame and i sat on the wagon seats on the floor and i lit a lot of the kindler on the hearth for the night was chilly if i was any judge that girl enjoyed it it was a change for her it gave her a different point of view she laughed and talked and the kindler made a dim light compared to her eyes i had a pocketful of cigars and as far as i was concerned there had never been any fall of man we were at the same old stand in the garden of eden out there somewhere in the rain and the dark was the river of zion and the angel with the flaming sword had not yet put up the keep off the grass sign i opened up a gross or two of the brazilians and made mame put them on rings brooches necklaces eardrops bracelets girdles and lockets she flashed and sparkled like a million dollar princess until she had pink spots in her cheeks and almost cried for a looking glass when it got late i made a fine bunk on the floor for mame with the hay and my lap robes and blankets out of the wagon and persuaded her to lie down i sat in the other room burning tobacco and listening to the pouring rain and meditating on the many vicissitudes that came to a man during the seventy years or so immediately preceding his funeral i must have dozed a little while before morning for my eyes were shut and when i opened them it was daylight and there stood mame with her hair all done up neat and correct and her eyes bright with admiration of existence gee whiz jeff she exclaims but i m hungry i could eat a i looked up and caught her eye her smile went back in and she gave me a cold look of suspicion then i laughed and laid down on the floor to laugh easier it seemed funny to me by nature and geniality i am a hearty laugher and i went the limit when i came to mame was sitting with her back to me all contaminated with dignity don t be angry mame i says for i couldn t help it it s the funny way you ve done up your hair if you could only see it you needn t tell stories sir said mame cool and advised my hair is all right i know what you were laughing about why jeff look outside she winds up peeping through a chink between the logs i opened the little wooden window and looked out the entire river bottom was flooded and the knob of land on which the house stood was an island in the middle of a rushing stream of yellow water a hundred yards wide and it was still raining hard all we could do was to stay there till the doves brought in the olive branch i am bound to admit that conversations and amusements languished during that day i was aware that mame was getting a too prolonged one sided view of things again but i had no way to change it personally i was wrapped up in the desire to eat i had hallucinations of hash and visions of ham and i kept saying to myself all the time what ll you have to eat jeff what ll you order now old man when the waiter comes i picks out to myself all sorts of favourites from the bill of fare and imagines them coming i guess it s that way with all hungry men they can t get their cogitations trained on anything but something to eat it shows that the little table with the broken legged caster and the imitation worcester sauce and the napkin covering up the coffee stains is the paramount issue after all instead of the question of immortality or peace between nations i sat there musing along arguing with myself quite heated as to how i d have my steak with mushrooms or a la creole mame was on the other seat pensive her head leaning on her hand let the potatoes come home fried i states in my mind and brown the hash in the pan with nine poached eggs on the side i felt careful in my own pockets to see if i could find a peanut or a grain or two of popcorn night came on again with the river still rising and the rain still falling i looked at mame and i noticed that desperate look on her face that a girl always wears when she passes an ice cream lair i knew that poor girl was hungry maybe for the first time in her life there was that anxious look in her eye that a woman has only when she has missed a meal or feels her skirt coming unfastened in the back it was about eleven o clock or so on the second night when we sat gloomy in our shipwrecked cabin i kept jerking my mind away from the subject of food but it kept flopping back again before i could fasten it i thought of everything good to eat i had ever heard of i went away back to my kidhood and remembered the hot biscuit sopped in sorghum and bacon gravy with partiality and respect then i trailed along up the years pausing at green apples and salt flapjacks and maple lye hominy fried chicken old virginia style corn on the cob spareribs and sweet potato pie and wound up with georgia brunswick stew which is the top notch of good things to eat because it comprises em all they say a drowning man sees a panorama of his whole life pass before him well when a man s starving he sees the ghost of every meal he ever ate set out before him and he invents new dishes that would make the fortune of a chef if somebody would collect the last words of men who starved to death they d have to sift em mighty fine to discover the sentiment but they d compile into a cook book that would sell into the millions i guess i must have had my conscience pretty well inflicted with culinary meditations for without intending to do so i says out loud to the imaginary waiter cut it thick and have it rare with the french fried and six soft scrambled on toast mame turned her head quick as a wing her eyes were sparkling and she smiled sudden medium for me she rattles out with the juliennes and three straight up draw one and brown the wheats double order to come oh jeff wouldn t it be glorious and then i d like to have a half fry and a little chicken curried with rice and a cup custard with ice cream and go easy i interrupts where s the chicken liver pie and the kidney saute on toast and the roast lamb and oh cuts in mame all excited with mint sauce and the turkey salad and stuffed olives and raspberry tarts and keep it going says i hurry up with the fried squash and the hot corn pone with sweet milk and don t forget the apple dumpling with hard sauce and the cross barred dew berry pie yes for ten minutes we kept up that kind of restaurant repartee we ranges up and down and backward and forward over the main trunk lines and the branches of the victual subject and mame leads the game for she is apprised in the ramifications of grub and the dishes she nominates aggravates my yearnings it seems that there is a feeling that mame will line up friendly again with food it seems that she looks upon the obnoxious science of eating with less contempt than before the next morning we find that the flood has subsided i geared up the bays and we splashed out through the mud some precarious until we found the road again we were only a few miles wrong and in two hours we were in oklahoma city the first thing we saw was a big restaurant sign and we piled into there in a hurry here i finds myself sitting with mame at table with knives and forks and plates between us and she not scornful but smiling with starvation and sweetness twas a new restaurant and well stocked i designated a list of quotations from the bill of fare that made the waiter look out toward the wagon to see how many more might be coming there we were and there was the order being served twas a banquet for a dozen but we felt like a dozen i looked across the table at mame and smiled for i had recollections mame was looking at the table like a boy looks at his first stem winder then she looked at me straight in the face and two big tears came in her eyes the waiter was gone after more grub jeff she says soft like i ve been a foolish girl i ve looked at things from the wrong side i never felt this way before men get hungry every day like this don t they they re big and strong and they do the hard work of the world and they don t eat just to spite silly waiter girls in restaurants do they jeff you said once that is you asked me you wanted me to well jeff if you still care i d be glad and willing to have you always sitting across the table from me now give me something to eat quick please so as i ve said a woman needs to change her point of view now and then they get tired of the same old sights the same old dinner table washtub and sewing machine give em a touch of the various a little travel and a little rest a little tomfoolery along with the tragedies of keeping house a little petting after the blowing up a little upsetting and a little jostling around and everybody in the game will have chips added to their stack by the play the caballero s way the cisco kid had killed six men in more or less fair scrimmages had murdered twice as many mostly mexicans and had winged a larger number whom he modestly forbore to count therefore a woman loved him the kid was twenty five looked twenty and a careful insurance company would have estimated the probable time of his demise at say twenty six his habitat was anywhere between the frio and the rio grande he killed for the love of it because he was quick tempered to avoid arrest for his own amusement any reason that came to his mind would suffice he had escaped capture because he could shoot five sixths of a second sooner than any sheriff or ranger in the service and because he rode a speckled roan horse that knew every cow path in the mesquite and pear thickets from san antonio to matamoras tonia perez the girl who loved the cisco kid was half carmen half madonna and the rest oh yes a woman who is half carmen and half madonna can always be something more the rest let us say was humming bird she lived in a grass roofed jacal near a little mexican settlement at the lone wolf crossing of the frio with her lived a father or grandfather a lineal aztec somewhat less than a thousand years old who herded a hundred goats and lived in a continuous drunken dream from drinking mescal back of the jacal a tremendous forest of bristling pear twenty feet high at its worst crowded almost to its door it was along the bewildering maze of this spinous thicket that the speckled roan would bring the kid to see his girl and once clinging like a lizard to the ridge pole high up under the peaked grass roof he had heard tonia with her madonna face and carmen beauty and humming bird soul parley with the sheriff s posse denying knowledge of her man in her soft melange of spanish and english one day the adjutant general of the state who is ex officio commander of the ranger forces wrote some sarcastic lines to captain duval of company x stationed at laredo relative to the serene and undisturbed existence led by murderers and desperadoes in the said captain s territory the captain turned the colour of brick dust under his tan and forwarded the letter after adding a few comments per ranger private bill adamson to ranger lieutenant sandridge camped at a water hole on the nueces with a squad of five men in preservation of law and order lieutenant sandridge turned a beautiful couleur de rose through his ordinary strawberry complexion tucked the letter in his hip pocket and chewed off the ends of his gamboge moustache the next morning he saddled his horse and rode alone to the mexican settlement at the lone wolf crossing of the frio twenty miles away six feet two blond as a viking quiet as a deacon dangerous as a machine gun sandridge moved among the jacales patiently seeking news of the cisco kid far more than the law the mexicans dreaded the cold and certain vengeance of the lone rider that the ranger sought it had been one of the kid s pastimes to shoot mexicans to see them kick if he demanded from them moribund terpsichorean feats simply that he might be entertained what terrible and extreme penalties would be certain to follow should they anger him one and all they lounged with upturned palms and shrugging shoulders filling the air with quien sabes and denials of the kid s acquaintance but there was a man named fink who kept a store at the crossing a man of many nationalities tongues interests and ways of thinking no use to ask them mexicans he said to sandridge they re afraid to tell this hombre they call the kid goodall is his name ain t it he s been in my store once or twice i have an idea you might run across him at but i guess i don t keer to say myself i m two seconds later in pulling a gun than i used to be and the difference is worth thinking about but this kid s got a half mexican girl at the crossing that he comes to see she lives in that jacal a hundred yards down the arroyo at the edge of the pear maybe she no i don t suppose she would but that jacal would be a good place to watch anyway sandridge rode down to the jacal of perez the sun was low and the broad shade of the great pear thicket already covered the grass thatched hut the goats were enclosed for the night in a brush corral near by a few kids walked the top of it nibbling the chaparral leaves the old mexican lay upon a blanket on the grass already in a stupor from his mescal and dreaming perhaps of the nights when he and pizarro touched glasses to their new world fortunes so old his wrinkled face seemed to proclaim him to be and in the door of the jacal stood tonia and lieutenant sandridge sat in his saddle staring at her like a gannet agape at a sailorman the cisco kid was a vain person as all eminent and successful assassins are and his bosom would have been ruffled had he known that at a simple exchange of glances two persons in whose minds he had been looming large suddenly abandoned at least for the time all thought of him never before had tonia seen such a man as this he seemed to be made of sunshine and blood red tissue and clear weather he seemed to illuminate the shadow of the pear when he smiled as though the sun were rising again the men she had known had been small and dark even the kid in spite of his achievements was a stripling no larger than herself with black straight hair and a cold marble face that chilled the noonday as for tonia though she sends description to the poorhouse let her make a millionaire of your fancy her blue black hair smoothly divided in the middle and bound close to her head and her large eyes full of the latin melancholy gave her the madonna touch her motions and air spoke of the concealed fire and the desire to charm that she had inherited from the gitanas of the basque province as for the humming bird part of her that dwelt in her heart you could not perceive it unless her bright red skirt and dark blue blouse gave you a symbolic hint of the vagarious bird the newly lighted sun god asked for a drink of water tonia brought it from the red jar hanging under the brush shelter sandridge considered it necessary to dismount so as to lessen the trouble of her ministrations i play no spy nor do i assume to master the thoughts of any human heart but i assert by the chronicler s right that before a quarter of an hour had sped sandridge was teaching her how to plaint a six strand rawhide stake rope and tonia had explained to him that were it not for her little english book that the peripatetic padre had given her and the little crippled chivo that she fed from a bottle she would be very very lonely indeed which leads to a suspicion that the kid s fences needed repairing and that the adjutant general s sarcasm had fallen upon unproductive soil in his camp by the water hole lieutenant sandridge announced and reiterated his intention of either causing the cisco kid to nibble the black loam of the frio country prairies or of haling him before a judge and jury that sounded business like twice a week he rode over to the lone wolf crossing of the frio and directed tonia s slim slightly lemon tinted fingers among the intricacies of the slowly growing lariata a six strand plait is hard to learn and easy to teach the ranger knew that he might find the kid there at any visit he kept his armament ready and had a frequent eye for the pear thicket at the rear of the jacal thus he might bring down the kite and the humming bird with one stone while the sunny haired ornithologist was pursuing his studies the cisco kid was also attending to his professional duties he moodily shot up a saloon in a small cow village on quintana creek killed the town marshal plugging him neatly in the centre of his tin badge and then rode away morose and unsatisfied no true artist is uplifted by shooting an aged man carrying an old style bulldog on his way the kid suddenly experienced the yearning that all men feel when wrong doing loses its keen edge of delight he yearned for the woman he loved to reassure him that she was his in spite of it he wanted her to call his bloodthirstiness bravery and his cruelty devotion he wanted tonia to bring him water from the red jar under the brush shelter and tell him how the chivo was thriving on the bottle the kid turned the speckled roan s head up the ten mile pear flat that stretches along the arroyo hondo until it ends at the lone wolf crossing of the frio the roan whickered for he had a sense of locality and direction equal to that of a belt line street car horse and he knew he would soon be nibbling the rich mesquite grass at the end of a forty foot stake rope while ulysses rested his head in circe s straw roofed hut more weird and lonesome than the journey of an amazonian explorer is the ride of one through a texas pear flat with dismal monotony and startling variety the uncanny and multiform shapes of the cacti lift their twisted trunks and fat bristly hands to encumber the way the demon plant appearing to live without soil or rain seems to taunt the parched traveller with its lush grey greenness it warps itself a thousand times about what look to be open and inviting paths only to lure the rider into blind and impassable spine defended bottoms of the bag leaving him to retreat if he can with the points of the compass whirling in his head to be lost in the pear is to die almost the death of the thief on the cross pierced by nails and with grotesque shapes of all the fiends hovering about but it was not so with the kid and his mount winding twisting circling tracing the most fantastic and bewildering trail ever picked out the good roan lessened the distance to the lone wolf crossing with every coil and turn that he made while they fared the kid sang he knew but one tune and sang it as he knew but one code and lived it and but one girl and loved her he was a single minded man of conventional ideas he had a voice like a coyote with bronchitis but whenever he chose to sing his song he sang it it was a conventional song of the camps and trail running at its beginning as near as may be to these words don t you monkey with my lulu girl or i ll tell you what i ll do and so on the roan was inured to it and did not mind but even the poorest singer will after a certain time gain his own consent to refrain from contributing to the world s noises so the kid by the time he was within a mile or two of tonia s jacal had reluctantly allowed his song to die away not because his vocal performance had become less charming to his own ears but because his laryngeal muscles were aweary as though he were in a circus ring the speckled roan wheeled and danced through the labyrinth of pear until at length his rider knew by certain landmarks that the lone wolf crossing was close at hand then where the pear was thinner he caught sight of the grass roof of the jacal and the hackberry tree on the edge of the arroyo a few yards farther the kid stopped the roan and gazed intently through the prickly openings then he dismounted dropped the roan s reins and proceeded on foot stooping and silent like an indian the roan knowing his part stood still making no sound the kid crept noiselessly to the very edge of the pear thicket and reconnoitred between the leaves of a clump of cactus ten yards from his hiding place in the shade of the jacal sat his tonia calmly plaiting a rawhide lariat so far she might surely escape condemnation women have been known from time to time to engage in more mischievous occupations but if all must be told there is to be added that her head reposed against the broad and comfortable chest of a tall red and yellow man and that his arm was about her guiding her nimble fingers that required so many lessons at the intricate six strand plait sandridge glanced quickly at the dark mass of pear when he heard a slight squeaking sound that was not altogether unfamiliar a gun scabbard will make that sound when one grasps the handle of a six shooter suddenly but the sound was not repeated and tonia s fingers needed close attention and then in the shadow of death they began to talk of their love and in the still july afternoon every word they uttered reached the ears of the kid remember then said tonia you must not come again until i send for you soon he will be here a vaquero at the tienda said to day he saw him on the guadalupe three days ago when he is that near he always comes if he comes and finds you here he will kill you so for my sake you must come no more until i send you the word all right said the stranger and then what and then said the girl you must bring your men here and kill him if not he will kill you he ain t a man to surrender that s sure said sandridge it s kill or be killed for the officer that goes up against mr cisco kid he must die said the girl otherwise there will not be any peace in the world for thee and me he has killed many let him so die bring your men and give him no chance to escape you used to think right much of him said sandridge tonia dropped the lariat twisted herself around and curved a lemon tinted arm over the ranger s shoulder but then she murmured in liquid spanish i had not beheld thee thou great red mountain of a man and thou art kind and good as well as strong could one choose him knowing thee let him die for then i will not be filled with fear by day and night lest he hurt thee or me how can i know when he comes asked sandridge when he comes said tonia he remains two days sometimes three gregorio the small son of old luisa the lavendera has a swift pony i will write a letter to thee and send it by him saying how it will be best to come upon him by gregorio will the letter come and bring many men with thee and have much care oh dear red one for the rattlesnake is not quicker to strike than is el chivato as they call him to send a ball from his pistola the kid s handy with his gun sure enough admitted sandridge but when i come for him i shall come alone i ll get him by myself or not at all the cap wrote one or two things to me that make me want to do the trick without any help you let me know when mr kid arrives and i ll do the rest i will send you the message by the boy gregorio said the girl i knew you were braver than that small slayer of men who never smiles how could i ever have thought i cared for him it was time for the ranger to ride back to his camp on the water hole before he mounted his horse he raised the slight form of tonia with one arm high from the earth for a parting salute the drowsy stillness of the torpid summer air still lay thick upon the dreaming afternoon the smoke from the fire in the jacal where the frijoles blubbered in the iron pot rose straight as a plumb line above the clay daubed chimney no sound or movement disturbed the serenity of the dense pear thicket ten yards away when the form of sandridge had disappeared loping his big dun down the steep banks of the frio crossing the kid crept back to his own horse mounted him and rode back along the tortuous trail he had come but not far he stopped and waited in the silent depths of the pear until half an hour had passed and then tonia heard the high untrue notes of his unmusical singing coming nearer and nearer and she ran to the edge of the pear to meet him the kid seldom smiled but he smiled and waved his hat when he saw her he dismounted and his girl sprang into his arms the kid looked at her fondly his thick black hair clung to his head like a wrinkled mat the meeting brought a slight ripple of some undercurrent of feeling to his smooth dark face that was usually as motionless as a clay mask how s my girl he asked holding her close sick of waiting so long for you dear one she answered my eyes are dim with always gazing into that devil s pincushion through which you come and i can see into it such a little way too but you are here beloved one and i will not scold que mal muchacho not to come to see your alma more often go in and rest and let me water your horse and stake him with the long rope there is cool water in the jar for you the kid kissed her affectionately not if the court knows itself do i let a lady stake my horse for me said he but if you ll run in chica and throw a pot of coffee together while i attend to the caballo i ll be a good deal obliged besides his marksmanship the kid had another attribute for which he admired himself greatly he was muy caballero as the mexicans express it where the ladies were concerned for them he had always gentle words and consideration he could not have spoken a harsh word to a woman he might ruthlessly slay their husbands and brothers but he could not have laid the weight of a finger in anger upon a woman wherefore many of that interesting division of humanity who had come under the spell of his politeness declared their disbelief in the stories circulated about mr kid one shouldn t believe everything one heard they said when confronted by their indignant men folk with proof of the caballero s deeds of infamy they said maybe he had been driven to it and that he knew how to treat a lady anyhow considering this extremely courteous idiosyncrasy of the kid and the pride he took in it one can perceive that the solution of the problem that was presented to him by what he saw and heard from his hiding place in the pear that afternoon at least as to one of the actors must have been obscured by difficulties and yet one could not think of the kid overlooking little matters of that kind at the end of the short twilight they gathered around a supper of frijoles goat steaks canned peaches and coffee by the light of a lantern in the jacal afterward the ancestor his flock corralled smoked a cigarette and became a mummy in a grey blanket tonia washed the few dishes while the kid dried them with the flour sacking towel her eyes shone she chatted volubly of the inconsequent happenings of her small world since the kid s last visit it was as all his other home comings had been then outside tonia swung in a grass hammock with her guitar and sang sad canciones de amor do you love me just the same old girl asked the kid hunting for his cigarette papers always the same little one said tonia her dark eyes lingering upon him i must go over to fink s said the kid rising for some tobacco i thought i had another sack in my coat i ll be back in a quarter of an hour hasten said tonia and tell me how long shall i call you my own this time will you be gone again to morrow leaving me to grieve or will you be longer with your tonia oh i might stay two or three days this trip said the kid yawning i ve been on the dodge for a month and i d like to rest up he was gone half an hour for his tobacco when he returned tonia was still lying in the hammock it s funny said the kid how i feel i feel like there was somebody lying behind every bush and tree waiting to shoot me i never had mullygrubs like them before maybe it s one of them presumptions i ve got half a notion to light out in the morning before day the guadalupe country is burning up about that old dutchman i plugged down there you are not afraid no one could make my brave little one fear well i haven t been usually regarded as a jack rabbit when it comes to scrapping but i don t want a posse smoking me out when i m in your jacal somebody might get hurt that oughtn t to remain with your tonia no one will find you here the kid looked keenly into the shadows up and down the arroyo and toward the dim lights of the mexican village i ll see how it looks later on was his decision at midnight a horseman rode into the rangers camp blazing his way by noisy halloes to indicate a pacific mission sandridge and one or two others turned out to investigate the row the rider announced himself to be domingo sales from the lone wolf crossing he bore a letter for senor sandridge old luisa the lavendera had persuaded him to bring it he said her son gregorio being too ill of a fever to ride sandridge lighted the camp lantern and read the letter these were its words dear one he has come hardly had you ridden away when he came out of the pear when he first talked he said he would stay three days or more then as it grew later he was like a wolf or a fox and walked about without rest looking and listening soon he said he must leave before daylight when it is dark and stillest and then he seemed to suspect that i be not true to him he looked at me so strange that i am frightened i swear to him that i love him his own tonia last of all he said i must prove to him i am true he thinks that even now men are waiting to kill him as he rides from my house to escape he says he will dress in my clothes my red skirt and the blue waist i wear and the brown mantilla over the head and thus ride away but before that he says that i must put on his clothes his pantalones and camisa and hat and ride away on his horse from the jacal as far as the big road beyond the crossing and back again this before he goes so he can tell if i am true and if men are hidden to shoot him it is a terrible thing an hour before daybreak this is to be come my dear one and kill this man and take me for your tonia do not try to take hold of him alive but kill him quickly knowing all you should do that you must come long before the time and hide yourself in the little shed near the jacal where the wagon and saddles are kept it is dark in there he will wear my red skirt and blue waist and brown mantilla i send you a hundred kisses come surely and shoot quickly and straight thine own tonia sandridge quickly explained to his men the official part of the missive the rangers protested against his going alone i ll get him easy enough said the lieutenant the girl s got him trapped and don t even think he ll get the drop on me sandridge saddled his horse and rode to the lone wolf crossing he tied his big dun in a clump of brush on the arroyo took his winchester from its scabbard and carefully approached the perez jacal there was only the half of a high moon drifted over by ragged milk white gulf clouds the wagon shed was an excellent place for ambush and the ranger got inside it safely in the black shadow of the brush shelter in front of the jacal he could see a horse tied and hear him impatiently pawing the hard trodden earth he waited almost an hour before two figures came out of the jacal one in man s clothes quickly mounted the horse and galloped past the wagon shed toward the crossing and village and then the other figure in skirt waist and mantilla over its head stepped out into the faint moonlight gazing after the rider sandridge thought he would take his chance then before tonia rode back he fancied she might not care to see it throw up your hands he ordered loudly stepping out of the wagon shed with his winchester at his shoulder there was a quick turn of the figure but no movement to obey so the ranger pumped in the bullets one two three and then twice more for you never could be too sure of bringing down the cisco kid there was no danger of missing at ten paces even in that half moonlight the old ancestor asleep on his blanket was awakened by the shots listening further he heard a great cry from some man in mortal distress or anguish and rose up grumbling at the disturbing ways of moderns the tall red ghost of a man burst into the jacal reaching one hand shaking like a tule reed for the lantern hanging on its nail the other spread a letter on the table look at this letter perez cried the man who wrote it ah dios it is senor sandridge mumbled the old man approaching pues senor that letter was written by el chivato as he is called by the man of tonia they say he is a bad man i do not know while tonia slept he wrote the letter and sent it by this old hand of mine to domingo sales to be brought to you is there anything wrong in the letter i am very old and i did not know valgame dios it is a very foolish world and there is nothing in the house to drink nothing to drink just then all that sandridge could think of to do was to go outside and throw himself face downward in the dust by the side of his humming bird of whom not a feather fluttered he was not a caballero by instinct and he could not understand the niceties of revenge a mile away the rider who had ridden past the wagon shed struck up a harsh untuneful song the words of which began don t you monkey with my lulu girl or i ll tell you what i ll do the sphinx apple twenty miles out from paradise and fifteen miles short of sunrise city bildad rose the stage driver stopped his team a furious snow had been falling all day eight inches it measured now on a level the remainder of the road was not without peril in daylight creeping along the ribs of a bijou range of ragged mountains now when both snow and night masked its dangers further travel was not to be thought of said bildad rose so he pulled up his four stout horses and delivered to his five passengers oral deductions of his wisdom judge menefee to whom men granted leadership and the initiatory as upon a silver salver sprang from the coach at once four of his fellow passengers followed inspired by his example ready to explore to objurgate to resist to submit to proceed according as their prime factor might be inclined to sway them the fifth passenger a young woman remained in the coach bildad had halted upon the shoulder of the first mountain spur two rail fences ragged black hemmed the road fifty yards above the upper fence showing a dark blot in the white drifts stood a small house upon this house descended or rather ascended judge menefee and his cohorts with boyish whoops born of the snow and stress they called they pounded at window and door at the inhospitable silence they waxed restive they assaulted and forced the pregnable barriers and invaded the premises the watchers from the coach heard stumblings and shoutings from the interior of the ravaged house before long a light within flickered glowed flamed high and bright and cheerful then came running back through the driving flakes the exuberant explorers more deeply pitched than the clarion even orchestral in volume the voice of judge menefee proclaimed the succour that lay in apposition with their state of travail the one room of the house was uninhabited he said and bare of furniture but it contained a great fireplace and they had discovered an ample store of chopped wood in a lean to at the rear housing and warmth against the shivering night were thus assured for the placation of bildad rose there was news of a stable not ruined beyond service with hay in a loft near the house gentlemen cried bildad rose from his seat swathed in coats and robes tear me down two panels of that fence so i can drive in that is old man redruth s shanty i thought we must be nigh it they took him to the foolish house in august cheerfully the four passengers sprang at the snow capped rails the exhorted team tugged the coach up the slant to the door of the edifice from which a mid summer madness had ravished its proprietor the driver and two of the passengers began to unhitch judge menefee opened the door of the coach and removed his hat i have to announce miss garland said he the enforced suspension of our journey the driver asserts that the risk in travelling the mountain road by night is too great even to consider it will be necessary to remain in the shelter of this house until morning i beg that you will feel that there is nothing to fear beyond a temporary inconvenience i have personally inspected the house and find that there are means to provide against the rigour of the weather at least you shall be made as comfortable as possible permit me to assist you to alight to the judge s side came the passenger whose pursuit in life was the placing of the little goliath windmill his name was dunwoody but that matters not much in travelling merely from paradise to sunrise city one needs little or no name still one who would seek to divide honours with judge madison l menefee deserves a cognomenal peg upon which fame may hang a wreath thus spake loudly and buoyantly the aerial miller guess you ll have to climb out of the ark mrs mcfarland this wigwam isn t exactly the palmer house but it turns snow and they won t search your grip for souvenir spoons when you leave we ve got a fire going and we ll fix you up with dry tilbys and keep the mice away anyhow all right all right one of the two passengers who were struggling in a melee of horses harness snow and the sarcastic injunctions of bildad rose called loudly from the whirl of his volunteer duties say some of you fellows get miss solomon into the house will you whoa there you confounded brute again must it be gently urged that in travelling from paradise to sunrise city an accurate name is prodigality when judge menefee sanctioned to the act by his grey hair and widespread repute had introduced himself to the lady passenger she had herself sweetly breathed a name in response that the hearing of the male passengers had variously interpreted in the not unjealous spirit of rivalry that eventuated each clung stubbornly to his own theory for the lady passenger to have reasseverated or corrected would have seemed didactic if not unduly solicitous of a specific acquaintance therefore the lady passenger permitted herself to be garlanded and mcfarlanded and solomoned with equal and discreet complacency it is thirty five miles from paradise to sunrise city compagnon de voyage is name enough by the gripsack of the wandering jew for so brief a journey soon the little party of wayfarers were happily seated in a cheerful arc before the roaring fire the robes cushions and removable portions of the coach had been brought in and put to service the lady passenger chose a place near the hearth at one end of the arc there she graced almost a throne that her subjects had prepared she sat upon cushions and leaned against an empty box and barrel robe bespread which formed a defence from the invading draughts she extended her feet delectably shod to the cordial heat she ungloved her hands but retained about her neck her long fur boa the unstable flames half revealed while the warding boa half submerged her face a youthful face altogether feminine clearly moulded and calm with beauty s unchallenged confidence chivalry and manhood were here vying to please and comfort her she seemed to accept their devoirs not piquantly as one courted and attended nor preeningly as many of her sex unworthily reap their honours not yet stolidly as the ox receives his hay but concordantly with nature s own plan as the lily ingests the drop of dew foreordained to its refreshment outside the wind roared mightily the fine snow whizzed through the cracks the cold besieged the backs of the immolated six but the elements did not lack a champion that night judge menefee was attorney for the storm the weather was his client and he strove by special pleading to convince his companions in that frigid jury box that they sojourned in a bower of roses beset only by benignant zephyrs he drew upon a fund of gaiety wit and anecdote sophistical but crowned with success his cheerfulness communicated itself irresistibly each one hastened to contribute his own quota toward the general optimism even the lady passenger was moved to expression i think it is quite charming she said in her slow crystal tones at intervals some one of the passengers would rise and humorously explore the room there was little evidence to be collected of its habitation by old man redruth bildad rose was called upon vivaciously for the ex hermit s history now since the stage driver s horses were fairly comfortable and his passengers appeared to be so peace and comity returned to him the old didapper began bildad somewhat irreverently infested this here house about twenty year he never allowed nobody to come nigh him he d duck his head inside and slam the door whenever a team drove along there was spinning wheels up in his loft all right he used to buy his groceries and tobacco at sam tilly s store on the little muddy last august he went up there dressed in a red bedquilt and told sam he was king solomon and that the queen of sheba was coming to visit him he fetched along all the money he had a little bag full of silver and dropped it in sam s well she won t come says old man redruth to sam if she knows i ve got any money as soon as folks heard he had that sort of a theory about women and money they knowed he was crazy so they sent down and packed him to the foolish asylum was there a romance in his life that drove him to a solitary existence asked one of the passengers a young man who had an agency no said bildad not that i ever heard spoke of just ordinary trouble they say he had had unfortunateness in the way of love derangements with a young lady when he was young before he contracted red bed quilts and had his financial conclusions disqualified i never heard of no romance ah exclaimed judge menefee impressively a case of unrequited affection no doubt no sir returned bildad not at all she never married him marmaduke mulligan down at paradise seen a man once that come from old redruth s town he said redruth was a fine young man but when you kicked him on the pocket all you could hear jingle was a cuff fastener and a bunch of keys he was engaged to this young lady miss alice something was her name i ve forgot this man said she was the kind of girl you like to have reach across you in a car to pay the fare well there come to the town a young chap all affluent and easy and fixed up with buggies and mining stock and leisure time although she was a staked claim miss alice and the new entry seemed to strike a mutual kind of a clip they had calls and coincidences of going to the post office and such things as sometimes make a girl send back the engagement ring and other presents a rift within the loot the poetry man calls it one day folks seen redruth and miss alice standing talking at the gate then he lifts his hat and walks away and that was the last anybody in that town seen of him as far as this man knew what about the young lady asked the young man who had an agency never heard answered bildad right there is where my lode of information turns to an old spavined crowbait and folds its wings for i ve pumped it dry a very sad began judge menefee but his remark was curtailed by a higher authority what a charming story said the lady passenger in flute like tones a little silence followed except for the wind and the crackling of the fire the men were seated upon the floor having slightly mitigated its inhospitable surface with wraps and stray pieces of boards the man who was placing little goliath windmills arose and walked about to ease his cramped muscles suddenly a triumphant shout came from him he hurried back from a dusky corner of the room bearing aloft something in his hand it was an apple a large red mottled firm pippin pleasing to behold in a paper bag on a high shelf in that corner he had found it it could have been no relic of the lovewrecked redruth for its glorious soundness repudiated the theory that it had lain on that musty shelf since august no doubt some recent bivouackers lunching in the deserted house had left it there dunwoody again his exploits demand for him the honours of nomenclature flaunted his apple in the faces of his fellow marooners see what i found mrs mcfarland he cried vaingloriously he held the apple high up in the light of the fire where it glowed a still richer red the lady passenger smiled calmly always calmly what a charming apple she murmured clearly for a brief space judge menefee felt crushed humiliated relegated second place galled him why had this blatant obtrusive unpolished man of windmills been selected by fate instead of himself to discover the sensational apple he could have made of the act a scene a function a setting for some impromptu fanciful discourse or piece of comedy and have retained the role of cynosure actually the lady passenger was regarding this ridiculous dunboddy or woodbundy with an admiring smile as if the fellow had performed a feat and the windmill man swelled and gyrated like a sample of his own goods puffed up with the wind that ever blows from the chorus land toward the domain of the star while the transported dunwoody with his aladdin s apple was receiving the fickle attentions of all the resourceful jurist formed a plan to recover his own laurels

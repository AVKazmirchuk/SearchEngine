loan in those days the cattlemen were the anointed they were the grandees of the grass kings of the kine lords of the lea barons of beef and bone they might have ridden in golden chariots had their tastes so inclined the cattleman was caught in a stampede of dollars it seemed to him that he had more money than was decent but when he had bought a watch with precious stones set in the case so large that they hurt his ribs and a california saddle with silver nails and angora skin suaderos and ordered everybody up to the bar for whisky what else was there for him to spend money for not so circumscribed in expedient for the reduction of surplus wealth were those lairds of the lariat who had womenfolk to their name in the breast of the rib sprung sex the genius of purse lightening may slumber through years of inopportunity but never my brothers does it become extinct so out of the chaparral came long bill longley from the bar circle branch on the frio a wife driven man to taste the urban joys of success something like half a million dollars he had with an income steadily increasing long bill was a graduate of the camp and trail luck and thrift a cool head and a telescopic eye for mavericks had raised him from cowboy to be a cowman then came the boom in cattle and fortune stepping gingerly among the cactus thorns came and emptied her cornucopia at the doorstep of the ranch in the little frontier city of chaparosa longley built a costly residence here he became a captive bound to the chariot of social existence he was doomed to become a leading citizen he struggled for a time like a mustang in his first corral and then he hung up his quirt and spurs time hung heavily on his hands he organised the first national bank of chaparosa and was elected its president one day a dyspeptic man wearing double magnifying glasses inserted an official looking card between the bars of the cashier s window of the first national bank five minutes later the bank force was dancing at the beck and call of a national bank examiner this examiner mr j edgar todd proved to be a thorough one at the end of it all the examiner put on his hat and called the president mr william r longley into the private office well how do you find things asked longley in his slow deep tones any brands in the round up you didn t like the looks of the bank checks up all right mr longley said todd and i find your loans in very good shape with one exception you are carrying one very bad bit of paper one that is so bad that i have been thinking that you surely do not realise the serious position it places you in i refer to a call loan of made to thomas merwin not only is the amount in excess of the maximum sum the bank can loan any individual legally but it is absolutely without endorsement or security thus you have doubly violated the national banking laws and have laid yourself open to criminal prosecution by the government a report of the matter to the comptroller of the currency which i am bound to make would i am sure result in the matter being turned over to the department of justice for action you see what a serious thing it is bill longley was leaning his lengthy slowly moving frame back in his swivel chair his hands were clasped behind his head and he turned a little to look the examiner in the face the examiner was surprised to see a smile creep about the rugged mouth of the banker and a kindly twinkle in his light blue eyes if he saw the seriousness of the affair it did not show in his countenance of course you don t know tom merwin said longley almost genially yes i know about that loan it hasn t any security except tom merwin s word somehow i ve always found that when a man s word is good it s the best security there is oh yes i know the government doesn t think so i guess i ll see tom about that note mr todd s dyspepsia seemed to grow suddenly worse he looked at the chaparral banker through his double magnifying glasses in amazement you see said longley easily explaining the thing away tom heard of head of two year olds down near rocky ford on the rio grande that could be had for a head i reckon twas one of old leandro garcia s outfits that he had smuggled over and he wanted to make a quick turn on em those cattle are worth on the hoof in kansas city tom knew it and i knew it he had and i let him have the to make the deal with his brother ed took em on to market three weeks ago he ought to be back most any day now with the money when he comes tom ll pay that note the bank examiner was shocked it was perhaps his duty to step out to the telegraph office and wire the situation to the comptroller but he did not he talked pointedly and effectively to longley for three minutes he succeeded in making the banker understand that he stood upon the border of a catastrophe and then he offered a tiny loophole of escape i am going to hilldale s to night he told longley to examine a bank there i will pass through chaparosa on my way back at twelve o clock to morrow i shall call at this bank if this loan has been cleared out of the way by that time it will not be mentioned in my report if not i will have to

wanted the way i feel put into words you ve done it i want to take chances on what s coming suppose we have a bottle of moselle with the next course agreed said ives i m glad you catch my idea it will increase the animosity of the house toward the loser if it does not weary you we will pursue the theme only a few times have i met a true venturer one who does not ask a schedule and map from fate when he begins a journey but as the world becomes more civilized and wiser the more difficult it is to come upon an adventure the end of which you cannot foresee in the elizabethan days you could assault the watch wring knockers from doors and have a jolly set to with the blades in any convenient angle of a wall and get away with it nowadays if you speak disrespectfully to a policeman all that is left to the most romantic fancy is to conjecture in what particular police station he will land you i know i know said forster nodding approval i returned to new york to day continued ives from a three years ramble around the globe things are not much better abroad than they are at home the whole world seems to be overrun by conclusions the only thing that interests me greatly is a premise i ve tried shooting big game in africa i know what an express rifle will do at so many yards and when an elephant or a rhinoceros falls to the bullet i enjoy it about as much as i did when i was kept in after school to do a sum in long division on the blackboard i know i know said forster there might be something in aeroplanes went on ives reflectively i ve tried ballooning but it seems to be merely a cut and dried affair of wind and ballast women suggested forster with a smile three months ago said ives i was pottering around in one of the bazaars in constantinople i noticed a lady veiled of course but with a pair of especially fine eyes visible who was examining some amber and pearl ornaments at one of the booths with her was an attendant a big nubian as black as coal after a while the attendant drew nearer to me by degrees and slipped a scrap of paper into my hand i looked at it when i got a chance on it was scrawled hastily in pencil the arched gate of the nghtingale garden at nine to night does that appear to you to be an interesting premise mr forster i made inquiries and learned that the nightingale garden was the property of an old turk a grand vizier or something of the sort of course i prospected for the arched gate and was there at nine the same nubian attendant opened the gate promptly on time and i went inside and sat on a bench by a perfumed fountain with the veiled lady we had quite an extended chat she was myrtle thompson a lady journalist who was writing up the turkish harems for a chicago newspaper she said she noticed the new york cut of my clothes in the bazaar and wondered if i couldn t work something into the metropolitan papers about it i see said forster i see i ve canoed through canada said ives down many rapids and over many falls but i didn t seem to get what i wanted out of it because i knew there were only two possible outcomes i would either go to the bottom or arrive at the sea level i ve played all games at cards but the mathematicians have spoiled that sport by computing the percentages i ve made acquaintances on trains i ve answered advertisements i ve rung strange door bells i ve taken every chance that presented itself but there has always been the conventional ending the logical conclusion to the premise i know repeated forster i ve felt it all but i ve had few chances to take my chance at chances is there any life so devoid of impossibilities as life in this city there seems to be a myriad of opportunities for testing the undeterminable but not one in a thousand fails to land you where you expected it to stop i wish the subways and street cars disappointed one as seldom the sun has risen said ives on the arabian nights there are no more caliphs the fisherman s vase is turned to a vacuum bottle warranted to keep any genie boiling or frozen for forty eight hours life moves by rote science has killed adventure there are no more opportunities such as columbus and the man who ate the first oyster had the only certain thing is that there is nothing uncertain well said forster my experience has been the limited one of a city man i haven t seen the world as you have but it seems that we view it with the same opinion but i tell you i am grateful for even this little venture of ours into the borders of the haphazard there may be at least one breathless moment when the bill for the dinner is presented perhaps after all the pilgrims who traveled without scrip or purse found a keener taste to life than did the knights of the round table who rode abroad with a retinue and king arthur s certified checks in the lining of their helmets and now if you ve finished your coffee suppose we match one of your insufficient coins for the impending blow of fate what have i up heads called ives heads it is said forster lifting his hand i lose we forgot to agree upon a plan for the winner to escape i suggest that when the waiter comes you make a remark about telephoning to a friend

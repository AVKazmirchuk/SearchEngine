as a product of its soil six years earlier this county had removed the wheat straw from between its huckle berry stained teeth and emitted a derisive and bucolic laugh as old man walmsley s freckle faced bob abandoned the certain three per diem meals of the one horse farm for the discontinuous quick lunch counters of the three ringed metropolis at the end of the six years no murder trial coaching party au tomobile accident or cotillion was complete in which the name of robert walmsley did not figure tailors waylaid him in the street to get a new wrinkle from the cut of his unwrinkled trousers hyphenated fel lows in the clubs and members of the oldest subpoenaed families were glad to clap him on the back and allow him three letters of his name but the matterhorn of robert walmsley s success was not scaled until be married alicia van der pool i cite the matterhorn for just so high and cool and white and inaccessible was this daughter of the old burghers the social alps that ranged about her over whose bleak passes a thousand climbers struggled reached only to her knees she towered in her own atmosphere serene chaste prideful wading in no fountains dining no monkeys breeding no dogs for bench shows she was a van der pool fountains were made to play for her monkeys were made for other people s ancestors dogs she understood were created to be companions of blind persons and objec tionable characters who smoked pipes this was the matterhorn that robert walmsley accomplished if he found with the good poet with the game foot and artificially curled hair that he who ascends to mountain tops will find the loftiest peaks most wrapped in clouds and snow he concealed his chilblains beneath a brave and smiling exterior he was a lucky man and knew it even though he were imitating the spartan boy with an ice cream freezer beneath his doublet frappeeing the region of his heart after a brief wedding tour abroad the couple re turned to create a decided ripple in the calm cistern so placid and cool and sunless it is of the best so ciety they entertained at their red brick mausoleum of ancient greatness in an old square that is a ceme tery of crumbled glory and robert walmsley was proud of his wife although while one of his hands shook his guests the other held tightly to his alpen stock and thermometer one day alicia found a letter written to robert by his

direct from the soil straight from home full of biographies of bees tales of turnips peaans of new laid eggs neg lected parents and the slump in dried apples why have i not been shown your mother s let ters asked alicia there was always something in her voice that made you think of lorgnettes of ac counts at tiffany s of sledges smoothly gliding on the trail from dawson to forty mile of the tinkling of pendant prisms on your grandmothers chandeliers of snow lying on a convent roof of a police sergeant refusing bail your mother continued alicia invites us to make a visit to the farm i have never seen a farm we will go there for a week or two robert we will said robert with the grand air of an associate supreme justice concurring in an opinion i did not lay the invitation before you because i thought you would not care to go i am much pleased at your decision i will write to her myself answered alicia with a faint foreshadowing of enthusiasm felice shall pack my trunks at once seven i think will be enough i do not suppose that your mother entertains a great deal does she give many house parties robert arose and as attorney for rural places filed a demurrer against six of the seven trunks he en deavored to define picture elucidate set forth and describe a farm his own words sounded strange in his ears he had not realized how thoroughly urbsi dized he had become a week

over to meet you it ain t six o clock yet you know i m glad to see you tom said robert grasp ing his brother s band yes i ve found my way at last you ve a right to say at last it s been over two years since the last time but it will be oftener after this my boy alicia cool in the summer beat as an arctic wraith white as a norse snow maiden in her flimsy muslin and fluttering lace parasol came round the corner of the station and tom was stripped of his assurance he became chiefly eyesight clothed in blue jeans and on the homeward drive to the mule alone did he confide in language the inwardness of his thoughts they drove homeward the low sun dropped a spendthrift flood of gold upon the fortunate fields of wheat the cities were far away the road lay curl ing around wood and dale and bill like

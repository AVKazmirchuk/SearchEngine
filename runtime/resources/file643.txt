her quick smile and upturned happy eyes as bright and clear as the water in trout pools the eyes were saying that they had the right to be shining and happy for was their owner not with her for the present man her gentleman friend and holder of the keys to the enchanted city of fun blinker did not read her look accurately but by some miracle he suddenly saw coney aright he no longer saw a mass of vulgarians seeking gross joys he now looked clearly upon a hundred thousand true idealists their offenses were wiped out counterfeit and false though the garish joys of these spangled temples were he perceived that deep under the gilt surface they offered saving and apposite balm and satisfaction to the restless human heart here at least was the husk of romance the empty but shining casque of chivalry the breath catching though safe guarded dip and flight of adventure the magic carpet that transports you to the realms of fairyland though its journey be trough but a few poor yards of space he no longer saw a rabble but his brothers seeking the ideal there was no magic of poesy here or of art but the glamour of their imagination turned yellow calico into cloth of gold and the megaphones into the silver trumpets of joy s heralds almost humbled blinker rolled up the shirt sleeves of his mind and joined the idealists you are the lady doctor he said to florence how shall we go about doing this jolly conglomeration of fairy tales incorporated we will begin there said the princess pointing to a fun pagoda on the edge of the sea and we will take there all in one by one they caught the eight o clock returning boat and sat filled with pleasant fatigue against the rail in the bow listening to the italians fiddle and harp blinker had thrown off all care the north woods seemed to him an uninhabitable wilderness what a fuss he had made over signing his name pooh he could sign it a hundred times and her name was as pretty as she was florence he said it to himself a great many times as the boat was nearing its pier in the north river a two funnelled drab foreign looking sea going steamer was dropping down toward the bay the boat turned its nose in toward its slip the steamer veered as if to seek midstream and then yawed seemed to increase its speed and struck the coney boat on the side near the stern cutting into it with a terrifying shock and crash while the six hundred passengers on the boat were mostly tumbling about the decks in a shrieking panic the captain was shouting at the steamer that it should not back off and leave the rent exposed for the water to enter but the steamer tore its way out like a savage sawfish and cleaved its heartless way full speed ahead the boat began to sink at its stern but moved slowly toward the slip the passengers were a frantic mob unpleasant to behold blinker held florence tightly until the boat had righted itself she made no sound or sign of fear he stood on a camp stool ripped off the slats above his head and pulled down a number of the life preservers he began to buckle one around florence the rotten canvas split and the fraudulent granulated cork came pouring out in a stream florence caught a handful of it and laughed gleefully it looks like breakfast food she said take it off they re no good she unbuckled it and threw it on the deck she made blinker sit down and sat by his side and put her hand in his what ll you bet we don t reach the pier all right she said and began to hum a song and now the captain moved among the passengers and compelled order the boat would undoubtedly make her slip he said and ordered the women and children to the bow where they could land first the boat very low in the water at the stern tried gallantly to make his promise good florence said blinker as she held him close by an arm and hand i love you that s what they all say she replied lightly i am not one of they all he persisted i never knew any one i could love before i could pass my life with you and be happy every day i am rich i can make things all right for you that s what they all say said the girl again weaving the words into her little reckless song don t say that again said blinker in a tone that made her look at him in frank surprise why shouldn t i say it she asked calmly they all do who are they he asked jealous for the first time in his existence why the fellows i know do you know so many oh well i m not a wall flower she answered with modest complacency where do you see these these men at your home of course not i meet them just as i did you sometimes on the boat sometimes in the park sometimes on the street i m a pretty good judge of a man i can tell in a minute if a fellow is one who is likely to get fresh what do you mean by fresh why try to kiss you me i mean do any of them try that asked blinker clenching his teeth sure all men do you know that do you allow them some not many they won t take you out anywhere unless you do she turned her head and looked searchingly at blinker her eyes were as innocent as a child s there was a puzzled look in them as though she did not understand him what s wrong about

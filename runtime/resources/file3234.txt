was no adelina patti not even on the fare wellest of the diva s farewell tours she had a cooing little voice like that of a turtle dove that could almost fill the parlor when the windows and doors were closed and betty was not rattling the lids of the stove in the kitchen she had a gamut that i estimate at about eight inches on the piano and her runs and trills sounded like the clothes bubbling in your grandmother s iron wash pot believe that she must have been beautiful when i tell you that it sounded like music to us she must have been beautiful when i tell you that it sounded like music to us ileen s musical taste was catholic she would sing through a pile of sheet music on the left hand top of the piano laying each slaughtered composition on the right hand top the next evening she would sing from right to left her favorites were mendelssohn and moody and sankey by request she always wound up with sweet violets and when the leaves begin to turn when we left at ten o clock the three of us would go down to jacks little wooden station and sit on the platform swinging our feet and trying to pump one another for dews as to which way miss ileen s inclinations seemed to lean that is the way of rivals they do not avoid and glower at one another they convene and converse and construe striving by the art politic to estimate the strength of the enemy one day there came a dark horse to paloma a young lawyer who at once flaunted his shingle and himself spectacularly upon the town his name was c vincent vesey you could see at a glance that he was a recent graduate of a southwestern law school his prince albert coat light striped trousers broad brimmed soft black hat and narrow white muslin bow tie proclaimed that more loudly than any diploma could vesey was a compound of daniel webster lord chesterfield beau brummell and little jack horner his coming boomed paloma the next day after he arrived an addition to the town was surveyed and laid off in lots of course vesey to further his professional fortunes must mingle with the citizenry and outliers of paloma and as well as with the soldier men he was bound to seek popularity with the gay dogs of the place so jacks and bud cunningham and i came to be honored by his acquaintance the doctrine of predestination would have been discredited had not vesey seen ileen hinkle and become fourth in the tourney magnificently he boarded at the yellow pine hotel instead of at the parisian restaurant but he came to be a formidable visitor in the hinkle parlor his competition reduced bud to an inspired increase of profanity drove jacks to an outburst of slang so weird that it sounded more horrible than the most trenchant of bud s imprecations and made me dumb with gloom for vesey had the rhetoric words flowed from him like oil from a gusher hyperbole compliment praise appreciation honeyed gallantry golden opinions eulogy and unveiled panegyric vied with one another for pre eminence in his speech we had small hopes that ileen could resist his oratory and prince albert but a day came that gave us courage about dusk one evening i was sitting on the little gallery in front of the hinkle parlor waiting for ileen to come when i heard voices inside she had come into the room with her father and old man hinkle began to talk to her i had observed before that he was a shrewd man and not unphilosophic ily said he i notice there s three or four young fellers that have been callin to see you regular for quite a while is there any one of em you like better than another why pa she answered i like all of em very well i think mr cuninngham and mr jacks and mr harris are very nice young men they are so frank and honest in everything they say to me i haven t known mr vesey very long but i think he s a very nice young man he s so frank and honest in everything he says to me now that s what i m gittin at says old hinkle you ve always been sayin you like people what tell the truth and don t go humbuggin you with compliments and bogus talk now suppose you make a test of these fellers and see which one of em will talk the straightest to you but how ll i do it pa i ll tell you how you know you sing a little bit ily you took music lessons nearly two years in logansport it wasn t long but it was all we could afford then and your teacher said you didn t have any voice and it was a waste of money to keep on now suppose you ask the fellers what they think of your singin and see what each one of em tells you the man that ll tell you the truth about it ll have a mighty lot of nerve and ll do to tie to what do you think of the plan all right pa said ileen i think it s a good idea i ll try it ileen and mr hinkle went out of the room through the inside doors unobserved i hurried down to the station jacks was at his telegraph table waiting for eight o clock to come it was bud s night in town and when he rode in i repeated the conversation to them both i was loyal to my rivals as all true admirers of all ileens should be simultaneously the three of us were smitten by an uplifting thought surely this test would eliminate vesey from the contest he with his unctuous flattery would be driven from the lists well we remembered ileen s love of frankness and honesty how she treasured truth and candor above vain compliment and blandishment linking arms we did a grotesque dance of joy up and down the platform singing muldoon was a solid man at the top of our voices that evening four of the willow rocking chairs were filled besides the lucky one that sustained the trim figure of miss hinkle three of us awaited with suppressed excitement the application of the test it was tried on bud first mr cunningham said ileen with her dazzling smile after she had sung when the leaves begin to turn what do you really think of my voice frankly and honestly now as you know i want you to always be toward me bud squirmed in his chair at his chance to show the sincerity that he knew was required of him tell you the truth miss ileen he said earnestly you ain t got much more voice than a weasel just a little squeak you know of course we all like to hear you sing for it s kind of sweet and soothin after all and you look most as mighty well sittin on the piano stool as you do faced around but as for real singin i reckon you couldn t call it that i looked closely at ileen to see if bud had overdone his frankness but her pleased smile and sweetly spoken thanks assured me that we were on the right track and what do you think mr jacks she asked next take it from me said jacks you ain t in the prima donna class i ve heard em warble in every city in the united states and i tell you your vocal output don t go otherwise you ve got the grand opera bunch sent to the soap factory in looks i mean for the high screechers generally look like mary ann on her thursday out but nix for the gargle work your epiglottis ain t a real side stepper its footwork ain t good with a merry laugh at jacks criticism ileen looked inquiringly at me i admit that i faltered a little was there not such a thing as being too frank perhaps i even hedged a little in my verdict but i stayed with the critics i am not skilled in scientific music miss ileen i said but frankly i cannot praise very highly the singing voice that nature has given you it has long been a favorite comparison that a great singer sings like a bird well there are birds and birds i would say that your voice reminds me of the thrush s throaty and not strong nor of much compass or variety but still er sweet in er its way and er thank you mr harris interrupted miss hinkle i knew i could depend upon your frankness and honesty and then c vincent vesey drew back one sleeve from his snowy cuff and the water came down at lodore my memory cannot do justice to his masterly tribute to that priceless god given treasure miss hinkle s voice he raved over it in terms that if they had been addressed to the morning stars when they sang together would have made that stellar choir explode in a meteoric shower of flaming self satisfaction he marshalled on his white finger tips the grand opera stars of all the continents from jenny lind to emma abbott only to depreciate their endowments he spoke of larynxes of chest notes of phrasing arpeggios and other strange paraphernalia of the throaty art he admitted as though driven to a corner that jenny lind had a note or two in the high register that miss hinkle had not yet acquired but that was a mere matter of practice and training and as a peroration he predicted solemnly predicted a career in vocal art for the coming star of the southwest and one of which grand old texas may well be proud hitherto unsurpassed in the annals of musical history when we left at ten ileen gave each of us her usual warm cordial handshake entrancing smile and invitation to call again i could not see that one was favored above or below another but three of us knew we knew we knew that frankness and honesty had won and that the rivals now numbered three instead of four down at the station jacks brought out a pint bottle of the proper stuff and we celebrated the downfall of a blatant interloper four days went by without anything happening worthy of recount on the fifth jacks and i entering the brush arbor for our supper saw the mexican youth instead of a divinity in a spotless waist and a navy blue skirt taking in the dollars through the barbed wire wicket we rushed into the kitchen meeting pa hinkle coming out with two cups of hot coffee in his hands where s ileen we asked in recitative pa hinkle was a kindly man well gents said he it was a sudden notion she took but i ve got the money and i let her have her way she s gone to a corn a conservatory in boston for four years for to have her voice cultivated now excuse me to pass gents for this coffee s hot and my thumbs is tender that night there were four instead of three of us sitting on the station platform and swinging our feet c vincent vesey was one of us we discussed things while dogs barked at the moon that rose as big as a five cent piece or a flour barrel over the chaparral and what we discussed was whether it is better to lie to a woman or to tell her the truth and as all of us were young then we did not come to a decision roads of destiny roads of destiny i go to seek on many roads what is to be true heart and strong with love to light will they not bear me in the fight to order shun or wield or mould my destiny unpublished poems of david mignot the song was over the words were david s the air one of the countryside the company about the inn table applauded heartily for the young poet paid for the wine only the notary m papineau shook his head a little at the lines for he was a man of books and he had not drunk with the rest david went out into the village street where the night air drove the wine vapour from his head and then he remembered that he and yvonne had quarrelled that day and that he had resolved to leave his home that night to seek fame and honour in the great world outside when my poems are on every man s tongue he told himself in a fine exhilaration she will perhaps think of the hard words she spoke this day except the roisterers in the tavern the village folk were abed david crept softly into his room in the shed of his father s cottage and made a bundle of his small store of clothing with this upon a staff he set his face outward upon the road that ran from vernoy he passed his father s herd of sheep huddled in their nightly pen the sheep he herded daily leaving them to scatter while he wrote verses on scraps of paper he saw a light yet shining in yvonne s window and a weakness shook his purpose of a sudden perhaps that light meant that she rued sleepless her anger and that morning might but no his decision was made vernoy was no place for him not one soul there could share his thoughts out along that road lay his fate and his future three leagues across the dim moonlit champaign ran the road straight as a ploughman s furrow it was believed in the village that the road ran to paris at least and this name the poet whispered often to himself as he walked never so far from vernoy had david travelled before the left branch three leagues then the road ran and turned into a puzzle it joined with another and a larger road at right angles david stood uncertain for a while and then took the road to the left upon this more important highway were imprinted in the dust wheel tracks left by the recent passage of some vehicle some half an hour later these traces were verified by the sight of a ponderous carriage mired in a little brook at the bottom of a steep hill the driver and postilions were shouting and tugging at the horses bridles on the road at one side stood a huge black clothed man and a slender lady wrapped in a long light cloak david saw the lack of skill in the efforts of the servants he quietly assumed control of the work he directed the outriders to cease their clamour at the horses and to exercise their strength upon the wheels the driver alone urged the animals with his familiar voice david himself heaved a powerful shoulder at the rear of the carriage and with one harmonious tug the great vehicle rolled up on solid ground the outriders climbed to their places david stood for a moment upon one foot the huge gentleman waved a hand you will enter the carriage he said in a voice large like himself but smoothed by art and habit obedience belonged in the path of such a voice brief as was the young poet s hesitation it was cut shorter still by a renewal of the command david s foot went to the step in the darkness he perceived dimly the form of the lady upon the rear seat he was about to seat himself opposite when the voice again swayed him to its will you will sit at the lady s side the gentleman swung his great weight to the forward seat the carriage proceeded up the hill the lady was shrunk silent into her corner david could not estimate whether she was old or young but a delicate mild perfume from her clothes stirred his poet s fancy to the belief that there was loveliness beneath the mystery here was an adventure such as he had often imagined but as yet he held no key to it for no word was spoken while he sat with his impenetrable companions in an hour s time david perceived through the window that the vehicle traversed the street of some town then it stopped in front of a closed and darkened house and a postilion alighted to hammer impatiently upon the door a latticed window above flew wide and a nightcapped head popped out who are ye that disturb honest folk at this time of night my house is closed tis too late for profitable travellers to be abroad cease knocking at my door and be off open spluttered the postilion loudly open for monsiegneur the marquis de beaupertuys ah cried the voice above ten thousand pardons my lord i did not know the hour is so late at once shall the door be opened and the house placed at my lord s disposal inside was heard the clink of chain and bar and the door was flung open shivering with chill and apprehension the landlord of the silver flagon stood half clad candle in hand upon the threshold david followed the marquis out of the carriage assist the lady he was ordered the poet obeyed he felt her small hand tremble as he guided her descent into the house was the next command the room was the long dining hall of the tavern a great oak table ran down its length the huge gentleman seated himself in a chair at the nearer end the lady sank into another against the wall with an air of great weariness david stood considering how best he might now take his leave and continue upon his way my lord said the landlord bowing to the floor h had i ex expected this honour entertainment would have been ready t t there is wine and cold fowl and m m maybe candles said the marquis spreading the fingers of one plump white hand in a gesture he had y yes my lord he fetched half a dozen candles lighted them and set them upon the table if monsieur would perhaps deign to taste a certain burgundy there is a cask candles said monsieur spreading his fingers assuredly quickly i fly my lord a dozen more lighted candles shone in the hall the great bulk of the marquis overflowed his chair he was dressed in fine black from head to foot save for the snowy ruffles at his wrist and throat even the hilt and scabbard of his sword were black his expression was one of sneering pride the ends of an upturned moustache reached nearly to his mocking eyes the lady sat motionless and now david perceived that she was young and possessed of pathetic and appealing beauty he was startled from the contemplation of her forlorn loveliness by the booming voice of the marquis what is your name and pursuit david mignot i am a poet the moustache of the marquis curled nearer to his eyes how do you live i am also a shepherd i guarded my father s flock david answered with his head high but a flush upon his cheek then listen master shepherd and poet to the fortune you have blundered upon to night this lady is my niece mademoiselle lucie de varennes she is of noble descent and is possessed of ten thousand francs a year in her own right as to her charms you have but to observe for yourself if the inventory pleases your shepherd s heart she becomes your wife at a word do not interrupt me to night i conveyed her to the chateau of the comte de villemaur to whom her hand had been promised guests were present the priest was waiting her marriage to one eligible in rank and fortune was ready to be accomplished at the alter this demoiselle so meek and dutiful turned upon me like a leopardess charged me with cruelty and crimes and broke before the gaping priest the troth i had plighted for her i swore there and then by ten thousand devils that she should marry the first man we met after leaving the chateau be he prince charcoal burner or thief you shepherd are the first mademoiselle must be wed this night if not you then another you have ten minutes in which to make your decision do not vex me with words or questions ten minutes shepherd and they are speeding the marquis drummed loudly with his white fingers upon the table he sank into a veiled attitude of waiting it was as if some great house had shut its doors and windows against approach david would have spoken but the huge man s bearing stopped his tongue instead he stood by the lady s chair and bowed mademoiselle he said and he marvelled to find his words flowing easily before so much elegance and beauty you have heard me say i was a shepherd i have also had the fancy at times that i am a poet if it be the test of a poet to adore and cherish the beautiful that fancy is now strengthened can i serve you in any way mademoiselle the young woman looked up at him with eyes dry and mournful his frank glowing face made serious by the gravity of the adventure his strong straight figure and the liquid sympathy in his blue eyes perhaps also her imminent need of long denied help and kindness thawed her to sudden tears monsieur she said in low tones you look to be true and kind he is my uncle the brother of my father and my only relative he loved my mother and he hates me because i am like her he has made my life one long terror i am afraid of his very looks and never before dared to disobey him but to night he would have married me to a man three times my age you will forgive me for bringing this vexation upon you monsieur you will of course decline this mad act he tries to force upon you but let me thank you for your generous words at least i have had none spoken to me in so long there was now something more than generosity in the poet s eyes poet he must have been for yvonne was forgotten this fine new loveliness held him with its freshness and grace the subtle perfume from her filled him with strange emotions his tender look fell warmly upon her she leaned to it thirstily ten minutes said david is given me in which to do what i would devote years to achieve i will not say i pity you mademoiselle it would not be true i love you i cannot ask love from you yet but let me rescue you from this cruel man and in time love may come i think i have a future i will not always be a shepherd for the present i will cherish you with all my heart and make your life less sad will you trust your fate to me mademoiselle ah you would sacrifice yourself from pity from love the time is almost up mademoiselle you will regret it and despise me i will live only to make you happy and myself worthy of you her fine small hand crept into his from beneath her cloak i will trust you she breathed with my life and and love may not be so far off as you think tell him once away from the power of his eyes i may forget david went and stood before the marquis the black figure stirred and the mocking eyes glanced at the great hall clock two minutes to spare a shepherd requires eight minutes to decide whether he will accept a bride of beauty and income speak up shepherd do you consent to become mademoiselle s husband mademoiselle said david standing proudly has done me the honour to yield to my request that she become my wife well said said the marquis you have yet the making of a courtier in you master shepherd mademoiselle could have drawn a worse prize after all and now to be done with the affair as quick as the church and the devil will allow he struck the table soundly with his sword hilt the landlord came knee shaking bringing more candles in the hope of anticipating the great lord s whims fetch a priest said the marquis a priest do you understand in ten minutes have a priest here or the landlord dropped his candles and flew the priest came heavy eyed and ruffled he made david mignot and lucie de verennes man and wife pocketed a gold piece that the marquis tossed him and shuffled out again into the night wine ordered the marquis spreading his ominous fingers at the host fill glasses he said when it was brought he stood up at the head of the table in the candlelight a black mountain of venom and conceit with something like the memory of an old love turned to poison in his eyes as it fell upon his niece monsieur mignot he said raising his wineglass drink after i say this to you you have taken to be your wife one who will make your life a foul and wretched thing the blood in her is an inheritance running black lies and red ruin she will bring you shame and anxiety the devil that descended to her is there in her eyes and skin and mouth that stoop even to beguile a peasant there is your promise monsieur poet for a happy life drink your wine at last mademoiselle i am rid of you the marquis drank a little grievous cry as if from a sudden wound came from the girl s lips david with his glass in his hand stepped forward three paces and faced the marquis there was little of a shepherd in his bearing just now he said calmly you did me the honor to call me monsieur may i hope therefore that my marriage to mademoiselle has placed me somewhat nearer to you in let us say reflected rank has given me the right to stand more as an equal to monseigneur in a certain little piece of business i have in my mind you may hope shepherd sneered the marquis then said david dashing his glass of wine into the contemptuous eyes that mocked him perhaps you will condescend to fight me the fury of the great lord outbroke in one sudden curse like a blast from a horn he tore his sword from its black sheath he called to the hovering landlord a sword there for this lout he turned to the lady with a laugh that chilled her heart and said you put much labour upon me madame it seems i must find you a husband and make you a widow in the same night i know not sword play said david he flushed to make the confession before his lady i know not sword play mimicked the marquis shall we fight like peasants with oaken cudgels hola francois my pistols a postilion brought two shining great pistols ornamented with carven silver from the carriage holsters the marquis tossed one upon the table near david s hand to the other end of the table he cried even a shepherd may pull a trigger few of them attain the honour to die by the weapon of a de beaupertuys the shepherd and the marquis faced each other from the ends of the long table the landlord in an ague of terror clutched the air and stammered m m monseigneur for the love of christ not in my house do not spill blood it will ruin my custom the look of the marquis threatening him paralyzed his tongue coward cried the lord of beaupertuys cease chattering your teeth long enough to give the word for us if you can mine host s knees smote the floor he was without a vocabulary even sounds were beyond him still by gestures he seemed to beseech peace in the name of his house and custom i will give the word said the lady in a clear voice she went up to david and kissed him sweetly her eyes were sparkling bright and colour had come to her cheek she stood against the wall and the two men levelled their pistols for her count un deux trois the two reports came so nearly together that the candles flickered but once the marquis stood smiling the fingers of his left hand resting outspread upon the end of the table david remained erect and turned his head very slowly searching for his wife with his eyes then as a garment falls from where it is hung he sank crumpled upon the floor with a little cry of terror and despair the widowed maid ran and stooped above him she found his wound and then looked up with her old look of pale melancholy through his heart she whispered oh his heart come boomed the great voice of the marquis out with you to the carriage daybreak shall not find you on my hands wed you shall be again and to a living husband this night the next we come upon my lady highwayman or peasant if the road yields no other then the churl that opens my gates out with you into the carriage the marquis implacable and huge the lady wrapped again in the mystery of her cloak the postilion bearing the weapons all moved out to the waiting carriage the sound of its ponderous wheels rolling away echoed through the slumbering village in the hall of the silver flagon the distracted landlord wrung his hands above the slain poet s body while the flames of the four and twenty candles danced and flickered on the table the right branch three leagues then the road ran and turned into a puzzle it joined with another and a larger road at right angles david stood uncertain for a while and then took the road to the right whither it led he knew not but he was resolved to leave vernoy far behind that night he travelled a league and then passed a large chateau which showed testimony of recent entertainment lights shone from every window from the great stone gateway ran a tracery of wheel tracks drawn in the dust by the vehicles of the guests three leagues farther and david was weary he rested and slept for a while on a bed of pine boughs at the roadside then up and on again along the unknown way thus for five days he travelled the great road sleeping upon nature s balsamic beds or in peasants ricks eating of their black hospitable bread drinking from streams or the willing cup of the goatherd at length he crossed a great bridge and set his foot within the smiling city that has crushed or crowned more poets than all the rest of the world his breath came quickly as paris sang to him in a little undertone her vital chant of greeting the hum of voice and foot and wheel high up under the eaves of an old house in the rue conti david paid for lodging and set himself in a wooden chair to his poems the street once sheltering citizens of import and consequence was now given over to those who ever follow in the wake of decline the houses were tall and still possessed of a ruined dignity but many of them were empty save for dust and the spider by night there was the clash of steel and the cries of brawlers straying restlessly from inn to inn where once gentility abode was now but a rancid and rude incontinence but here david found housing commensurate to his scant purse daylight and candlelight found him at pen and paper one afternoon he was returning from a foraging trip to the lower world with bread and curds and a bottle of thin wine halfway up his dark stairway he met or rather came upon for she rested on the stair a young woman of a beauty that should balk even the justice of a poet s imagination a loose dark cloak flung open showed a rich gown beneath her eyes changed swiftly with every little shade of thought within one moment they would be round and artless like a child s and long and cozening like a gypsy s one hand raised her gown undraping a little shoe high heeled with its ribbons dangling untied so heavenly she was so unfitted to stoop so qualified to charm and command perhaps she had seen david coming and had waited for his help there ah would monsieur pardon that she occupied the stairway but the shoe the naughty shoe alas it would not remain tied ah if monsieur would be so gracious the poet s fingers trembled as he tied the contrary ribbons then he would have fled from the danger of her presence but the eyes grew long and cozening like a gypsy s and held him he leaned against the balustrade clutching his bottle of sour wine you have been so good she said smiling does monsieur perhaps live in the house yes madame i i think so madame perhaps in the third story then no madame higher up the lady fluttered her fingers with the least possible gesture of impatience pardon certainly i am not discreet in asking monsieur will forgive me it is surely not becoming that i should inquire where he lodges madame do not say so i live in the no no no do not tell me now i see that i erred but i cannot lose the interest i feel in this house and all that is in it once it was my home often i come here but to dream of those happy days again will you let that be my excuse let me tell you then for you need no excuse stammered the poet i live in the top floor the small room where the stairs turn in the front room asked the lady turning her head sidewise the rear madame the lady sighed as if with relief i will detain you no longer then monsieur she said employing the round and artless eye take good care of my house alas only the memories of it are mine now adieu and accept my thanks for your courtesy she was gone leaving but a smile and a trace of sweet perfume david climbed the stairs as one in slumber but he awoke from it and the smile and the perfume lingered with him and never afterward did either seem quite to leave him this lady of whom he knew nothing drove him to lyrics of eyes chansons of swiftly conceived love odes to curling hair and sonnets to slippers on slender feet poet he must have been for yvonne was forgotten this fine new loveliness held him with its freshness and grace the subtle perfume about her filled him with strange emotions on a certain night three persons were gathered about a table in a room on the third floor of the same house three chairs and the table and a lighted candle upon it was all the furniture one of the persons was a huge man dressed in black his expression was one of sneering pride the ends of his upturned moustache reached nearly to his mocking eyes another was a lady young and beautiful with eyes that could be round and artless as a child s or long and cozening like a gypsy s but were now keen and ambitious like any other conspirator s the third was a man of action a combatant a bold and impatient executive breathing fire and steel he was addressed by the others as captain desrolles this man struck the table with his fist and said with controlled violence to night to night as he goes to midnight mass i am tired of the plotting that gets nowhere i am sick of signals and ciphers and secret meetings and such baragouin let us be honest traitors if france is to be rid of him let us kill in the open and not hunt with snares and traps to night i say i back my words my hand will do the deed to night as he goes to mass the lady turned upon him a cordial look woman however wedded to plots must ever thus bow to rash courage the big man stroked his upturned moustache dear captain he said in a great voice softened by habit this time i agree with you nothing is to be gained by waiting enough of the palace guards belong to us to make the endeavour a safe one to night repeated captain desrolles again striking the table you have heard me marquis my hand will do the deed but now said the huge man softly comes a question word must be sent to our partisans in the palace and a signal agreed upon our stanchest men must accompany the royal carriage at this hour what messenger can penetrate so far as the south doorway ribouet is stationed there once a message is placed in his hands all will go well i will send the message said the lady you countess said the marquis raising his eyebrows your devotion is great we know but listen exclaimed the lady rising and resting her hands upon the table in a garret of this house lives a youth from the provinces as guileless and tender as the lambs he tended there i have met him twice or thrice upon the stairs i questioned him fearing that he might dwell too near the room in which we are accustomed to meet he is mine if i will he writes poems in his garret and i think he dreams of me he will do what i say he shall take the message to the palace the marquis rose from his chair and bowed you did not permit me to finish my sentence countess he said i would have said your devotion is great but your wit and charm are infinitely greater while the conspirators were thus engaged david was polishing some lines addressed to his amorette d escalier he heard a timorous knock at his door and opened it with a great throb to behold her there panting as one in straits with eyes wide open and artless like a child s monsieur she breathed i come to you in distress i believe you to be good and true and i know of no other help how i flew through the streets among the swaggering men monsieur my mother is dying my uncle is a captain of guards in the palace of the king some one must fly to bring him may i hope mademoiselle interrupted davis his eyes shining with the desire to do her service your hopes shall be my wings tell me how i may reach him the lady thrust a sealed paper into his hand go to the south gate the south gate mind and say to the guards there the falcon has left his nest they will pass you and you will go to the south entrance to the palace repeat the words and give this letter to the man who will reply let him strike when he will this is the password monsieur entrusted to me by my uncle for now when the country is disturbed and men plot against the king s life no one without it can gain entrance to the palace grounds after nightfall if you will monsieur take him this letter so that my mother may see him before she closes her eyes give it me said david eagerly but shall i let you return home through the streets alone so late i no no fly each moment is like a precious jewel some time said the lady with eyes long and cozening like a gypsy s i will try to thank you for your goodness the poet thrust the letter into his breast and bounded down the stairway the lady when he was gone returned to the room below the eloquent eyebrows of the marquis interrogated her he is gone she said as fleet and stupid as one of his own sheep to deliver it the table shook again from the batter of captain desrolles s fist sacred name he cried i have left my pistols behind i can trust no others take this said the marquis drawing from beneath his cloak a shining great weapon ornamented with carven silver there are none truer but guard it closely for it bears my arms and crest and already i am suspected me i must put many leagues between myself and paris this night to morrow must find me in my chateau after you dear countess the marquis puffed out the candle the lady well cloaked and the two gentlemen softly descended the stairway and flowed into the crowd that roamed along the narrow pavements of the rue conti david sped at the south gate of the king s residence a halberd was laid to his breast but he turned its point with the words the falcon has left his nest pass brother said the guard and go quickly on the south steps of the palace they moved to seize him but again the mot de passe charmed the watchers one among them stepped forward and began let him strike but a flurry among the guards told of a surprise a man of keen look and soldierly stride suddenly pressed through them and seized the letter which david held in his hand come with me he said and led him inside the great hall then he tore open the letter and read it he beckoned to a man uniformed as an officer of musketeers who was passing captain tetreau you will have the guards at the south entrance and the south gate arrested and confined place men known to be loyal in their places to david he said come with me he conducted him through a corridor and an anteroom into a spacious chamber where a melancholy man sombrely dressed sat brooding in a great leather covered chair to that man he said sire i have told you that the palace is as full of traitors and spies as a sewer is of rats you have thought sire that it was my fancy this man penetrated to your very door by their connivance he bore a letter which i have intercepted i have brought him here that your majesty may no longer think my zeal excessive i will question him said the king stirring in his chair he looked at david with heavy eyes dulled by an opaque film the poet bent his knee from where do you come asked the king from the village of vernoy in the province of eure et loir sire what do you follow in paris i i would be a poet sire what did you in vernoy i minded my father s flock of sheep the king stirred again and the film lifted from his eyes ah in the fields yes sire you lived in the fields you went out in the cool of the morning and lay among the hedges in the grass the flock distributed itself upon the hillside you drank of the living stream you ate your sweet brown bread in the shade and you listened doubtless to blackbirds piping in the grove is not that so shepherd it is sire answered david with a sigh and to the bees at the flowers and maybe to the grape gatherers singing on the hill yes yes said the king impatiently maybe to them but surely to the blackbirds they whistled often in the grove did they not nowhere sire so sweetly as in eure et loir i have endeavored to express their song in some verses that i have written can you repeat those verses asked the king eagerly a long time ago i listened to the blackbirds it would be something better than a kingdom if one could rightly construe their song and at night you drove the sheep to the fold and then sat in peace and tranquillity to your pleasant bread can you repeat those verses shepherd they run this way sire said david with respectful ardour lazy shepherd see your lambkins skip ecstatic on the mead see the firs dance in the breezes hear pan blowing at his reed hear us calling from the tree tops see us swoop upon your flock yield us wool to make our nests warm in the branches of the if it please your majesty interrupted a harsh voice i will ask a question or two of this rhymester there is little time to spare i crave pardon sire if my anxiety for your safety offends the loyalty said the king of the duke d aumale is too well proven to give offence he sank into his chair and the film came again over his eyes first said the duke i will read you the letter he brought to night is the anniversary of the dauphin s death if he goes as is his custom to midnight mass to pray for the soul of his son the falcon will strike at the corner of the rue esplanade if this be his intention set a red light in the upper room at the southwest corner of the palace that the falcon may take heed peasant said the duke sternly you have heard these words who gave you this message to bring my lord duke said david sincerely i will tell you a lady gave it me she said her mother was ill and that this writing would fetch her uncle to her bedside i do not know the meaning of the letter but i will swear that she is beautiful and good describe the woman commanded the duke and how you came to be her dupe describe her said david with a tender smile you would command words to perform miracles well she is made of sunshine and deep shade she is slender like the alders and moves with their grace her eyes change while you gaze into them now round and then half shut as the sun peeps between two clouds when she comes heaven is all about her when she leaves there is chaos and a scent of hawthorn blossoms she came to see me in the rue conti number twenty nine it is the house said the duke turning to the king that we have been watching thanks to the poet s tongue we have a picture of the infamous countess quebedaux sire and my lord duke said david earnestly i hope my poor words have done no injustice i have looked into that lady s eyes i will stake my life that she is an angel letter or no letter the duke looked at him steadily i will put you to the proof he said slowly dressed as the king you shall yourself attend mass in his carriage at midnight do you accept the test david smiled i have looked into her eyes he said i had my proof there take yours how you will half an hour before twelve the duke d aumale with his own hands set a red lamp in a southwest window of the palace at ten minutes to the hour david leaning on his arm dressed as the king from top to toe with his head bowed in his cloak walked slowly from the royal apartments to the waiting carriage the duke assisted him inside and closed the door the carriage whirled away along its route to the cathedral on the qui vive in a house at the corner of the rue esplanade was captain tetreau with twenty men ready to pounce upon the conspirators when they should appear but it seemed that for some reason the plotters had slightly altered their plans when the royal carriage had reached the rue christopher one square nearer than the rue esplanade forth from it burst captain desrolles with his band of would be regicides and assailed the equipage the guards upon the carriage though surprised at the premature attack descended and fought valiantly the noise of conflict attracted the force of captain tetreau and they came pelting down the street to the rescue but in the meantime the desperate desrolles had torn open the door of the king s carriage thrust his weapon against the body of the dark figure inside and fired now with loyal reinforcements at hand the street rang with cries and the rasp of steel but the frightened horses had dashed away upon the cushions lay the dead body of the poor mock king and poet slain by a ball from the pistol of monseigneur the marquis de beaupertuys the main road three leagues then the road ran and turned into a puzzle it joined with another and a larger road at right angles david stood uncertain for a while and then sat himself to rest upon its side whither these roads led he knew not either way there seemed to lie a great world full of chance and peril and then sitting there his eye fell upon a bright star one that he and yvonne had named for theirs that set him thinking of yvonne and he wondered if he had not been too hasty why should he leave her and his home because a few hot words had come between them was love so brittle a thing that jealousy the very proof of it could break it mornings always brought a cure for the little heartaches of evening there was yet time for him to return home without any one in the sweetly sleeping village of vernoy being the wiser his heart was yvonne s there where he had lived always he could write his poems and find his happiness david rose and shook off his unrest and the wild mood that had tempted him he set his face steadfastly back along the road he had come by the time he had retravelled the road to vernoy his desire to rove was gone he passed the sheepfold and the sheep scurried with a drumming flutter at his late footsteps warming his heart by the homely sound he crept without noise into his little room and lay there thankful that his feet had escaped the distress of new roads that night how well he knew woman s heart the next evening yvonne was at the well in the road where the young congregated in order that the cure might have business the corner of her eye was engaged in a search for david albeit her set mouth seemed unrelenting he saw the look braved the mouth drew from it a recantation and later a kiss as they walked homeward together three months afterwards they were married david s father was shrewd and prosperous he gave them a wedding that was heard of three leagues away both the young people were favourites in the village there was a procession in the streets a dance on the green they had the marionettes and a tumbler out from dreux to delight the guests then a year and david s father died the sheep and the cottage descended to him he already had the seemliest wife in the village yvonne s milk pails and her brass kettles were bright ouf they blinded you in the sun when you passed that way but you must keep your eyes upon her yard for her flower beds were so neat and gay they restored to you your sight and you might hear her sing aye as far as the double chestnut tree above pere gruneau s blacksmith forge but a day came when david drew out paper from a long shut drawer and began to bite the end of a pencil spring had come again and touched his heart poet he must have been for now yvonne was well nigh forgotten this fine new loveliness of earth held him with its witchery and grace the perfume from her woods and meadows stirred him strangely daily had he gone forth with his flock and brought it safe at night but now he stretched himself under the hedge and pieced words together on his bits of paper the sheep strayed and the wolves perceiving that difficult poems make easy mutton ventured from the woods and stole his lambs david s stock of poems grew longer and his flock smaller yvonne s nose and temper waxed sharp and her talk blunt her pans and kettles grew dull but her eyes had caught their flash she pointed out to the poet that his neglect was reducing the flock and bringing woe upon the household david hired a boy to guard the sheep locked himself in the little room at the top of the cottage and wrote more poems the boy being a poet by nature but not furnished with an outlet in the way of writing spent his time in slumber the wolves lost no time in discovering that poetry and sleep are practically the same so the flock steadily grew smaller yvonne s ill temper increased at an equal rate sometimes she would stand in the yard and rail at david through his high window then you could hear her as far as the double chestnut tree above pere gruneau s blacksmith forge m papineau the kind wise meddling old notary saw this as he saw everything at which his nose pointed he went to david fortified himself with a great pinch of snuff and said friend mignot i affixed the seal upon the marriage certificate of your father it would distress me to be obliged to attest a paper signifying the bankruptcy of his son but that is what you are coming to i speak as an old friend now listen to what i have to say you have your heart set i perceive upon poetry at dreux i have a friend one monsieur bril georges bril he lives in a little cleared space in a houseful of books he is a learned man he visits paris each year he himself has written books he will tell you when the catacombs were made how they found out the names of the stars and why the plover has a long bill the meaning and the form of poetry is to him as intelligent as the baa of a sheep is to you i will give you a letter to him and you shall take him your poems and let him read them then you will know if you shall write more or give your attention to your wife and business write the letter said david i am sorry you did not speak of this sooner at sunrise the next morning he was on the road to dreux with the precious roll of poems under his arm at noon he wiped the dust from his feet at the door of monsieur bril that learned man broke the seal of m papineau s letter and sucked up its contents through his gleaming spectacles as the sun draws water he took david inside to his study and sat him down upon a little island beat upon by a sea of books monsieur bril had a conscience he flinched not even at a mass of manuscript the thickness of a finger length and rolled to an incorrigible curve he broke the back of the roll against his knee and began to read he slighted nothing he bored into the lump as a worm into a nut seeking for a kernel meanwhile david sat marooned trembling in the spray of so much literature it roared in his ears he held no chart or compass for voyaging in that sea half the world he thought must be writing books monsieur bril bored to the last page of the poems then he took off his spectacles and wiped them with his handkerchief my old friend papineau is well he asked in the best of health said david how many sheep have you monsieur mignot three hundred and nine when i counted them yesterday the flock has had ill fortune to that number it has decreased from eight hundred and fifty you have a wife and home and lived in comfort the sheep brought you plenty you went into the fields with them and lived in the keen air and ate the sweet bread of contentment you had but to be vigilant and recline there upon nature s breast listening to the whistle of the blackbirds in the grove am i right thus far it was so said david i have read all your verses continued monsieur bril his eyes wandering about his sea of books as if he conned the horizon for a sail look yonder through that window monsieur mignot tell me what you see in that tree i see a crow said david looking there is a bird said monsieur bril that shall assist me where i am disposed to shirk a duty you know that bird monsieur mignot he is the philosopher of the air he is happy through submission to his lot none so merry or full crawed as he with his whimsical eye and rollicking step the fields yield him what he desires he never grieves that his plumage is not gay like the oriole s and you have heard monsieur mignot the notes that nature has given him is the nightingale any happier do you think david rose to his feet the crow cawed harshly from his tree i thank you monsieur bril he said slowly there was not then one nightingale among all those croaks i could not have missed it said monsieur bril with a sigh i read every word live your poetry man do not try to write it any more i thank you said david again and now i will be going back to my sheep if you would dine with me said the man of books and overlook the smart of it i will give you reasons at length no said the poet i must be back in the fields cawing at my sheep back along the road to vernoy he trudged with his poems under his arm when he reached his village he turned into the shop of one zeigler a jew out of armenia who sold anything that came to his hand friend said david wolves from the forest harass my sheep on the hills i must purchase firearms to protect them what have you a bad day this for me friend mignot said zeigler spreading his hands for i perceive that i must sell you a weapon that will not fetch a tenth of its value only last i week i bought from a peddlar a wagon full of goods that he procured at a sale by a commissionaire of the crown the sale

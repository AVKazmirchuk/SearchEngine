on the morning train says andy you d better get your collars and cuffs and press clippings together great says i i ll be ready but andy says i i wish i could have met that professor james darnley mccorkle before we went i had a curiosity to know that man that ll be easy says andy turning around to the faro dealer jim says andy shake hands with mr peters the hand that riles the world many of our great men said i apropos of many things have declared that they owe their success to the aid and encouragement of some brilliant woman i know said jeff peters i ve read in history and mythology about joan of arc and mme yale and mrs caudle and eve and other noted females of the past but in my opinion the woman of to day is of little use in politics or business what s she best in anyway men make the best cooks milliners nurses housekeepers stenographers clerks hairdressers and launderers about the only job left that a woman can beat a man in is female impersonator in vaudeville i would have thought said i that occasionally anyhow you would have found the wit and intuition of woman valuable to you in your lines of er business now wouldn t you said jeff with an emphatic nod wouldn t you have imagined that but a woman is an absolutely unreliable partner in any straight swindle she s liable to turn honest on you when you are depending upon her the most i tried em once bill humble an old friend of mine in the territories conceived the illusion that he wanted to be appointed united states marshall at that time me and andy was doing a square legitimate business of selling walking canes if you unscrewed the head of one and turned it up to your mouth a half pint of good rye whiskey would go trickling down your throat to reward you for your act of intelligence the deputies was annoying me and andy some and when bill spoke to me about his officious aspirations i saw how the appointment as marshall might help along the firm of peters tucker jeff says bill to me you are a man of learning and education besides having knowledge and information concerning not only rudiments but facts and attainments i do says i and i have never regretted it i am not one says i who would cheapen education by making it free tell me says i which is of the most value to mankind literature or horse racing why er playing the po i mean of course the poets and the great writers have got the call of course says bill exactly says i then why do the master minds of finance and philanthropy says i charge us to get into a race track and let us into a library free is that distilling into the masses says i a correct estimate of the relative value of the two means of self culture and disorder you are arguing outside of my faculties of sense and rhetoric says bill what i wanted you to do is to go to washington and dig out this appointment for me i haven t no ideas of cultivation and intrigue i m a plain citizen and i need the job i ve killed seven men says bill i ve got nine children i ve been a good republican ever since the first of may i can t read nor write and i see no reason why i ain t illegible for the office and i think your partner mr tucker goes on bill is also a man of sufficient ingratiation and connected system of mental delinquency to assist you in securing the appointment i will give you preliminary says bill for drinks bribes and carfare in washington if you land the job i will pay you more cash down and guarantee you impunity in boot legging whiskey for twelve months are you patriotic to the west enough to help me put this thing through the whitewashed wigwam of the great father of the most eastern flag station of the pennsylvania railroad says bill well i talked to andy about it and he liked the idea immense andy was a man of an involved nature he was never content to plod along as i was selling to the peasantry some little tool like a combination steak beater shoe horn marcel waver monkey wrench nail file potato masher and multum in parvo tuning fork andy had the artistic temper which is not to be judged as a preacher s or a moral man s is by purely commercial deflections so we accepted bill s offer and strikes out for washington says i to andy when we get located at a hotel on south dakota avenue g s s w now andy for the first time in our lives we ve got to do a real dishonest act lobbying is something we ve never been used to but we ve got to scandalize ourselves for bill humble s sake in a straight and legitimate business says i we could afford to introduce a little foul play and chicanery but in a disorderly and heinous piece of malpractice like this it seems to me that the straightforward and aboveboard way is the best i propose says i that we hand over of this money to the chairman of the national campaign committee get a receipt lay the receipt on the president s desk and tell him about bill the president is a man who would appreciate a candidate who went about getting office that way instead of pulling wires andy agreed with me but after we talked the scheme over with the hotel clerk we give that plan up he told us that there was only one way to get an appointment in washington and that was

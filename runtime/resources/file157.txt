daytime from the bottom of a well at night my room is like the shaft of a coal mine and it makes billy jackson look like the big diamond pin that night fastens her kimono with there came a time after that when miss leeson brought no formidable papers home to copy and when she went out in the morning instead of working she went from office to office and let her heart melt away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office boys this went on there came an evening when she wearily climbed mrs parker s stoop at the hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant

slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail some one ran to phone for an ambulance in due time it backed up to the door with much gong clanging and the capable young medico in his white

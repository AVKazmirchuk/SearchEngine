on a rail fence and that the rail fence is built on a turtle s back now the turtle has to stand on something and that is a board walk made of men like old jerome i do not know whether immortality shall accrue to man but if not so i would like to know when men like old jerome get what is due them they met nevada warren at the station she was a little girl deeply sunburned and wholesomely good looking with a manner that was frankly unsophisticated yet one that not even a cigar drummer would intrude upon without thinking twice looking at her somehow you would expect to see her in a short skirt and leather leggings shooting glass balls or taming mustangs but in her plain white waist and black skirt she sent you guessing again with an easy exhibition of strength she swung along a heavy valise which the uniformed porters tried in vain to wrest from her i am sure we shall be the best of friends said barbara pecking at the firm sunburned cheek i hope so said nevada dear little niece said old jerome you are as welcome to my home as if it were your father s own thanks said nevada and i am going to call you cousin said gilbert with his charming smile take the valise please said nevada it weighs a million pounds it s got samples from six of dad s old mines in it she explained to barbara i calculate they d assay about nine cents to the thousand tons but i promised him to bring them along ii it is a common custom to refer to the usual complication between one man and two ladies or one lady and two men or a lady and a man and a nobleman or well any of those problems as the triangle but they are never unqualified triangles they are always isosceles never equilateral so upon the coming of nevada warren she and gilbert and barbara ross lined up into such a figurative triangle and of that triangle barbara formed the hypotenuse one morning old jerome was lingering long after breakfast over the dullest morning paper in the city before setting forth to his down town fly trap he had become quite fond of nevada finding in her much of his dead brother s quiet independence and unsuspicious frankness a maid brought in a note for miss nevada warren a messenger boy delivered it at the door please she said he s waiting for an answer nevada who was whistling a spanish waltz between her teeth and watching the carriages and autos roll by in the street took the envelope she knew it was from gilbert before she opened it by the little gold palette in the upper left hand corner after tearing it open she pored over the contents for a while absorbedly then with a serious face she went and stood at her uncle s elbow uncle jerome gilbert is a nice boy isn t he why bless the child said old jerome crackling his paper loudly of course he is i raised him myself he wouldn t write anything to anybody that wasn t exactly i mean that everybody couldn t know and read would he i d just like to see him try it said uncle tearing a handful from his newspaper why what read this note he just sent me uncle and see if you think it s all right and proper you see i don t know much about city people and their ways old jerome threw his paper down and set both his feet upon it he took gilbert s note and fiercely perused it twice and then a third time why child said he you had me almost excited although i was sure of that boy he s a duplicate of his father and he was a gilt edged diamond he only asks if you and barbara will be ready at four o clock this afternoon for an automobile drive over to long island i don t see anything to criticise in it except the stationery i always did hate that shade of blue would it be all right to go asked nevada eagerly yes yes yes child of course why not still it pleases me to see you so careful and candid go by all means i didn t know said nevada demurely i thought i d ask you couldn t you go with us uncle i no no no no i ve ridden once in a car that boy was driving never again but it s entirely proper for you and barbara to go yes yes but i will not no no no no nevada flew to the door and said to the maid you bet we ll go i ll answer for miss barbara tell the boy to say to mr warren you bet we ll go nevada called old jerome pardon me my dear but wouldn t it be as well to send him a note in reply just a line would do no i won t bother about that said nevada gayly gilbert will understand he always does i never rode in an automobile in my life but i ve paddled a canoe down little devil river through the lost horse canon and if it s any livelier than that i d like to know iii two months are supposed to have elapsed barbara sat in the study of the hundred thousand dollar house it was a good place for her many places are provided in the world where men and women may repair for the purpose of extricating themselves from divers difficulties there are cloisters wailing places watering places confessionals hermitages lawyer s offices beauty parlors air ships and studies and the greatest of these are studies it usually takes a hypotenuse a long time to discover that it is the longest side

italian woman who sold apples and garlic on essex street and quoting the words of a song book ballad murray s fall had been more luciferian if less spectacular all the pretty tiny little kickshaws of gotham had once been his the megaphone man roars out at you to observe the house of his uncle on a grand and revered avenue but there had been an awful row about something and the prince had been escorted to the door by the butler which in said avenue is equivalent to the impact of the avuncular shoe a weak prince hal without inheritance or sword he drifted downward to meet his humorless falstaff and to pick the crusts of the streets with him one evening they sat on a bench in a little downtown park the great bulk of the captain which starvation seemed to increase drawing irony instead of pity to his petitions for aid was heaped against the arm of the bench in a shapeless mass his red face spotted by tufts of vermilion week old whiskers and topped by a sagging white straw hat looked in the gloom like one of those structures that you may observe in a dark third avenue window challenging your imagination to say whether it be something recent in the way of ladies hats or a strawberry shortcake a tight drawn belt last relic of his official spruceness made a deep furrow in his circumference the captain s shoes were buttonless in a smothered bass he cursed his star of ill luck murray at his side was shrunk into his dingy and ragged suit of blue serge his hat was pulled low he sat quiet and a little indistinct like some ghost that had been dispossessed i m hungry growled the captain by the top sirloin of the bull of bashan i m starving to death right now i could eat a bowery restaurant clear through to the stovepipe in the alley can t you think of nothing murray you sit there with your shoulders scrunched up giving an irritation of reginald vanderbilt driving his coach what good are them airs doing you now think of some place we can get something to chew you forget my dear captain said murray without moving that our last attempt at dining was at my suggestion you bet it was groaned the captain you bet your life it was have you got any more like that to make hey i admit we failed sighed murray i was sure malone would be good for one more free lunch after the way he talked baseball with me the last time i spent a nickel in his establishment i had this hand said the captain extending the unfortunate member i had this hand on the drum stick of a turkey and two sardine sandwiches when them waiters grabbed us i was within two inches of the olives said murray stuffed olives i haven t tasted one in a year what ll we do grumbled the captain we can t starve can t we said murray quietly i m glad to hear that i was afraid we could you wait here said the captain rising heavily and puffily to his feet i m going to try to make one more turn you stay here till i come back murray i won t be over half an hour if i turn the trick i ll come back flush he made some elephantine attempts at smartening his appearance he gave his fiery mustache a heavenward twist he dragged into sight a pair of black edged cuffs deepened the crease in his middle by tightening his belt another hole and set off jaunty as a zoo rhinoceros across the south end of the park when he was out of sight murray also left the park hurrying swiftly eastward he stopped at a building whose steps were flanked by two green lights a police captain named maroney he said to the desk sergeant was dismissed from the force after being tried under charges three years ago i believe sentence was suspended is this man wanted now by the police why are ye asking inquired the sergeant with a frown i thought there might be a reward standing explained murray easily i know the man well he seems to be keeping himself pretty shady at present i could lay my hands on him at any time if there should be a reward there s no reward interrupted the sergeant shortly the man s not wanted and neither are ye so get out ye are frindly with um and ye would be selling um out with ye quick or i ll give ye a start murray gazed at the officer with serene and virtuous dignity i would be simply doing my duty as a citizen and gentleman he said severely if i could assist the law in laying hold of one of its ofenders murray hurried back to the bench in the park he folded his arms and shrank within his clothes to his ghost like presentment ten minutes afterward the captain arrived at the rendezvous windy and thunderous as a clog day in kansas his collar had been torn away his straw

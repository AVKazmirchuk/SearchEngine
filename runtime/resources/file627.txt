a memorial to the slaughtered conventions in the candle light he stood a flaw in the decorous fittings of the apartment his face was a sickly white covered almost to the eyes with a stubble the shade of a red irish setter s coat phillips s comb had failed to control the pale brown hair long matted and conformed to the contour of a constantly worn hat his eyes were full of a hopeless tricky defiance like that seen in a cur s that is cornered by his tormentors his shabby coat was buttoned high but a quarter inch of redeeming collar showed above it his manner was singularly free from

in harsh and aggressive tones if you re like me you like to know the name of the party you re dining with i was going on to say continued chalmers somewhat hastily that mine is chalmers will you sit

barked plumer going to be in courses is it all right my jovial ruler of bagdad i m your scheherezade all the way to the toothpicks you re the first caliph with a genuine oriental flavor i ve struck since frost what luck and i was forty third in line i finished counting just as your welcome emissary arrived to bid me to the feast i had about as much chance of getting a bed to night as i have of

was a sudden whim that prompted me to send for some stranger to dine with me i assure you you will not suffer through any curiosity of mine oh fudge exclaimed the guest enthusiastically tackling his

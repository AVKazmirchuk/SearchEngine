drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice he danced howled raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin the policeman twirled his club turned his back to soapy and remarked to a citizen tis one of them yale lads celebratin the goose egg they give to the hartford college noisy but no harm we ve instructions to lave them be disconsolate soapy ceased his unavailing racket would never a policeman lay hands on him in his fancy the island seemed an unattainable arcadia he buttoned his thin coat against the chilling wind in a cigar store he saw a well dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light his silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering soapy stepped inside secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it slowly the man at the cigar light followed hastily my umbrella he said sternly oh is it sneered soapy adding insult to petit larceny well why don t you call a policeman i took it your umbrella why don t you call a cop there stands one on the corner the umbrella owner slowed his steps soapy did likewise with a presentiment that luck would again run against him the policeman looked at the two curiously of course said the umbrella man that is well you know how these mistakes occur i if it s your umbrella i hope you ll excuse me i picked it up this morning in a restaurant if you recognise it as yours why i hope you ll of course it s mine said soapy viciously the ex umbrella man retreated the policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements he hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation he muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs because he wanted to fall into their clutches they seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong at length soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil was but faint he set his face down this toward madison square for the homing instinct survives even when the home is a park bench but on an unusually quiet corner soapy came to a standstill here was an old church quaint and rambling and gabled through one violet stained window a soft light glowed where no doubt the organist loitered over the keys making sure of his mastery of the coming sabbath anthem for there drifted out to soapy s ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence the moon was above lustrous and serene vehicles and pedestrians were few sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves for a little while the scene might have been a country churchyard and the anthem that the organist played cemented soapy to the iron fence for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars the conjunction of soapy s receptive state of mind and the influences about the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul he viewed with swift horror the pit into which he had tumbled the degraded days unworthy desires dead hopes wrecked faculties and base motives that made up his existence and also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood an instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate he would pull himself out of the mire he would make a man of himself again he would conquer the evil that had taken possession of him there was time he was comparatively young yet he would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him to morrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and find work a fur importer had once offered him a place as driver he would find him to morrow and ask for the position he would be somebody in the world he would soapy felt a hand laid on his arm he looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman what are you doin here asked the officer nothin said soapy then come along said the policeman three months on the island said the magistrate in the police court the next morning an adjustment of nature in an art exhibition the other day i saw a painting that had been sold for the painter was a young scrub out of the west named kraft who had a favourite food and a pet theory his pabulum was an unquenchable belief in the unerring artistic adjustment of nature his theory was fixed around corned beef hash with poached egg there was a story behind the picture so i went home and let it drip out of a fountain pen the idea of kraft but that is not the beginning of the story three years ago kraft bill judkins a poet and i took our meals at cypher s on eighth avenue i say took when we had money cypher got it off of us as he expressed it we had no credit we went in called for food and ate it we paid or we did not pay we had confidence in cypher s sullenness end smouldering ferocity deep down in his sunless soul he was either a prince a fool or an artist he sat at a worm eaten desk covered with files of waiters checks so old that i was sure the bottomest one was for clams that hendrik hudson had eaten and paid for cypher had the power in common with napoleon iii and the goggle eyed perch of throwing a film over his eyes rendering opaque the windows

be you ll introduce the bill and i ll get up on the floor of the senate and wave the scalp of every indian old lucien ever murdered let s see there was something else proud and foolish he did wasn t there oh yes he declined all emoluments and benefits he was entitled to refused his head right and veteran donation certificates could have been governor but wouldn t declined a pension now s the state s chance to pay up it ll have to take the picture but then it deserves some punishment for keeping the briscoe family waiting so long we ll bring this thing up about the middle of the month after the tax bill is settled now mullens you send over as soon as you can and get me the figures on the cost of those irrigation ditches and the statistics about the increased production per acre i m

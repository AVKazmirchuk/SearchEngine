faithful espionage upon the lagging trail of passengers from the mexican side bud dawson proprietor of the top notch saloon had on the evening previous violently ejected from his premises one leandro garcia for alleged violation of the top notch code of behaviour garcia had mentioned twenty four hours as a limit by which time he would call and collect a painful indemnity for personal satisfaction this mexican although a tremendous braggart was thoroughly courageous and each side of the river respected him for one of these attributes he and a following of similar bravoes were addicted to the pastime of retrieving towns from stagnation the day designated by garcia for retribution was to be further signalised on the american side by a cattlemen s convention a bull fight and an old settlers barbecue and picnic knowing the avenger to be a man of his word and believing it prudent to court peace while three such gently social relaxations were in progress captain mcnulty of the ranger company stationed there detailed his lieutenant and three men for duty at the end of the bridge their instructions were to prevent the invasion of garcia either alone or attended by his gang travel was slight that sultry afternoon and the rangers swore gently and mopped their brows in their convenient but close quarters for an hour no one had crossed save an old woman enveloped in a brown wrapper and a black mantilla driving before her a burro loaded with kindling wood tied in small bundles for peddling then three shots were fired down the street the sound coming clear and snappy through the still air the four rangers quickened from sprawling symbolic figures of indolence to alert life but only one rose to his feet three turned their eyes beseechingly but hopelessly upon the fourth who had gotten nimbly up and was buckling his cartridge belt around him the three knew that lieutenant bob buckley in command would allow no man of them the privilege of investigating a row when he himself might go the agile broad chested lieutenant without a change of expression in his smooth yellow brown melancholy face shot the belt strap through the guard of the buckle hefted his sixes in their holsters as a belle gives the finishing touches to her toilette caught up his winchester and dived for the door there he paused long enough to caution his comrades to maintain their watch upon the bridge and then plunged into the broiling highway the three relapsed into resigned inertia and plaintive comment i ve heard of fellows grumbled broncho leathers what was wedded to danger but if bob buckley ain t committed bigamy with trouble i m a son of a gun peculiarness of bob is inserted the nueces kid he ain t had proper trainin he never learned how to git skeered now a man ought to be skeered enough when he tackles a fuss to hanker after readin his name on the list of survivors anyway buckley commented ranger no who was a misguided eastern man burdened with an education scraps in such a solemn manner that i have been led to doubt its spontaneity i m not quite onto his system but he fights like tybalt by the book of arithmetic i never heard mentioned broncho about any of dibble s ways of mixin scrappin and cipherin triggernometry suggested the nueces infant that s rather better than i hoped from you nodded the easterner approvingly the other meaning is that buckley never goes into a fight without giving away weight he seems to dread taking the slightest advantage that s quite close to foolhardiness when you are dealing with horse thieves and fence cutters who would ambush you any night and shoot you in the back if they could buckley s too full of sand he ll play horatius and hold the bridge once too often some day i m on there drawled the kid i mind that bridge gang in the reader me i go instructed for the other chap spurious somebody the one that fought and pulled his freight to fight em on some other day anyway summed up broncho bob s about the gamest man i ever see along the rio bravo great sam houston if she gets any hotter she ll sizzle broncho whacked at a scorpion with his four pound stetson felt and the three watchers relapsed into comfortless silence how well bob buckley had kept his secret since these men for two years his side comrades in countless border raids and dangers thus spake of him not knowing that he was the most arrant physical coward in all that rio bravo country neither his friends nor his enemies had suspected him of aught else than the finest courage it was purely a physical cowardice and only by an extreme grim effort of will had he forced his craven body to do the bravest deeds scourging himself always as a monk whips his besetting sin buckley threw himself with apparent recklessness into every danger with the hope of some day ridding himself of the despised affliction but each successive test brought no relief and the ranger s face by nature adapted to cheerfulness and good humour became set to the guise of gloomy melancholy thus while the frontier admired his deeds and his prowess was celebrated in print and by word of mouth in many camp fires in the valley of the bravo his heart was sick within him only himself knew of the horrible tightening of the chest the dry mouth the weakening of the spine the agony of the strung nerves the never failing symptoms of his shameful malady one mere boy in his company was wont to enter a fray with a leg perched flippantly about the horn of his saddle a cigarette hanging from his lips which emitted smoke and original slogans of clever invention buckley would have given a year s pay

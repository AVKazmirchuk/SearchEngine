and put a lot of stuff in it about true love and sling in a few stickfuls of funny business joshing the long islanders about being green and well you know how to do it you ought to get fifteen dollars out of it anyhow and it ll cost you only about four dollars you ll make a clear profit of eleven how will it cost me four dollars i asked suspiciously one dollar to mrs mcginnis tripp answered promptly and two dollars to pay the girl s fare back home and the fourth dimension i inquired making a rapid mental calculation one dollar to me said tripp for whiskey are you on i smiled enigmatically and spread my elbows as if to begin writing again but this grim abject specious subservient burr like wreck of a man would not be shaken off his forehead suddenly became shiningly moist don t you see he said with a sort of desperate calmness that this girl has got to be sent home to day not to night nor to morrow but to day i can t do anything for her you know i m the janitor and corresponding secretary of the down and out club i thought you could make a newspaper story out of it and win out a piece of money on general results but anyhow don t you see that she s got to get back home before night and then i began to feel that dull leaden soul depressing sensation known as the sense of duty why should that sense fall upon one as a weight and a burden i knew that i was doomed that day to give up the bulk of my store of hard wrung coin to the relief of this ada lowery but i swore to myself that tripp s whiskey dollar would not be forthcoming he might play knight errant at my expense but he would indulge in no wassail afterward commemorating my weakness and gullibility in a kind of chilly anger i put on my coat and hat tripp submissive cringing vainly endeavoring to please conducted me via the street cars to the human pawn shop of mother mcginnis i paid the fares it seemed that the collodion scented don quixote and the smallest minted coin were strangers tripp pulled the bell at the door of the mouldly red brick boarding house at its faint tinkle he paled and crouched as a rabbit makes ready to spring away at the sound of a hunting dog i guessed what a life he had led terror haunted by the coming footsteps of landladies give me one of the dollars quick he said the door opened six inches mother mcginnis stood there with white eyes they were white i say and a yellow face holding together at her throat with one hand a dingy pink flannel dressing sack tripp thrust the dollar through the space without a word and it bought us entry she s in the parlor said the mcginnis turning the back of her sack upon us in the dim parlor a girl sat at the cracked marble centre table weeping comfortably and eating gum drops she was a flawless beauty crying had only made her brilliant eyes brighter when she crunched a gum drop you thought only of the poetry of motion and envied the senseless confection eve at the age of five minutes must have been a ringer for miss ada lowery at nineteen or twenty i was introduced and a gum drop suffered neglect while she conveyed to me a naive interest such as a puppy dog a prize winner might bestow upon a crawling beetle or a frog tripp took his stand by the table with the fingers of one hand spread upon it as an attorney or a master of ceremonies might have stood but he looked the master of nothing his faded coat was buttoned high as if it sought to be charitable to deficiencies of tie and linen i thought of a scotch terrier at the sight of his shifty eyes in the glade between his tangled hair and beard for one ignoble moment i felt ashamed of having been introduced as his friend in the presence of so much beauty in distress but evidently tripp meant to conduct the ceremonies whatever they might be i thought i detected in his actions and pose an intention of foisting the situation upon me as material for a newspaper story in a lingering hope of extracting from me his whiskey dollar my friend i shuddered mr chalmers said tripp will tell you miss lowery the same that i did he s a reporter and he can hand out the talk better than i can that s why i brought him with me tripp wasn t it the silver tongued orator you wanted he s wise to a lot of things and he ll tell you now what s best to do i stood on one foot as it were as i sat in my rickety chair why er miss lowery i began secretly enraged at tripp s awkward opening i am at your service of course but er as i haven t been apprized of the circumstances of the case i er oh said miss lowery beaming for a moment it ain t as bad as that there ain t any circumstances it s the first time i ve ever been in new york except once when i was five years old and i had no idea it was such a big town and i met mr mr snip on the street and asked him about a friend of mine and he brought me here and asked me to wait i advise you miss lowery said tripp to tell mr chalmers all he s a friend of mine i was getting used to it by this time and he ll give you the right tip why certainly said miss ada chewing a gum drop toward me there ain t anything to tell except that well everything s fixed for me to marry hiram dodd next thursday evening hi has got two hundred acres of land with a lot of shore front and one of the best truck farms on the island but this morning i had my horse saddled up he s a white horse named dancer and i rode over to the station i told em at home i was going to spend the day with susie adams it was a story i guess but i don t care and i came to new york on the train and i met mr mr flip on the street and asked him if he knew where i could find g g now miss lowery broke in tripp loudly and with much bad taste i thought as she hesitated with her word you like this young man hiram dodd don t you he s all right and good to you ain t he of course i like him said miss lowery emphatically hi s all right and of course he s good to me so is everybody i could have sworn it myself throughout miss ada lowery s life all men would be to good to her they would strive contrive struggle and compete to hold umbrellas over her hat check her trunk pick up her handkerchief buy for her soda at the fountain but went on miss lowery last night got to thinking about g george and i down went the bright gold head upon dimpled clasped hands on the table such a beautiful april storm unrestrainedly sobbed i wished i could have comforted her but i was not george and i was glad i was not hiram and yet i was sorry too by and by the shower passed she straightened up brave and half way smiling she would have made a splendid wife for crying only made her eyes more bright and tender she took a gum drop and began her story i guess i m a terrible hayseed she said between her little gulps and sighs but i can t help it g george brown and i were sweet hearts since he was eight and i was five when he was nineteen that was four years ago he left greenburg and went to the city he said he was going to be a policeman or a railroad president or something and then he was coming back for me but i never heard from him any more and i i liked him another flow of tears seemed imminent but tripp hurled himself into the crevasse and dammed it confound him i could see his game he was trying to make a story of it for his sordid ends and profit go on mr chalmers said he and tell the lady what s the proper caper that s what i told her you d hand it to her straight spiel up i coughed and tried to feel less wrathful toward tripp i saw my duty cunningly i had been inveigled but i was securely trapped tripp s first dictum to me had been just and correct the young lady must be sent back to greenburg that day she must be argued with convinced assured instructed ticketed and returned without delay i hated hiram and despised george but duty must be done noblesse oblige and only five silver dollars are not strictly romantic compatibles but sometimes they can be made to jibe it was mine to be sir oracle and then pay the freight so i assumed an air that mingled solomon s with that of the general passenger agent of the long island railroad miss lowery said i as impressively as i could life is rather a queer proposition after all there was a familiar sound to these words after i had spoken them and i hoped miss lowery had never heard mr cohan s song those whom we first love we seldom wed our earlier romances tinged with the magic radiance of youth often fail to materialize the last three words sounded somewhat trite when they struck the air but those fondly cherished dreams i went on may cast a pleasant afterglow on our future lives however impracticable and vague they may have been but life is full of realities as well as visions and dreams one cannot live on memories may i ask miss lowery if you think you could pass a happy that is a contented and harmonious life with mr er dodd if in other ways than romantic recollections he seems to er fill the bill as i might say oh hi s all right answered miss lowery yes i could get along with him fine he s promised me an automobile and a motor boat but somehow when it got so close to the time i was to marry him i couldn t help wishing well just thinking about george something must have happened to him or he d have written on the day he left he and me got a hammer and a chisel and cut a dime into two pieces i took one piece and he took the other and we promised to be true to each other and always keep the pieces till we saw each other again i ve got mine at home now in a ring box in the top drawer of my dresser i guess i was silly to come up here looking for him i never realized what a big place it is and then tripp joined in with a little grating laugh that he had still trying to drag in a little story or drama to earn the miserable dollar that he craved oh the boys from the country forget a lot when they come to the city and learn something i guess george maybe is on the bum or got roped in by some other girl or maybe gone to the dogs on account of whiskey or the races you listen to mr chalmers and go back home and you ll be all right but now the time was come for action for the hands of the clock were moving close to noon frowning upon tripp i argued gently and philosophically with miss lowery delicately convincing her of the importance of returning home at once and i impressed upon her the truth that it would not be absolutely necessary to her future happiness that she mention to hi the wonders or the fact of her visit to the city that had swallowed up the unlucky george she said she had left her horse unfortunate rosinante tied to a tree near the railroad station tripp and i gave her instructions to mount the patient steed as soon as she arrived and ride home as fast as possible there she was to recount the exciting adventure of a day spent with susie adams she could fix susie i was sure of that and all would be well and then being susceptible to the barbed arrows of beauty i warmed to the adventure the three of us hurried to the ferry and there i found the price of a ticket to greenburg to be but a dollar and eighty cents i bought one and a red red rose with the twenty cents for miss lowery we saw her aboard her ferryboat and stood watching her wave her handkerchief at us until it was the tiniest white patch imaginable and then tripp and i faced each other brought back to earth left dry and desolate in the shade of the sombre verities of life the spell wrought by beauty and romance was dwindling i looked at tripp and almost sneered he looked more careworn contemptible and disreputable than ever i fingered the two silver dollars remaining in my pocket and looked at him with the half closed eyelids of contempt he mustered up an imitation of resistance can t you get a story out of it he asked huskily some sort of a story even if you have to fake part of it not a line said i i can fancy the look on grimes face if i should try to put over any slush like this but we ve helped the little lady out and that ll have to be our only reward i m sorry said tripp almost inaudibly i m sorry you re out your money now it seemed to me like a find of a big story you know that is a sort of thing that would write up pretty well let s try to forget it said i with a praiseworthy attempt at gayety and take the next car cross town i steeled myself against his unexpressed but palpable desire he should not coax cajole or wring from me the dollar he craved i had had enough of that wild goose chase tripp feebly unbuttoned his coat of the faded pattern and glossy seams to reach for something that had once been a handkerchief deep down in some obscure and cavernous pocket as he did so i caught the shine of a cheap silver plated watch chain across his vest and something dangling from it caused me to stretch forth my hand and seize it curiously it was the half of a silver dime that had been cut in halves with a chisel what i said looking at him keenly oh yes he responded dully george brown alias tripp what s the use barring the w c t u i d like to know if anybody disapproves of my having produced promptly from my pocket tripp s whiskey dollar and unhesitatingly laying it in his hand the higher pragmatism i where to go for wisdom has become a question of serious import the ancients are discredited plato is boiler plate

rather gather wisdom but how to do so requires knowledge if we know a thing we know it but very often we are not wise to it that we are wise and but let s go on with the story ii once upon a time i found a ten cent magazine lying on a bench in a little city park anyhow that was the amount he asked me for when i sat on the bench next to him he was a musty dingy and tattered magazine with some queer stories bound in him i was sure he turned out to be a scrap book i am a newspaper reporter i said to him to try him i have been detailed to write up some of the experiences of the unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in this park may i ask you to what you attribute your downfall in i was interrupted by a laugh from my purchase a laugh so rusty and unpractised that i was sure it had been his first for many a day oh no no said he you ain t a reporter reporters don t talk that way they pretend to be one of us and say they ve just got in on the blind baggage from st louis i can tell a reporter on sight us park bums get to be fine judges of human nature we sit here all day and watch the people go by i can size up anybody who walks past my bench in a way that would surprise you well i said go on and tell me how do you size me up i should say said the student of human nature with unpardonable hesitation that you was say in the contracting business or maybe worked in a store or was a sign painter you stopped in the park to finish your cigar and thought you d get a little free monologue out of me still you might be a plasterer or a lawyer it s getting kind of dark you see and your wife won t let you smoke at home i frowned gloomily but judging again went on the reader of men i d say you ain t got a wife no said i rising restlessly no no no i ain t but i will have by the arrows of cupid that is if my voice must have trailed away and muffled itself in uncertainty and despair i see you have a story yourself said the dusty vagrant impudently it seemed to me suppose you take your dime back and spin your yarn for me i m interested myself in the ups and downs of unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in the park somehow that amused me i looked at the frowsy derelict with more interest i did have a story why not tell it to him i had told none of my friends i had always been a reserved and bottled up man it was psychical timidity or sensitiveness perhaps both and i smiled to myself in wonder when i felt an impulse to confide in this stranger and vagabond jack said i mack said he mack said i i ll tell you do you want the dime back in advance said he i handed him a dollar the dime said i was the price of listening to your story right on the point of the jaw said he go on and then incredible as it may seem to the lovers in the world who confide their sorrows only to the night wind and the gibbous moon i laid bare my secret to that wreck of all things that you would have supposed to be in sympathy with love i told him of the days and weeks and months that i had spent in adoring mildred telfair i spoke of my despair my grievous days and wakeful nights my dwindling hopes and distress of mind i even pictured to this night prowler her beauty and dignity the great sway she had in society and the magnificence of her life as the elder daughter of an ancient race whose pride overbalanced the dollars of the city s millionaires why don t you cop the lady out asked mack bringing me down to earth and dialect again i explained to him that my worth was so small my income so minute and my fears so large that i hadn t the courage to speak to her of my worship i told him that in her presence i could only blush and stammer and that she looked upon me with a wonderful maddening smile of amusement she kind of moves in the professional class don t she asked mack the telfair family i began haughtily i mean professional beauty said my hearer she is greatly and widely admired i answered cautiously any sisters one you know any more girls why several i answered and a few others say said mack tell me one thing can you hand out the dope to other girls can you chin em and make matinee eyes at em and squeeze em you know what i mean you re just shy when it comes to this particular dame the professional beauty ain t that right in a way you have outlined the situation with approximate truth i admitted i thought so said mack grimly now that reminds me of my own case i ll tell you about it i was indignant but concealed it what was this loafer s case or anybody s case compared with mine besides i had given him a dollar and ten cents feel my muscle said my companion suddenly flexing his biceps i did so mechanically the fellows in gyms are always asking you to do that his arm was as hard as cast iron four years ago said mack i could lick any man in new york outside of the professional ring your case and mine is just the same i come from the west side between thirtieth and fourteenth i won t give the number on the door i was a scrapper when i was ten and when i was twenty no amateur in the city could stand up four rounds with me s a fact you know bill mccarty no he managed the smokers for some of them swell clubs well i knocked out everything bill brought up before me i was a middle weight but could train down to a welter when necessary i boxed all over the west side at bouts and benefits and private entertainments and was never put out once but say the first time i put my foot in the ring with a professional i was no more than a canned lobster i dunno how it was i seemed to lose heart i guess i got too much imagination there was a formality and publieness about it that kind of weakened my nerve i never won a fight in the ring light weights and all kinds of scrubs used to sign up with my manager and then walk up and tap me on the wrist and see me fall the minute i seen the crowd and a lot of gents in evening clothes down in front and seen a professional come inside the ropes i got as weak as ginger ale of course it wasn t long till i couldn t get no backers and i didn t have any more chances to fight a professional or many amateurs either but lemme tell you i was as good as most men inside the ring or out it was just that dumb dead feeling i had when i was up against a regular that always done me up well sir after i had got out of the business i got a mighty grouch on i used to go round town licking private citizens and all kinds of unprofessionals just to please myself i d lick cops in dark streets and car conductors and cab drivers and draymen whenever i could start a row with em it didn t make any difference how big they were or how much science they had i got away with em if i d only just have had the confidence in the ring that i had beating up the best men outside of it i d be wearing black pearls and heliotrope silk socks to day one evening i was walking along near the bowery thinking about things when along comes a slumming party about six or seven they was all in swallowtails and these silk hats that don t shine one of the gang kind of shoves me off the sidewalk i hadn t had a scrap in three days and i just says de lighted and hits him back of the ear well we had it that johnnie put up as decent a little fight as you d want to see in the moving pictures it was on a side street and no cops around the other guy had a lot of science but it only took me about six minutes to lay him out some of the swallowtails dragged him up against some steps and began to fan him another one of em comes over to me and says young man do you know what you ve done oh beat it says i i ve done nothing but a little punching bag work take freddy back to yale and tell him to quit studying sociology on the wrong side of the sidewalk my good fellow says he i don t know who you are but i d like to you ve knocked out reddy burns the champion middle weight of the world he came to new york yesterday to try to get a match on with jim jeifries if you but when i come out of my faint i was laying on the floor in a drug store saturated with aromatic spirits of ammonia if i d known that was reddy burns i d have got down in the gutter and crawled past him instead of handing him one like i did why if i d ever been in a ring and seen him climbing over the ropes i d have been all to the sal volatile so that s what imagination does concluded mack and as i said your case and mine is simultaneous you ll never win out you can t go up against the professionals i tell you it s a park bench for yours in this romance business mack the pessimist laughed harshly i m afraid i don t see the parallel i said coldly i have only a very slight acquaintance with the prize ring the derelict touched my sleeve with his forefinger for emphasis as he explained his parable every man said he with some dignity has got his lamps on something that looks good to him with you it s this dame that you re afraid to say your say to with me it was to win out in the ring well you ll lose just like i did why do you think i shall lose i asked warmly cause said he you re afraid to go in the ring you dassen t stand up before a professional your case and mine is just the same you re a amateur and that means that you d better keep outside of the ropes well i must be going i said rising and looking with elaborate care at my watch when i was twenty feet away the park bencher called to me much obliged for the dollar he said and for the dime but you ll never get er you re in the amateur class serves you right i said to myself for hobnobbing with a tramp his impudence but as i walked his words seemed to repeat themselves over and over again in my brain i think i even grew angry at the man i ll show him i finally said aloud i ll show him that i can fight reddy burns too even knowing who he is i hurried to a telephone booth and rang up the telfair residence a soft sweet voice answered didn t i know that voice my hand holding the receiver shook is that you said i employing the foolish words that form the vocabulary of every talker through the telephone yes this is i came back the answer in the low clear cut tones that are an inheritance of the telfairs who is it please it s me said i less ungrammatically than egotistically it s me and i ve got a few things that i want to say to you right now and immediately and straight to the point dear me said the voice oh it s you mr arden i wondered if any accent on the first word was intended mildred was fine at saying things that you had to study out afterward yes said i i hope so and now to come down to brass tacks i thought that rather a vernacularism if there is such a word as soon as i had said it but i didn t stop to apologize you know of course that i love you and that i have been in that idiotic state for a long time i don t want any more foolish ness about it that is i mean i want an answer from you right now will you marry me or not hold the wire please keep out central hello hello will you or will you not that was just the uppercut for reddy burns chin the answer came back why phil dear of course i will i didn t know that you that is you never said oh come up to the house please i can t say what i want to over the phone you are so importunate but please come up to the house won t you would i i rang the bell of the telfair house violently some sort of a human came to the door and shooed me into the drawing room oh well said i to myself looking at the ceiling any one can learn from any one that was a pretty good philosophy of mack s anyhow he didn t take advantage of his experience but i get the benefit of it if you want to get into the professional class you ve got to i stopped thinking then some one was coming down the stairs my knees began to shake i knew then how mack had felt when a professional began to climb over the ropes i looked around foolishly for a door or a window by which i might escape if it had been any other girl approaching i mightn t have but just then the door opened and bess mildred s younger sister came in i d never seen her look so much like a glorified angel she walked straight tip to me and and i d never noticed before what perfectly wonderful eyes and hair elizabeth telfair had phil she said in the telfair sweet thrilling tones why didn t you tell me about it before i thought it was sister you wanted all the time until you telephoned to me a few minutes ago i suppose mack and i always will be hopeless amateurs but as the thing has turned out in my case i m mighty glad of it best seller i one day last summer i went to pittsburgh well i had to go there on business my chair car was profitably well filled with people of the kind one usually sees on chair cars most of them were ladies in brown silk dresses cut with square yokes with lace insertion and dotted veils who refused to have the windows raised then there was the usual number of men who looked as if they might be in almost any business and going almost anywhere some students of human nature can look at a man in a pullman and tell you where he is from his occupation and his stations in life both flag and social but i never could the only way i can correctly judge a fellow traveller is when the train is held up by robbers or when he reaches at the same time i do for the last towel in the dressing room of the sleeper the porter came and brushed the collection of soot on the window sill off to the left knee of my trousers i removed it with an air of apology the temperature was eighty eight one of the dotted veiled ladies demanded the closing of two more ventilators and spoke loudly of interlaken i leaned back idly in chair no and looked with the tepidest curiosity at the small black bald spotted head just visible above the back of no suddenly no hurled a book to the floor between his chair and the window and looking i saw that it was the rose lady and trevelyan one of the best selling novels of the present day and then the critic or philistine whichever he was veered his chair toward the window and i knew him at once for john a pescud of pittsburgh travelling salesman for a plate glass company an old acquaintance whom i had not seen in two years in two minutes we were faced had shaken hands and had finished with such topics as rain prosperity health residence and destination politics might have followed next but i was not so ill fated i wish you might know john a pescud he is of the stuff that heroes are not often lucky enough to be made of he is a small man with a wide smile and an eye that seems to be fixed upon that little red spot on the end of your nose i never saw him wear but one kind of necktie and he believes in cuff holders and button shoes he is as hard and true as anything ever turned out by the cambria steel works and he believes that as soon as pittsburgh makes smoke consumers compulsory st peter will come down and sit at the foot of smithfield street and let somebody else attend to the gate up in the branch heaven he believes that our plate glass is the most important commodity in the world and that when a man is in his home town he ought to be decent and law abiding during my acquaintance with him in the city of diurnal night i had never known his views on life romance literature and ethics we had browsed during our meetings on local topics and then parted after chateau margaux irish stew flannel cakes cottage pudding and coffee hey there with milk separate now i was to get more of his ideas by way of facts he told me that business had picked up since the party conventions and that he was going to get off at coketown ii say said pescud stirring his discarded book with the toe of his right shoe did you ever read one of these best sellers i mean the kind where the hero is an american swell sometimes even from chicago who falls in love with a royal princess from europe who is travelling under an alias and follows her to her father s kingdom or principality i guess you have they re all alike sometimes this going away masher is a washington newspaper correspondent and sometimes he is a van something from new york or a chicago wheat broker worthy fifty millions but he s always ready to break into the king row of any foreign country that sends over their queens and princesses to try the new plush seats on the big four or the b and there doesn t seem to be any other reason in the book for their being here well this fellow chases the royal chair warmer home as i said and finds out who she is he meets here on the corso or the strasse one evening and gives us ten pages of conversation she reminds him of the difference in their stations and that gives him a chance to ring in three solid pages about america s uncrowned sovereigns if you d take his remarks and set em to music and then take the music away from em they d sound exactly like one of george cohan s songs well you know how it runs on if you ve read any of em he slaps the king s swiss body guards around like everything whenever they get in his way he s a great fencer too now i ve known of some chicago men who were pretty notorious fences but i never heard of any fencers coming from there he stands on the first landing of the royal staircase in castle schutzenfestenstein with a gleaming rapier in his hand and makes a baltimore broil of six platoons of traitors who come to massacre the said king and then he has to fight duels with a couple of chancellors and foil a plot by four austrian archdukes to seize the kingdom for a gasoline station but the great scene is when his rival for the princess hand count feodor attacks him between the portcullis and the ruined chapel armed with a mitrailleuse a yataghan and a couple of siberian bloodhounds this scene is what runs the best seller into the twenty ninth edition before the publisher has had time to draw a check for the advance royalties the american hero shucks his coat and throws it over the heads of the bloodhounds gives the mitrailleuse a slap with his mitt says yah to the yataghan and lands in kid mccoy s best style on the count s left eye of course we have a neat little prize fight right then and there the count in order to make the go possible seems to be an expert at the art of self defence himself and here we have the corbett sullivan fight done over into literature the book ends with the broker and the princess doing a john cecil clay cover under the linden trees on the gorgonzola walk that winds up the love story plenty good enough but i notice that the book dodges the final issue even a best seller has sense enough to shy at either leaving a chicago grain broker on the throne of lobsterpotsdam or bringing over a real princess to eat fish and potato salad in an italian chalet on michigan avenue what do you think about em why said i i hardly know john there s a saying love levels all ranks you know yes said pescud but these kind of love stories are rank on the level i know something about literature even if i am in plate glass these kind of books are wrong and yet i never go into a train but what they pile em up on me no good can come out of an international clinch between the old world aristocracy and one of us fresh americans when people in real life marry they generally hunt up somebody in their own station a fellow usually picks out a girl that went to the same high school and belonged to the same singing society that he did when young millionaires fall in love they always select the chorus girl that likes the same kind of sauce on the lobster that he does washington newspaper correspondents always many widow ladies ten years older than themselves who keep boarding houses no sir you can t make a novel sound right to me when it makes one of c d gibson s bright young men go abroad and turn kingdoms upside down just because he s a taft american aud took a course at a gymnasium and listen how they talk too pescud picked up the best seller and hunted his page listen at this said he trevelyan is chinning with the princess alwyna at the back end of the tulip garden this is how it goes say not so dearest and sweetest of earth s fairest flowers would i aspire you are a star set high above me in a royal heaven i am only myself yet i am a man and i have a heart to do and dare i have no title save that of an uncrowned sovereign but i have an arm and a sword that yet might free schutzenfestenstein from the plots of traitors think of a chicago man packing a sword and talking about freeing anything that sounded as much like canned pork as that he d be much more likely to fight to have an import duty put on it i think i understand you john said i you want fiction writers to be consistent with their scenes and characters they shouldn t mix turkish pashas with vermont farmers or english dukes with long island clam diggers or italian countesses with montana cowboys or cincinnati brewery agents with the rajahs of india or plain business men with aristocracy high above em added pescud it don t jibe people are divided into classes whether we admit it or not and it s everybody s impulse to stick to their own class they do it too i don t see why people go to work and buy hundreds of thousands of books like that you don t see or hear of any such didoes and capers in real life iii well john said i i haven t read a best seller in a long time maybe i ve had notions about them somewhat like yours but tell me more about yourself getting along all right with the company bully said pescud brightening at once i ve had my salary raised twice since i saw you and i get a commission too i ve bought a neat slice of real estate out in the east end and have run up a house on it next year the firm is going to sell me some shares of stock oh i m in on the line of general prosperity no matter who s elected met your affinity yet john i asked oh i didn t tell you about that did i said pescud with a broader grin ho i said so you ve taken time enough off from your plate glass to have a romance no no said john no romance nothing like that but i ll tell you about it i was on the south bound going to cincinnati about eighteen months ago when i saw across the aisle the finest looking girl i d ever laid eyes on nothing spectacular you know but just the sort you want for keeps well i never was up to the flirtation business either handkerchief automobile postage stamp or door step and she wasn t the kind to start anything she read a book and minded her business which was to make the world prettier and better just by residing on it i kept on looking out of the side doors of my eyes and finally the proposition got out of the pullman class into a case of a cottage with a lawn and vines running over the porch i never thought of speaking to her but i let the plate glass business go to smash for a while she changed cars at cincinnati and took a sleeper to louisville over the l and n there she bought another ticket and went on through shelbyville frankfort and lexington along there i began to have a hard time keeping up with her the trains came along when they pleased and didn t seem to be going anywhere in particular except to keep on the track and the right of way as much as possible then they began to stop at junctions instead of towns and at last they stopped altogether i ll bet pinkerton would outbid the plate glass people for my services any time if they knew how i managed to shadow that young lady i contrived to keep out of her sight as much as i could but i never lost track of her the last station she got off at was away down in virginia about six in the afternoon there were about fifty houses and four hundred niggers in sight the rest was red mud mules and speckled hounds a tall old man with a smooth face and white hair looking as proud as julius caesar and roscoe conkling on the same post card was there to meet her his clothcs were frazzled but i didn t notice that till later he took her little satchel and they started over the plank walks and went up a road along the hill i kept along a piece behind em trying to look like i was hunting a garnet ring in the sand that my sister had lost at a picnic the previous saturday they went in a gate on top of the hill it nearly took my breath away when i looked up up there in the biggest grove i ever saw was a tremendous house with round white pillars about a thousand feet high and the yard was so full of rose bushes and box bushes and lilacs that you couldn t have seen the house if it hadn t been as big as the capitol at washington here s where i have to trail says i to myself i thought before that she seemed to be in moderate circumstances at least this must be the governor s mansion or the agricultural building of a new world s fair anyhow i d better go back to the village and get posted by the postmaster or drug the druggist for some information in the village i found a pine hotel called the bay view house the only excuse for the name was a bay horse grazing in the front yard i set my sample case down and tried to be ostensible i told the landlord i was taking orders for plate glass i don t want no plates says he but i do need another glass molasses pitcher by and by i got him down to local gossip and answering questions why says he i thought everybody knowed who lived in the big white house on the hill it s colonel allyn the biggest man and the finest quality in virginia or anywhere else they re the oldest family in the state that was his daughter that got off the train she s been up to illinois to see her aunt who is sick i registered at the hotel and on the third day i caught the young lady walking in the front yard down next to the paling fence i stopped and raised my hat there wasn t any other way excuse me says i can you tell me where mr hinkle lives she looks at me as cool as if i was the man come to see about the weeding of the garden but i thought i saw just a slight twinkle of fun in her eyes no one of that name lives in birchton says she that is she goes on as far as i know is the gentleman you are seeking white well that tickled me no kidding says i i m not looking for smoke even if i do come from pittsburgh you are quite a distance from home says she i d have gone a thousand miles farther says i not if you hadn t waked up when the train started in shelbyville says she and then she turned almost as red as one of the roses on the bushes in the yard i remembered i had dropped off to sleep on a bench in the shelbyville station waiting to see which train she took and only just managed to wake up in time and then i told her why i had come as respectful and earnest as i could and i told her everything about myself and what i was making and how that all i asked was just to get acquainted with her and try to get her to like me she smiles a little and blushes some but her eyes never get mixed up they look straight at whatever she s talking to i never had any one talk like this to me before mr pescud says she what did you say your name is john john a says i and you came mighty near missing the train at powhatan junction too says she with a laugh that sounded as good as a mileage book to me how did you know i asked men are very clumsy said she i knew you were on every train i thought you were going to speak to me and i m glad you didn t then we had more talk and at last a kind of proud serious look came on her face and she turned and pointed a finger at the big house the allyns says she have lived in elmcroft for a hundred years we are a proud family look at that mansion it has fifty rooms see the pillars and porches and balconies the ceilings in the reception rooms and the ball room are twenty eight feet high my father is a lineal descendant of belted earls i belted one of em once in the duquesne hotel in pittsburgh says i and he didn t offer to resent it he was there dividing his attentions between monongahela whiskey and heiresses and he got fresh of course she goes on my father wouldn t allow a drummer to set his foot in elmeroft if he knew that i was talking to one over the fence he would lock me in my room would you let me come there says i would you talk to me if i was to call for i goes on if you said i might come and see you the earls might be belted or suspendered or pinned up with safety pins as far as i am concerned i must not talk to you she says because we have not been introduced it is not exactly proper so i will say good bye mr say the name says i you haven t forgotten it pescud says she a little mad the rest of the name i demands cool as could be john says she john what i says john a says she with her head high are you through now i m coming to see the belted earl to morrow i says he ll feed you to his fox hounds says she laughing if he does it ll improve their running says i i m something of a hunter myself i must be going in now says she i oughtn t to have spoken to you at all i hope you ll have a pleasant trip back to minneapolis or pittsburgh was it good bye good night says i and it wasn t minneapolis what s your name first please she hesitated then she pulled a leaf off a bush and said my name is jessie says she good night miss allyn says i the next morning at eleven sharp i rang the door bell of that world s fair main building after about three quarters of an hour an old nigger man about eighty showed up and asked what i wanted i gave him my business card and said i wanted to see the colonel he showed me in say did you ever crack open a wormy english walnut that s what that house was like there wasn t enough furniture in it to fill an eight dollar flat some old horsehair lounges and three legged chairs and some framed ancestors on the walls were all that met the eye but when colonel allyn comes in the place seemed to light up you could almost hear a band playing and see a bunch of old timers in wigs and white stockings dancing a quadrille it was the style of him although he had on the same shabby clothes i saw him wear at the station for about nine seconds he had me rattled and i came mighty near getting cold feet and trying to sell him some plate glass but i got my nerve back pretty quick he asked me to sit down and i told him everything i told him how i followed his daughter from cincinnati and what i did it for and all about my salary and prospects and explained to him my little code of living to be always decent and right in your home town and when you re on the road never take more than four glasses of beer a day or play higher than a twenty five cent limit at first i thought he was going to throw me out of the window but i kept on talking pretty soon i got a chance to tell him that story about the western congressman who had lost his pocket book and the grass widow you remember that story well that got him to laughing and i ll bet that was the first laugh those ancestors and horsehair sofas had heard in many a day we talked two hours i told him everything i knew and then he began to ask questions and i told him the rest all i asked of him was to give me a chance if i couldn t make a hit with the little lady i d clear out and not bother any more at last he says there was a sir courtenay pescud in the time of charles i if i remember rightly if there was says i he can t claim kin with our bunch we ve always lived in and around pittsburgh i ve got an uncle in the real estate business and one in trouble somewhere out in kansas you can inquire about any of the rest of us from anybody in old smoky town and get satisfactory replies did you ever run across that story about the captain of the whaler who tried to make a sailor say his prayers says i it occurs to me that i have never been so fortunate says the colonel so i told it to him laugh i was wishing to myself that he was a customer what a bill of glass i d sell him and then he says the relating of anecdotes and humorous occurrences has always seemed to me mr pescud to be a particularly agreeable way of promoting and perpetuating amenities between friends with your permission i will relate to you a fox hunting story with which i was personally connected and which may furnish you some amusement so he tells it it takes forty minutes by the watch did i laugh well say when i got my face straight he calls in old pete the super annuated darky and sends him down to the hotel to bring up my valise it was elmcroft for me while i was in the town two evenings later i got a chance to speak a word with miss jessie alone on the porch while the colonel was thinking up another story it s going to be a fine evening says i he s coming says she he s going to tell you this time the story about the old negro and the green watermelons it always comes after the one about the yankees and the game rooster there was another time she goes on that you nearly got left it was at pulaski city yes says i i remember my foot slipped as i was jumping on the step and i nearly tumbled off i know says she and and i i was afraid you had john a i was afraid you had and then she skips into the house through one of the big windows iv coketown droned the porter making his way through the slowing car pescud gathered his hat and baggage with the leisurely promptness of an old traveller i married her a year ago said john i told you i built a house in the east end the belted i mean the colonel is there too i find him waiting at the gate whenever i get back from a trip to hear any new story i might have picked up on the road i glanced out of the window coketown was nothing more than a ragged hillside dotted with a score of black dismal huts propped up against dreary mounds of slag and clinkers it rained in slanting torrents too and the rills foamed and splashed down through the black mud to the railroad tracks you won t sell much plate glass here john said i why do you get off at this end o the world why said pescud the other day i took jessie for a little trip to philadelphia and coming back she thought she saw some petunias in a pot in one of those windows over there just like some she used to raise down in the old virginia home so i thought i d drop off here for the night and see if i could dig up some of the cuttings or blossoms for her here we are good night old man i gave you the address come out and see us when you have time the train moved forward one of the dotted brown ladies insisted on having windows raised now that the rain beat against them the porter came along with his mysterious wand and began to light the car i glanced downward and saw the best seller i picked it up and set it carefully farther along on the floor of the car where the rain drops would not fall upon it and then suddenly i smiled and seemed to see that life has no geographical metes and bounds good luck to you trevelyan i said and may you get the petunias for your princess rus in urbe considering men in relation to money there are three kinds whom i dislike men who have more money than they can spend men who have more money than they do spend and men who spend more money than they have of the three varieties i believe i have the least liking for the first but as a man i liked spencer grenville north pretty well although he had something like two or ten or thirty millions i ve forgotten exactly how many i did not leave town that summer i usually went down to a village on the south

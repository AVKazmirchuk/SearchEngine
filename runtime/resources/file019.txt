the best by you we knew how well well says uncle emsley that jackson bird is sure a seldom kind of a snoozer during the progress of jud s story he had been slowly but deftly combining certain portions of the contents of his sacks and cans toward the close of it he set before me the finished product a pair of red hot rich hued pancakes on a tin plate from some secret hoarding he also brought a lump of excellent butter and a bottle of golden syrup how long ago did these things happen i asked him three years said jud they re living on the mired mule ranch now but i haven t seen either of em since they say jackson bird was fixing his ranch up fine with rocking chairs and window curtains all the time he was putting me up the pancake tree oh i got over it after a while but the boys kept the racket up did you make these cakes by the famous recipe i asked didn t i tell you there wasn t no receipt said jud the boys hollered pancakes till they got pancake hungry and i cut this recipe out of a newspaper how does the truck taste they re delicious i answered why don t you have some too jud i was sure i heard a sigh me said jud i don t ever eat em seats of the haughty golden by day and silver by night a new trail now leads to us across the indian ocean dusky kings and princes have found our bombay of the west and few be their trails that do not lead down to broadway on their journey for to admire and for to see if chance should ever lead you near a hotel that transiently shelters some one of these splendid touring grandees i counsel you to seek lucullus polk among the republican tuft hunters that besiege its entrances he will be there you will know him by his red alert wellington nosed face by his manner of nervous caution mingled with determination by his assumed promoter s or broker s air of busy impatience and by his bright red necktie gallantly redressing the wrongs of his maltreated blue serge suit like a battle standard still waving above a lost cause i found him profitable and so may you when you do look for him look among the light horse troop of bedouins that besiege the picket line of the travelling potentate s guards and secretaries among the wild eyed genii of arabian afternoons that gather to make astounding and egregrious demands upon the prince s coffers i first saw mr polk coming down the steps of the hotel at which sojourned his highness the gaekwar of baroda most enlightened of the mahratta princes who of late ate bread and salt in our metropolis of the occident lucullus moved rapidly as though propelled by some potent moral force that imminently threatened to become physical behind him closely followed the impetus a hotel detective if ever white alpine hat hawk s nose implacable watch chain and loud refinement of manner spoke the truth a brace of uniformed porters at his heels preserved the smooth decorum of the hotel repudiating by their air of disengagement any suspicion that they formed a reserve squad of ejectment safe on the sidewalk lucullus polk turned and shook a freckled fist at the caravansary and to my joy he began to breathe deep invective in strange words rides in howdays does he he cried loudly and sneeringly rides on elephants in howdahs and calls himself a prince kings yah comes over here and talks horse till you would think he was a president and then goes home and rides in a private dining room strapped onto an elephant well well well the ejecting committee quietly retired the scorner of princes turned to me and snapped his fingers what do you think of that he shouted derisively the gaekwar of baroda rides in an elephant in a howdah and there s old bikram shamsher jang scorching up and down the pig paths of khatmandu on a motor cycle wouldn t that maharajah you and the shah of persia that ought to have been muley on the spot for at least three he s got the palanquin habit and that funny hat prince from korea wouldn t you think he could afford to amble around on a milk white palfrey once in a dynasty or two nothing doing his idea of a balaklava charge is to tuck his skirts under him and do his mile in six days over the hog wallows of seoul in a bull cart that s the kind of visiting potentates that come to this country now it s a hard deal friend i murmured a few words of sympathy but it was uncomprehending for i did not know his grievance against the rulers who flash meteor like now and then upon our shores the last one i sold continued the displeased one was to that three horse tailed turkish pasha that came over a year ago five hundred dollars he paid for it easy i says to his executioner or secretary he was a kind of a jew or a chinaman his turkey gibbets is fond of horses then him says the secretary well no he s got a big fat wife in the harem named bad dora that he don t like i believe he intends to saddle her up and ride her up and down the board walk in the bulbul gardens a few times every day you haven t got a pair of extra long spurs you could throw in on the deal have you yes sir there s mighty few real rough riders among the royal sports these days as soon as lucullus polk got cool enough i picked him up and with no greater effort than you would employ

had been every kind of fool except one i had expended my patrimony pretended my matrimony played poker lawn tennis and bucket shops parted soon with my money in many ways but there remained one rule of the wearer of cap and bells that i had not played that was the seeker after buried treasure to few does the delectable furor come but of all the would be followers in the hoof prints of king midas none has found a pursuit so rich in pleasurable promise but going back from my theme a while as lame pens must do i was a fool of the sentimental soft i saw may martha mangum and was hers she was eighteen the color of the white ivory keys of a new piano beautiful and possessed by the exquisite solemnity and pathetic witchery of an unsophisticated angel doomed to live in a small dull texas prairie town she had a spirit and charm that could have enabled her to pluck rubies like raspberries from the crown of belgium or any other sporty kingdom but she did not know it and i did not paint the picture for her you see i wanted may martha mangum for to have and to hold i wanted her to abide with me and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings may martha s father was a man hidden behind whiskers and spectacles he lived for bugs and butterflies and all insects that fly or crawl or buzz or get down your back or in the butter he was an etymologist or words to that effect he spent his life seining the air for flying fish of the june bug order and then sticking pins through em and calling em names he and may martha were the whole family he prized her highly as a fine specimen of the racibus humanus because she saw that he had food at times and put his clothes on right side before and kept his alcohol bottles filled scientists they say are apt to be absent minded there was another besides myself who thought may martha mangum one to be desired that was goodloe banks a young man just home from college he had all the attainments to be found in books latin greek philosophy and especially the higher branches of mathematics and logic if it hadn t been for his habit of pouring out this information and learning on every one that he addressed i d have liked him pretty well but even as it was he and i were you would have thought great pals we got together every time we could because each of us wanted to pump the other for whatever straws we could to find which way the wind blew from the heart of may martha mangum rather a mixed metaphor goodloe banks would never have been guilty of that that is the way of rivals you might say that goodloe ran to books manners culture rowing intellect and clothes i would have put you in mind more of baseball and friday night debating societies by way of culture and maybe of a good horseback rider but in our talks together and in our visits and conversation with may martha neither goodloe banks nor i could find out which one of us she preferred may martha was a natural born non committal and knew in her cradle how to keep people guessing as i said old man mangum was absentminded after a long time he found out one day a little butterfly must have told him that two young men were trying to throw a net over the head of the young person a daughter or some such technical appendage who looked after his comforts i never knew scientists could rise to such occasions old mangum orally labelled and classified goodloe and myself easily among the lowest orders of the vertebrates and in english too without going any further into latin than the simple references to orgetorix rex helvetii which is as far as i ever went myself and he told us that if he ever caught us around his house again he would add us to his collection goodloe banks and i remained away five days expecting the storm to subside when we dared to call at the house again may martha mangum and her father were gone gone the house they had rented was closed their little store of goods and chattels was gone also and not a word of farewell to either of us from may martha not a white fluttering note pinned to the hawthorn bush not a chalk mark on the gate post nor a post card in the post office to give us a clew for two months goodloe banks and i separately tried every scheme we could think of to track the runaways we used our friendship and influence with the ticket agent with livery stable men railroad conductors and our one lone lorn constable but without results then we became better friends and worse enemies than ever we forgathered in the back room of snyder s saloon every afternoon after work and played dominoes and laid conversational traps to find out from each other if anything had been discovered that is the way of rivals now goodloe banks had a sarcastic way of displaying his own learning and putting me in the class that was reading poor jane ray her bird is dead she cannot play well i rather liked goodloe and i had a contempt for his college learning and i was always regarded as good natured so i kept my temper and i was trying to find out if he knew anything about may martha so i endured his society in talking things over one afternoon he said to me suppose you do find her ed whereby would you profit miss mangum has a mind perhaps it is

office at its head was the admiral of the navy somewhere felipe had raked together a pitiful semblance of a military uniform a pair of red trousers a dingy blue short jacket heavily ornamented with gold braid and an old fatigue cap that must have been cast away by one of the british soldiers in belize and brought away by felipe on one of his coasting voyages buckled around his waist was an ancient ship s cutlass contributed to his equipment by pedro lafitte the baker who proudly asserted its inheritance from his ancestor the illustrious buccaneer at the admiral s heels tagged his newly shipped crew three grinning glossy black caribs bare to the waist the sand spurting in showers from the spring of their naked feet briefly and with dignity felipe demanded his vessel of the collector and now a fresh honor awaited him the collector s wife who played the guitar and read novels in the hammock all day had more than a little romance in her placid yellow bosom she had found in an old book an engraving of a flag that purported to be the naval flag of anchuria perhaps it had so been designed by the founders of the nation but as no navy had ever been established oblivion had claimed the flag laboriously with her own hands she had made a flag after the pattern a red cross upon a blue and white ground he presented it to felipe with these words brave sailor this flag is of your country be true and defend it with your life go you with god for the first time since his appointment the admiral showed a flicker of emotion he took the silken emblem and passed his hand reverently over its surface i am the admiral he said to the collector s lady being on land he could bring himself to no more exuberant expression of sentiment at sea with the flag at the masthead of his navy some more eloquent exposition of feelings might be forthcoming abruptly the admiral departed with his crew for the next three days they were busy giving the estrella del noche a new coat of white paint trimmed with blue and then felipe further adorned himself by fastening a handful of brilliant parrot s plumes in his cap again he tramped with his faithful crew to the collector s office and formally notified him that the sloop s name had been changed to el nacional during the next few months the navy had its troubles even an admiral is perplexed to know what to do without any orders but none came neither did any salaries el nacional swung idly at anchor when felipe s little store of money was exhausted he went to the collector and raised the question of finances salaries exclaimed the collector with hands raised valgame dios not one centavo of my own pay have i received for the last seven months the pay of an admiral do you ask quien sabe should it be less than three thousand pesos mira you will see a revolution in this country very soon a good sign of it is when the government calls all the time for pesos pesos pesos and pays none out felipe left the collector s office with a look almost of content on his sombre face a revolution would mean fighting and then the government would need his services it was rather humiliating to be an admiral without anything to do and have a hungry crew at your heels begging for reales to buy plantains and tobacco with when he returned to where his happy go lucky caribs were waiting they sprang up and saluted as he had drilled them to do come muchachos said the admiral it seems that the government is poor it has no money to give us we will earn what we need to live upon thus will we serve our country soon his heavy eyes almost lighted up it may gladly call upon us for help thereafter el nacional turned out with the other coast craft and became a wage earner she worked with the lighters freighting bananas and oranges out to the fruit steamers that could not approach nearer than a mile from the shore surely a self supporting navy deserves red letters in the budget of any nation after earning enough at freighting to keep himself and his crew in provisions for a week felipe would anchor the navy and hang about the little telegraph office looking like one of the chorus of an insolvent comic opera troupe besieging the manager s den a hope for orders from the capital was always in his heart that his services as admiral had never been called into requirement hurt his pride and patriotism at every call he would inquire gravely and expectantly for despatches the operator would pretend to make a search and then reply not yet it seems senor el almirante poco tiempo outside in the shade of the lime trees the crew chewed sugar cane or slumbered well content to serve a country that was contented with so little service one day in the early summer the revolution predicted by the collector flamed out suddenly it had long been smoldering at the first note of alarm the admiral of the navy force and fleet made all sail for a larger port on the coast of a neighboring republic where he traded a hastily collected cargo of fruit for its value in cartridges for the five martini rifles the only guns that the navy could boast then to the telegraph office sped the admiral sprawling in his favorite corner in his fast decaying uniform with his prodigious sabre distributed between his red legs he waited for the long delayed but now soon expected orders not yet senor el almirante the telegraph clerk would

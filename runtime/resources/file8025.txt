were travelling the pace that passes all understanding james williams you would have guessed was about twenty four it will gratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate he was exactly twenty three years eleven months and twenty nine days old he was well built active strong jawed good natured and rising he was on his wedding trip dear kind fairy please cut out those orders for money and h p touring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of the boat club instead of any of them turn backward oh turn backward and give us just a teeny weeny bit of our wedding trip over again just an hour dear fairy so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees looked and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin even if it was the hatpins that did the work can t do it very well hurry up with that touring car and the oil stock then just in front of mrs james williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses only in dreams and milliners shops do we alas gather grapes and roses at one swipe this girl gazed with large blue eyes credulous when the megaphone man roared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should be concerned between blasts she resorted to epictetian philosophy in the form of pepsin chewing gum at this girl s right hand sat a young man about twenty four he was well built active strong jawed and good natured but if his description seems to follow that of james williams divest it of anything cloverdalian this man belonged to hard streets and sharp corners he looked keenly about him seeming to begrudge the asphalt under the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch while the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry let me whisper you through the low tuned cardiaphone to sit tight for now things are about to happen and the great city will close over them again as over a scrap of ticker tape floating down from the den of a broad street bear the girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the last seat the other passengers she had absorbed the seat behind her was her bluebeard s chamber her eyes met those of mrs james williams between two ticks of a watch they exchanged their life s experiences histories hopes and fancies and all mind you with the eye before two men could have decided whether to draw steel or borrow a match the bride leaned forward low she and the girl spoke rapidly together their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents a comparison that is not meant to go further two smiles and a dozen nods closed the conference and now in the broad quiet avenue in front of the rubberneck car a man in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand from the sidewalk another hurried to join him the girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm and whispered in his ear that young man exhibited proof of ability to act promptly crouching low he slid over the edge of the car hung lightly for an instant and then disappeared half a dozen of the top riders observed his feat wonderingly but made no comment deeming it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional manner of alighting in this bewildering city the truant passenger dodged a hansom and then floated past like a leaf on a stream between a furniture van and a florist s delivery wagon the girl in the tan jacket turned again and looked in the eyes of mrs james williams then she faced about and sat still while the rubberneck auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the plainclothes man what s eatin you demanded the megaphonist abandoning his professional discourse for pure english keep her at anchor for a minute ordered the officer there s a man on board we want a philadelphia burglar called pinky mcguire there he is on the back seat look out for the side donovan donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at james williams come down old sport he said pleasantly we ve got you back to sleepytown for yours it ain t a bad idea hidin on a rubberneck though i ll remember that softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor better step off sir and explain the car must proceed on its tour james williams belonged among the level heads with necessary slowness he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front of the car his wife followed but she first turned her eyes and saw the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind a tree on the edge of the little park not fifty feet away descended to the ground james williams faced his captors with a smile he was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in cloverdale about having been mistaken for a burglar the rubberneck coach lingered out of respect for its patrons what could be a more interesting sight than this my name is james williams of cloverdale missouri he said kindly so that they would not be too greatly mortified i have letters here that will show you ll come with us please announced the plainclothes man pinky mcguire s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds a detective saw you on the rubberneck up at central park and phoned down to take you in do your explaining at the station house james williams s wife his bride of two weeks looked him in the face with a strange soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks looked him in the face and said go with em quietly pinky and maybe it ll be in your favour and then as the glaring at gotham car rolled away she turned and threw a kiss his wife threw a kiss at some one high up on the seats of the rubberneck your girl gives you good advice mcguire said donovan come on now and then madness descended upon and occupied james williams he pushed his hat far upon the back of his head my wife seems to think i am a burglar he said recklessly i never heard of her being crazy therefore i must be and if i m crazy they can t do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops had to be whistled for and afterwards the reserves to disperse a few thousand delighted spectators at the station house the desk sergeant asked for his name mcdoodle the pink or pinky the brute i forget which was james williams s answer but you can bet i m a burglar don t leave that out and you might add that it took five of em to pluck the pink i d especially like to have that in the records in an hour came mrs james williams with uncle thomas of madison avenue in a respect compelling motor car and proofs of the hero s innocence for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an automobile mfg co after the police had sternly reprimanded james williams for imitating a copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the department was capable of mrs williams rearrested him and swept him into an angle of the station house james williams regarded her with one eye he always said that donovan closed the other while somebody was holding his good right hand never before had he given her a word of reproach or of reproof if you can explain he began rather stiffly why you dear she interrupted listen it was an hour s pain and trial to you i did it for her i mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach i was so happy jim so happy with you that i didn t dare to refuse that happiness to another jim they were married only this morning those two and i wanted him to get away while they were struggling with you i saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park that s all of it dear i had to do it thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one by rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings but bride knoweth bride at the glance of an eye and between them swiftly passes comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of the romance of a busy broker pitcher confidential clerk in the office of harvey maxwell broker allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half past nine in company with his young lady stenographer with a snappy good morning pitcher maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were intending to leap over it and then plunged into the great heap of letters and telegrams waiting there for him the young lady had been maxwell s stenographer for a year she was beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic she forewent the pomp of the alluring pompadour she wore no chains bracelets or lockets she had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to luncheon her dress was grey and plain but it fitted her figure with fidelity and discretion in her neat black turban hat was the gold green wing of a macaw on this morning she was softly and shyly radiant her eyes were dreamily bright her cheeks genuine peachblow her expression a happy one tinged with reminiscence pitcher still mildly curious noticed a difference in her ways this morning instead of going straight into the adjoining room where her desk was she lingered slightly irresolute in the outer office once she moved over by maxwell s desk near enough for him to be aware of her presence the machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man it was a busy new york broker moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs well what is it anything asked maxwell sharply his opened mail lay like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk his keen grey eye impersonal and brusque flashed upon her half impatiently nothing answered the stenographer moving away with a little smile mr pitcher she said to the confidential clerk did mr maxwell say anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer he did answered pitcher he told me to get another one i notified the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning it s o clock and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple chewing gum has showed up yet i will do the work as usual then said the young lady until some one comes to fill the place and she went to her desk at once and hung the black turban hat with the gold green macaw wing in its accustomed place he who has been denied the spectacle of a busy manhattan broker during a rush of business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology the poet sings of the crowded hour of glorious life the broker s hour is not only crowded but the minutes and seconds are hanging to all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms and this day was harvey maxwell s busy day the ticker began to reel out jerkily its fitful coils of tape the desk telephone had a chronic attack of buzzing men began to throng into the office and call at him over the railing jovially sharply viciously excitedly messenger boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams the clerks in the office jumped about like sailors during a storm even pitcher s face relaxed into something resembling animation on the exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and glaciers and volcanoes and those elemental disturbances were reproduced in miniature in the broker s offices maxwell shoved his chair against the wall and transacted business after the manner of a toe dancer he jumped from ticker to phone from desk to door with the trained agility of a harlequin in the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became suddenly aware of a high rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding canopy of velvet and ostrich tips an imitation sealskin sacque and a string of beads as large as hickory nuts ending near the floor with a silver heart there was a self possessed young lady connected with these accessories and pitcher was there to construe her lady from the stenographer s agency to see about the position said pitcher maxwell turned half around with his hands full of papers and ticker tape what position he asked with a frown position of stenographer said pitcher you told me yesterday to call them up and have one sent over this morning you are losing your mind pitcher said maxwell why should i have given you any such instructions miss leslie has given perfect satisfaction during the year she has been here the place is hers as long as she chooses to retain it there s no place open here madam countermand that order with the agency pitcher and don t bring any more of em in here the silver heart left the office swinging and banging itself independently against the office furniture as it indignantly departed pitcher seized a moment to remark to the bookkeeper that the old man seemed to get more absent minded and forgetful every day of the world the rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster on the floor they were pounding half a dozen stocks in which maxwell s customers were heavy investors orders to buy and sell were coming and going as swift as the flight of swallows some of his own holdings were imperilled and the man was working like some high geared delicate strong machine strung to full tension going at full speed accurate never hesitating with the proper word and decision and act ready and prompt as clockwork stocks and bonds loans and mortgages margins and securities here was a world of finance and there was no room in it for the human world or the world of nature when the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the uproar maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and memoranda with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging in disorderly strings over his forehead his window was open for the beloved janitress spring had turned on a little warmth through the waking registers of the earth and through the window came a wandering perhaps a lost odour a delicate sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment immovable for this odour belonged to miss leslie it was her own and hers only the odour brought her vividly almost tangibly before him the world of finance dwindled suddenly to a speck and she was in the next room twenty steps away by george i ll do it now said maxwell half aloud i ll ask her now i wonder i didn t do it long ago he dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to cover he charged upon the desk of the stenographer she looked up at him with a smile a soft pink crept over her cheek and her eyes were kind and frank maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk he still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was above his ear miss leslie he began hurriedly i have but a moment to spare i want to say something in that moment will you he my wife i haven t had time to make love to you in the ordinary way but i really do love you talk quick please those fellows are clubbing the stuffing out of union pacific oh what are you talking about exclaimed the young lady she rose to her feet and gazed upon him round eyed don t you understand said maxwell restively i want you to marry me i love you miss leslie i wanted to tell you and i snatched a minute when things had slackened up a bit they re calling me for the phone now tell em to wait a minute pitcher won t you miss leslie the stenographer acted very queerly at first she seemed overcome with amazement then tears flowed from her wondering eyes and then she smiled sunnily through them and one of her arms slid tenderly about the broker s neck i know now she said softly it s this old business that has driven everything else out of your head for the time i was frightened at first don t you remember harvey we were married last evening at o clock in the little church around the corner after twenty years the policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively the impressiveness was habitual and not for show for spectators were few the time was barely o clock at night but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh depeopled the streets trying doors as he went twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare the officer with his stalwart form and slight swagger made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace the vicinity was one that kept early hours now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all night lunch counter but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed when about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk in the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned with an unlighted cigar in his mouth as the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly it s all right officer he said reassuringly i m just waiting for a friend it s an appointment made twenty years ago sounds a little funny to you doesn t it well i ll explain if you d like to make certain it s all straight about that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands big joe brady s restaurant until five years ago said the policeman it was torn down then the man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar the light showed a pale square jawed face with keen eyes and a little white scar near his right eyebrow his scarfpin was a large diamond oddly set twenty years ago to night said the man i dined here at big joe brady s with jimmy wells my best chum and the finest chap in the world he and i were raised here in new york just like two brothers together i was eighteen and jimmy was twenty the next morning i was to start for the west to make my fortune you couldn t have dragged jimmy out of new york he thought it was the only place on earth well we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come we figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made whatever they were going to be it sounds pretty interesting said the policeman rather a long time between meets though it seems to me haven t you heard from your friend since you left well yes for a time we corresponded said the other but after a year or two we lost track of each other you see the west is a pretty big proposition and i kept hustling around over it pretty lively but i know jimmy will meet me here if he s alive for he always was the truest stanchest old chap in the world he ll never forget i came a thousand miles to stand in this door to night and it s worth it if my old partner turns up the waiting man pulled out a handsome watch the lids of it set with small diamonds three minutes to ten he announced it was exactly ten o clock when we parted here at the restaurant door did pretty well out west didn t you asked the policeman you bet i hope jimmy has done half as well he was a kind of plodder though good fellow as he was i ve had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile a man gets in a groove in new york it takes the west to put a razor edge on him the policeman twirled his club and took a step or two i ll be on my way hope your friend comes around all right going to call time on him sharp i should say not said the other i ll give him half an hour at least if jimmy is alive on earth he ll be here by that time so long officer good night sir said the policeman passing on along his beat trying doors as he went there was now a fine cold drizzle falling and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow the few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands and in the door of the hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment uncertain almost to absurdity with the friend of his youth smoked his cigar and waited about twenty minutes he waited and then a tall man in a long overcoat with collar turned up to his ears hurried across from the opposite side of the street he went directly to the waiting man is that you bob he asked doubtfully is that you jimmy wells cried the man in the door bless my heart exclaimed the new arrival grasping both the other s hands with his own it s bob sure as fate i was certain i d find you here if you were still in existence well well well twenty years is a long time the old gone bob i wish it had lasted so we could have had another dinner there how has the west treated you old man bully it has given me everything i asked it for you ve changed lots jimmy i never thought you were so tall by two or three inches oh i grew a bit after i was twenty doing well in new york jimmy moderately i have a position in one of the city departments come on bob we ll go around to a place i know of and have a good long talk about old times the two men started up the street arm in arm the man from the west his egotism enlarged by success was beginning to outline the history of his career the other submerged in his overcoat listened with interest at the corner stood a drug store brilliant with electric lights when they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other s face the man from the west stopped suddenly and released his arm you re not jimmy wells he snapped twenty years is a long time but not long enough to change a man s nose from a roman to a pug it sometimes changes a good man into a bad one said the tall man you ve been under arrest for ten minutes silky bob chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you going quietly are you that s sensible now before we go on to the station here s a note i was asked to hand you you may read it here at the window it s from patrolman wells the man from the west unfolded the little piece of paper handed him his hand was steady when he began to read but it trembled a little by the time he had finished the note was rather short bob i was at the appointed place on time when you struck the match to light your cigar i saw it was the face of the man wanted in chicago somehow i couldn t do it myself so i went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job jimmy lost on dress parade mr towers chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom one iron was heating on a small gas stove the other was being pushed vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be seen later on extending in straight lines from mr chandler s patent leather shoes to the edge of his low cut vest so much of the hero s toilet may be intrusted to our confidence the remainder may be guessed by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient our next view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging house immaculately and correctly clothed calm assured handsome in appearance the typical new york young clubman setting out slightly bored to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening chandler s honorarium was per week he was employed in the office of an architect he was twenty two years old he considered architecture to be truly an art and he honestly believed though he would not have dared to admit it in new york that the flatiron building was inferior to design to the great cathedral in milan out of each week s earnings chandler set aside at the end of each ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated he purchased one gentleman s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old father time he arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents he took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest and there dined with taste and luxury with ten dollars a man may for a few hours play the wealthy idler to perfection the sum is ample for a well considered meal a bottle bearing a respectable label commensurate tips a smoke cab fare and the ordinary etceteras this one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to chandler a source of renascent bliss to the society bud comes but one debut it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened but to chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen as thrilling as new as the first had been to sit among bon vivants under palms in the swirl of concealed music to look upon the habitues of such a paradise and to be looked upon by them what is a girl s first dance and short sleeved tulle compared with this up broadway chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade for this evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer for the next sixty nine evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious table d hotes at whirlwind lunch counters on sandwiches and beer in his hall bedroom he was willing to do that for he was a true son of the great city of razzle dazzle and to him one evening in the limelight made up for many dark ones chandler protracted his walk until the forties began to intersect the great and glittering primrose way for the evening was yet young and when one is of the beau monde only one day in seventy one loves to protract the pleasure eyes bright sinister curious admiring provocative alluring were bent upon him for his garb and air proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure at a certain corner he came to a standstill proposing to himself the question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury just then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner slipped on a patch of icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy the girl hobbled to the wall of the building leaned against it and thanked him demurely i think my ankle is strained she said it twisted when i fell does it pain you much inquired chandler only when i rest my weight upon it i think i will be able to walk in a minute or two if i can be of any further service suggested the young man i will call a cab or thank you said the girl softly but heartily i am sure you need not trouble yourself any further it was so awkward of me and my shoe heels are horridly common sense i can t blame them at all chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest she was pretty in a refined way and her eye was both merry and kind she was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a sort of uniform such as shop girls wear her glossy dark brown hair showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament was a velvet ribbon and bow she could have posed as a model for the self respecting working girl of the best type a sudden idea came into the head of the young architect he would ask this girl to dine with him here was the element that his splendid but solitary periodic feasts had lacked his brief season of elegant luxury would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady s society this girl was a lady he was sure her manner and speech settled that and in spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to sit at table with her these thoughts passed swiftly through his mind and he decided to ask her it was a breach of etiquette of course but oftentimes wage earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind they were generally shrewd judges of men and thought better of their own judgment than they did of useless conventions his ten dollars discreetly expended would enable the two to dine very well indeed the dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull routine of the girl s life and her lively appreciation of it would add to his own triumph and pleasure i think he said to her with frank gravity that your foot needs a longer rest than you suppose now i am going to suggest a way in which you can give it that and at the same time do me a favour i was on my way to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the corner you come with me and we ll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant talk together and by that time your game ankle will carry you home very nicely i am sure the girl looked quickly up into chandler s clear pleasant countenance her eyes twinkled once very brightly and then she smiled ingenuously but we don t know each other it wouldn t be right would it she said doubtfully there is nothing wrong about it said the young man candidly i ll introduce myself permit me mr towers chandler after our dinner which i will try to make as pleasant as possible i will bid you good evening or attend you safely to your door whichever you prefer but dear me said the girl with a glance at chandler s faultless attire in this old dress and hat never mind that said chandler cheerfully i m sure you look more charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner toilette my ankle does hurt yet admitted the girl attempting a limping step i think i will accept your invitation mr chandler you may call me miss marian come then miss marian said the young architect gaily but with perfect courtesy you will not have far to walk there is a very respectable and good restaurant in the next block you will have to lean on my arm so and walk slowly it is lonely dining all by one s self i m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice when the two were established at a well appointed table with a promising waiter hovering in attendance chandler began to experience the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him the restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down broadway which he always preferred but it was nearly so the tables were well filled with prosperous looking diners there was a good orchestra playing softly enough to make conversation a possible pleasure and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism his companion even in her cheap hat and dress held herself with an air that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure and it is certain that she looked at chandler with his animated but self possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes with something not far from admiration in her own charming face then it was that the madness of manhattan the frenzy of fuss and feathers the bacillus of brag the provincial plague of pose seized upon towers chandler he was on broadway surrounded by pomp and style and there were eyes to look at him on the stage of that comedy he had assumed to play the one night part of a butterfly of fashion and an idler of means and taste he was dressed for the part and all his good angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it so he began to prate to miss marian of clubs of teas of golf and riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints of a yacht lying at larchmont he could see that she was vastly impressed by this vague talk so he endorsed his pose by random insinuations concerning great wealth and mentioned familiarly a few names that are handled reverently by the proletariat it was chandler s short little day and he was wringing from it the best that could be had as he saw it and yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and all objects this way of living that you speak of she said sounds so futile and purposeless haven t you any work to do in the world that might interest you more my dear miss marian he exclaimed work think of dressing every day for dinner of making half a dozen calls in an afternoon with a policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to the station if you get up any greater speed than a donkey cart s gait we do nothings are the hardest workers in the land the dinner was concluded the waiter generously fed and the two walked out to the corner where they had met miss marian walked very well now her limp was scarcely noticeable thank you for a nice time she said frankly i must run home now i liked the dinner very much mr chandler he shook hands with her smiling cordially and said something about a game of bridge at his club he watched her for a moment walking rather rapidly eastward and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward in his chilly bedroom chandler laid away his evening clothes for a sixty nine days rest he went about it thoughtfully that was a stunning girl he said to himself she s all right too i d be sworn even if she does have to work perhaps if i d told her the truth instead of all that razzle dazzle we might but confound it i had to play up to my clothes thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the tribe of the manhattans the girl after leaving her entertainer sped swiftly cross town until she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east facing on that avenue which is the highway of mammon and the auxiliary gods here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously out the window oh you madcap exclaimed the elder girl when the other entered when will you quit frightening us this way it is two hours since you ran out in that rag of an old dress and marie s hat mamma has been so alarmed she sent louis in the auto to try to find you you are a bad thoughtless puss the elder girl touched a button and a maid came in a moment marie tell mamma that miss marian has returned don t scold sister i only ran down to mme theo s to tell her to use mauve insertion instead of pink my costume and marie s hat were just what i needed every one thought i was a shopgirl i am sure dinner is over dear you stayed so late i know i slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle i could not walk so i hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until i was better that is why i was so long the two girls sat in the window seat looking out at the lights and the stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue the younger one cuddled down with her head in her sister s lap we will have to marry some day she said dreamily both of us we have so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the public do you want me to tell you the kind of a man i could love sis go on you scatterbrain smiled the other i could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes who is gentle and respectful to poor girls who is handsome and good and does not try to flirt but i could love him only if he had an ambition an object some work to do in the world i would not care how poor he was if i could help him build his way up but sister dear the kind of man we always meet the man who lives an idle life between society and his clubs i could not love a man like that even if his eyes were blue and he were ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street by courier it was neither the season nor the hour when the park had frequenters and it is likely that the young lady who was seated on one of the benches at the side of the walk had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming spring she rested there pensive and still a certain melancholy that touched her countenance must have been of recent birth for it had not yet altered the fine and youthful contours of her cheek nor subdued the arch though resolute curve of her lips a tall young man came striding through the park along the path near which she sat behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit case at sight of the young lady the man s face changed to red and back to pale again he watched her countenance as he drew nearer with hope and anxiety mingled on his own he passed within a few yards of her but he saw no evidence that she was aware of his presence or existence some fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at one side the boy dropped the suit case and stared at him with wondering shrewd eyes the young man took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow it was a good handkerchief a good brow and the young man was good to look at he said to the boy i want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench tell her i am on my way to the station to leave for san francisco where i shall join that alaska moose hunting expedition tell her that since she has commanded me neither to speak nor to write to her i take this means of making one last appeal to her sense of justice for the sake of what has been tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not deserved such treatment without giving him her reasons or a chance to explain is contrary to her nature as i believe it to be tell her that i have thus to a certain degree disobeyed her injunctions in the hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done go and tell her that the young man dropped a half dollar into the boy s hand the boy looked at him for a moment with bright canny eyes out of a dirty intelligent face and then set off at a run he approached the lady on the bench a little doubtfully but unembarrassed he touched the brim of the old plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head the lady looked at him coolly without prejudice or favour lady he said dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance by me if yer don t know de guy and he s tryin to do de johnny act say de word and i ll call a cop in t ree minutes if yer does know him and he s on de square w y i ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he sent yer the young lady betrayed a faint interest a song and dance she said in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony a new idea in the troubadour line i suppose i used to know the gentleman who sent you so i think it will hardly be necessary to call the police you may execute your song and dance but do not sing too loudly it is a little early yet for open air vaudeville and we might attract attention awe said the boy with a shrug down the length of him yer know what i mean lady tain t a turn it s wind he told me to tell yer he s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to frisco den he s goin to shoot snow birds in de klondike he says yer told him not to send round no more pink notes nor come hangin over de garden gate and he takes dis means of puttin yer wise he says yer refereed him out like a has been and never give him no chance to kick at de decision he says yer swiped him and never said why the slightly awakened interest in the young lady s eyes did not abate perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the snow bird hunter in thus circumventing her express commands against the ordinary modes of communication she fixed her eye on a statue standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park and spoke into the transmitter tell the gentleman that i need not repeat to him a description of my ideals he knows what they have been and what they still are so far as they touch on this case absolute loyalty and truth are the ones paramount tell him that i have studied my own heart as well as one can and i know its weakness as well as i do its needs that is why i decline to hear his pleas whatever they may be i did not condemn him through hearsay or doubtful evidence and that is why i made no charge but since he persists in hearing what he already well knows you may convey the matter tell him that i entered the conservatory that evening from the rear to cut a rose for my mother tell him i saw him and miss ashburton beneath the pink oleander the tableau was pretty but the pose and juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation i left the conservatory and at the same time the rose and my ideal you may carry that song and dance to your impresario i m shy on one word lady jux jux put me wise on dat will yer juxtaposition or you may call it propinquity or if you like being rather too

pocket of his coat and drew out a handful of letters selecting one he handed it to the boy following it with a silver dollar from his vest pocket give that letter to the lady he said and ask her to read it tell her that it should explain the situation tell her that if she had mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal much heartache might have been avoided tell her that the loyalty

letter and handed it to the boy de gent wants an answer said the messenger wot s de word the lady s eyes suddenly flashed on him bright smiling and wet tell that guy on the other bench she said with a happy tremulous laugh that his girl wants him the furnished room restless shifting fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of the population of the red brick district of the lower west side homeless they have a hundred homes they flit from furnished room to furnished room transients forever transients in abode transients in heart and mind they sing home sweet home in ragtime they carry their lares et penates in a bandbox their vine is entwined about a picture hat a rubber plant is their fig tree hence the houses of this district having had a thousand dwellers should have a thousand tales to tell mostly dull ones no doubt but it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the wake of all these vagrant guests one evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red mansions ringing their bells at the twelfth he rested his lean hand baggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and forehead the bell sounded faint and far away in some remote hollow depths to the door of this the twelfth house whose bell he had rung came a housekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome surfeited worm that had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy with edible lodgers he asked if there was a room to let come in said the housekeeper her voice came from her throat her throat seemed lined with fur i have the third floor back vacant since a week back should you wish to look at it the young man followed her up the stairs a faint light from no particular source mitigated the shadows of the halls they trod noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn it seemed to have become vegetable to have degenerated in that rank sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to the staircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter at each turn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall perhaps plants had once been set within them if so they had died in that foul and tainted air it may be that statues of the saints had stood there but it was not difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them forth in the darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished pit below this is the room said the housekeeper from her furry throat it s a nice room it ain t often vacant i had some most elegant people in it last summer no trouble at all and paid in advance to the minute the water s at the end of the hall sprowls and mooney kept it three months they done a vaudeville sketch miss b retta sprowls you may have heard of her oh that was just the stage names right there over the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung framed the gas is here and you see there is plenty of closet room it s a room everybody likes it never stays idle long do you have many theatrical people rooming here asked the young man they comes and goes a good proportion of my lodgers is connected with the theatres yes sir this is the theatrical district actor people never stays long anywhere i get my share yes they comes and they goes he engaged the room paying for a week in advance he was tired he said and would take possession at once he counted out the money the room had been made ready she said even to towels and water as the housekeeper moved away he put for the thousandth time the question that he carried at the end of his tongue a young girl miss vashner miss eloise vashner do you remember such a one among your lodgers she would be singing on the stage most likely a fair girl of medium height and slender with reddish gold hair and a dark mole near her left eyebrow no i don t remember the name them stage people has names they change as often as their rooms they comes and they goes no i don t call that one to mind no always no five months of ceaseless interrogation and the inevitable negative so much time spent by day in questioning managers agents schools and choruses by night among the audiences of theatres from all star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find what he most hoped for he who had loved her best had tried to find her he was sure that since her disappearance from home this great water girt city held her somewhere but it was like a monstrous quicksand shifting its particles constantly with no foundation its upper granules of to day buried to morrow in ooze and slime the furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of pseudo hospitality a hectic haggard perfunctory welcome like the specious smile of a demirep the sophistical comfort came in reflected gleams from the decayed furniture the raggcd brocade upholstery of a couch and two chairs a footwide cheap pier glass between the two windows from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a corner the guest reclined inert upon a chair while the room confused in speech as though it were an apartment in babel tried to discourse to him of its divers tenantry a polychromatic rug like some brilliant flowered rectangular tropical islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting upon the gay papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from house to house the huguenot lovers the first quarrel the wedding breakfast psyche at the fountain the mantel s chastely severe outline was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew like the sashes of the amazonian ballet upon it was some desolate flotsam cast aside by the room s marooned when a lucky sail had borne them to a fresh port a trifling vase or two pictures of actresses a medicine bottle some stray cards out of a deck one by one as the characters of a cryptograph become explicit the little signs left by the furnished room s procession of guests developed a significance the threadbare space in the rug in front of the dresser told that lovely woman had marched in the throng tiny finger prints on the wall spoke of little prisoners trying to feel their way to sun and air a splattered stain raying like the shadow of a bursting bomb witnessed where a hurled glass or bottle had splintered with its contents against the wall across the pier glass had been scrawled with a diamond in staggering letters the name marie it seemed that the succession of dwellers in the furnished room had turned in fury perhaps tempted beyond forbearance by its garish coldness and wreaked upon it their passions the furniture was chipped and bruised the couch distorted by bursting springs seemed a horrible monster that had been slain during the stress of some grotesque convulsion some more potent upheaval had cloven a great slice from the marble mantel each plank in the floor owned its particular cant and shriek as from a separate and individual agony it seemed incredible that all this malice and injury had been wrought upon the room by those who had called it for a time their home and yet it may have been the cheated home instinct surviving blindly the resentful rage at false household gods that had kindled their wrath a hut that is our own we can sweep and adorn and cherish the young tenant in the chair allowed these thoughts to file soft shod through his mind while there drifted into the room furnished sounds and furnished scents he heard in one room a tittering and incontinent slack laughter in others the monologue of a scold the rattling of dice a lullaby and one crying dully above him a banjo tinkled with spirit doors banged somewhere the elevated trains roared intermittently a cat yowled miserably upon a back fence and he breathed the breath of the house a dank savour rather than a smell a cold musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork then suddenly as he rested there the room was filled with the strong sweet odour of mignonette it came as upon a single buffet of wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost seemed a living visitant and the man cried aloud what dear as if he had been called and sprang up and faced about the rich odour clung to him and wrapped him around he reached out his arms for it all his senses for the time confused and commingled how could one be peremptorily called by an odour surely it must have been a sound but was it not the sound that had touched that had caressed him she has been in this room he cried and he sprang to wrest from it a token for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had belonged to her or that she had touched this enveloping scent of mignonette the odour that she had loved and made her own whence came it the room had been but carelessly set in order scattered upon the flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins those discreet indistinguishable friends of womankind feminine of gender infinite of mood and uncommunicative of tense these he ignored conscious of their triumphant lack of identity ransacking the drawers of the dresser he came upon a discarded tiny ragged handkerchief he pressed it to his face it was racy and insolent with heliotrope he hurled it to the floor in another drawer he found odd buttons a theatre programme a pawnbroker s card two lost marshmallows a book on the divination of dreams in the last was a woman s black satin hair bow which halted him poised between ice and fire but the black satin hairbow also is femininity s demure impersonal common ornament and tells no tales and then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent skimming the walls considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and knees rummaging mantel and tables the curtains and hangngs the drunken cabinet in the corner for a visible sign unable to perceive that she was there beside around against within above him clinging to him wooing him calling him so poignantly through the finer senses that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call once again he answered loudly yes dear and turned wild eyed to gaze on vacancy for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and outstretched arms in the odour of mnignonette oh god whence that odour and since when have odours had a voice to call thus he groped he burrowed in crevices and corners and found corks and cigarettes these he passed in passive contempt but once he found in a fold of the matting a half smoked cigar and this he ground beneath his heel with a green and trenchant oath he sifted the room from end to end he found dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant but of her whom he

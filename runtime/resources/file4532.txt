s hand and there was born suddenly in the worshipful soul of ikey snigglefritz an audacious thrilling impulse he stepped forward into the little cleared space in which majesty moved and held out his hand billy mcmahan grasped it unhesitatingly shook it and smiled made mad now by the gods who were about to destroy him ikey threw away his scabbard and charged upon olympus have a drink with me billy he said familiarly you and your friends don t mind if i do old man said the great leader just to keep the ball rolling the last spark of ikey s reason fled wine he called to the bartender waving a trembling hand the corks of three bottles were drawn the champagne bubbled in the long row of glasses set upon the bar billy mcmahan took his and nodded with his beaming smile at ikey the lieutenants and satellites took theirs and growled here s to you ikey took his nectar in delirium all drank ikey threw his week s wages in a crumpled roll upon the bar c rect said the bartender smoothing the twelve one dollar notes the crowd surged around billy mcmahan again some one was telling how brannigan fixed em over in the eleventh ikey leaned against the bar a while and then went out he went down hester street and up chrystie and down delancey to where he lived and there his women folk a bibulous mother and three dingy sisters pounced upon him for his wages and at his confession they shrieked and objurgated him in the pithy rhetoric of the locality but even as they plucked at him and struck him ikey remained in his ecstatic trance of joy his head was in the clouds the star was drawing his wagon compared with what he had achieved the loss of wages and the bray of women s tongues were slight affairs he had shaken the hand of billy mcmahan billy mcmahan had a wife and upon her visiting cards was engraved the name mrs william darragh mcmahan and there was a certain vexation attendant upon these cards for small as they were there were houses in which they could not be inserted billy mcmahan was a dictator in politics a four walled tower in business a mogul dreaded loved and obeyed among his own people he was growing rich the daily papers had a dozen men on his trail to chronicle his every word of wisdom he had been honored in caricature holding the tiger cringing in leash but the heart of billy was sometimes sore within him there was a race of men from which he stood apart but that he viewed with the eye of moses looking over into the promised land he too had ideals even as had ikey snigglefritz and sometimes hopeless of attaining them his own solid success was as dust and ashes in his mouth and mrs william darragh mcmahan wore a look of discontent upon her plump but pretty face and the very rustle of her silks seemed a sigh there was a brave and conspicuous assemblage in the dining saloon of a noted hostelry where fashion loves to display her charms at one table sat billy mcmahan and his wife mostly silent they were but the accessories they enjoyed little needed the indorsement of speech mrs mcmahan s diamonds were outshone by few in the room the waiter bore the costliest brands of wine to their table in evening dress with an expression of gloom upon his smooth and massive countenance you would look in vain for a more striking figure than billy s four tables away sat alone a tall slender man about thirty with thoughtful melancholy eyes a van dyke beard and peculiarly white thin hands he was dining on filet mignon dry toast and apollinaris that man was cortlandt van duyckink a man worth eighty millions who inherited and held a sacred seat in the exclusive inner circle of society billy mcmahan spoke to no one around him because he knew no one van duyckink kept his eyes on his plate because he knew that every one present was hungry to catch his he could bestow knighthood and prestige by a nod and he was chary of creating a too extensive nobility and then billy mcmahan conceived and accomplished the most startling and audacious act of his life he rose deliberately and walked over to cortlandt van duyckink s table and held out his hand say mr van duyckink he said i ve heard you was talking about starting some reforms among the poor people down in my district i m mcmahan you know say now if that s straight i ll do all i can to help you and what i says goes in that neck of the woods don t it oh say i rather guess it does van duyckink s rather sombre eyes lighted up he rose to his lank height and grasped billy mcmahan s hand thank you mr mcmahan he said in his deep serious tones i have been thinking of doing some work of that sort i shall be glad of your assistance it pleases me to have become acquainted with you billy walked back to his seat his shoulder was tingling from the accolade bestowed by royalty a hundred eyes were now turned upon him in envy and new admiration mrs william darragh mcmahan trembled with ecstasy so that her diamonds smote the eye almost with pain and now it was apparent that at many tables there were those who suddenly remembered that they enjoyed mr mcmahan s acquaintance he saw smiles and bows about him he became enveloped in the aura of dizzy greatness his campaign coolness deserted him wine for that gang he commanded the waiter pointing with his finger wine over there wine to those three gents by that green bush tell em it s on me d n it wine for everybody the waiter ventured to whisper that it was perhaps inexpedient to carry out the order in consideration of the dignity of the house and its custom all right said billy if it s against the rules i wonder if twould do to send my friend van duyckink a bottle no well it ll flow all right at the caffy to night just the same it ll be rubber boots for anybody who comes in there any time up to a m billy mcmahan was happy he had shaken the hand of cortlandt van duyckink the big pale gray auto with its shining metal work looked out of place moving slowly among the push carts and trash heaps on the lower east side so did cortlandt van duyckink with his aristocratic face and white thin hands as he steered carefully between the groups of ragged scurrying youngsters in the streets and so did miss constance schuyler with her dim ascetic beauty seated at his side oh cortlandt she breathed isn t it sad that human beings have to live in such wretchedness and poverty and you how noble it is of you to think of them to give your time and money to improve their condition van duyckink turned his solemn eyes upon her it is little he said sadly that i can do the question is a large one and belongs to society but even individual effort is not thrown away look constance on this street i have arranged to build soup kitchens where no one who is hungry will be turned away and down this other street are the old buildings that i shall cause to be torn down and there erect others in place of those death traps of fire and disease down delancey slowly crept the pale gray auto away from it toddled coveys of wondering tangle haired barefooted unwashed children it stopped before a crazy brick structure foul and awry van duyckink alighted to examine at a better perspective one of the leaning walls down the steps of the building came a young man who seemed to epitomize its degradation squalor and infelicity a narrow chested pale unsavory young man puffing at a cigarette obeying a sudden impulse van duyckink stepped out and warmly grasped the hand of what seemed to him a living rebuke i want to know you people he said sincerely i am going to help you as much as i can we shall be friends as the auto crept carefully away cortlandt van duyckink felt an unaccustomed glow about his heart he was near to being a happy man he had shaken the hand of ikey snigglefritz the purple dress we are to consider the shade known as purple it is a color justly in repute among the sons and daughters of man emperors claim it for their especial dye good fellows everywhere seek to bring their noses to the genial hue that follows the commingling of the red and blue we say of princes that they are born to the purple and no doubt they are for the colic tinges their faces with the royal tint equally with the snub nosed countenance of a woodchopper s brat all women love it when it is the fashion and now purple is being worn you notice it on the streets of course other colors are quite stylish as well in fact i saw a lovely thing the other day in olive green albatross with a triple lapped flounce skirt trimmed with insert squares of silk and a draped fichu of lace opening over a shirred vest and double puff sleeves with a lace band holding two gathered frills but you see lots of purple too oh yes you do just take a walk down twenty third street any afternoon therefore maida the girl with the big brown eyes and cinnamon colored hair in the bee hive store said to grace the girl with the rhinestone brooch and peppermint pepsin flavor to her speech i m going to have a purple dress a tailor made purple dress for thanksgiving oh are you said grace putting away some gloves into the box well it s me for red you see more red on fifth avenue and the men all seem to like it i like purple best said maida and old schlegel has promised to make it for it s going to be lovely i m going to have a plaited skirt and a blouse coat trimmed with a band of galloon under a white cloth collar with two rows of sly boots said grace with an educated wink soutache braid over a surpliced white vest and a plaited basque and sly boots sly boots repeated grace plaited gigot sleeves with a drawn velvet ribbon over an inside cuff what do you mean by saying that you think mr ramsay likes purple i heard him say yesterday he thought some of the dark shades of red were stunning i don t care said maida i prefer purple and them that don t like it can just take the other side of the street which suggests the thought that after all the followers of purple may be subject to slight delusions danger is near when a maiden thinks she can wear purple regardless of complexions and opinions and when emperors think their purple robes will wear forever maida had saved after eight months of economy and this had bought the goods for the purple dress and paid schlegel on the making of it on the day before thanksgiving she would have just enough to pay the remaining and then for a holiday in a new dress can earth offer anything more enchanting old bachman the proprietor of the bee hive store always gave a thanksgiving dinner to his employees on every one of the subsequent days excusing sundays he would remind them of the joys of the past banquet and the hopes of the coming ones thus inciting them to increased enthusiasm in work the dinner was given in the store on one of the long tables in the middle of the room they tacked wrapping paper over the front windows and the turkeys and other good things were brought in the back way from the restaurant on the corner you will perceive that the bee hive was not a fashionable department store with escalators and pompadours it was almost small enough to be called an emporium and you could actually go in there and get waited on and walk out again and always at the thanksgiving dinners mr ramsay oh bother i should have mentioned mr ramsay first of all he is more important than purple or green or even the red cranberry sauce mr ramsay was the head clerk and as far as i am concerned i am for him he never pinched the girls arms when he passed them in dark corners of the store and when he told them stories when business was dull and the girls giggled and said oh pshaw it wasn t g bernard they meant at all besides being a gentleman mr ramsay was queer and original in other ways he was a health crank and believed that people should never eat anything that was good for them he was violently opposed to anybody being comfortable and coming in out of snow storms or wearing overshoes or taking medicine or coddling themselves in any way every one of the ten girls in the store had little pork chop and fried onion dreams every night of becoming mrs ramsay for next year old bachman was going to take him in for a partner and each one of them knew that if she should catch him she would knock those cranky health notions of his sky high before the wedding cake indigestion was over mr ramsay was master of ceremonies at the dinners always they had two italians in to play a violin and harp and had a little dance in the store and here were two dresses being conceived to charm ramsay one purple and the other red of course the other eight girls were going to have dresses too but they didn t count very likely they d wear some shirt waist and black skirt affairs nothing as resplendent as purple or red grace had saved her money too she was going to buy her dress ready made oh what s the use of bothering with a tailor when you ve got a figger it s easy to get a fit the ready made are intended for a perfect figger except i have to have em all taken in at the waist the average figger is so large waisted the night before thanksgiving came maida hurried home keen and bright with the thoughts of the blessed morrow her thoughts were of purple but they were white themselves the joyous enthusiasm of the young for the pleasures that youth must have or wither she knew purple would become her and for the thousandth time she tried to assure herself that it was purple mr ramsay said he liked and not red she was going home first to get the wrapped in a piece of tissue paper in the bottom drawer of her dresser and then she was going to pay schlegel and take the dress home herself grace lived in the same house she occupied the hall room above maida s at home maida found clamor and confusion the landlady s tongue clattering sourly in the halls like a churn dasher dabbing in buttermilk and then grace come down to her room crying with eyes as red as any dress she says i ve got to get out said grace the old beast because i owe her she s put my trunk in the hall and locked the door i can t go anywhere else i haven t got a cent of money you had some yesterday said maida i paid it on my dress said grace i thought she d wait till next week for the rent sniffle sniffle sob sniffle out came out it had to come maida s you blessed darling cried grace now a rainbow instead of sunset i ll pay the mean old thing and then i m going to try on my dress i think it s heavenly come up and look at it i ll pay the money back a dollar a week honest i will thanksgiving the dinner was to be at noon at a quarter to twelve grace switched into maida s room yes she looked charming red was her color maida sat by the window in her old cheviot skirt and blue waist darning a st oh doing fancy work why goodness me ain t you dressed yet shrilled the red one how does it fit in the back don t you think these velvet tabs look awful swell why ain t you dressed maida my dress didn t get finished in time said maida i m not going to the dinner that s too bad why i m awfully sorry maida why don t you put on anything and come along it s just the store folks you know and they won t mind i was set on my purple said maida if i can t have it i won t go at all don t bother about me run along or you ll be late you look awful nice in red at her window maida sat through the long morning and past the time of the dinner at the store in her mind she could hear the girls shrieking over a pull bone could hear old bachman s roar over his own deeply concealed jokes could see the diamonds of fat mrs bachman who came to the store only on thanksgiving days could see mr ramsay moving about alert kindly looking to the comfort of all at four in the afternoon with an expressionless face and a lifeless air she slowly made her way to schlegel s shop and told him she could not pay the due on the dress gott cried schlegel angrily for what do you look so glum take him away he is ready pay me some time haf i not seen you pass mine shop every day in two years if i make clothes is it that i do not know how to read beoples because you will pay me some time when you can take him away he is made goot and if you look bretty in him all right so pay me when you can maida breathed a millionth part of the thanks in her heart and hurried away with her dress as she left the shop a smart dash of rain struck upon her face she smiled and did not feel it ladies who shop in carriages you do not understand girls whose wardrobes are charged to the old man s account you cannot begin to comprehend you could not understand why maida did not feel the cold dash of the thanksgiving rain at five o clock she went out upon the street wearing her purple dress the rain had increased and it beat down upon her in a steady wind blown pour people were scurrying home and to cars with close held umbrellas and tight buttoned raincoats many of them turned their heads to marvel at this beautiful serene happy eyed girl in the purple dress walking through the storm as though she were strolling in a garden under summer skies i say you do not understand it ladies of the full purse and varied wardrobe you do not know what it is to live with a perpetual longing for pretty things to starve eight months in order to bring a purple dress and a holiday together what difference if it rained hailed blew snowed cycloned maida had no umbrella nor overshoes she had her purple dress and she walked abroad let the elements do their worst a starved heart must have one crumb during a year the rain ran down and dripped from her fingers some one turned a corner and blocked her way she looked up into mr ramsay s eyes sparkling with admiration and interest why miss maida said he you look simply magnificent in your new dress i was greatly disappointed not to see you at our dinner and of all the girls i ever knew you show the greatest sense and intelligence there is nothing more healthful and invigorating than braving the weather as you are doing may i walk with you and maida blushed and sneezed the foreign policy of company john byrnes hose cart driver of engine company no was afflicted with what his comrades called japanits byrnes had a war map spread permanently upon a table in the second story of the engine house and he could explain to you at any hour of the day or night the exact positions conditions and intentions of both the russian and japanese armies he had little clusters of pins stuck in the map which represented the opposing forces and these be moved about from day to day in conformity with the war news in the daily papers wherever the japs won a victory john byrnes would shift his pins and then he would execute a war dance of delight and the other firemen would hear him yell go it you blamed little sawed off huckleberry eyed monkey faced hot tamales eat em up you little sleight o hand bow legged bull terriers give em another of them yalu looloos and you ll eat rice in st petersburg talk about your russians say wouldn t they give you a painsky when it comes to a scrapovitch not even on the fair island of nippon was there a more enthusiastic champion of the mikado s men supporters of the russian cause did well to keep clear of engine house no sometimes all thoughts of the japs left john byrnes s head that was when the alarm of fire had sounded and he was strapped in his driver s seat on the swaying cart guilding erebus and joe the finest team in the whole department according to the crew of of all the codes adopted by man for regulating his actions toward his fellow mortals the greatest are these the code of king arthur s knights of the round table the constitution of the united states and the unwritten rules of the new york fire department the round table methods are no longer practicable since the invention of street cars and breach of promise suits and our constitution is being found more and more unconstitutional every day so the code of our firemen must be considered in the lead with the golden rule and jeffries s new punch trying for place and show the constitution says that one man is as good as another but the fire department says he is better this is a too generous theory but the law will not tallow itself to be construed otherwise all of which comes perilously near to being a paradox and commends itself to the attention of the s p c a one of the transatlantic liners dumped out at ellis island a lump of protozoa which was expected to evolve into an american citizen a steward kicked him down the gangway a doctor pounced upon his eyes like a raven seeking for trachoma or ophthalmia he was hustled ashore and ejected into the city in the name of liberty perhaps theoretically thus inoculating against kingocracy with a drop of its own virus this hypodermic injection of europeanism wandered happily into the veins of the city with the broad grin of a pleased child it was not burdened with baggage cares or ambitions its body was lithely built and clothed in a sort of foreign fustian its face was brightly vacant with a small flat nose and was mostly covered by a thick ragged curling beard like the coat of a spaniel in the pocket of the imported thing were a few coins denarii sendi kopecks pfennigs pilasters whatever the financial nomenclature of his unknown country nay have been prattling to himself always broadly grinning pleased by the roar and movement of the barbarous city into which the steamship cut rates had shunted him the alien strayed away from the sea which he hated as far as the district covered by engine company no light as a cork he was kept bobbing along by the human tide the cruelest atom in all the silt of the stream that emptied into the reservoir of liberty while crossing third avenue he slowed his steps enchanted by the thunder of the elevated trains above him and the soothing crash of the wheels on the cobbles and then there was a new delightful chord in the uproar the musical clanging of a gong and a great shining juggernaut belching fire and smoke that people were hurrying to see this beautiful thing entrancing to the eye dashed past and the protoplasmic immigrant stepped into the wake of it with his broad enraptured uncomprehending grin and so stepping stepped into the path of no s flying hose cart with john byrnes gripping with arms of steel the reins over the plunging backs of erebus and joe the unwritten constitutional code of the fireman has no exceptions or amendments it is a simple thing as simple as the rule of three there was the heedless unit in the right of way there was the hose cart and the iron pillar of the elevated railroad john byrnes swung all his weight and muscle on the left rein the team and cart swerved that way and crashed like a torpedo into the pillar the men on the cart went flying like skittles the driver s strap burst the pillar rang with the shock and john byrnes fell on the car track with a broken shoulder twenty feet away while erebus beautiful raven black best loved erebus lay whickering in his harness with a broken leg in consideration for the feelings of engine company no the details will be lightly touched the company does not like to be reminded of that day there was a great crowd and hurry calls were sent in and while the ambulance gong was clearing the way the men of no heard the crack of the s p c a agent s pistol and turned their heads away not daring to look toward erebus again when the firemen got back to the engine house they found that one of them was dragging by the collar the cause of their desolation and grief they set it in the middle of the floor and gathered grimly about it through its whiskers the calamitous object chattered effervescently and waved its hands sounds like a seidlitz powder said mike dowling disgustedly and it makes me sicker than one call that a man that hoss was worth a steamer full of such two legged animals it s a immigrant that s what it is look at the doctor s chalk mark on its coat said reilly the desk man it s just landed it must be a kind of a dago or a hun or one of them finns i guess that s the kind of truck that europe unloads onto us think of a thing like that getting in the way and laying john up in hospital and spoiling the best fire team in the city groaned another fireman it ought to be taken down to the dock and drowned somebody go around and get sloviski suggested the engine driver and let s see what nation is responsible for this conglomeration of hair and head noises sloviski kept a delicatessen store around the corner on third avenue and was reputed to be a linguist one of the men fetched him a fat cringing man with a discursive eye and the odors of many kinds of meats upon him take a whirl at this importation with your jaw breakers sloviski requested mike dowling we can t quite figure out whether he s from the hackensack bottoms or hongkong on the ganges sloviski addressed the stranger in several dialects that ranged in rhythm and cadence from the sounds produced by a tonsilitis gargle to the opening of a can of tomatoes with a pair of scissors the immigrant replied in accents resembling the uncorking of a bottle of ginger ale i have you his name reported sloviski you shall not pronounce it writing of it in paper is better they gave him paper and he wrote demetre svangvsk looks like short hand said the desk man he speaks some language continued the interpreter wiping his forehead of austria and mixed with a little turkish and den he have some magyar words and a polish or two and many like the roumanian but not without talk of one tribe in bessarabia i do not him quite understand would you call him a dago or a polocker or what asked mike frowning at the polyglot description he is a answered sloviski he is a i dink he come from i dink he is a fool he concluded impatient at his linguistic failure and if you pleases i will go back at mine delicatessen whatever he is he s a bird said mike dowling and you want to watch him fly taking by the wing the alien fowl that had fluttered into the nest of liberty mike led him to the door of the engine house and bestowed upon him a kick hearty enough to convey the entire animus of company demetre svangvsk hustled away down the sidewalk turning once to show his ineradicable grin to the aggrieved firemen in three weeks john byrnes was back at his post from the hospital with great gusto he proceeded to bring his war map up to date my money on the japs every time he declared why look at them russians they re nothing but wolves wipe em out i say and the little old jiu jitsu gang are just the cherry blossoms to do the trick and don t you forget it the second day after byrnes s reappearance came demetre svangvsk the unidentified to the engine house with a broader grin than ever he managed to convey the idea that he wished to congratulate the hose cart driver on his recovery and to apologize for having caused the accident this he accomplished by so many extravagant gestures and explosive noises that the company was diverted for half an hour then they kicked him out again and on the next day he came back grinning how or where he lived no one knew and then john byrnes s nine year old son chris who brought him convalescent delicacies from home to eat took a fancy to svangvsk and they allowed him to loaf about the door of the engine house occasionally one afternoon the big drab automobile of the deputy fire commissioner buzzed up to the door of no and the deputy stepped inside for an informal inspection the men kicked svangvsk out a little harder than usual and proudly escorted the deputy around in which everything shone like my lady s mirror the deputy respected the sorrow of the company concerning the loss of erebus and he had come to promise it another mate for joe that would do him credit so they let joe out of his stall and showed the deputy how deserving he was of the finest mate that could be in horsedom while they were circling around joe confabbing chris climbed into the deputy s auto and threw the power full on the men heard a monster puffing and a shriek from the lad and sprang out too late the big auto shot away luckily taking a straight course down the street the boy knew nothing of its machinery he sat clutching the cushions and howling with the power on nothing could have stopped that auto except a brick house and there was nothing for chris to gain by such a stoppage demetre svangvsk was just coming in again with a grin for another kick when chris played his merry little prank while the others sprang for the door demetre sprang for joe he glided upon the horse s bare back like a snake and shouted something at him like the crack of a dozen whips one of the firemen afterward swore that joe answered him back in the same language ten seconds after the auto started the big horse was eating up the asphalt behind it like a strip of macaroni some people two blocks and a half away saw the rescue they said that the auto was nothing but a drab noise with a black speck in the middle of it for chris when a big bay horse with a lizard lying on its back cantered up alongside of it and the lizard reached over and picked the black speck out of the noise only fifteen minutes after svangvsk s last kicking at the hands or rather the feet of engine company no he rode joe back through the door with the boy safe but acutely conscious of the licking he was going to receive svangvsk slipped to the floor leaned his head against joe s and made a noise like a clucking hen joe nodded and whistled loudly through his nostrils putting to shame the knowledge of sloviski of the delicatessen john byrnes walked up to svangvsk who grinned expecting to be kicked byrnes gripped the outlander so strongly by the hand that demetre grinned anyhow conceiving it to be a new form of punishment the heathen rides like a cossack remarked a fireman who had seen a wild west show they re the greatest riders in the world the word seemed to electrify svangvsk he grinned wider than ever yas yas me cossack he spluttered striking his chest cossack repeated john byrnes thoughtfully ain t that a kind of a russian they re one of the russian tribes sure said the desk man who read books between fire alarms just then alderman foley who was on his way home and did not know of the runaway stopped at the door of the engine house and called to byrnes hello there jimmy me boy how s the war coming along japs still got the bear on the trot have they oh i don t know said john byrnes argumentatively them japs haven t got any walkover you wait till kuropatkin gets a good whack at em and they won t be knee high to a puddle ducksky the lost blend since the bar has been blessed by the clergy and cocktails open the dinners of the elect one may speak of the saloon teetotalers need not listen if they choose there is always the slot restaurant where a dime dropped into the cold bouillon aperture will bring forth a dry martini con lantry worked on the sober side of the bar in kenealy s cafe you and i stood one legged like geese on the other side and went into voluntary liquidation with our week s wages opposite danced con clean temperate clear headed polite white jacketed punctual trustworthy young responsible and took our money the saloon whether blessed or cursed stood in one of those little places which are parallelograms instead of streets and inhabited by laundries decayed knickerbocker families and bohemians who have nothing to do with either over the cafe lived kenealy and his family his daughter katherine had eyes of dark irish but why should you be told be content with your geraldine or your eliza ann for con dreamed of her and when she called softly at the foot of the back stairs for the pitcher of beer for dinner his heart went up and down like a milk punch in the shaker orderly and fit are the rules of romance and if you hurl the last shilling of your fortune upon the bar for whiskey the bartender shall take it and marry his boss s daughter and good will grow out of it but not so con for in the presence of woman he was tongue tied and scarlet he who would quell with his eye the sonorous youth whom the claret punch made loquacious or smash with lemon squeezer the obstreperous or hurl gutterward the cantankerous without a wrinkle coming to his white lawn tie when he stood before woman he was voiceless incoherent stuttering buried beneath a hot avalanche of bashfulness and misery what then was he before katherine a trembler with no word to say for himself a stone without blarney the dumbest lover that ever babbled of the weather in the presence of his divinity there came to kenealy s two sunburned men riley and mcquirk they had conference with kenealy and then they took possession of a back room which they filled with bottles and siphons and jugs and druggist s measuring glasses all the appurtenances and liquids of a saloon were there but they dispensed no drinks all day long the two sweltered in there pouring and mixing unknown brews and decoctions from the liquors in their store riley had the education and he figured on reams of paper reducing gallons to ounces and quarts to fluid drams mcquirk a morose man with a red eye dashed each unsuccessful completed mixture into the waste pipes with curses gentle husky and deep they labored heavily and untiringly to achieve some mysterious solution like two alchemists striving to resolve gold from the elements into this back room one evening when his watch was done sauntered con his professional curiosity had been stirred by these occult bartenders at whose bar none drank and who daily drew upon kenealy s store of liquors to follow their consuming and fruitless experiments down the back stairs came katherine with her smile like sunrise on gweebarra bay good evening mr lantry says she and what is the news to day if you please it looks like r rain stammered the shy one backing to the wall it couldn t do better said katherine i m thinking there s nothing the worse off for a little water in the back room riley and mcquirk toiled like bearded witches over their strange compounds from fifty bottles they drew liquids carefully measured after riley s figures and shook the whole together in a great glass vessel then mcquirk would dash it out with gloomy profanity and they would begin again sit down said riley to con and i ll tell you last summer me and tim concludes that an american bar in this nation of nicaragua would pay there was a town on the coast where there s nothing to eat but quinine and nothing to drink but rum the natives and foreigners lay down with chills and get up with fevers and a good mixed drink is nature s remedy for all such tropical inconveniences so we lays in a fine stock of wet goods in new york and bar fixtures and glassware and we sails for that santa palma town on a lime steamer on the way me and tim sees flying fish and plays seven up with the captain and steward and already begins to feel like the high ball kings of the tropics of capricorn when we gets in five hours of the country that we was going to introduce to long drinks and short change the captain calls us over to the starboard binnacle and recollects a few things i forgot to tell you boys says he that nicaragua slapped an import duty of per cent ad valorem on all bottled goods last month the president took a bottle of cincinnati hair tonic by mistake for tobasco sauce and he s getting even barrelled goods is free sorry you didn t mention it sooner says we and we bought two forty two gallon casks from the captain and opened every bottle we had and dumped the stuff all together in the casks that per cent would have ruined us so we took the chances on making that cocktail rather than throw the stud away well when we landed we tapped one of the barrels the mixture was something heartrending it was the color of a plate of bowery pea soup and it tasted like one of those coffee substitutes your aunt makes you take for the heart trouble you get by picking losers we gave a nigger four fingers of it to try it and he lay under a cocoanut tree three days beating the sand with his heels and refused to sign a testimonial but the other barrel say bartender did you ever put on a straw hat with a yellow band around it and go up in a balloon with a pretty girl with in your pocket all at the same time that s what thirty drops of it would make you feel like with two fingers of it inside you you would bury your face in your hands and cry because there wasn t anything more worth while around for you to lick than little jim jeffries yes sir the stuff in that second barrel was distilled elixir of battle money and high life it was the color of gold and as clear as glass and it shone after dark like the sunshine was still in it a thousand years from now you ll get a drink like that across the bar well we started up business with that one line of drinks and it was enough the piebald gentry of that country stuck to it like a hive of bees if that barrel had lasted that country would have become the greatest on earth when we opened up of mornings we had a line of generals and colonels and ex presidents and revolutionists a block long waiting to be served we started in at cents silver a drink the last ten gallons went easy at a gulp it was wonderful stuff it gave a man courage and ambition and nerve to do anything at the same time he didn t care whether his money was tainted or fresh from the ice trust when that barrel was half gone nicaragua had repudiated the national debt removed the duty on cigarettes and was about to declare war on the united states and england twas by accident we discovered this king of drinks and twill be by good luck if we strike it again for ten months we ve been trying small lots at a time we ve mixed barrels of all the harmful ingredients known to the profession of drinking ye could have stocked ten bars with the whiskies brandies cordials bitters gins and wines me and tim have wasted a glorious drink like that to be denied to the world tis a sorrow and a loss of money the united states as a nation would welcome a drink of that sort and pay for it all the while mcquirk lead been carefully measuring and pouring together small quantities of various spirits as riley called them from his latest pencilled prescription the completed mixture was of a vile mottled chocolate color mcquirk tasted it and hurled it with appropriate epithets into the waste sink tis a strange story even if true said con i ll be going now along to my supper take a drink said riley we ve all kinds except the lost blend i never drink said con anything stronger than water i am just after meeting miss katherine by the stairs she said a true word there s not anything says she but is better off for a little water when con had left them riley almost felled mcquirk by a blow on the back did ye hear that he shouted two fools are we the six dozen bottles of pollinaris we had on the slip ye opened them yourself which barrel did ye pour them in which barrel ye mudhead i mind said mcquirk slowly twas in the second barrel we opened i mind the blue piece of paper pasted on the side of it we ve got it now cried riley twas that we lacked tis the water that does the trick everything else we had right hurry man and get two bottles of pollinaris from the bar while i figure out the proportionments with me pencil an hour later con strolled down the sidewalk toward kenealy s cafe thus faithful employees haunt during their recreation hours the vicinity where they labor drawn by some mysterious attraction a police patrol wagon stood at the side door three able cops were half carrying half hustling riley and mcquirk up its rear steps the eyes and faces of each bore the bruises and cuts of sanguinary and assiduous conflict yet they whooped with strange joy and directed upon the police the feeble remnants of their pugnacious madness began fighting each other in the back room explained kenealy to con and singing that was worse smashed everything pretty much up but they re good men they ll pay for everything trying to invent some new kind of cocktail they was i ll see they come out all right in the morning con sauntered into the back room to view the battlefield as he went through the hall katherine was just coming down the stairs good evening again mr lantry said she and is there no news from the weather yet still threatens r rain said con slipping past with red in his smooth pale cheek riley and mcquirk had indeed waged a great and friendly battle broken bottles and glasses were everywhere the room was full of alcohol fumes the floor was variegated with spirituous puddles on the table stood a ounce glass graduated measure in the bottom of it were two tablespoonfuls of liquid a bright golden liquid that seemed to hold the sunshine a prisoner in its auriferous depths con smelled it he tasted it he drank it as he returned through the hall katherine was just going up the stairs no news yet mr lantry she asked with her teasing laugh con lifted her clear from the floor and held her there the news is he said that we re to be married put me down sir she cried indignantly or i will oh con where oh wherever did you get the nerve to say it a harlem tragedy harlem mrs fink had dropped into mrs cassidy s flat one flight below ain t it a beaut said mrs cassidy she turned her face proudly for her friend mrs fink to see one eye was nearly closed with a great greenish purple bruise around it her lip was cut and bleeding a little and there were red finger marks on each side of her neck my husband wouldn t ever think of doing that to me said mrs fink concealing her envy i wouldn t have a man declared mrs cassidy that didn t beat me up at least once a week shows he thinks something of you say but that last dose jack gave me wasn t no homeopathic one i can see stars yet but he ll be the sweetest man in town for the rest of the week to make up for it this eye is good for theater tickets and a silk shirt waist at the very least i should hope said mrs fink assuming complacency that mr fink is too much of a gentleman ever to raise his hand against me oh go on maggie said mrs cassidy laughing and applying witch hazel you re only jealous your old man is too frapped and slow to ever give you a punch he just sits down and practises physical culture with a newspaper when he comes home now ain t that the truth mr fink certainly peruses of the papers when he comes home acknowledged mrs fink with a toss of her head but he certainly don t ever make no steve o donnell out of me just to amuse himself that s a sure thing mrs cassidy laughed the contented laugh of the guarded and happy matron with the air of cornelia exhibiting her jewels she drew down the collar of her kimono and revealed another treasured bruise maroon colored edged with olive and orange a bruise now nearly well but still to memory dear mrs fink capitulated the formal light in her eye softened to envious admiration she and mrs cassidy had been chums in the downtown paper box factory before they had married one year before now she and her man occupied the flat above mame and her man therefore she could not put on airs with mame don t it hurt when he soaks you asked mrs fink curiously hurt mrs cassidy gave a soprano scream of delight well say did you ever have a brick house fall on you well that s just the way it feels just like when they re digging you out of the ruins jack s got a left that spells two matinees and a new pair of oxfords and his right well it takes a trip to coney and six pairs of openwork silk lisle threads to make that good but what does he beat you for inquired mrs fink with wide open eyes silly said mrs cassidy indulgently why because he s full it s generally on saturday nights but what cause do you give him persisted the seeker after knowledge why didn t i marry him jack comes in tanked up and i m here ain t i who else has he got a right to beat i d just like to catch him once beating anybody else sometimes it s because supper ain t ready and sometimes it s because it is jack ain t particular about causes he just lushes till he remembers he s married and then he makes for home and does me up saturday nights i just move the furniture with sharp corners out of the way so i won t cut my head when he gets his work in he s got a left swing that jars you sometimes i take the count in the first round but when i feel like having a good time during the week or want some new rags i come up again for more punishment that s what i done last night jack knows i ve been wanting a black silk waist for a month and i didn t think just one black eye would bring it tell you what mag i ll bet you the ice cream he brings it to night mrs fink was thinking deeply my mart she said never hit me a lick in his life it s just like you said mame he comes in grouchy and ain t got a word to say he never takes me out anywhere he s a chair warmer at home for fair he buys me things but he looks so glum about it that i never appreciate em mrs cassidy slipped an arm around her chum you poor thing she said but everybody can t have a husband like jack marriage wouldn t be no failure if they was all like him these discontented wives you hear about what they need is a man to come home and kick their slats in once a week and then make it up in kisses and chocolate creams that d give em some interest in life what i want is a masterful man that slugs you when he s jagged and hugs you when he ain t jagged preserve me from the man that ain t got the sand to do neither mrs fink sighed the hallways were suddenly filled with sound the door flew open at the kick of mr cassidy his arms were occupied with bundles mame flew and hung about his neck her sound eye sparkled with the love light that shines in the eye of the maori maid when she recovers consciousness in the hut of the wooer who has stunned and dragged her there hello old girl shouted mr cassidy he shed his bundles and lifted her off her feet in a mighty hug i got tickets for barnum bailey s and if you ll bust the string of one of them bundles i guess you ll find that silk waist why good evening mrs fink i didn t see you at first how s old mart coming along he s very well mr cassidy thanks said mrs fink i must be going along up now mart ll be home for supper soon i ll bring you down that pattern you wanted to morrow mame mrs fink went up to her flat and had a little cry it was a meaningless cry the kind of cry that only a woman knows about a cry from no particular cause altogether an absurd cry the most transient and the most hopeless cry in the repertory of grief why had martin never thrashed her he was as big and strong as jack cassidy did he not care for her at all he never quarrelled he came home and lounged about silent glum idle he was a fairly good provider but he ignored the spices of life mrs fink s ship of dreams was becalmed her captain ranged between plum duff and his hammock if only he would shiver his timbers or stamp his foot on the quarter deck now and then and she had thought to sail so merrily touching at ports in the delectable isles but now to vary the figure she was ready to throw up the sponge tired out without a scratch to show for all those tame rounds with her sparring partner for one moment she almost hated mame mame with her cuts and bruises her salve of presents and kisses her stormy voyage with her fighting brutal loving mate mr fink came home at he was permeated with the curse of domesticity beyond the portals of his cozy home he cared not to roam to roam he was the man who had caught the street car the anaconda that had swallowed its prey the tree that lay as it had fallen like the supper mart asked mrs fink who had striven over it m m m yep grunted mr fink after supper he gathered his newspapers to read he sat in his stocking feet arise some new dante and sing me the befitting corner of perdition for the man who sitteth in the house in his stockinged feet sisters of patience who by reason of ties or duty have endured it in silk yarn cotton lisle thread or woollen does not the new canto belong the next day was labor day the occupations of mr cassidy and mr fink ceased for one passage of the sun labor triumphant would parade and otherwise disport itself mrs fink took mrs cassidy s pattern down early maine had on her new silk waist even her damaged eye managed to emit a holiday gleam jack was fruitfully penitent and there was a hilarious scheme for the day afoot with parks and picnics and pilsener in it a rising indignant jealousy seized mrs fink as she returned to her flat above oh happy mame with her bruises and her quick following balm but was mame to have a monopoly of happiness surely martin fink was as good a man as jack cassidy was his wife to go always unbelabored and uncaressed a sudden brilliant breathless idea came to mrs fink she would show mame that there were husbands as able to use their fists and perhaps to be as tender afterward as any jack the holiday promised to be a nominal one with the finks mrs fink had the stationary washtubs in the kitchen filled with a two weeks wash that had been soaking overnight mr fink sat in his stockinged feet reading a newspaper thus labor day presaged to speed jealousy surged high in mrs fink s heart and higher still surged an audacious resolve if her man would not strike her if he would not so far prove his manhood his prerogative and his interest in conjugal affairs he must be prompted to his duty mr fink lit his pipe and peacefully rubbed an ankle with a stockinged toe he reposed in the state of matrimony like a lump of unblended suet in a pudding this was his level elysium to sit at ease vicariously girdling the world in print amid the wifely splashing of suds and the agreeable smells of breakfast dishes departed and dinner ones to come many ideas were far from his mind but the furthest one was the thought of beating his wife mrs fink turned on the hot water and set the washboards in the suds up from the flat below came the gay laugh of mrs cassidy it sounded like a taunt a flaunting of her own happiness in the face of the unslugged bride above now was mrs fink s time suddenly she turned like a fury upon the man reading you lazy loafer she cried must i work my arms off washing and toiling for the ugly likes of you are you a man or are you a kitchen hound mr fink dropped his paper motionless from surprise she feared that he would not strike that the provocation had been insufficient she leaped at him and struck him fiercely in the face with her clenched hand in that instant she felt a thrill of love for hire such as she had not felt for many a day rise up martin fink and come into your kingdom oh she must feel the weight of his hand now just to show that he cared just to show that he cared mr fink sprang to his feet maggie caught him again on the jaw with a wide swing of her other hand she closed her eyes in that fearful blissful moment before his blow should come she whispered his name to herself she leaned to the expected shock hungry for it in the flat below mr cassidy with a shamed and contrite face was powdering mame s eye in preparation for their junket from the flat above came the sound of a woman s voice high raised a bumping a stumbling and a shufing a chair overturned unmistakable sounds of domestic conflict mart and mag scrapping postulated mr cassidy didn t know they ever indulged shall i trot up and see if they need a sponge holder one of mrs cassidy s eyes sparkled like a diamond the other twinkled at least like paste oh oh she said softly and without apparent meaning in the feminine ejaculatory manner i wonder if wonder if wait jack till i go up and see up the stairs she sped as her foot struck the hallway above out from the kitchen door of her flat wildly flounced mrs fink oh maggie cried mrs cassidy in a delighted whisper did he oh did he mrs fink ran and laid her face upon her chum s shoulder and sobbed hopelessly mrs cassidy took maggie s face between her hands and lifted it gently tear stained it was flushing and paling but its velvety pink and white becomingly freckled surface was unscratched unbruised unmarred by the recreant fist of mr fink tell me maggie pleaded mame or i ll go in there and find out what was it did

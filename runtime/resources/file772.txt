but i d hate to think it they re both as fine fellows as you d meet in an all day auto ride no doubtfully answered plunkett there wasn t any picture of williams to be had and i never saw him myself i ve been sheriff only a year but i ve got a pretty accurate description of him about feet dark hair and eyes nose inclined to be roman heavy about the shoulders strong white teeth with none miss ing laughs a good deal talkative drinks considerably but never to intoxication looks you square in the eye when talking age thirty five which one of your men does that description fit the consul grinned broadly i ll tell you what you do he said laying down his rifle and slipping on his dingy black alpaca coat you come along mr plunkett and i ll take you up to see the boys if you can tell which one of em your descrip tion fits better than it does the other you have the advan tage of me bridger conducted the sheriff out and along the hard beach close to which the tiny houses of the village were distributed immediately back of the town rose sudden small thickly wooded hills up one of these by means of steps cut in the hard clay the consul led plunkett the very verge of an eminence was perched a two room wooden cottage with a thatched roof a carib woman was washing clothes outside the consul ushered the sheriff to the door of the room that over looked the harbour two men were in the room about to sit down in their shirt sleeves to a table spread for dinner they bore little resemblance one to the other in detail but the general description given by plunkett could have been justly applied to either in height colour of hair shape of nose build and manners each of them tallied with it they were fair types of jovial ready witted broad gauged americans who had gravitated together for com panionship in an alien land hello bridger they called in unison at sight of the consul come and have dinner with us and then they noticed plunkett at his heels and came forward with hospitable curiosity gentlemen said the consul his voice taking on unaccustomed formality this is mr plunkett mr plunkett mr reeves and mr morgan the cocoanut barons greeted the newcomer joyously reeves seemed about an inch taller than morgan but his laugh was not quite as loud morgan s eyes were deep brown reeves s were black reeves was the host and busied himself with fetching other chairs and calling to the carib woman for supplemental table ware it was explained that morgan lived in a bamboo shack to loo ard but that every day the two friends dined together plunkett stood still during the preparations looking about mildly with his pale blue eyes bridger looked apologetic and uneasy at length two other covers were laid and the company was assigned to places reeves and morgan stood side by side across the table from the visitors reeves nodded genially as a signal for all to seat themselves and then suddenly plunkett raised his hand with a gesture of authority he was looking straight between reeves and morgan wade williams he said quietly you are under arrest for murder reeves and morgan instantly exchanged a quick bright glance the quality of which was interrogation with a seasoning of surprise then simultaneously they turned to the speaker with a puzzled and frank depre cation in their gaze can t say that we understand you mr plunkett said morgan cheerfully did you say williams what s the joke bridgy asked reeves turning to the consul with a smile before bridger could answer plunkett spoke again i ll explain he said quietly one of you don t need any explanation but this is for the other one one of you is wade williams of chatham county kentucky you murdered your wife on may two years ago after ill treating and abusing her continually for five years i have the proper papers in my pocket for taking you back with me and you are going we will return on the fruit steamer that comes back by this island to morrow to leave its inspectors i acknowledge gentlemen that i m not quite sure which one of you is williams but wade williams goes back to chatham county to morrow i want you to understand that a great sound of merry laughter from morgan and reeves went out over the still harbour two or three fishermen in the fleet of sloops anchored there looked up at the house of the diablos americanos on the hill and wondered my dear mr plunkett cried morgan conquering his mirth the dinner is getting cold let us sit down and eat i am anxious to get my spoon into that shark fin soup business afterward sit down gentlemen if you please added reeves pleasantly i am sure mr plunkett will not object perhaps a little time may be of advantage to him in identi fying the gentlemen he wishes to arrest no objections i m sure said plunkett dropping into his chair heavily i m hungry myself i didn t want to accept the hospitality of you folks without giving you notice that s all reeves set bottles and glasses on the table there s cognac he said and anisada and scotch smoke and rye take your choice bridger chose rye reeves poured three fingers of scotch for himself morgan took the same the sheriff against much protestation filled his glass from the water bottle here s to the appetite said reeves raising his glass of mr williams morgan s laugh and his drink encountering sent him into a choking splutter all began to pay attention to the dinner which was well cooked and palatable williams called plunkett suddenly and sharply all

wound once around her neck she began to talk in spanish a voluble mournful stream of melancholy music littlefield did not under stand spanish the deputy did and he translated her talk by portions at intervals holding up his hand to check the flow of her words she came to see you mr littlefield her name s joya trevi as she wants to see you about well she s mixed up with that rafael ortiz she s his she s his girl she says he s innocent she says she made the money and got him to pass it don t you believe her mr little field that s the way with these mexi can girls they ll lie steal or kill for a fellow when they get stuck on him never trust a woman that s in love mr kilpatrick nancy derwent s indignant exclamation caused the deputy to flounder for a moment in attempting to explain that he had misquoted his own sentiments and then he event on with the translation she says she s willing to take his place in the jail if you ll let him out she says she was down sick with the fever and the doctor said she d die if she didn t have medicine that s why he passed the lead dollar on the drug store she says it saved her life this rafal seems to be her honey all right there s a lot of stuff in her talk about love and such things that you don t want to hear it was an old story to the district attorney tell her said he that i can do nothing the case comes up in the morning and he will have to make his fight before the court nancy derwent was not so hardened she was look ing with sympathetic interest at joya trevi as and at littlefield alternately the deputy repeated the dis trict attorney s words to the girl she spoke a sentence or two in a low voice pulled her shawl closely about her face and left the room what did she say then asked the district attorney nothing special said the deputy she said if the life of the one let s see how it went si la vida de ella a quien tu amas if the life of the girl you love is ever in danger remember rafael ortiz kilpatrick strolled out through the corridor in the direction of the marshal s office can t you do anything for them bob asked nancy it s such a little thing just one counterfeit dollar to ruin the happiness of two lives she was in danger of death and he did it to save her doesn t the law know the feeling of pity it hasn t a place in jurisprudence nan said little field especially in re the district attorney s duty i ll promise you that the prosecution will not be vindictive but the man is as good as convicted when the case is called witnesses will swear to his passing the bad dollar which i have in my pocket at this moment as exhibit a there are no mexicans on the jury and it will vote mr greaser guilty without leaving the box the plover shooting was fine that afternoon and in the excitement of the sport the case of rafael and the grief of joya trevi as was forgotten the district attor ney and nancy derwent drove out from the town three miles along a smooth grassy road and then struck across a rolling prairie toward a heavy line of timber on piedra creek beyond this creek lay long prairie the favourite haunt of the plover as they were nearing the creek they heard the galloping of a horse to their right and saw a man with black hair and a swarthy face riding toward the woods at a tangent as if he had come up behind them i ve seen that fellow somewhere said littlefield who had a memory for faces but i can t exactly place him some ranchman i suppose taking a short cut home they spent an hour on long prairie shooting from the buckboard nancy derwent an active outdoor western girl was pleased with her twelve bore she had bagged within two brace of her companion s score they started homeward at a gentle trot when within a hundred yards of piedra creek a man rode out of the timber directly toward them it looks like the man we saw coming over remarked miss derwent as the distance between them lessened the district attorney suddenly pulled up his team sharply with his eyes fixed upon the advancing horseman that individ ual had drawn a winchester from its scabbard on his saddle and thrown it over his arm now i know you mexico sam muttered littlefield to himself it was you who shook your rattles in that gentle epistle mexico sam did not leave things long in doubt he had a nice eye in all matters relating to firearms so when he was within good rifle range but outside of danger from no shot he threw up his winchester and opened fire upon the occupants of the buckboard the first shot cracked the back of the seat within the two inch space between the shoulders of littlefield and miss derwent the next went through the dashboard and littlefield s trouser leg the district attorney hustled nancy out of the buck board to the ground she was a little pale but asked no questions she had the frontier instinct that accepts conditions in an emergency without superfluous argument they kept their guns in hand and littlefield hastily gathered some handfuls of cartridges from the pasteboard box on the seat and crowded them into his pockets keep behind the horses nan he commanded that fellow is a ruffian i sent to prison once he s trying to get even he knows our shot won t hurt him at that distance all right bob said nancy steadily i m not afraid but you come close too whoa bess stand still now she stroked bess s mane littlefield stood with his gun ready praying that the desperado would come within range but mexico sam was playing his vendetta along safe lines he was a bird of different feather from the plover his accurate eye drew an imaginary line of circumference around the area of danger from bird shot and upon this line lie rode his horse wheeled to the right and as his victims rounded to the safe side of their equine breast work he sent a ball through the district attorney s hat once he miscalculated in making a d tour and over stepped ms margin littlefield s gun flashed and mexico sam ducked his head to the harmless patter of the shot a few of them stung his horse which pranced promptly back to the safety line the desperado fired again a little cry came from nancy derwent littlefield whirled with blazing eyes and saw the blood trickling down her cheek i m not hurt bob only a splinter struck me i think he hit one of the wheel spokes lord groaned littlefield if i only had a charge of buckshot the ruffian got his horse still and took careful aim fly gave a snort and fell in the harness struck in the neck bess now disabused of the idea that plover were being fired at broke her traces and galloped wildly away mexican sam sent a ball neatly through the fulness of nancy derwent s shooting jacket lie down lie down snapped littlefield close to the horse flat on the ground so he almost threw her upon the grass against the back of the recum bent fly oddly enough at that moment the words of the mexican girl returned to his mind if the life of the girl you love is ever in danger remem ber rafael ortiz littlefield uttered an exclamation open fire on him nan across the horse s back fire as fast as you can you can t hurt him but keep him dodging shot for one minute while i try to work a little scheme nancy gave a quick glance at littlefield and saw him take out his pocket knife and open it then she turned her face to obey orders keeping up a rapid fire at the enemy mexico sam waited patiently until this innocuous fusillade ceased he had plenty of time and he did not care to risk the chance of a bird shot in his eye when could be avoided by a little caution he pulled his heavy stetson low down over his face until the shots ceased then he drew a little nearer and fired with careful aim at what he could see of his victims above the fallen horse neither of them moved he urged his horse a few steps nearer he saw the district attorney rise to one knee and deliberately level his shotgun he pulled his hat down and awaited the harmless rattle of the tiny pellets the shotgun blazed with a heavy report mexico sam sighed turned limp all over and slowly fell from his horse a dead rattlesnake at ten o clock the next morning court opened and the case of the united states versus rafael ortiz was called the district attorney with his arm in a sling rose and addressed the court may it please your honour he said i desire to enter a nolle pros in this case even though the defend ant should be guilty there is not sufficient evidence in the hands of the government to secure a conviction the piece of counterfeit coin upon the identity of which the case was built is not now available as evidence i ask therefore that the case be stricken off at the noon recess kilpatrick strolled into the district attorney s office i ve just been down to take a squint at old mexico sam said the deputy they ve got him laid out old mexico was a tough outfit i reckon the boys was wonderin down there what you shot him with some said it must have been nails i never see a gun carry anything to make holes like he had i shot him said the district attorney with exhibit a of your counterfeiting case lucky thing for me and somebody else that it was as bad money as it was it sliced up into slugs very nicely say kil can t you go down to the jacals and find where that mexican girl lives miss derwent wants to know a newspaper story at a m it lay on giuseppi s news stand still damp from the presses giuseppi with the cunning of his ilk philandered on the opposite comer leaving his patrons to help themselves no doubt on a theory related to the hypothesis of the watched pot this particular newspaper was according to its custom and design an educator a guide a monitor a champion and a household counsellor and vade mecum from its many excellencies might be selected three editorials one was in simple and chaste but illuminat ing language directed to parents and teachers depreca ting corporal punishment for children another was an accusive and significant warning addressed to a notorious labour leader who was on the point of instigating his clients to a troublesome strike the third was an eloquent demand that the police force be sustained and aided in everything that tended to increase its efficiency as public guardians and servants besides these more important chidings and requisitions upon the store of good citizenship was a wise prescription or form of procedure laid out by the editor of the heart to heart column in the specific case of a young man who had complained of the obduracy of his lady love teaching him how he might win her again there was on the beauty page a complete answer to a young lady inquirer who desired admonition toward the securing of bright eyes rosy cheeks and a beautiful countenance one other item requiring special cognizance was a brief personal running thus dear jack forgive me you were right meet me comer madison and th at this morning we leave at noon penitent at o clock a young man with a haggard look and the feverish gleam of unrest in his eye dropped a penny and picked up the top paper as he passed giuseppi s stand a sleepless night had left him a late riser there was an office to be reached by nine and a shave and a hasty cup of coffee to be crowded into the interval he visited his barber shop and then hurried on his way he pocketed his paper meditating a belated perusal of it at the luncheon hour at the next corner it fell from his pocket carrying with it his pair of new gloves three blocks he walked missed the gloves and turned back fuming just on the half hour he reached the corner where lay the gloves and the paper but he strangely ignored that which he had come to seek he was holding two little hands as tightly as ever he could and looking into two penitent brown eyes while joy rioted in his heart dear jack she said i knew you would be here on time i wonder what she means by that he was saying to himself but it s all right it s all right a big wind puffed out of the west picked up the paper from the sidewalk opened it out and sent it flying and whirling down a side street up that street was driving a skittish bay to a spider wheel buggy the young man who had written to the heart to heart editor for a recipe that he might win her for whom he sighed the wind with a prankish flurry flapped the flying newspaper against the face of the skittish bay there was a lengthened streak of bay mingled with the red of running gear that stretched itself out for four blocks then a water hydrant played its part in the cosmogony the buggy became matchwood as foreordained and the driver rested very quietly where he had been flung on the asphalt in front of a certain brownstone mansion they came out and had him inside very promptly and there was one who made herself a pillow for his head and cared for no curious eyes bending over and saying oh it was you it was you all the time bobby couldn t you see it and if you die why so must i and but in all this wind we must hurry to keep in touch with our paper policeman o brine arrested it as a character dangerous to traffic straightening its dishevelled leaves with his big slow fingers he stood a few feet from the family entrance of the shandon bells caf one headline he spelled out ponderously the papers to the front in a move to help the police but whisht the voice of danny the head bartender through the crack of the door here s a nip for ye mike ould man behind the widespread amicable columns of the press policeman o brine receives swiftly his nip of the real stuff he moves away stalwart refreshed fortified to his duties might not the editor man view with pride the early the spiritual the literal fruit that had blessed his labours policeman o brine folded the paper and poked it playfully under the arm of a small boy that was passing that boy was named johnny and he took the paper home with him his sister was named gladys and she had written to the beauty editor of the paper asking for the practicable touchstone of beauty that was weeks ago and she had ceased to look for an answer gladys was a pale girl with dull eyes and a discontented expression she was dressing to go up to the avenue to get some braid beneath her skirt she pinned two leaves of the paper johnny had brought when she walked the rustling sound was an exact imitation of the real thing on the street she met the brown girl from the flat below and stopped to talk the brown girl turned green only silk at a yard could make the sound that she heard when gladys moved the brown girl consumed by jealousy said something spiteful and went her way with pinched lips gladys proceeded toward the avenue her eyes now sparkled like jagerfonteins a rosy bloom visited her cheeks a triumphant subtle vivifying smile transfigured her face she was beautiful could the beauty editor have seen her then there was something in her answer in the paper i believe about cultivating kind feelings toward others in order to make plain features attractive the labour leader against whom the paper s solemn and weighty editorial injunction was laid was the father of gladys and johnny he picked up the remains of the journal from which gladys had ravished a cosmetic of silken sounds the editorial did not come under his eye but instead it was greeted by one of those ingenious and specious puzzle problems that enthrall alike the simpleton and the sage the labour leader tore off half of the page provided himself with table pencil and paper and glued himself to his puzzle three hours later after waiting vainly for him at the appointed place other more conservative leaders declared and ruled in favour of arbitration and the strike with its attendant dangers was averted subsequent editions of the paper referred in coloured inks to the clarion tone of its successful denunciation of the labour leader s intended designs the remaining leaves of the active journal also went loyally to the proving of its potency when johnny returned from school he sought a secluded spot and removed the missing columns from the inside of his clothing where they had been artfully distributed so as to successfully defend such areas as are generally attacked during scholastic castigations johnny attended a private school and had had trouble with his teacher as has been said there was an excellent editorial against corporal punishment in that morning s issue and no doubt it had its effect after this can any one doubt the power of the press tommy s burglar at ten o clock p m felicia the maid left by the basement door with the policeman to get a raspberry phosphate around the corner she detested the police man and objected earnestly to the arrangement she pointed out not unreasonably that she might have been allowed to fall asleep over one of st george rathbone s novels on the third floor but she was overruled rasp berries and cops were not created for nothing the burglar got into the house without much difficulty because we must have action and not too much descrip tion in a word story in the dining room he opened the slide of his dark lantern with a brace and centrebit he began to bore into the lock of the silver closet suddenly a click was heard the room was flooded with electric light the dark velvet porti res parted to admit a fair haired boy of eight in pink pajamas bearing a bottle of olive oil in his hand are you a burglar he asked in a sweet childish voice listen to that exclaimed the man in a hoarse voice am i a burglar wot do you suppose i have a three days growth of bristly bread on my face for and a cap with flaps give me the oil quick and let me grease the bit so i won t wake up your mamma who is lying down with a headache and left you in charge of felicia who has been faithless to her trust oh dear said tommy with a sigh i thought you would be more up to date this oil is for the salad when i bring lunch from the pantry for you and mamma and papa have gone to the metropolitan to hear de reszke but that isn t my fault it only shows how long the story has been knocking around among the editors if the author had been wise he d have changed it to caruso in the proofs be quiet hissed the burglar under his breath if you raise an alarm i ll wring your neck like a rabbit s like a chicken s corrected tommy you had that wrong you don t wring rabbits necks aren t you afraid of me asked the burglar you know i m not answered tommy don t you suppose i know fact from fiction if this wasn t a story i d yell like an indian when i saw you and you d probably tumble downstairs and get pinched on the sidewalk i see said the burglar that you re on to your job go on with the performance tommy seated himself in an armchair and drew his toes up under him why do you go around robbing strangers mr burg lar have you no friends i see what you re driving at said the burglar with a dark frown it s the same old story your innocence and childish insouciance is going to lead me back into an honest life every time i crack a crib where there s a kid around it happens would you mind gazing with wolfish eyes at the plate of cold beef that the butler has left on the dining table said tommy i m afraid it s growing late the burglar accommodated poor man said tommy you must be hungry if you will please stand in a listless attitude i will get you something to eat the boy brought a roast chicken a jar of marmalade and a bottle of wine from the pantry the burglar seized a knife and fork sullenly it s only been an hour he grumbled since i had a lobster and a pint of musty ale up on broadway i wish these story writers would let a fellow have a pepsin tablet anyhow between feeds my papa writes books remarked tommy the burglar jumped to his feet quickly you said he had gone to the opera he hissed hoarsely and with immediate suspicion i ought to have explained said tommy he didn t buy the tickets the burglar sat again and toyed with the wishbone why do you burgle houses asked the boy wonderingly because replied the burglar with a sudden flow of tears god bless my little brown baired boy bessie at home ah said tommy wrinkling his nose you got that answer in the wrong place you want to tell your hard luck story before you pull out the child stop oh yes said the burglar i forgot well once i lived in milwaukee and take the silver said tommy rising from his chair hold on said the burglar but i moved away i could find no other employment for a while i man aged to support my wife and child by passing confederate money but alas i was forced to give that up because it did not belong to the union i became desperate and a burglar have you ever fallen into the hands of the police asked tommy i said burglar not beggar answered the cracksman after you finish your lunch said tommy and experience the usual change of heart how shall we wind up the story suppose said the burglar thoughtfully that tony pastor turns out earlier than usual to night and your father gets in from parsifal at i am thoroughly repentant because you have made me think of my own little boy bessie and say said tommy haven t you got that wrong not on your coloured crayon drawings by b cory kilvert said the burglar it s always a bessie that i have at home artlessly prattling to the pale checked burglar s bride as i was saying your father opens the front door just as i am departing with admonitions and sandwiches that you have wrapped up for me upon recognizing me as an old harvard classmate he starts back in not in surprise interrupted tommy with wide open eyes he starts back in the doorway continued the burglar and then he rose to his feet and began to shout rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah well said tommy wonderingly that s the first time i ever knew a burglar to give a college yell when he was burglarizing a house even in a story that s one on you said the burglar with a laugh i was practising the dramatization if this is put on the stage that college touch is about the only thing that will make it go tommy looked his admiration you re on all right he said and there s another mistalze you ve made said the burglar you should have gone some time ago and brought me the gold piece your mother gave you on your birthday to take to bessie but she didn t give it to me to take to bessie said tommy pouting come come said the burglar sternly it s not nice of you to take advantage because the story contains an ambiguous sentence you know what i mean it s mighty little i get out of these fictional jobs anyhow i lose all the loot and i have to reform every time and all the swag i m allowed is the blamed little fol de rols and luck pieces that you kids hand over why in one story all i got was a kiss from a little girl who came in on me when i was opening a safe and it tasted of molasses candy too i ve a good notion to tie this table cover over your head and keep on into the silver closet oh no you haven t said tommy wrapping his arms around his knees because if you did no editor would buy the story you know you ve got to preserve the unities so ve you said the burglar rather glumly instead of sitting here talking impudence and taking the bread out of a poor man s mouth what you d like to be doing is hiding under the bed and screeching at the top of your voice you re right old man said tommy heartily i wonder what they make us do it for i think the s p c c ought to interfere i m sure it s neither agreeable nor usual for a kid of my age to butt in when a full grown burglar is at work and offer him a red sled and a pair of skates not to awaken his sick mother and look how they make the burglars act you d think editors would know but what s the use the burglar wiped his hands on the tablecloth and arose with a yawn well let s get through with it he said god bless you my little boy you have saved a man from committing a crime this night bessie shall pray for you as soon as i get home and give her her orders i shall never burglarize another house at least not until the june magazines are out it ll be your little sister s turn then to run in on me while i am abstracting the u s per cent from the tea urn and buy me off with her coral necklace and a falsetto kiss you haven t got all the kicks coming to you sighed tommy crawling out of his chair think of the sleep i m losing but it s tough on both of us old man i wish you could get out of the story and really rob somebody maybe you ll have the chance if they dramatize us never said the burglar gloomily between the box office and my better impulses that your leading juven iles are supposed to awaken and the magazines that pay on publication i guess i ll always be broke i m sorry said tommy sympathetically but i can t help myself any more than you can it s one of the canons of household fiction that no burglar shall be suc cessful the burglar must be foiled by a kid like me or by a young lady heroine or at the last moment by his old pal red mike who recognizes the house as one in which he used to be the coachman you have got the worst end of it in any kind of a story well i suppose i must be clearing out now said the burglar taking up his lantern and bracebit you have to take the rest of this chicken and the bottle of wine with you for bessie and her mother said tommy calmly but confound it exclaimed the burglar in an annoyed tone they don t want it i ve got five cases of chateau de beychsvelle at home that was bottled in that claret of yours is corked and you couldn t get either of them to look at a chicken unless it was stewed in champagne you know after i get out of the story i don t have so many limitations i make a turn now and then yes but you must take them said tommy loading his arms with the bundles bless you young master recited the burglar obedient second story saul will never forget you and now hurry and let me out kid our words must be nearly up tommy led the way through the hall toward the front door suddenly the burglar stopped and called to him softly ain t there a cop out there in front somewhere sparking the girl yes said tommy but what i m afraid he ll catch me said the burglar you mustn t forget that this is fiction great head said tommy turning come out by the back door a chaparral christmas gift the original cause of the trouble was about twenty years in growing at the end of that time it was worth it had you lived anywhere within fifty miles of sun down ranch you would have heard of it it possessed a quantity of jet black hair a pair of extremely frank deep brown eyes and a laugh that rippled across the prairie like the sound of a hidden brook the name of it was rosita mcmullen and she was the daughter of old man mcmullen of the sundown sheep ranch there came riding on red roan steeds or to be more explicit on a paint and a flea bitten sorrel two wooers one was madison lane and the other was the frio kid but at that time they did not call him the frio kid for he had not earned the honours of special nomenclature his name was simply johnny mcroy it must not be supposed that these two were the sum of the agreeable rosita s admirers the bronchos of a dozen others champed their bits at the long hitching rack of the sundown ranch many were the sheeps eves that were cast in those savannas that did not belong to the flocks of dan mcmullen but of all the cavaliers madison lane and johnny meroy galloped far ahead wherefore they are to be chronicled madison lane a young cattleman from the nueces country won the race he and rosita were married one christmas day armed hilarious vociferous mag nanimous the cowmen and the sheepmen laying aside their hereditary hatred joined forces to celebrate the occasion sundown ranch was sonorous with the cracking of jokes and sixshooters the shine of buckles and bright eyes the outspoken congratulations of the herders of kine but while the wedding feast was at its liveliest there descended upon it johnny meroy bitten by jealousy like one possessed i ll give you a christmas present he yelled shrilly at the door with his in his hand even then he had some reputation as an offhand shot his first bullet cut a neat underbit in madison lane s right ear the barrel of his gun moved an inch the next shot would have been the bride s had not carson a sheepman possessed a mind with triggers somewhat well oiled and in repair the guns of the wedding party had been hung in their belts upon nails in the wall when they sat at table as a concession to good taste but carson with great promptness hurled his plate of roast venison and frijoles at mcroy spoiling his aim the second bullet then only shattered the white petals of a spanish dagger flower suspended two feet above rosita s head the guests spurned their chairs and jumped for their weapons it was considered an improper act to shoot the bride and groom at a wedding in about six seconds there were twenty or so bullets due to be whizzing in the direction of mr mcroy i ll shoot better next time yelled johnny and there ll be a next time he backed rapidly out the door carson the sheepman spurred on to attempt further exploits by the success of his plate throwing was first to reach the door mcroy s bullet from the darkness laid him low the cattlemen then swept out upon him calling for vengeance for while the slaughter of a sheepman has not always lacked condonement it was a decided mis demeanour in this instance carson was innocent he was no accomplice at the matrimonial proceedings nor had any one heard him quote the line christmas comes but once a year to the guests but the sortie failed in its vengeance mcroy was on his horse and away shouting back curses and threats as he galloped into the concealing chaparral that night was the birthnight of the frio kid he became the bad man of that portion of the state the rejection of his suit by miss mcmullen turned him to a dangerous man when officers went after him for the shooting of carson he killed two of them and entered upon the life of an outlaw he became a marvellous shot with either hand he would turn up in towns and settlements raise a quarrel at the slightest opportunity pick off his man and laugh at the officers of the law he was so cool so deadly so rapid so inhumanly blood thirsty that none but faint attempts were ever made to capture him when he was at last shot and killed by a little one armed mexican who was nearly dead himself from fright the frio kid had the deaths of eighteen men on his head about half of these were killed in fair duels depending upon the quickness of the draw the other half were men whom be assassinated from absolute wantonness and cruelty many tales are told along the border of his impudent courage and daring but he was not one of the breed of desperadoes who have seasons of generosity and even of softness they say he never had mercy on the object of his anger yet at this and every christmastide it is well to give each one credit if it can be done for what ever speck of good he may have possessed if the frio kid ever did a kindly act or felt a throb of generosity in his heart it was once at such a time and season and this is the way it happened one who has been crossed in love should never breathe the odour from the blossoms of the ratama tree it stirs the memory to a dangerous degree one december in the frio country there was a ratama tree in full bloom for the winter had been as warm as springtime that way rode the frio kid and his satellite aw co murderer mexican frank the kid reined in his mustang and sat in his saddle thoughtful and grim with dangerously narrowing eyes the rich sweet scent touched him somewhere beneath his ice and iron i don t know what i ve been thinking about mex he remarked in his usual mild drawl to have forgot all about a christmas present i got to give i m going to ride over to morrow night and shoot madison lane in his own house he got my girl rosita would have had me if he hadn t cut into the game i wonder why i happened to overlook it up to now ah shucks kid said mexican don t talk foolish ness you know you can t get within a mile of mad lane s house to morrow night i see old man allen day before yesterday and he says mad is going to have christmas doings at his house you remember how you shot up the festivities when mad was married and about the threats you made don t you suppose mad lane ll kind of keep his eye open for a certain mr kid you plumb make me tired kid with such remarks i m going repeated the frio kid without heat to go to madison lane s christmas doings and kill him i ought to have done it a long time ago why mex just two weeks ago i dreamed me and rosita was married instead of her and him and we was living in a house and i could see her smiling at me and oh h l mex he got her and i ll get him yes sir on christmas eve he got her and then s when i ll get him there s other ways of committing suicide advised mexican why don t you go and surrender to the sheriff i ll get him said the kid christmas eve fell as balmy as april perhaps there was a hint of far away frostiness in the air but it tingles like seltzer perfumed faintly with late prairie blossoms and the mesquite grass when night came the five or six rooms of the ranch house were brightly lit in one room was a christmas tree for the lanes had a boy of three and a dozen or more guests were expected from the nearer ranches at nightfall madison lane called aside jim belcher and three other cowboys employed on his ranch now boys said lane keep your eyes open walk around the house and watch the road well all of you know the frio kid as they call him now and if you see him open fire on him without asking any questions i m not afraid of his coming around but rosita is she s been afraid he d come in on us every christmas since we were married the guests had arrived in buckboards and on horseback and were making themselves comfortable inside the evening went along pleasantly the guests enjoyed and praised rosita s excellent supper and after ward the men scattered in groups about the rooms or on the broad gallery smoking and chatting the christmas tree of course delighted the youngsters and above all were they pleased when santa claus himself in magnificent white beard and furs appeared and began to distribute the toys it s my papa announced billy sampson aged six i ve seen him wear em before berkly a sheepman an old friend of lane stopped rosita as she was passing by him on the gallery where he was sitting smoking well mrs lane said he i suppose by this christ mas you ve gotten over being afraid of that fellow mcroy haven t you madison and i have talked about it you know very nearly said rosita smiling but i am still nervous sometimes i shall never forget that awful time when he came so near to killing us he s the most cold hearted villain in the world said berkly the citizens all along the border ought to turn out and hunt him down like a wolf he has committed awful crimes said rosita but i don t know i think there is a spot of good somewhere in everybody he was not always bad that i know rosita turned into the hallway between the rooms santa claus in muffling whiskers and furs was just coming through i heard what you said through the window mrs lane he said i was just going down in my pocket for a christmas present for your husband but i ve left one for you instead it s in the room to your right oh thank you kind santa claus said rosita brightly rosita went into the room while santa claus stepped into the cooler air of the yard she found no one in the room but madison where is my present that santa said he left for me in here she asked haven t seen anything in the way of a present said her husband laughing unless he could have meant me the next day gabriel radd the foreman of the x ranch dropped into the post office at loma alta well the frio kid s got his dose of lead at last he remarked to the postmaster that so how d it happen one of old sanchez s mexican sheep herders did it think of it the frio kid killed bv a sheep herder the greaser saw him riding along past his camp about twelve o clock last night and was so skeered that he up with a winchester and let him have it funniest part of it was that the kid was dressed all up with white angora skin whiskers and a regular santy claus rig out from head to foot think of the frio kid playing santy a little local colour i mentioned to rivington that i was in search of characteristic new york scenes and incidents some thing typical i told him without necessarily having to spell the first syllable with an i oh for your writing business said rivington you couldn t have applied to a better shop what i don t know about little old new york wouldn t make a sonnet to a sunbonnet i ll put you right in the middle of so much local colour that you won t know whether you are a magazine cover or in the erysipelas ward when do you want to begin rivington is a young man about town and a new yorker by birth preference and incommutability i told him that i would be glad to accept his escort and guardianship so that i might take notes of manhattan s grand gloomy and peculiar idiosyncrasies and that the time of so doing would be at his own convenience we ll begin this very evening said rivington him self interested like a good fellow dine with me at seven and then i ll steer you up against metropolitan phases so thick you ll have to have a kinetoscope to record em so i dined with rivington pleasantly at his club in forty eleventh street and then we set forth in pursuit of the elusive tincture of affairs as we came out of the club there stood two men on the sidewalk near the steps in earnest conversation and by what process of ratiocination said one of them do you arrive at the conclusion that the division of society into producing and non possessing classes predicates failure when compared with competitive systems that are monopolizing in tendency and result inimically to industrial evolution oh come off your perch said the other man who wore glasses your premises won t come out in the wash you wind jammers who apply bandy legged theories to concrete categorical syllogisms send logical conclusions skallybootin into the infinitesimal ragbag you can t pull my leg with an old sophism with whiskers on it you quote marx and hyndman and kautsky what are they shines tolstoi his garret is full of rats i put it to you over the home plate that the idea of a cooperative commonwealth and an abolishment of competitive systems simply takes the rag off the bush and gives me hyperesthesia of the roopteetoop the skoo kum house for yours i stopped a few yards away and took out my little notebook oh come ahead said rivington somewhat ner vously you don t want to listen to that why man i whispered this is just what i do want to hear these slang types are among your city s most distinguishing features is this the bowery variety i really must hear more of it if i follow you said the man who had spoken flrst you do not believe it possible to reorganize society on the basis of common interest shinny on your own side said the man with glasses you never heard any such music from my foghorn what i said was that i did not believe it practicable just now the guys with wads are not in the frame of mind to slack up on the mazuma and the man with the portable tin banqueting canister isn t exactly ready to join the bible class you can bet your variegated socks that the situation is all spifflicated up from the battery to breakfast what the country needs is for some bully old bloke like cobden or some wise guy like old ben frank lin to sashay up to the front and biff the nigger s head with the baseball do you catch my smoke what rivington pulled me by the arm impatiently please come on he said let s go see something this isn t what you want indeed it is i said resisting this tough talk is the very stuff that counts there is a picturesqueness about the speech of the lower order of people that is quite unique did you say that this is the bowery variety of slang oh well said rivington giving it up i ll tell you straight that s one of our college professors talking he ran down for a day or two at the club it s a sort of fad with him lately to use slang in his conversation he thinks it improves language the man he is talking to is one of new york s famous social economists now will you come on you can t use that you know no i agreed i can t use that would you call that typical of new york of course not said rivington with a sigh of relief i m glad you see the difference but if you want to hear the real old tough bowery slang i ll take you down where you ll get your fill of it i would like it i said that is if it s the real thing i ve often read it in books but i never heard it do you think it will be dangerous to go unprotected among those characters oh no said rivington not at this time of night to tell the truth i haven t been along the bowery in a long time but i know it as well as i do broadway we ll look up some of the typical bowery boys and get them to talk it ll be worth your while they talk a peculiar dialect that you won t hear any where else on earth rivington and i went east in a forty second street car and then south on the third avenue line at houston street we got off and walked we are now on the famous bowery said rivington the bowery celebrated in song and story we passed block after block of gents furnishing stores the windows full of shirts with prices attached and cuffs inside in other windows were neckties and no shirts people walked up and down the sidewalks in some ways said i this reminds me of koko mono ind during the peach crating season rivington was nettled step into one of these saloons or vaudeville shows said he with a large roll of money and see how quickly the bowery will sustain its reputation you make impossible conditions said i coldly by and by rivington stopped and said we were in the heart of the bowery there was a policeman on the corner whom rivington knew hallo donahue said my guide how goes it my friend and i are down this way looking up a bit of local colour he s anxious to meet one of the bowery types can t you put us on to something genuine in that line something that s got the colour you know policeman donahue turned himself about ponder ously his florid face full of good nature he pointed with his club down the street sure he said huskily here comes a lad now that was born on the bowery and knows every inch of it if he s ever been above bleecker street he s kept it to himself a man about twenty eight or twenty nine with a smooth face was sauntering toward us with his hands in his coat pockets policeman donahue stopped him with a courteous wave of his club evening kerry he said here s a couple of gents friends of mine that want to hear you spiel something about the bowery can you reel em off a few yards certainly donahue said the young man pleas antly good evening gentlemen he said to us with a pleasant smile donahue walked off on his beat this is the goods whispered rivington nudging me with his elbow look at his jaw say cull said rivington pushing back his hat wot s doin me and my friend s taking a look down de old line see de copper tipped us off dat you was wise to de bowery is dat right i could not help admiring rivington s power of adapt ing himself to his surroundings donahue was right said the young man frankly i was brought up on the bowery i have been news boy teamster pugilist member of an organized band of toughs bartender and a sport in various mean ings of the word the experience certainly warrants the supposition that i have at least a passing acquaintance with a few phases of bowery life i will be pleased to place whatever knowledge and experience i have at the service of my friend donahue s friends rivington seemed ill at ease i say he said somewhat entreatingly i thought you re not stringing us are you it isn t just the kind of talk we expected you haven t even said hully gee once do you really belong on the bowery i am afraid said the bowery boy smilingly that at some time you have been enticed into one of the dives of literature and had the counterfeit coin of the bowery passed upon you the argot to which you doubtless refer was the invention of certain of your literary dis coverers who invaded the unknown wilds below third avenue and put strange sounds into the mouths of the inhabitants safe in their homes far to the north and west the credulous readers who were beguiled by this new dialect perused and believed like marco polo and mungo park pioneers indeed but ambitious souls who could not draw the line of demarcation between dis covery and invention the literary bones of these explorers are dotting the trackless wastes of the sub way while it is true that after the publication of the mythical language attributed to the dwellers along the bowery certain of its pat phrases and apt metaphors were adopted and to a limited extent used in this locality it was because our people are prompt in assimilating whatever is to their commercial advantage to the tourists who visited our newly discovered clime and who expected a realization of their literary guide books they supplied the demands of the market but perhaps i am wandering from the question in what way can i assist you gentlemen i beg you will believe that the hospitality of the street is extended to all there are i regret to say many catchpenny places of entertainment but i cannot conceive that they would entice you i felt rivington lean somewhat heavily against me say he remarked with uncertain utterance come and have a drink with us thank you but i never drink i find that alcohol even in the smallest quantities alters the perspective and i must preserve my perspective for i am studyinc the bowery i have lived in it nearly thirty years and i am just beginning to understand its heartbeats it is like a great river fed by a hundred alien streams each influx brings strange seeds on its flood strange silt and weeds and now and then a flower of rare promise to construe this river requires a man who can build dykes against the overflow who is a naturalist a geologist a humanitarian a diver and a strong swimmer i love my bowery it was my cradle and is my inspiration i have published one book the critics have been kind i put my heart in it i am writing another into which i hope to put both heart and brain consider me your guide gentlemen is there arything i can take you to see any place to which i can conduct you i was afraid to look at rivington except with one eye thanks said rivington we were looking up that is my friend confound it it s against all precedent you know awfully obliged just the same in case said our friend you would like to meet some of our bowery young men i would be pleased to have you visit the quarters of our east side kappa delta phi society only two blocks east of here awfully sorry said rivington but my friend s got me on the jump to nioht he s a terror when he s out after local colour now there s nothing i would like better than to drop in at the kappa delta phi but some other time we said our farewells and boarded a home bound car we had a rabbit on upper broadway and then i parted with rivington on a street corner well anyhow said he braced and recovered it couldn t have happened anywhere but in little old new york which to say the least was typical of rivington georgia s ruling if you should chance to visit the general land office step into the draughtsmen s room and ask to be shown the map of salado county a leisurely german pos sibly old kampfer himself will bring it to you it will be four feet square on heavy drawing cloth the lettering and the figures will be beautifully clear and distinct the title will be in splendid undecipherable german text ornamented with classic teutonic designs very likely ceres or pomona leaning against the initial letters with cornucopias venting grapes and wieners you must tell him that this is not the map you wish to see that he will kindly bring you its official predecessor he will then say ach so and bring out a map half the size of the first dim old tattered and faded by looking carefully near its northwest corner you will presently come upon the worn contours of chiquito river and maybe if your eyes are good discern the silent witness to this story the commissioner of the land office was of the old style his antique courtesy was too formal for his day he dressed in fine black and there was a suggestion of roman drapery in his long coat skirts his collars were undetached blame haberdashery for the word his tie was a narrow funereal strip tied in the same knot as were his shoe strings his gray hair was a trifle too long behind but he kept it smooth and orderly his face was clean shaven like the old statesmen s most people thought it a stern face but when its official expression was off a few had seen altogether a different countenance especially tender and gentle it had appeared to those who were about him during the last illness of his only child the commissioner had been a widower for years and his life outside his official duties had been so devoted to little georgia that people spoke of it as a touching and admirable thing he was a reserved man and dignified almost to austerity but the child had come below it all and rested upon his very heart so that she scarcely missed the mother s love that had been taken away there was a wonderful companionship between them for she had many of his own ways being thoughtful and serious beyond her years one day while she was lying with the fever burning brightly in her checks she said suddenly papa i wish i could do something good for a whole lot of children what would you like to do dear asked the com missioner give them a party oh i don t mean those kind i mean poor children who haven t homes and aren t loved and cared for as i am i tell you what papa what my own child if i shouldn t get well i ll leave them you not give you but just lend you for you must come to mamma and me when you die too if you can find time wouldn t you do something to help them if i ask you papa hush hush dear dear child said the commissioner holding her hot little hand against his cheek you ll get well real soon and you and i will see what we can do for them together but in whatsoever paths of benevolence thus vaguely premeditated the commissioner might tread he was not to have the company of his beloved that night the little frail body grew suddenly too tired to struggle further and georgia s exit was made from the great stage when she had scarcely begun to speak her little piece before the footlights but there must be a stage manager who understands she had given the cue to the one who was to speak after her a week after she was laid away the commissioner reappeared at the office a little more courteous a little paler and sterner with the black frock coat hanging a little more loosely from his tall figure his desk was piled with work that had accumulated during the four heartbreaking weeks of his absence his chief clerk had done what he could but there were ques tions of law of fine judicial decisions to be made concern ing the issue of patents the marketing and leasing of school lands the classification into grazing agricultural watered and timbered of new tracts to be opened to settlers the commissioner went to work silently and ob stinately putting back his grief as far as possible forcing his mind to attack the complicated and important busi ness of his office on the second day after his return he called the porter pointed to a leather covered chair that stood near his own and ordered it removed to a lumber room at the top of the building in that chair georgia would always sit when she came to the office for him of afternoons as time passed the commissioner seemed to grow more silent solitary and reserved a new phase of mind developed in him he could not endure the presence of a child often when

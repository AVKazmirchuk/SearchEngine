said dennis carnahan i ll be after going down to see the new coney island that s risen like a phoenix bird from the ashes of the old resort i m going with norah flynn and we ll fall victims to all the dry goods deceptions from the red flannel eruption of mount vesuvius to the pink silk ribbons on the race suicide problems in the incubator kiosk was i there before i was i was there last tuesday did i see the sights i did not last monday i amalgamated myself with the bricklayers union and in accordance with the rules i was ordered to quit work the same day on account of a sympathy strike with the lady salmon canners lodge no of tacoma washington twas disturbed i was in mind and proclivities by losing me job bein already harassed in me soul on account of havin quarrelled with norah flynn a week before by reason of hard words spoken at the dairymen and street sprinkler drivers semi annual ball caused by jealousy and prickly heat and that divil andy coghlin so i says it will be coney for tuesday and if the chutes and the short change and the green corn silk between the teeth don t create diversions and get me feeling better then i don t know at all ye will have heard that coney has received moral reconstruction the old bowery where they used to take your tintype by force and give ye knockout drops before having your palm read is now called the wall street of the island the wienerwurst stands are required by law to keep a news ticker in em and the doughnuts are examined every four years by a retired steamboat inspector the nigger man s head that was used by the old patrons to throw baseballs at is now illegal and by order of the police commissioner the image of a man drivin an automobile has been substituted i hear that the old immoral amusements have been suppressed people who used to go down from new york to sit in the sand and dabble in the surf now give up their quarters to squeeze through turnstiles and see imitations of city fires and floods painted on canvas the reprehensible and degradin resorts that disgraced old coney are said to be wiped out the wipin out process consists of raisin the price from cents to cents and hirin a blonde named maudie to sell tickets instead of micky the bowery bite that s what they say i don t know but to coney i goes a tuesday i gets off the l and starts for the glitterin show twas a fine sight the babylonian towers and the hindoo roof gardens was blazin with thousands of electric lights and the streets was thick with people tis a true thing they say that coney levels all rank i see millionaires eatin popcorn and trampin along with the crowd and i see eight dollar a week clothin store clerks in red automobiles fightin one another for who d squeeze the horn when they come to a corner i made a mistake i says to myself twas not coney i needed when a man s sad tis not scenes of hilarity he wants twould be far better for him to meditate in a graveyard or to attend services at the paradise roof gardens tis no consolation when a man s lost his sweetheart to order hot corn and have the waiter bring him the powdered sugar cruet instead of salt and then conceal himself or to have zozookum the gipsy palmist tell him that he has three children and to look out for another serious calamity price twenty five cents i walked far away down on the beach to the ruins of an old pavilion near one corner of this new private park dreamland a year ago that old pavilion was standin up straight and the old style waiters was slammin a week s supply of clam chowder down in front of you for a nickel and callin you cully friendly and vice was rampant and you got back to new york with enough change to take a car at the bridge now they tell me that they serve welsh rabbits on surf avenue and you get the right change back in the movin picture joints i sat down at one side of the old pavilion and looked at the surf spreadin itself on the beach and thought about the time me and norah flynn sat on that spot last summer twas before reform struck the island and we was happy we had tintypes and chowder in the ribald dives and the egyptian sorceress of the nile told norah out of her hand while i was waitin in the door that twould be the luck of her to marry a red headed gossoon with two crooked legs and i was overrunnin with joy on account of the allusion and twas there that norah flynn put her two hands in mine a year before and we talked of flats and the things she could cook and the love business that goes with such episodes and that was coney as we loved it and as the hand of satan was upon it friendly and noisy and your money s worth with no fence around the ocean and not too many electric lights to show the sleeve of a black serge coat against a white shirtwaist i sat with my back to the parks where they had the moon and the dreams and the steeples corralled and longed for the old coney there wasn t many people on the beach lots of them was feedin pennies into the slot machines to see the interrupted courtship in the movin pictures and a good many was takin the sea air in the canals of venice and some was breathin the smoke of the sea battle by actual warships in

collateral branch of the caswell family genealogy disposed of he took up to my distaste his private family matters he spoke of his wife traced her descent back to eve and profanely denied any possible rumor that she may have had relations in the land of nod by this time i was beginning to suspect that he was trying to obscure by noise the fact that he had ordered the drinks on the chance that i would be bewildered into paying for them but when they were down he crashed a silver dollar loudly upon the bar then of course another serving was obligatory and when i had paid for that i took leave of him brusquely for i wanted no more of him but before i had obtained my release he had prated loudly of an income that his wife received and showed a handful of silver money when i got my key at the desk the clerk said to me courteously if that man caswell has annoyed you and if you would like to make a complaint we will have him ejected he is a nuisance a loafer and without any known means of support although he seems to have some money most the time but we don t seem to be able to hit upon any means of throwing him out legally why no said i after some reflection i don t see my way clear to making a complaint but i would like to place myself on record as asserting that i do not care for his company your town i continued seems to be a quiet one what manner of entertainment adventure or excitement have you to offer to the stranger within your gates well sir said the clerk there will be a show here next thursday it is i ll look it up and have the announcement sent up to your room with the ice water good night after i went up to my room i looked out the window it was only about ten o clock but i looked upon a silent town the drizzle continued spangled with dim lights as far apart as currants in a cake sold at the ladies exchange a quiet place i said to myself as my first shoe struck the ceiling of the occupant of the room beneath mine nothing of the life here that gives color and variety to the cities in the east and west just a good ordinary humdrum business town nashville occupies a foremost place among the manufacturing centres of the country it is the fifth boot and shoe market in the united states the largest candy and cracker manufacturing city in the south and does an enormous wholesale drygoods grocery and drug business i must tell you how i came to be in nashville and i assure you the digression brings as much tedium to me as it does to you i was traveling elsewhere on my own business but i had a commission from a northern literary magazine to stop over there and establish a personal connection between the publication and one of its contributors azalea adair adair there was no clue to the personality except the handwriting had sent in some essays lost art and poems that had made the editors swear approvingly over their one o clock luncheon so they had commissioned me to round up said adair and corner by contract his or her output at two cents a word before some other publisher offered her ten or twenty at nine o clock the next morning after my chicken livers en brochette try them if you can find that hotel i strayed out into the drizzle which was still on for an unlimited run at the first corner i came upon uncle caesar he was a stalwart negro older than the pyramids with gray wool and a face that reminded me of brutus and a second afterwards of the late king cettiwayo he wore the most remarkable coat that i ever had seen or expect to see it reached to his ankles an had once been a confederate gray in colors but rain and sun and age had so variegated it that joseph s coat beside it would have faded to a pale monochrome i must linger with that coat for it has to do with the story the story that is so long in coming because you can hardly expect anything to happen in nashville once it must have been the military coat of an officer the cape of it had vanished but all adown its front it had been frogged and tasseled magnificently but now the frogs and tassles were gone in their stead had been patiently stitched i surmised by some surviving black mammy new frogs made of cunningly twisted common hempen twine this twine was frayed and disheveled it must have been added to the coat as a substitute for vanished splendors with tasteless but painstaking devotion for it followed faithfully the curves of the long missing frogs and to complete the comedy and pathos of the garment all its buttons were gone save one the second button from the top alone remained the coat was fastened by other twine strings tied through the buttonholes and other holes rudely pierced in the opposite side there was never such a weird garment so fantastically bedecked and of so many mottled hues the lone button was the size of a half dollar made of yellow horn and sewed on with coarse twine this negro stood by a carriage so old that ham himself might have started a hack line with it after he left the ark with the two animals hitched to it as i approached he threw open the door drew out a feather duster waved it without using it and said in deep rumbling tones step right in suh ain t a speck of dust in it jus got back from a funeral suh

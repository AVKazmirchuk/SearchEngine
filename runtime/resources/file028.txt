he well you tell him it isn t necessary you asked if there is anything we could do for him well i advise you to set him digging post holes or breaking mustangs there s our team ready good day sir and like a puff of wholesome blustery wind the doctor was off raidler reached out and plucked a leaf from a mesquite bush by the railing and began chewing it thoughtfully the branding season was at hand and the next morning ross hargis foreman of the outfit was mustering his force of some twenty five men at the ranch ready to start for the san carlos range where the work was to begin by six o clock the horses were all saddled the grub wagon ready and the cow punchers were swinging themselves upon their mounts when raidler bade them wait a boy was bringing up an extra pony bridled and saddled to the gate raidler walked to mcguire s room and threw open the door mcguire was lying on his cot not yet dressed smoking get up said the cattleman and his voice was clear and brassy like a bugle how s that asked mcguire a little startled get up and dress i can stand a rattlesnake but i hate a liar do i have to tell you again he caught mcguire by the neck and stood him on the floor say friend cried mcguire wildly are you bug house i m sick see i ll croak if i got to hustle what ve i done to yer he began his chronic whine i never asked yer to put on your clothes called raidler in a rising tone swearing stumbling shivering keeping his amazed shining eyes upon the now menacing form of the aroused cattleman mcguire managed to tumble into his clothes then raidler took him by the collar and shoved him out and across the yard to the extra pony hitched at the gate the cow punchers lolled in their saddles open mouthed take this man said raidler to ross hargis and put him to work make him work hard sleep hard and eat hard you boys know i done what i could for him and he was welcome yesterday the best doctor in san antone examined him and says he s got the lungs of a burro and the constitution of a steer you know what to do with him ross ross hargis only smiled grimly aw said mcguire looking intently at raidler with a peculiar expression upon his face the croaker said i was all

with it cricket who once brought in good boy by a neck at hawthorne and a to shot had his foot in the stirrups again mcguire led the cavalcade as they dashed away for san carlos and the cow punchers gave a yell of applause as they closed in behind his dust but in less than a mile he had lagged to the rear and was last man when they struck the patch of high chaparral below the horse pens behind a clump of this he drew rein and held a handkerchief to his mouth he took it away drenched with bright arterial blood and threw it carefully into a clump of prickly pear then he slashed with his quirt again gasped g wan to his astonished pony and galloped after the gang that night raidler received a message from his old home in alabama there had been a death in the family an estate was to divide and they called for him to come daylight found him in the buckboard skimming the prairies for the station it was two months before he returned when he arrived at the ranch house he found it well nigh deserted save for ylario who acted as a kind of steward during his absence little by little the youth made him acquainted with the work done while he was away the branding camp he was informed was still doing business on account of many severe storms the cattle had been badly scattered and the branding had been accomplished but slowly the camp was now in the valley of the guadalupe twenty miles

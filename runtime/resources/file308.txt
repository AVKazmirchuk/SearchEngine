favor to the president and stockholders of the s p ry co one more line of description and i turn jacks over to you he wore bright blue clothes yellow shoes and a bow tie made of the same cloth as his shirt my rival no was bud cunningham whose services had been engaged by a ranch near paloma to assist in compelling refractory cattle to keep within the bounds of decorum and order bud was the only cowboy off the stage that i ever saw who looked like one on it he wore the sombrero the chaps and the handkerchief tied at the back of his neck twice a week bud rode in from the val verde ranch to sup at the parisian restaurant he rode a many high handed kentucky horse at a tremendously fast lope which animal he would rein up so suddenly under the big mesquite at the corner of the brush shelter that his hoofs would plough canals yards long in the loam jacks and i were regular boarders at the restaurant of course the front room of the hinkle house was as neat a little parlor as there was in the black waxy country it was all willow rocking chairs and home knit tidies and albums and conch shells in a row and a little upright piano in one comer here jacks and bud and i or sometimes one or two of us according to our good luck used to sit of evenings when the tide of trade was over and visit miss hinkle ileen was a girl of ideas she was destined for higher things if there can be anything higher than taking in dollars all day through a barbed wire wicket she had read and listened and thought her looks would have formed a career for a less ambitious girl but rising superior to mere beauty she must establish something in the nature of a salon the only one in paloma don t you think that shakespeare was a great writer she would ask with such a pretty little knit of her arched brows that the late ignatius donnelly himself had he seen it could scarcely have saved his bacon ileen was of the opinion also that boston is more cultured than chicago that rosa bonheur was one of the greatest of women painters that westerners are more spontaneous and open hearted than easterners that london must be a very foggy city and that california must be quite lovely in the springtime and of many other opinions indicating a keeping up with the world s best thought these however were but gleaned from hearsay and evidence ileen had theories of her own one in particular she disseminated to us untiringly flattery she detested frankness and honesty of speech and action she declared were the chief mental ornaments of man and woman if ever she could like any one it would be for those qualities i m awfully weary she said one evening when we three musketeers of the mesquite were in the little parlor of having compliments on my looks paid to me i know i m not beautiful bud cunningham told me afterward that it was all he could do to keep from calling her a liar when she said that i m only a little middle western girl went on ileen who justs wants to be simple and neat and tries to help her father make a humble living old man hinkle was shipping a thousand silver dollars a month clear profit to a bank in san antonio bud twisted around in his chair and bent the rim of his hat from which he could never be persuaded to separate he did not know whether she wanted what she said she wanted or what she knew she deserved many a wiser man has hesitated at deciding bud decided why ah miss ileen beauty as you might say ain t everything not sayin that you haven t your share of good looks i always admired more than anything else about you the nice kind way you treat your ma and pa any one what s good to their parents and is a kind of home body don t specially need to be too pretty ileen gave him one of her sweetest smiles thank you mr cunningham she said i consider that one of the finest compliments i ve had in a long time i d so much rather hear you say that than to hear you talk about my eyes and hair i m glad you believe me when i say i don t like flattery our cue was there for us bud had made a good guess you couldn t lose jacks he chimed in next sure thing miss ileen he said the good lookers don t always win out now you ain t bad looking of course but that s nix cum rous i knew a girl once in dubuque with a face like a cocoanut who could skin the cat twice on a horizontal bar without changing hands now a girl might have the california peach crop mashed to a marmalade and not be able to do that i ve seen er worse lookers than you miss ileen but what i like about you is the business way you ve got of doing things cool and wise that s the winning way for a girl mr hinkle told me the other day you d never taken in a lead silver dollar or a plugged one since you ve been on the job now that s the stuff for a girl that s what catches me jacks got his smile too thank you mr jacks said ileen if you only knew how i appreciate any one s being candid and not a flatterer i get so tired of people telling me i m pretty i think it is the loveliest thing to have friends who tell you the truth

that she may have suffered in health and spirits by so long a residence there that is one portent reason for the change we are making my dear can you not recall those lines you wrote entitled i think the georgia hills the poem that was so extensively copied by the southern press and praised so highly by the atlanta critics mrs blaylock turned a glance of speaking tenderness upon the colonel fingered for a moment the silvery curl that drooped upon her bosom then looked again toward the mountains without preliminary or affectation or demurral she began in rather thrilling and more deeply pitched tones to recite these lines the georgia hills the georgia hills oh heart why dost thou pine are not these sheltered lowlands fair with mead and bloom and vine ah as the slow paced river here broods on its natal rills my spirit drifts in longing sweet back to the georgia hills and through the close drawn curtained night i steal on sleep s slow wings back to my heart s ease slopes of pine where end my wanderings oh heaven seems nearer from their tops and farther earthly ills even in dreams if i may but dream of my georgia hills the grass upon their orchard sides is a fine couch to me the common note of each small bird passes all minstrelsy it would not seem so dread a thing if when the reaper wills he might come there and take my hand up in the georgia hills thats great stuff ma am said j pinkney bloom enthusiastically when the poetess had concluded i wish i had looked up poetry more than i have i was raised in the pine hills myself the mountains ever call to their children murmured mrs blaylock i feel that life will take on the rosy hue of hope again in among these beautiful hills peyton a little taste of the currant wine if you will be so good the journey though delightful in the extreme slightly fatigues me colonel blaylock again visited the depths of his prolific coat and produced a tightly corked rough black bottle mr bloom was on his feet in an instant let me bring a glass ma am you come along colonel there s a little table we can bring too maybe we can scare up some fruit or a cup of tea on board i ll ask mac mrs blaylock reclined at ease few royal ladies have held their royal prerogative with the serene grace of the petted southern woman the colonel with an air as gallant and assiduous as in the days of his courtship and j pinkney bloom with a ponderous agility half professional and half directed by some resurrected unnamed long forgotten sentiment formed a diversified but attentive court the currant wine wine home made from the holly springs fruit went round and then j pinkney began to hear something of holly springs life it seemed from the conversation of the blaylocks that the springs was decadent a third of the population had moved away business and the colonel was an authority on business had dwindled to nothing after carefully studying the field of opportunities open to capital he had sold his little property there for eight hundred dollars and invested it in one of the enterprises opened up by the book in okochee might i inquire sir said mr bloom in what particular line of business you inserted your coin i know that town as well as i know the regulations for illegal use of the mails i might give you a hunch as to whether you can make the game go or not j pinkney somehow had a kindly feeling toward these unsophisticated representatives of by gone days they were so simple impractical and unsuspecting he was glad that he happened not to have a gold brick or a block of that western bad boy silver mine stock along with him he would have disliked to unload on people he liked so well as he did these but there are some temptations toe enticing to be resisted no sir said colonel blaylock pausing to arrange the queen s wrap i did not invest in okochee i have made an exhaustive study of business conditions and i regard old settled towns as unfavorable fields in which to place capital that is limited in amount some months ago through the kindness of a friend there came into my hands a map and description of this new town of skyland that has been built upon the lake the description was so pleasing the future of the town set forth in such convincing arguments and its increasing prosperity portrayed in such an attractive style that i decided to take advantage of the opportunity it offered i carefully selected a lot in the centre of the business district although its price was the highest in the schedule five hundred dollars and made the purchase at once are you the man i mean did you pay five hundred dollars for a lot in skyland asked j pinkney bloom i did sir answered the colonel with the air of a modest millionaire explaining his success a lot most excellently situated on the same square with the opera house and only two squares from the board of trade i consider the purchase a most fortuitous one it is my intention to erect a small building upon it at once and open a modest book and stationery store during past years i have met with many pecuniary reverses and i now find it necessary to engage in some commercial occupation that will furnish me with a livelihood the book and stationery business though an humble one seems to me not inapt nor altogether uncongenial i am a graduate of the university of virginia and mrs blaylock s really wonderful acquaintance with belles lettres and poetic literature should go far toward insuring success of course mrs blaylock

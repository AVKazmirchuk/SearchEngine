girl and tell you to an hour how long it had been since she had eaten anything more nourishing than marshmallows and tea he hung about the shopping districts and prowled around in department stores with his invitations to dinner men who escort dogs upon the streets at the end of a string look down upon him he is a type i can dwell upon him no longer my pen is not the kind intended for him i am no carpenter at ten minutes to seven dulcie was ready she looked at herself in the wrinkly mirror the reflection was satisfactory the dark blue dress fitting without a wrinkle the hat with its jaunty black feather the but slightly soiled gloves all representing self denial even of food itself were vastly becoming dulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was beautiful and that life was about to lift a corner of its mysterious veil for her to observe its wonders no gentleman had ever asked her out before now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and exalted show the girls said that piggy was a spender there would be a grand dinner and music and splendidly dressed ladies to look at and things to eat that strangely twisted the girls jaws when they tried to tell about them no doubt she would be asked out again there was a blue pongee suit in a window that she knew by saving twenty cents a week instead of ten in let s see oh it would run into years but there was a second hand store in seventh avenue where somebody knocked at the door dulcie opened it the landlady stood there with a spurious smile sniffing for cooking by stolen gas a gentleman s downstairs to see you she said name is mr wiggins by such epithet was piggy known to unfortunate ones who had to take him seriously dulcie turned to the dresser to get her handkerchief and then she stopped still and bit her underlip hard while looking in her mirror she had seen fairyland and herself a princess just awakening from a long slumber she had forgotten one that was watching her with sad beautiful stern eyes the only one there was to approve or condemn what she did straight and slender and tall with a look of sorrowful reproach on his handsome melancholy face general kitchener fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the dresser dulcie turned like an automatic doll to the landlady tell him i can t go she said dully tell him i m sick or something tell him i m not going out after the door was closed and locked dulcie fell upon her bed crushing her black tip and cried for ten minutes general kitchener was her only friend he was dulcie s ideal of a gallant knight he looked as if he might have a secret sorrow and his wonderful moustache was a dream and she was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes she used to have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime and ask for her with his sword clanking against his high boots once when a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a lamp post she had opened the window and looked out but there was no use she knew that general kitchener was away over in japan leading his army against the savage turks and he would never step out of his gilt frame for her yet one look from him had vanquished piggy that night yes for that night when her cry was over dulcie got up and took off her best dress and put on her old blue kimono she wanted no dinner she sang two verses of sammy then she became intensely interested in a little red speck on the side of her nose and after that was attended to she drew up a chair to the rickety table and told her fortune with an old deck of cards the horrid impudent thing she said aloud and i never gave him a word or a look to make him think it at nine o clock dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of raspberry jam out of her trunk and had a feast she offered general kitchener some jam on a cracker but he only looked at her as the sphinx would have looked at a butterfly if there are butterflies in the desert don t eat it if you don t want to said dulcie and don t put on so many airs and scold so with your eyes i wonder if you d he so superior and snippy if you had to live on six dollars a week it was not a good sign for dulcie to be rude to general kitchener and then she turned benvenuto cellini face downward with a severe gesture but that was not inexcusable for she had always thought he was henry viii and she did not approve of him at half past nine dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the dresser turned out the light and skipped into bed it s an awful thing to go to bed with a good night look at general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini this story really doesn t get anywhere at all the rest of it comes later sometime when piggy asks dulcie again to dine with him and she is feeling lonelier than usual and general kitchener happens to be looking the other way and then as i said before i dreamed that i was standing near a crowd of prosperous looking angels and a policeman took me by the wing and asked if i belonged with them who are they i asked why said he they are the men who hired

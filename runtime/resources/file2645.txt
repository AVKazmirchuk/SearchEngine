cottage descended to him he already had the seemliest wife in the village yvonne s milk pails and her brass kettles were bright ouf they blinded you in the sun when you passed that way but you must keep your eyes upon her yard for her flower beds were so neat and gay they restored to you your sight and you might hear her sing aye as far as the double chestnut tree above pere gruneau s blacksmith forge but a day came when david drew out paper from a long shut drawer and began to bite the end of a pencil spring had come again and touched his heart poet he must have been for now yvonne was well nigh forgotten this fine new loveliness of earth held him with its witchery and grace the perfume from her woods and meadows stirred him strangely daily had he gone forth with his flock and brought it safe at night but now he stretched himself under the hedge and pieced words together on his bits of paper the sheep strayed and the wolves perceiving that difficult poems make easy mutton ventured from the woods and stole his lambs david s stock of poems grew longer and his flock smaller yvonne s nose and temper waxed sharp and her talk blunt her pans and kettles grew dull but her eyes had caught their flash she pointed out to the poet that his neglect was reducing the flock and bringing woe upon the household david hired a boy to guard the sheep locked himself in the little room at the top of the cottage and wrote more poems the boy being a poet by nature but not furnished with an outlet in the way of writing spent his time in slumber the wolves lost no time in discovering that poetry and sleep are practically the same so the flock steadily grew smaller yvonne s ill temper increased at an equal rate sometimes she would stand in the yard and rail at david through his high window then you could hear her as far as the double chestnut tree above pere gruneau s blacksmith forge m papineau the kind wise meddling old notary saw this as he saw everything at which his nose pointed he went to david fortified himself with a great pinch of snuff and said friend mignot i affixed the seal upon the marriage certificate of your father it would distress me to be obliged to attest a paper signifying the bankruptcy of his son but that is what you are coming to i speak as an old friend now listen to what i have to say you have your heart set i perceive upon poetry at dreux i have a friend one monsieur bril georges bril he lives in a little cleared space in a houseful of books he is a learned man he visits paris each year he himself has written books he will tell you when the catacombs were made how they found out the names of the stars and why the plover has a long bill the meaning and the form of poetry is to him as intelligent as the baa of a sheep is to you i will give you a letter to him and you shall take him your poems and let him read them then you will know if you shall write more or give your attention to your wife and business write the letter said david i am sorry you did not speak of this sooner at sunrise the next morning he was on the road to dreux with the precious roll of poems under his arm at noon he wiped the dust from his feet at the door of monsieur bril that learned man broke the seal of m papineau s letter and sucked up its contents through his gleaming spectacles as the sun draws water he took david inside to his study and sat him down upon a little island beat upon by a sea of books monsieur bril had a conscience he flinched not even at a mass of manuscript the thickness of a finger length and rolled to an incorrigible curve he broke the back of the roll against his knee and began to read he slighted nothing he bored into the lump as a worm into a nut seeking for a kernel meanwhile david sat marooned trembling in the spray of so much literature it roared in his ears he held no chart or compass for voyaging in that sea half the world he thought must be writing books monsieur bril bored to the last page of the poems then he took off his spectacles and wiped them with his handkerchief my old friend papineau is well he asked in the best of health said david how many sheep have you monsieur mignot three hundred and nine when i counted them yesterday the flock has had ill fortune to that number it has decreased from eight hundred and fifty you have a wife and home and lived in comfort the sheep brought you plenty you went into the fields with them and lived in the keen air and ate the sweet bread of contentment you had but to be vigilant and recline there upon nature s breast listening to the whistle of the blackbirds in the grove am i right thus far it was so said david i have read all your verses continued monsieur bril his eyes wandering about his sea of books as if he conned the horizon for a sail look yonder through that window monsieur mignot tell me what you see in that tree i see a crow said david looking there is a bird said monsieur bril that shall assist me where i am disposed to shirk a duty you know that bird monsieur mignot he is the philosopher of the air he is happy through submission to his lot none so merry or full crawed as he with his whimsical eye and rollicking step the fields yield him what he desires he never grieves that his plumage is not gay like the oriole s and you have heard monsieur mignot the notes that nature has given him is the nightingale any happier do you think david rose to his feet the crow cawed harshly from his tree i thank you monsieur bril he said slowly there was not then one nightingale among all those croaks i could not have missed it said monsieur bril with a sigh i read every word live your poetry man do not try to write it any more i thank you said david again and now i will be going back to my sheep if you would dine with me said the man of books and overlook the smart of it i will give you reasons at length no said the poet i must be back in the fields cawing at my sheep back along the road to vernoy he trudged with his poems under his arm when he reached his village he turned into the shop of one zeigler a jew out of armenia who sold anything that came to his hand friend said david wolves from the forest harass my sheep on the hills i must purchase firearms to protect them what have you a bad day this for me friend mignot said zeigler spreading his hands for i perceive that i must sell you a weapon that will not fetch a tenth of its value only last i week i bought from a peddlar a wagon full of goods that he procured at a sale by a commissionaire of the crown the sale was of the chateau and belongings of a great lord i know not his title who has been banished for conspiracy against the king there are some choice firearms in the lot this pistol oh a weapon fit for a prince it shall be only forty francs to you friend mignot if i lose ten by the sale but perhaps an arquebuse this will do said david throwing the money on the counter is it charged i will charge it said zeigler and for ten francs more add a store of powder and ball david laid his pistol under his coat and walked to his cottage yvonne was not there of late she had taken to gadding much among the neighbours but a fire was glowing in the kitchen stove david opened the door of it and thrust his poems in upon the coals as they blazed up they made a singing harsh sound in the flue the song of the crow said the poet he went up to his attic room and closed the door so quiet was the village that a score of people heard the roar of the great pistol they flocked thither and up the stairs where the smoke issuing drew their notice the men laid the body of the poet upon his bed awkwardly arranging it to conceal the torn plumage of the poor black crow the women chattered in a luxury of zealous pity some of them ran to tell yvonne m papineau whose nose had brought him there among the first picked up the weapon and ran his eye over its silver mountings with a mingled air of connoisseurship and grief the arms he explained aside to the cure and crest of monseigneur the marquis de beaupertuys the guardian of the accolade not the least important of the force of the weymouth bank was uncle bushrod sixty years had uncle bushrod given of faithful service to the house of weymouth as chattel servitor and friend of the colour of the mahogany bank furniture was uncle bushrod thus dark was he externally white as the uninked pages of the bank ledgers was his soul eminently pleasing to uncle bushrod would the comparison have been for to him the only institution in existence worth considering was the weymouth bank of which he was something between porter and generalissimo in charge weymouth lay dreamy and umbrageous among the low foothills along the brow of a southern valley three banks there were in weymouthville two were hopeless misguided enterprises lacking the presence and prestige of a weymouth to give them glory the third was the bank managed by the weymouths and uncle bushrod in the old weymouth homestead the red brick white porticoed mansion the first to your right as you crossed elder creek coming into town lived mr robert weymouth the president of the bank his widowed daughter mrs vesey called miss letty by every one and her two children nan and guy there also in a cottage on the grounds resided uncle bushrod and aunt malindy his wife mr william weymouth the cashier of the bank lived in a modern fine house on the principal avenue mr robert was a large stout man sixty two years of age with a smooth plump face long iron gray hair and fiery blue eyes he was high tempered kind and generous with a youthful smile and a formidable stern voice that did not always mean what it sounded like mr william was a milder man correct in deportment and absorbed in business the weymouths formed the family of weymouthville and were looked up to as was their right of heritage uncle bushrod was the bank s trusted porter messenger vassal and guardian he carried a key to the vault just as mr robert and mr williams did sometimes there was ten fifteen or twenty thousand dollars in sacked silver stacked on the vault floor it was safe with uncle bushrod he was a weymouth in heart honesty and pride of late uncle bushrod had not been without worry it was on account of marse robert for nearly a year mr robert had been known to indulge in too much drink not enough understand to become tipsy but the habit was getting a hold upon him and every one was beginning to notice it half a dozen times a day he would leave the bank and step around to the merchants and planters hotel to take a drink mr roberts usual keen judgment and business capacity became a little impaired mr william a weymouth but not so rich in experience tried to dam the inevitable backflow of the tide but with incomplete success the deposits in the weymouth bank dropped from six figures to five past due paper began to accumulate owing to injudicious loans no one cared to address mr robert on the subject of temperance many of his friends said that the cause of it had been the death of his wife some two years before others hesitated on account of mr robert s quick temper which was extremely apt to resent personal interference of such a nature miss letty and the children noticed the change and grieved about it uncle bushrod also worried but he was one of those who would not have dared to remonstrate although he and marse robert had been raised almost as companions but there was a heavier shock coming to uncle bushrod than that caused by the bank president s toddies and juleps mr robert had a passion for fishing which he usually indulged whenever the season and business permitted one day when reports had been coming in relating to the bass and perch he announced his intention of making a two or three days visit to the lakes he was going down he said to reedy lake with judge archinard an old friend now uncle bushrod was treasurer of the sons and daughters of the burning bush every association he belonged to made him treasurer without hesitation he stood aa in coloured circles he was understood among them to be mr bushrod weymouth of the weymouth bank the night following the day on which mr robert mentioned his intended fishing trip the old man woke up and rose from his bed at twelve o clock declaring he must go down to the bank and fetch the pass book of the sons and daughters which he had forgotten to bring home the bookkeeper had balanced it for him that day put the cancelled checks in it and snapped two elastic bands around it he put but one band around other pass books aunt malindy objected to the mission at so late an hour denouncing it as foolish and unnecessary but uncle bushrod was not to be deflected from duty i done told sister adaline hoskins he said to come by here for dat book to morrer mawnin at sebin o clock for to kyar it to de meetin of de bo d of rangements and dat book gwine to be here when she come so uncle bushrod put on his old brown suit got his thick hickory stick and meandered through the almost deserted streets of weymouthville he entered the bank unlocking the side door and found the pass book where he had left it in the little back room used for consultations where he always hung his coat looking about casually he saw that everything was as he had left it and was about to start for home when he was brought to a standstill by the sudden rattle of a key in the front door some one came quickly in closed the door softly and entered the counting room through the door in the iron railing that division of the bank s space was connected with the back room by a narrow passageway now in deep darkness uncle bushrod firmly gripping his hickory stick tiptoed gently up this passage until he could see the midnight intruder into the sacred precincts of the weymouth bank one dim gas jet burned there but even in its nebulous light he perceived at once that the prowler was the bank s president wondering fearful undecided what to do the old coloured man stood motionless in the gloomy strip of hallway and waited developments the vault with its big iron door was opposite him inside that was the safe holding the papers of value the gold and currency of the bank on the floor of the vault was perhaps eighteen thousand dollars in silver the president took his key from his pocket opened the vault and went inside nearly closing the door behind him uncle bushrod saw through the narrow aperture the flicker of a candle in a minute or two it seemed an hour to the watcher mr robert came out bringing with him a large hand satchel handling it in a careful but hurried manner as if fearful that he might be observed with one hand he closed and locked the vault door with a reluctant theory forming itself beneath his wool uncle bushrod waited and watched shaking in his concealing shadow mr robert set the satchel softly upon a desk and turned his coat collar up about his neck and ears he was dressed in a rough suit of gray as if for travelling he glanced with frowning intentness at the big office clock above the burning gas jet and then looked lingeringly about the bank lingeringly and fondly uncle bushrod thought as one who bids farewell to dear and familiar scenes now he caught up his burden again and moved promptly and softly out of the bank by the way he had come locking the front door behind him for a minute or longer uncle bushrod was as stone in his tracks had that midnight rifler of safes and vaults been any other on earth than the man he was the old retainer would have rushed upon him and struck to save the weymouth property but now the watcher s soul was tortured by the poignant dread of something worse than mere robbery he was seized by an accusing terror that said the weymouth name and the weymouth honour were about to be lost marse robert robbing the bank what else could it mean the hour of the night the stealthy visit to the vault the satchel brought forth and with expedition and silence the prowler s rough dress his solicitous reading of the clock and noiseless departure what else could it mean and then to the turmoil of uncle bushrod s thoughts came the corroborating recollection of preceding events mr robert s increasing intemperance and consequent many moods of royal high spirits and stern tempers the casual talk he had heard in the bank of the decrease in business and difficulty in collecting loans what else could it all mean but that mr robert weymouth was an absconder was about to fly with the bank s remaining funds leaving mr william miss letty little nab guy and uncle bushrod to bear the disgrace during one minute uncle bushrod considered these things and then he awoke to sudden determination and action lawd lawd he moaned aloud as he hobbled hastily toward the side door sech a come off after all dese here years of big doin s and fine doin s scan lous sights upon de yearth when de weymouth fambly done turn out robbers and bezzlers time for uncle bushrod to clean out somebody s chicken coop and eben matters up oh lawd marse robert you ain t gwine do dat n miss letty an dem chillun so proud and talkin weymouth weymouth all de time i m gwine to stop you ef i can spec you shoot mr nigger s head off ef he fool wid you but i m gwine stop you ef i can uncle bushrod aided by his hickory stick impeded by his rheumatism hurried down the street toward the railroad station where the two lines touching weymouthville met as he had expected and feared he saw there mr robert standing in the shadow of the building waiting for the train he held the satchel in his hand when uncle bushrod came within twenty yards of the bank president standing like a huge gray ghost by the station wall sudden perturbation seized him the rashness and audacity of the thing he had come to do struck him fully he would have been happy could he have turned and fled from the possibilities of the famous weymouth wrath but again he saw in his fancy the white reproachful face of miss letty and the distressed looks of nan and guy should he fail in his duty and they question him as to his stewardship braced by the thought he approached in a straight line clearing his throat and pounding with his stick so that he might be early recognized thus he might avoid the likely danger of too suddenly surprising the sometimes hasty mr robert is that you bushrod called the clamant clear voice of the gray ghost yes suh marse robert what the devil are you doing out at this time of night for the first time in his life uncle bushrod told marse robert a falsehood he could not repress it he would have to circumlocute a little his nerve was not equal to a direct attack i done been down suh to see ol aunt m ria patterson she taken sick in de night and i kyar ed her a bottle of m lindy s medercine yes suh humph said robert you better get home out of the night air it s damp you ll hardly be worth killing to morrow on account of your rheumatism think it ll be a clear day bushrod i low it will suh de sun sot red las night mr robert lit a cigar in the shadow and the smoke looked like his gray ghost expanding and escaping into the night air somehow uncle bushrod could barely force his reluctant tongue to the dreadful subject he stood awkward shambling with his feet upon the gravel and fumbling with his stick but then afar off three miles away at the jimtown switch he heard the faint whistle of the coming train the one that was to transport the weymouth name into the regions of dishonour and shame all fear left him he took off his hat and faced the chief of the clan he served the great royal kind lofty terrible weymouth he bearded him there at the brink of the awful thing that was about to happen marse robert he began his voice quivering a little with the stress of his feelings you member de day dey all rode de tunnament at oak lawn de day suh dat you win in de ridin and you crown miss lucy de queen tournament said mr robert taking his cigar from his mouth yes i remember very well the but what the deuce are you talking about tournaments here at midnight for go long home bushrod

dem was her words my knight pure and fearless and widout reproach mr robert began to mask as was his habit a tendency to soft heartedness with a spurious anger you you old windbag he growled through a cloud of swirling cigar smoke i believe you are crazy i told you to go home bushrod miss lucy said that did she well we haven t kept the scutcheon very clear two years ago last week wasn t it bushrod when she died confound it are you going to stand there all night gabbing like a coffee coloured gander the train whistled again now it was at the water tank a mile away marse robert said uncle bushrod

don t take away dis er valise if i ever crosses over de jordan what i gwine to say to miss lucy when she ax me uncle bushrod wharfo didn you take good care of mr robert mr robert weymouth threw away his cigar and shook free one arm with that peculiar gesture that always preceded his outbursts of irascibility uncle bushrod bowed his head to the expected storm but he did not flinch if the house of weymouth was to fall he would fall with it the banker spoke and uncle bushrod blinked with surprise the storm was there but it was suppressed to the quietness of a summer breeze bushrod said mr robert in a lower voice than he usually employed you have overstepped all bounds you have presumed upon the leniency with which you have been treated to meddle unpardonably so you know what is in this satchel your long and faithful service is some excuse but go home bushrod not another word but bushrod grasped the satchel with a firmer hand the headlight of the train was now lightening the shadows about the station the roar was increasing and folks were stirring about at the track side marse robert gimme dis er valise i got a right suh to talk to you dis er way i slaved for you and tended to

er loose marse robert the train was standing at the station some men were pushing trucks along the side two or three sleepy passengers got off and wandered away into the night the conductor stepped to the gravel swung his lantern and called hello frank at some one invisible the bell clanged the brakes hissed the conductor drawled all aboard mr robert released his hold on the satchel uncle bushrod hugged it to his breast with both arms as a lover clasps his first beloved take it back with you bushrod said mr robert thrusting his hands into his pockets and let the subject drop now mind you ve said quite enough i m going to take the train tell mr william i will be back on saturday good night the banker climbed the steps of the moving train and disappeared in a coach uncle bushrod stood motionless still embracing the precious satchel his eyes were closed and his lips were moving in thanks to the master above for the salvation of the weymouth honour he knew mr robert would return when he said he would the weymouths never lied nor now thank the lord could it be said that they embezzled the money in banks then awake to the necessity for further guardianship of weymouth trust funds the old man started for the bank with the redeemed satchel three hours from weymouthville in the gray dawn mr robert alighted from the train at a lonely flag station dimly he could see the figure of a man waiting on the platform and the shape of a spring waggon team and driver half a dozen lengthy bamboo fishing poles projected from the waggon s rear you re here bob said judge archinard mr robert s old friend and schoolmate it s going to be a royal day for fishing i thought you said why didn t you bring along the stuff the president of the weymouth bank took off his hat and rumpled his gray locks well ben to tell you the truth there s an infernally presumptuous old nigger belonging in my family that broke up the arrangement he came down to the depot and vetoed the whole proceeding he means all right and well i reckon he is right somehow he had found out what i had along though i hid it in the bank vault and sneaked it out at midnight i reckon he has noticed that i ve been indulging a little more than a gentleman should and he laid for me with some reaching arguments i m going to quit drinking mr robert concluded i ve come to the conclusion that a man can t keep it up and be quite what he d like to be pure and fearless and without reproach that s the way old bushrod quoted it well i ll have to admit said the judge thoughtfully as they climbed into the waggon that the old darkey s argument can t conscientiously be overruled still said mr robert with a ghost of a sigh there was two quarts of the finest old silk velvet bourbon in that satchel you ever wet your lips with the discounters of money the spectacle of the money caliphs of the present day going about bagdad on the subway trying to relieve the wants of the people is enough to make the great al raschid turn haroun in his grave if not so then the assertion should do so the real caliph having been a wit and a scholar and therefore a hater of puns how properly to alleviate the troubles of the poor is one of the greatest troubles of the rich but one thing agreed upon by all professional philanthropists is that you must never hand over any cash to your subject the poor are notoriously temperamental and when they get money they exhibit a strong tendency to spend it for stuffed olives and enlarged crayon portraits instead of giving it to the instalment man and still old haroun had some advantages as an eleemosynarian he took around with him on his rambles his vizier giafar a vizier is a composite of a chauffeur a secretary of state and a night and day bank and old uncle mesrour his executioner who toted a snickersnee with this entourage a caliphing tour could hardly fail to be successful have you noticed lately any newspaper articles headed what shall we do with our ex presidents well now suppose that mr carnegie could engage him and joe gans to go about assisting in the distribution of free libraries do you suppose any town would have had the hardihood to refuse one that caliphalous combination would cause two libraries to grow where there had been only one set of e p roe s works before but as i said the money caliphs are handicapped they have the idea that earth has no sorrow that dough cannot heal and they rely upon it solely al raschid administered justice rewarding the deserving and punished whomsoever he disliked on the spot he was the originator of the short story contest whenever he succoured any chance pick up in the bazaars he always made the succouree tell the sad story of his life if the narrative lacked construction style and esprit he commanded his vizier to dole him out a couple of thousand ten dollar notes of the first national bank of the bosphorus or else gave him a soft job as keeper of the bird seed for the bulbuls in the imperial gardens if the story was a cracker jack he had mesrour the executioner whack of his head the report that haroun al raschid is yet alive and is editing the magazine that your grandmother used to subscribe for lacks confirmation and now follows the story of the millionaire the inefficacious increment and the babes drawn from the wood young howard pilkins the millionaire got his money ornithologically he was a shrewd judge of storks and got in on the ground floor at the residence of his immediate ancestors the pilkins brewing company for his mother was a partner in the business finally old man pilkins died from a torpid liver and then mrs pilkins died from worry on account of torpid delivery waggons and there you have young howard pilkins with and a good fellow at that he was an agreeable modestly arrogant young man who implicitly believed that money could buy anything that the world had to offer and bagdad on the subway for a long time did everything possible to encourage his belief but the rat trap caught him at last he heard the spring snap and found his heart in a wire cage regarding a piece of cheese whose other name was alice von der ruysling the von der ruyslings still live in that little square about which so much has been said and in which so little has been done to day you hear of mr tilden s underground passage and you hear mr gould s elevated passage and that about ends the noise in the world made by gramercy square but once it was different the von der ruyslings live there yet and they received the first key ever made to gramercy park you shall have no description of alice v d r just call up in your mind the picture of your own maggie or vera or beatrice straighten her nose soften her voice tone her down and then tone her up make her beautiful and unattainable and you have a faint dry point etching of alice the family owned a crumbly brick house and a coachman named joseph in a coat of many colours and a horse so old that he claimed to belong to the order of the perissodactyla and had toes instead of hoofs in the year the family had to buy a new set of harness for their perissodactyl before using it they made joseph smear it over with a mixture of ashes and soot it was the von der ruysling family that bought the territory between the bowery and east river and rivington street and the statue of liberty in the year from an indian chief for a quart of passementerie and a pair of turkey red portieres designed for a harlem flat i have always admired that indian s perspicacity and good taste all this is merely to convince you that the von der ruyslings were exactly the kind of poor aristocrats that turn down their noses at people who have money oh well i don t mean that i mean people who have just money one evening pilkins went down to the red brick house in gramercy square and made what he thought was a proposal to alice v d r alice with her nose turned down and thinking of his money considered it a proposition and refused it and him pilkins summoning all his resources as any good general would have done made an indiscreet references to the advantages that his money would provide that settled it the lady turned so cold that walter wellman himself would have waited until spring to make a dash for her in a dog sled but pilkins was something of a sport himself you can t fool all the millionaires every time the ball drops on the western union building if at any time he said to a v d r you feel that you would like to reconsider your answer send me a rose like that pilkins audaciously touched a jacque rose that she wore loosely in her hair very well said she and when i do you will understand by it that either you or i have learned something new about the purchasing power of money you ve been spoiled my friend no i don t think i could marry you to morrow i will send you back the presents you have given me presents said pilkins in surprise i never gave you a present in my life i would like to see a full length portrait of the man that you would take a present from why you never would let me send you flowers or candy or even art calendars you ve forgotten said alice v d r with a little smile it was a long time ago when our families were neighbours you were seven and i was trundling my doll on the sidewalk you have me a little gray hairy kitten with shoe buttony eyes its head came off and it was full of candy you paid five cents for it you told me so i haven t the candy to return to you i hadn t developed a conscience at three so i ate it but i have the kitten yet and i will wrap it up neatly to night and send it to you to morrow beneath the lightness of alice v d r s talk the steadfastness of her rejection showed firm and plain so there was nothing left for him but to leave the crumbly red brick house and be off with his abhorred millions on his way back pilkins walked through madison square the hour hand of the clock hung about eight the air was stingingly cool but not at the freezing point the dim little square seemed like a great cold unroofed room with its four walls of houses spangled with thousands of insufficient lights only a few loiterers were huddled here and there on the benches but suddenly pilkins came upon a youth sitting brave and as if conflicting with summer sultriness coatless his white shirt sleeves conspicuous in the light from the globe of an electric close to his side was a girl smiling dreamy happy around her shoulders was palpably the missing coat of the cold defying youth it appeared to be a modern panorama of the babes in the wood revised and brought up to date with the exception that the robins hadn t turned up yet with the protecting leaves with delight the money caliphs view a situation that they think is relievable while you wait pilkins sat on the bench one seat removed from the youth he glanced cautiously and saw as men do see and women oh never can that they were of the same order pilkins leaned over after a short time and spoke to the youth who answered smilingly and courteously from general topics the conversation concentrated to the bed rock of grim personalities but pilkins did it as delicately and heartily as any caliph could have done and when it came to the point the youth turned to him soft voiced and with his undiminished smile i don t want to seem unappreciative old man he said with a youth s somewhat too early spontaneity of address but you see i can t accept anything from a stranger i know you re all right and i m tremendously obliged but i couldn t think of borrowing from anybody you see i m marcus clayton the claytons of roanoke county virginia you know the young lady is miss eva bedford i reckon you ve heard of the bedfords she s seventeen and one of the bedfords of bedford county we ve eloped from home to get married and we wanted to see new york we got in this afternoon somebody got my pocketbook on the ferry boat and i had only three cents in change outside of it i ll get some work somewhere to morrow and we ll get married but i say old man said pilkins in confidential low tones you can t keep the lady out here in the cold all night now as for hotels i told you said the youth with a broader smile that i didn t have but three cents besides if i had a thousand we d have to wait here until morning you can understand that of course i m much obliged but i can t take any of your money miss bedford and i have lived an outdoor life and we don t mind a little cold i ll get work of some kind to morrow we ve got a paper bag of cakes and chocolates and we ll get along all right listen said the millionaire impressively my name is pilkins and i m worth several million dollars i happen to have in my pockets about or in cash don t you think you are drawing it rather fine when you decline to accept as much of it as will make you and the young lady comfortable at least for the night i can t say sir that i do think so said clayton of roanoke county i ve been raised to look at such things differently but i m mightily obliged to you just the same then you force me to say good night said the millionaire twice that day had his money been scorned by simple ones to whom his dollars had appeared as but tin tobacco tags he was no worshipper of the actual minted coin or stamped paper but he had always believed in its almost unlimited power to purchase pilkins walked away rapidly and then turned abruptly and returned to the bench where the young couple sat he took off his hat and began to speak the girl looked at him with the same sprightly glowing interest that she had been giving to the lights and statuary and sky reaching buildings that made the old square seem so far away from bedford county mr er roanoke said pilkins i admire your your indepen your idiocy so much that i m going to appeal to your chivalry i believe that s what you southerners call it when you keep a lady sitting outdoors on a bench on a cold night just to keep your old out of date pride going now i ve a friend a lady whom i have known all my life who lives a few blocks from here with her parents and sisters and aunts and all that kind of endorsement of course i am sure this lady would be happy and pleased to put up that is to have miss er bedford give her the pleasure of having her as a guest for the night don t you think mr roanoke of er virginie that you could unbend your prejudices that far clayton of roanoke rose and held out his hand old man he said miss bedford will be much pleased to accept the hospitality of the lady you refer to he formally introduced mr pilkins to miss bedford the girl looked at him sweetly and comfortably it s a lovely evening mr pilkins don t you think so she said slowly pilkins conducted them to the crumbly red brick house of the von der ruyslings his card brought alice downstairs wondering the runaways were sent into the drawing room while pilkins told alice all about it in the hall of course i will take her in said alice haven t those southern girls a thoroughbred air of course she will stay here you will look after mr clayton of course will i said pilkins delightedly oh yes i ll look after him as a citizen of new york and therefore a part owner of its public parks i m going to extend to him the hospitality of madison square to night he s going to sit there on a bench till morning there s no use arguing with him isn t he wonderful i m glad you ll look after the little lady alice i tell you those babes in the wood made my that is er made wall street and the bank of england look like penny arcades miss von der ruysling whisked miss bedford of bedford county up to restful regions upstairs when she came down she put an oblong small pasteboard box into pilkins hands your present she said that i am returning to you oh yes i remember said pilkins with a sigh the woolly kitten he left clayton on a park bench and shook hands with him heartily after i get work said the youth i ll look you up your address is on your card isn t it thanks well good night i m awfully obliged to you for your kindness no thanks i don t smoke good night in his room pilkins opened the box and took out the staring funny kitten long ago ravaged of his candy and minus one shoe button eye pilkins looked at it sorrowfully after all he said i don t believe that just money alone will and then he gave a shout and dug into the bottom of the box for something else that had been the kitten s resting place a crushed but red red fragrant glorious promising jacqueminot rose the enchanted profile there are few caliphesses women are scheherazades by birth predilection instinct and arrangement of the vocal cords the thousand and one stories are being told every day by hundreds of thousands of viziers daughters to their respective sultans but the bowstring will get some of em yet if they don t watch out i heard a story though of one lady caliph it isn t precisely an arabian nights story because it brings in cinderella who flourished her dishrag in another epoch and country so if you don t mind the mixed dates which seem to give it an eastern flavour after all we ll get along in new york there is an old old hotel you have seen woodcuts of it in the magazines it was built let s see at a time when there was nothing above fourteenth street except the old indian trail to boston and hammerstein s office soon the old hostelry will be torn down and as the stout walls are riven apart and the bricks go roaring down the chutes crowds of citizens will gather at the nearest corners and weep over the destruction of a dear old landmark civic pride is strongest in new bagdad and the wettest weeper and the loudest howler against the iconoclasts will be the man originally from terre haute whose fond memories of the old hotel are limited to his having been kicked out from its free lunch counter in at this hotel always stopped mrs maggie brown mrs brown was a bony woman of sixty dressed in the rustiest black and carrying a handbag made apparently from the hide of the original animal that adam decided to call an alligator she always occupied a small parlour and bedroom at the top of the hotel at a rental of two dollars per day and always while she was there each day came hurrying to see her many men sharp faced anxious looking with only seconds to spare for maggie brown was said to be the third richest woman in the world and these solicitous gentlemen were only the city s wealthiest brokers and business men seeking trifling loans of half a dozen millions or so from the dingy old lady with the prehistoric handbag the stenographer and typewriter of the acropolis hotel there i ve let the name of it out was miss ida bates she was a hold over from the greek classics there wasn t a flaw in her looks some old timer paying his regards to a lady said to have loved her was a liberal education well even to have looked over the black hair and neat white shirtwaist of miss bates was equal to a full course in any correspondence school in the country she sometimes did a little typewriting for me and as she refused to take the money in advance she came to look upon me as something of a friend and protege she had unfailing kindliness and a good nature and not even a white lead drummer or a fur importer had ever dared to cross the dead line of good behaviour in her presence the entire force of the acropolis from the owner who lived in vienna down to the head porter who had been bedridden for sixteen years would have sprung to her defence in a moment one day i walked past miss bates s little sanctum remingtorium and saw in her place a black haired unit unmistakably a person pounding with each of her forefingers upon the keys musing on the mutability of temporal affairs i passed on the next day i went on a two weeks vacation returning i strolled through the lobby of the acropolis and saw with a little warm glow of auld lang syne miss bates as grecian and kind and flawless as ever just putting the cover on her machine the hour for closing had come but she asked me in to sit for a few minutes on the dictation chair miss bates explained her absence from and return to the acropolis hotel in words identical with or similar to these following well man how are the stories coming pretty regularly said i about equal to their going i m sorry said she good typewriting is the main thing in a story you ve missed me haven t you no one said i whom i have ever known knows as well as you do how to space properly belt buckles semi colons hotel guests and hairpins but you ve been away too i saw a package of peppermint pepsin in your place the other day i was going to tell you all about it said miss bates if you hadn t interrupted me of course you know about maggie brown who stops here well she s worth she lives in jersey in a ten dollar flat she s always got more cash on hand than half a dozen business candidates for vice president i don t know whether she carries it in her stocking or not but i know she s mighty popular down in the part of town where they worship the golden calf well about two weeks ago mrs brown stops at the door and rubbers at me for ten minutes i m sitting with my side to her striking off some manifold copies of a copper mine proposition for a nice old man from tonopah but i always see everything all around me when i m hard at work i can see things through my side combs and i can leave one button unbuttoned in the back of my shirtwaist and see who s behind me i didn t look around because i make from eighteen to twenty dollars a week and i didn t have to that evening at knocking off time she sends for me to come up to her apartment i expected to have to typewrite about two thousand words of notes of hand liens and contracts with a ten cent tip in sight but i went well man i was certainly surprised old maggie brown had turned human child says she you re the most beautiful creature i ever saw in my life i want you to quit your work and come and live with me i ve no kith or kin says she except a husband and a son or two and i hold no communication with any of em they re extravagant burdens on a hard working woman i want you to be a daughter to me they say i m stingy and mean and the papers print lies about my doing my own cooking and washing it s a lie she goes on i put my washing out except the handkerchiefs and stockings and petticoats and collars and light stuff like that i ve got forty million dollars in cash and stocks and bonds that are as negotiable as standard oil preferred at a church fair i m a lonely old woman and i need companionship you re the most beautiful human being i ever saw says she will you come and live with me i ll show em whether i can spend money or not she says well man what would you have done of course i fell to it and to tell you the truth i began to like old maggie it wasn t all on account of the forty millions and what she could do for me i was kind of lonesome in the world too everybody s got to have somebody they can explain to about the pain in their left shoulder and how fast patent leather shoes wear out when they begin to crack and you can t talk about such things to men you meet in hotels they re looking for just such openings so i gave up my job in the hotel and went with mrs brown i certainly seemed to have a mash on her she d look at me for half an hour at a time when i was sitting reading or looking at the magazines one time i says to her do i remind you of some deceased relative or friend of your childhood mrs brown i ve noticed you give me a pretty good optical inspection from time to time you have a face she says exactly like a dear friend of mine the best friend i ever had but i like you for yourself child too she says and say man what do you suppose she did loosened up like a marcel wave in the surf at coney she took me to a swell dressmaker and gave her a la carte to fit me out money no object they were rush orders and madame locked the front door and put the whole force to work then we moved to where do you think no guess again that s right the hotel bonton we had a six room apartment and it cost a day i saw the bill i began to love that old lady and then man when my dresses began to come in oh i won t tell you about em you couldn t understand and i began to call her aunt maggie you ve read about cinderella of course well what cinderella said when the prince fitted that a on her foot was a hard luck story compared to the things i told myself then aunt maggie says she is going to give me a coming out banquet in the bonton that ll make moving vans of all the old dutch families on fifth avenue i ve been out before aunt maggie says i but i ll come out again but you know says i that this is one of the swellest hotels in the city and you know pardon me that it s hard to get a bunch of notables together unless you ve trained for it don t fret about that child says aunt maggie i don t send out invitations i issue orders i ll have fifty guests here that couldn t be brought together again at any reception unless it were given by king edward or william travers jerome they are men of course and all of em either owe me money or intend to some of their wives won t come but a good many will well i wish you could have been at that banquet the dinner service was all gold and cut glass there were about forty men and eight ladies present besides aunt maggie and i you d never have known the third richest woman in the world she had on a new black silk dress with so much passementerie on it that it sounded exactly like a hailstorm i heard once when i was staying all night with a girl that lived in a top floor studio and my dress say man i can t waste the words on you it was all hand made lace where there was any of it at all and it cost i saw the bill the men were all bald headed or white whiskered and they kept up a running fire of light repartee about per cents and bryan and the cotton crop on the left of me was something that talked like a banker and on my right was a young fellow who said he was a newspaper artist he was the only well i was going to tell you after the dinner was over mrs brown and i went up to the apartment we had to squeeze our way through a mob of reporters all the way through the halls that s one of the things money does for you say do you happen to know a newspaper artist named lathrop a tall man with nice eyes and an easy way of talking no i don t remember what paper he works on well all right when we got upstairs mrs brown telephones for the bill right away it came and it was i saw the bill aunt maggie fainted i got her on a lounge and opened the bead work child says she when she got back to the world what was it a raise of rent or an income tax just a little dinner says i nothing to worry about hardly a drop in the bucket shop sit up and take notice a dispossess notice if there s no other kind but say man do you know what aunt maggie did she got cold feet she hustled me out of that hotel bonton at nine the next morning we went to a rooming house on the lower west side she rented one room that had water on the floor below and light on the floor above after we got moved all you could see in the room was about worth of new swell dresses and a one burner gas stove aunt maggie had had a sudden attack of the hedges i guess everybody has got to go on a spree once in their life a man spends his on highballs and a woman gets woozy on clothes but with forty million dollars say i d like to have a picture of but speaking of pictures did you ever run across a newspaper artist named lathrop a tall oh i asked you that before didn

the burning gas jet and then looked lingeringly about the bank lingeringly and fondly uncle bushrod thought as one who bids farewell to dear and familiar scenes now he caught up his burden again and moved promptly and softly out of the bank by the way he had come locking the front door behind him for a minute or longer uncle bushrod was as stone in his tracks had that midnight rifler of safes and vaults been any other on earth than the man he was the old retainer would have rushed upon him and struck to save the weymouth property but now the watcher s soul was tortured by the poignant dread of something worse than mere robbery he was seized by an accusing terror that said the weymouth name and the weymouth honour were about to be lost marse robert robbing the bank what else could it mean the hour of the night the stealthy visit to the vault the satchel brought forth and with expedition and silence the prowler s rough dress his solicitous reading of the clock and noiseless departure what else could it mean and then to the turmoil of uncle bushrod s thoughts came the corroborating recollection of preceding events mr robert s increasing intemperance and consequent many moods of royal high spirits and stern tempers the casual talk he had heard in the bank of the decrease in business and difficulty in collecting loans what else could it all mean but that mr robert weymouth was an absconder was about to fly with the bank s remaining funds leaving mr william miss letty little nab guy and uncle bushrod to bear the disgrace during one minute uncle bushrod considered these things and then he awoke to sudden determination and action lawd lawd he moaned aloud as he hobbled hastily toward the side door sech a come off after all dese here years of big doin s and fine doin s scan lous sights upon de yearth when de weymouth fambly done turn out robbers and bezzlers time for uncle bushrod to clean out somebody s chicken coop and eben matters up oh lawd marse robert you ain t gwine do dat n miss letty an dem chillun so proud and talkin weymouth weymouth all de time i m gwine to stop you ef i can spec you shoot mr nigger s head off ef he fool wid you but i m gwine stop you ef i can uncle bushrod aided by his hickory stick impeded by his rheumatism hurried down the street toward the railroad station where the two lines touching weymouthville met as he had expected and feared he saw there mr robert standing in the shadow of the building waiting for the train he held the satchel in his hand when uncle bushrod came within twenty yards of the bank president standing like a huge gray ghost by the station wall sudden perturbation seized him the rashness and audacity of the thing he had come to do struck him fully he would have been happy could he have turned and fled from the possibilities of the famous weymouth wrath but again he saw in his fancy the white reproachful face of miss letty and the distressed looks of nan and guy should he fail in his duty and they question him as to his stewardship braced by the thought he approached in a straight line clearing his throat and pounding with his stick so that he might be early recognized thus he might avoid the likely danger of too suddenly surprising the sometimes hasty mr robert is that you bushrod called the clamant clear voice of the gray ghost yes suh marse robert what the devil are you doing out at this time of night for the first time in his life uncle bushrod told marse robert a falsehood he could not repress it he would have to circumlocute a little his nerve was not equal to a

shadow and the smoke looked like his gray ghost expanding and escaping into the night air somehow uncle bushrod could barely force his reluctant tongue to the dreadful subject he stood awkward shambling with his feet upon the gravel and fumbling with his stick but then afar off three miles away at the jimtown switch he heard the faint whistle of the coming train the one that was to transport the weymouth name into the regions of dishonour and shame all fear left him he took off his hat and faced the chief of the clan he served the great royal kind lofty terrible weymouth he bearded him there at the brink of the awful thing that was about to happen marse robert he began his voice quivering a little with the stress of his feelings you member de day dey all rode de tunnament at oak lawn de day suh dat you win in de ridin and you crown miss lucy de queen tournament said mr robert taking his cigar from his mouth yes i remember very well the but what the deuce are

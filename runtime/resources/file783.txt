the rocks then the pack train fording the stream attacked the sudden ascent and bade adieu to such civilization as the coast afforded for weeks armstrong guided by luis followed his regular route among the mountains after he had col lected an arroba of the precious metal winning a profit of nearly the heads of the lightened mules were turned down trail again where the head of the guarico river springs from a great gash in the mountain side luis halted the train half a day s journey from here se or said he is the village of tacuzama which we have never visited i think many ounces of gold may be procured there it is worth the trial armstrong concurred and they turned again upward toward tacuzama the trail was abrupt and precipi tous mounting through a dense forest as night fell dark and gloomy luis once more halted before them was a black chasm bisecting the path as far as they could see luis dismounted there should be a bridge he called and ran along the cleft a distance it is here he cried and remounting led the way in a few moments armstrong heard a sound as though a thunderous drum were beating somewhere in the dark it was the falling of the mules hoofs upon the bridge made of strong hides lashed to poles and stretched across the chasm half a mile further was tacuzama the village was a congre gation of rock and mud huts set in the profundity of an obscure wood as they rode in a sound inconsistent with that brooding solitude met their ears from a long low mud hut that they were nearing rose the glorious voice of a woman in song the words were english the air familiar to armstrong s memory but not to his musical knowledge he slipped from his mule and stole to a narrow window in one end of the house peering cautiously inside he saw within three feet of him a woman of marvellous imposing beauty clothed in a splendid loose robe of leopard skins the hut was packed close to the small space in which she stood with the squatting figures of indians the woman finished her song and seated herself close to the little window as if grateful for the unpolluted air that entered it when she had ceased several of the audience rose and cast little softly falling bags at her feet a harsh murmur no doubt a barbarous kind of applause and comment went through the grim assembly armstrong was used to seizing opportunities promptly taking advantage of the noise he called to the woman in a low but distinct voice do not turn your head this way but listen i am an american if you need assistance tell me how i can render it answer as briefly as you can the woman was worthy of his boldness only by a sudden flush of her pale cheek did she acknowledge understanding of his words then she spoke scarcely moving her lips i am held a prisoner by these indians god knows i need help in two hours come to the little hut twenty yards toward the mountainside there will be a light and a red curtain in the window there is always a guard at the door whom you will have to overcome for the love of heaven do not fail to come the story seems to shrink from adventure and rescue and mystery the theme is one too gentle for those brave and quickening tones and yet it reaches as far back as time itself it has been named environment which is as weak a word as any to express the unnameable kinship of man to nature that queer fraternity that causes stones and trees and salt water and clouds to play upon our emotions why are we made serious and solemn and sublime by mountain heights grave and contempla tive by an abundance of overhanging trees reduced to inconstancy and monkey capers by the ripples on a sandy beach did the protoplasm but enough the chem ists are looking into the matter and before long they will have all life in the table of the symbols briefly then in order to confine the story within scientific bounds john armstrong went to the hut choked the indian guard and carried away mlle giraud with her was also conveyed a number of pounds of gold dust she had collected during her six months forced engage ment in tacuzama the carabobo indians are easily the most enthusiastic lovers of music between the equator and the french opera house in new orleans they are also strong believers that the advice of emerson was good when he said the thing thou wantest discon tented man take it and pay the price a number of them had attended the performance of the alcazar opera company in macuto and found mlle giraud s style and technique satisfactory they wanted her so they took her one evening suddenly and without any fuss they treated her with much consideration exacting only one song recital each day she was quite pleased at being rescued by mr armstrong so much for mystery and adventure now to resume the theory of the proto plasm john armstrong and mlle giraud rode among the andean peaks enveloped in their greatness and sublimity the mightiest cousins furthest removed in nature s great family become conscious of the tie among those huge piles of primordial upheaval amid those gigantic silences and elongated fields of distance the littlenesses of men are precipitated as one chemical throws down a sediment from another they moved reverently as in a temple their souls were uplifted in unison with the stately heights they travelled in a zone of majesty and peace to armstrong the woman seemed almost a holy thing yet bathed in the white still dignity of her martyrdom that purified her earthly beauty and gave out it seemed

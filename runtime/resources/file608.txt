a tank filled with real water a few was down on the sands enjoyin the moonlight and the water and the heart of me was heavy for the new morals of the old island while the bands behind me played and the sea pounded on the bass drum in front and directly i got up and walked along the old pavilion and there on the other side of half in the dark was a slip of a girl sittin on the tumble down timbers and unless i m a liar she was cryin by herself there all alone is it trouble you are in now miss says i and what s to be done about it tis none of your business at all denny carnahan says she sittin up straight and it was the voice of no other than norah flynn then it s not says i and we re after having a pleasant evening miss flynn have ye seen the sights of this new coney island then i presume ye have come here for that purpose says i i have says she me mother and uncle tim they are waiting beyond tis an elegant evening i ve had i ve seen all the attractions that be right ye are says i to norah and i don t know when i ve been that amused after disportin me self among the most laughable moral improvements of the revised shell games i took meself to the shore for the benefit of the cool air and did ye observe the durbar miss flynn i did says she reflectin but tis not safe i m thinkin to ride down them slantin things into the water how did ye fancy the shoot the chutes i asks true then i m afraid of guns says norah they make such noise in my ears but uncle tim he shot them he did and won cigars tis a fine time we had this day mr carnahan i m glad you ve enjoyed yerself i says i suppose you ve had a roarin fine time seein the sights and how did the incubators and the helter skelter and the midgets suit the taste of ye i i wasn t hungry says norah faint but mother ate a quantity of all of em i m that pleased with the fine things in the new coney island says she that it s the happiest day i ve seen in a long time at all did you see venice says i we did says she she was a beauty she was all dressed in red she was with i listened no more to norah flynn i stepped up and i gathered her in my arms tis a story teller ye are norah flynn says i ye ve seen no more of the greater coney island than i have meself come now tell the truth ye came to sit by the old pavilion by the waves where you sat last summer and made dennis carnahan a happy man speak up and tell the truth norah stuck her nose against me vest i despise it denny she says half cryin mother and uncle tim went to see the shows but i came down here to think of you i couldn t bear the lights and the crowd are you forgivin me denny for the words we had twas me fault says i i came here for the same reason meself look at the lights norah i says turning my back to the sea ain t they pretty they are says norah with her eyes shinin and do ye hear the bands playin oh denny i think i d like to see it all the old coney is gone darlin i says to her everything moves when a man s glad it s not scenes of sadness he wants tis a greater coney we have here but we couldn t see it till we got in the humour for it next sunday norah darlin we ll see the new place from end to end law and order i found myself in texas recently revisiting old places and vistas at a sheep ranch where i had sojourned many years ago i stopped for a week and as all visitors do i heartily plunged into the business at hand which happened to be that of dipping the sheep now this process is so different from ordinary human baptism that it deserves a word of itself a vast iron cauldron with half the fires of avernus beneath it is partly filled with water that soon boils furiously into that is cast concentrated lye lime and sulphur which is allowed to stew and fume until the witches broth is strong enough to scorch the third arm of palladino herself then this concentrated brew is mixed in a long deep vat with cubic gallons of hot water and the sheep are caught by their hind legs and flung into the compound after being thoroughly ducked by means of a forked pole in the hands of a gentleman detailed for that purpose they are allowed to clamber up an incline into a corral and dry or die as the state of their constitutions may decree if you ever caught an able bodied two year old mutton by the hind legs and felt the volts of kicking that he can send though your arm seventeen times before you can hurl him into the vat you will of course hope that he may die instead of dry but this is merely to explain why bud oakley and i gladly stretched ourselves on the bank of the nearby charco after the dipping glad for the welcome inanition and pure contact with the earth after our muscle racking labours the flock was a small one and we finished at three in the afternoon so bud brought from the morral on his saddle horn coffee and a coffeepot and a big hunk of bread and

world was derived from inference and by inspiration of such is the precious small group of essayists made whle she talked to me i kept brushing my fingers trying unconsciously to rid them guiltily of the absent dust from the half calf backs of lamb chaucer hazlitt marcus aurelius montaigne and hood she was exquisite she was a valuable discovery nearly everybody nowadays knows too much oh so much too much of real life i could perceive clearly that azalea adair was very poor a house and a dress she had not much else i fancied so divided between my duty to the magazine and my loyalty to the poets and essayists who fought thomas in the valley of the cumberland i listened to her voice which was like a harpsichord s and found that i could not speak of contracts in the presence of the nine muses and the three graces one hesitated to lower the topic to two cents there would have to be another colloquy after i had regained my commercialism but i spoke of my mission and three o clock of the next afternoon was set for the discussion of the business proposition your town i said as i began to make ready to depart which is the time for smooth generalities seems to be a quiet sedate place a home town i should say where few things out of the ordinary ever happen it carries on an extensive trade in stoves and hollow ware with the west and south and its flouring mills have a daily capacity of more than barrels azalea adair seemed to reflect i have never thought of it that way she said with a kind of sincere intensity that seemed to belong to her isn t it in the still quiet places that things do happen i fancy that when god began to create the earth on the first monday morning one could have leaned out one s window and heard the drops of mud splashing from his trowel as he built up the everlasting hills what did the noisiest project in the world i mean the building of the tower of bable result in finally a page and a half of esperanto in the north american review of course said i platitudinously human nature is the same everywhere but there is more color er more drama and movement and er romance in some cities than in others on the surface said azalea adair i have traveled many times around the world in a golden airship wafted on two wings print and dreams i have seen on one of my imaginary tours the sultan of turkey bowstring with his own hands one of his wives who had uncovered her face in public i have seen a man in nashville tear up his theatre tickets because his wife was going out with her face covered with rice powder in san francisco s chinatown i saw the slave girl sing yee dipped slowly inch by inch in boiling almond oil to make her swear she would never see her american lover again she gave in when the boiling oil had reached three inches above her knee at a euchre party in east nashville the other night i saw kitty morgan cut dead by seven of her schoolmates and lifelong friends because she had married a house painter the boiling oil was sizzling as high as her heart but i wish you could have seen the fine little smile that she carried from table to table oh yes it is a humdrum town just a few miles of red brick houses and mud and lumber yards some one knocked hollowly at the back of the house azalea adair breathed a soft apology and went to investigate the sound she came back in three minutes with brightened eyes a faint flush on her cheeks and ten years lifted from her shoulders you must have a cup of tea before you go she said and a sugar cake she reached and shook a little iron bell in shuffled a small negro girl about twelve barefoot not very tidy glowering at me with thumb in mouth and bulging eyes azlea adair opened a tiny worn purse and drew out a dollar bill a dollar bill with the upper right hand corner missing torn in two pieces and pasted together again with a strip of blue tissue paper it was one of the bills i had given the piratical negro there was no doubt about it go up to mr baker s store on the corner impy she said handing the girl the dollar bill and get a quarter of a pound of tea the kind he always sends me and ten cents worth of sugar cakes now hurry the supply of tea in the house happens to be exhausted she explained to me impy left by the back way before the scrape of her hard bare feet had died away on the back porch a wild shriek i was sure it was hers filled the hollow house then the deep gruff tones of an angry man s voice mingled with the girl s further squeals and unintelligible words azalea adair rose without surprise or emotion and disappeared for two minutes i heard the hoarse rumble of the man s voice then someting like an oath and a slight scuffle and she returned calmly to her chair this is a roomy house she said and i have a tenant for part of it i am sorry to have to rescind my invitation to tea it was impossible to get the kind i always use at the store perhaps to morrow mr baker will be able to supply me i was sure that impy had not had time to leave the house i inquired concerning street car lines and took my leave after i was well on my way i remembered that i had not learned azalea adair s name but to morrow would do that same day i started in on the course of iniquity that this uneventful city forced upon me i was in the town only two days but in that time i managed to lie shamelessly by telegraph and to be an accomplice after the fact if that is the correct legal term to a murder as i rounded the corner nearest my hotel the afrite coachman of the ploychromatic nonpareil coat seized me swung open the dungeony door of his peripatetic sarcophagus flirted his feather duster and began his ritual step right in boss carriage is clean jus got back from a funeral fifty cents to any and then he knew me and grinned broadly scuse me boss you is de gen l man what rid out with me dis mawnin thank you kindly suh i am going out to again to morrow afternoon at three said i and if you will be here i ll let you drive me so you know miss adair i concluded thinking of my dollar bill i belonged to her father judge adair suh he replied i judge that she is pretty poor i said she hasn t much money to speak of has she for an instant i looked again at the fierce countenance of king cettiwayo and then he changed back to an extortionate old negro hack driver she ain t gwine to starve suh he said slowly she has reso ces suh she has reso ces i shall pay you fifty cents for the trip said i dat is puffeckly correct suh he answered humbly i jus had to have dat two dollars dis mawnin boss i went to the hotel and lied by electricity i wired the magazine a adair holds out for eight cents a word the answer that came back was give it to her quick you duffer just before dinner major wentworth caswell bore down upon me with the greetings of a long lost friend i have seen few men whom i have so instantaneously hated and of whom it was so difficult to be rid i was standing at the bar when he invaded me therefore i could not wave the white ribbon in his face i would have paid gladly for the drinks hoping thereby to escape another but he was one of those despicable roaring advertising bibbers who must have brass bands and fireworks attend upon every cent that they waste in their follies with an air of producing millions he drew two one dollar bills from a pocket and dashed one of them upon the bar i looked once more at the dollar bill with the upper right hand corner missing torn through the middle and patched with a strip of blue tissue paper it was my dollar bill again it could have been no other i went up to my room the drizzle and the monotony of a dreary eventless southern town had made me tired and listless i remember that just before i went to bed i mentally disposed of the mysterious dollar bill which might have formed the clew to a tremendously fine detective story of san francisco by saying to myself sleepily seems as if a lot of people here own stock in the hack driver s trust pays dividends promptly too wonder if then i fell asleep king cettiwayo was at his post the next day and rattled my bones over the stones out to he was to wait and rattle me back again when i was ready azalea adair looked paler and cleaner and frailer than she had looked on the day before after she had signed the contract at eight cents per word she grew still paler and began to slip out of her chair whitout much trouble i managed to get her up on the antediluvian horsehair sofa and then i ran out to the sidewalk and yelled to the coffee colored pirate to bring a doctor with a wisdom that i had not expected in him he abandoned his team and struck off up the street afoot realizing the value of speed in ten minutes he returned with a grave gray haired and capable man of medicine in a few words worth much less than eight cents each i explained to him my presence in the hollow house of mystery he bowed with stately understanding and turned to the old negro uncle caesar he said calmly run up to my house and ask miss lucy to give you a cream pitcher full of fresh milk and half a tumbler of port wine and hurry back don t drive run i want you to get back sometime this week it occurred to me that dr merriman also felt a distrust as to the speeding powers of the land pirate s steeds after uncle caesar was gone lumberingly but swiftly up the street the doctor looked me over with great politeness and as much careful calculation until he had decided that i might do it is only a case of insufficient nutrition he said in other words the result of poverty pride and starvation mrs caswell has many devoted friends who would be glad to aid her but she will accept nothing except from that old negro uncle caesar who was once owned by her family mrs caswell said i in surprise and then i looked at the contract and saw that she had signed it azalea adair caswell i thought she was miss adair i said married to a drunken worthless loafer sir said the doctor it is said that he robs her even of the small sums that her old servant contributes toward her support when the milk and wine had been brought the doctor soon revived azalea adair she sat up and talked of the beauty of the autumn leaves that were then in season and their height of color she referred lightly to her fainting seizure as the outcome of an old palpitation of the heart impy fanned her as she lay on the sofa the doctor was due elsewhere and i followed him to the door i told him that it was within my power and intentions to make a reasonable advance of money to azalea adair on future contributions to the magazine and he seemed pleased by the way he said perhaps you would like to know that you have had royalty for a coachman old caesar s grandfather was a king in congo caesar himself has royal ways as you may have observed as the doctor was moving off i heard uncle caesar s voice inside did he get bofe of dem two dollars from you mis zalea yes caesar i heard azalea adair answer weakly and then i went in and concluded business negotiations with our contributor i assumed the responsibility of advancing fifty dollars putting it as a necessary formality in binding our bargain and then uncle caesar drove me back to the hotel here ends all of the story as far as i can testify as a witness the rest must be only bare statements of facts at about six o clock i went out for a stroll uncle caesar was at his corner he threw open the door of his carriage flourished his duster and began his depressing formula step right in suh fifty cents to anywhere in the city hack s puffickly clean suh jus got back from a funeral and then he recognized me i think his eyesight was getting bad his coat had taken on a few more faded shades of color the twine strings were more frayed and ragged the last remaining button the button of yellow horn was gone a motley descendant of kings was uncle caesar about two hours later i saw an excited crowd besieging the front of a drug store in a desert where nothing happens this was manna so i edged my way inside on an extemporized couch of empty boxes and chairs was stretched the mortal corporeality of major wentworth caswell a doctor was testing him for the immortal ingredient his decision was that it was conspicuous by its absence the erstwhile major had been found dead on a dark street and brought by curious and ennuied citizens to the drug store the late human being had been engaged in terrific battle the details showed that loafer and reprobate though he had been he had been also a warrior but he had lost his hands were yet clinched so tightly that his fingers would not be opened the gentle citizens who had know him stood about and searched their vocabularies to find some good words if it were possible to speak of him one kind looking man said after much thought when cas was about fo teen he was one of the best spellers in school while i stood there the fingers of the right hand of the man that was which hung down the side of a white pine box relaxed and dropped something at my feet i covered it with one foot quietly and a little later on i picked it up and pocketed it i reasoned that in his last struggle his hand must have seized that object unwittingly and held it in a death grip at the hotel that night the main topic of conversation with the possible exceptions of politics and prohibition was the demise of major caswell i heard one man say to a group of listeners in my opinion gentlemen caswell was murdered by somme of these no account niggers for his money he had fifty dollars this afternoon which he showed to several gentlemen in the hotel when he was found the money was not on his person i left the city the next morning at nine and as the train was crossing the bridge over the cumberland river i took out of my pocket a yellow horn overcoat button the size of a fifty cent piece with frayed ends of coarse twine hanging from it and cast it out of the window into the slow muddy waters below i wonder what s doing in buffalo psyche and the pskyscraper if you are a philosopher you can do this thing you can go to the top of a high building look down upon your fellow men feet below and despise them as insects like the irresponsible black waterbugs on summer ponds they crawl and circle and hustle about idiotically without aim or purpose they do not even move with the admirable intelligence of ants for ants always know when they are going home the ant is of a lowly station but he will often reach home and get his slippers on while you are left at your elevated station man then to the housetopped philosopher appears to be but a creeping contemptible beetle brokers poets millionaires bootblacks beauties hod carriers and politicians become little black specks dodging bigger black specks in streets no wider than your thumb from this high view the city itself becomes degraded to an unintelligible mass of distorted buildings and impossible perspectives the revered ocean is a duck pond the earth itself a lost golf ball all the minutiae of life are gone the philosopher gazes into the infinite heavens above him and allows his soul to expand to the influence of his new view he feels that he is the heir to eternity and the child of time space too should be his by the right of his immortal heritage and he thrills at the thought that some day his kind shall traverse theose mysterious aerial roads between planet and planet the tiny world beneath his feet upon which this towering structure of steel rests as a speck of dust upon a himalayan mountain it is but one of a countless number of such whirling atoms what are the ambitions the achievements the paltry conquests and loves of those restless black insects below compared with the serene and awful immensity of the universe that lies above and around their insignificant city it is guaranteed that the philosopher will have these thoughts they have been expressly compiled from the philosophies of the world and set down with the proper interrogation point at the end of them to represent the invariable musings of deep thinkers on high places and when the philosopher takes the elevator down his mind is broader his heart is at peace and his conception of the cosmogony of creation is as wide as the buckle of orion s summer belt but if your name happened to be daisy and you worked in an eighth avenue candy store and lived in a little cold hall bedroom five feet by eight and earned per week and ate ten cent lunches and were nineteen years old and got up at and worked till and never had studied philosophy maybe things wouldn t look that way to you from the top of a skyscraper two sighed for the hand of daisy the unphilosophical one was joe who kept the smallest store in new york it was about the size of a tool box of the d p w and was stuck like a swallow s nest against a corner of a down town skyscraper its stock consisted of fruit candies newspapers song books cigarettes and lemonade in season when stern winter shook his congealed locks and joe had to move himself and the fruit inside there was exactly room in the store for the proprietor his wares a stove the size of a vinegar cruet and one customer joe was not of the nation that keeps us forever in a furore with fugues and fruit he was a capable american youth who was laying by money and wanted daisy to help him spend it three times he had asked her i got money saved up daisy was his love song and you know how bad i want you that store of mine ain t very big but oh ain t it would be the antiphony of the unphilosophical one why i heard wanamaker s was trying to get you to sublet part of your floor space to them for next year daisy passed joe s corner every morning and evening hello two by four was her usual greeting seems to me your store looks emptier you must have sold a pack of chewing gum ain t much room in here sure joe would answer with his slow grin except for you daise me and the store are waitin for you whenever you ll take us don t you think you might before long store a fine scorn was expressed by daisy s uptilted nose sardine box waitin for me you say gee you d have to throw out about a hundred pounds of candy before i could get inside of it joe i wouldn t mind an even swap like that said joe complimentary daisy s existence was limited in every way she had to walk sideways between the counter and the shelves in the candy store in her own hall bedroom coziness had been carried close to cohesiveness the walls were so near to one another that the paper on them made a perfect babel of noise she could light the gas with one hand and close the door with the other without taking her eyes off the reflection of her brown pompadour in the mirror she had joe s picture in a gilt frame on the dresser and sometimes but her next thought would always be of joe s funny little store tacked like a soap box to the corner of that great building and away would go her sentiment in a breeze of laughter daisy s other suitor followed joe by several months he came to board in the house where she lived his name was dabster and he was a philosopher though young attainments stood out upon him like continental labels on a passaic n j suit case knowledge he had kidnapped from cyclopedias and handbooks of useful information but as for wisdom when she passed he was left sniffling in the road without so much as the number of her motor car he could and would tell you the proportion of water and muscle making properties of peas and veal the shortest verse in the bible the number of pounds of shingle nails required to fasten shingles laid four inches to the weather the population of kankakee ill the theories of spinoza the name of mr h mckay twombly s second hall footman the length of the hoosac tunnel the best time to set a hen the salary of the railway post office messenger between driftwood and red bank furnace pa and the number of bones in the foreleg of a cat the weight of learning was no handicap to dabster his statistics were the sprigs of parsley with which he garnished the feast of small talk that he would set before you if he conceived that to be your taste and again he used them as breastworks in foraging at the boardinghouse firing at you a volley of figures concerning the weight of a lineal foot of bar iron x inches and the average annual rainfall at fort snelling minn he would transfix with his fork the best piece of chicken on the dish while you were trying to rally sufficiently to ask him weakly why does a hen cross the road thus brightly armed and further equipped with a measure of good looks of a hair oily shopping district at three in the afternoon kind it seems that joe of the lilliputian emporium had a rival worthy of his steel but joe carried no steel there wouldn t have been room in his store to draw it if he had one saturday afternoon about four o clock daisy and mr dabster stopped before joe s booth dabster wore a silk hat and well daisy was a woman and that hat had no chance to get back in its box until joe had seen it a stick of pineapple chewing gum was the ostensible object of the call joe supplied it through the open side of his store he did not pale or falter at sight of the hat mr dabster s going to take me on top of the building to observe the view said daisy after she had introduced her admirers i never was on a skyscraper i guess it must be awfully nice and funny up there h m said joe the panorama said mr dabster exposed to the gaze from the top of a lofty building is not only sublime but instructive miss daisy has a decided pleasure in store for her it s windy up there too as well as here said joe are you dressed warm enough daise sure thing i m all lined said daisy smiling slyly at his clouded brow you look just like a mummy in a case joe ain t you just put in an invoice of a pint of peanuts or another apple your stock looks awful over stocked daisy giggled at her favorite joke and joe had to smile with her your quarters are somewhat limited mr er er remarked dabster in comparison with the size of this building i understand the area of its side to be about by feet that would make you occupy a proportionate space as if half of beloochistan were placed upon a territory as large as the united states east of the rocky mountains with the province of ontario and belgium added is that so sport said joe genially you are weisenheimer on figures all right how many square pounds of baled hay do you think a jackass could eat if he stopped brayin long enough to keep still a minute and five eighths a few minutes later daisy and mr dabster stepped from an elevator to the top floor of the skyscraper then up a short steep stairway and out upon the roof dabster led her to the parapet so she could look down at the black dots moving in the street below what are they she asked trembling she had never before been on a height like this before and then dabster must needs play the philosopher on the tower and conduct her soul forth to meet the immensity of space bipeds he said solemnly see what they become even at the small elevation of feet mere crawling insects going to and fro at random oh they ain t anything of the kind exclaimed daisy suddenly they re folks i saw an automobile oh gee are we that high up walk over this way said dabster he showed her the great city lying like an orderly array of toys far below starred here and there early as it was by the first beacon lights of the winter afternoon and then the bay and sea to the south and east vanishing mysteriously into the sky i don t like it declared daisy with troubled blue eyes say we go down but the philosopher was not to be denied his opportunity he would let her behold the grandeur of his mind the half nelson he had on the infinite and the memory he had for statistics and then she would nevermore be content to buy chewing gum aat the smallest store in new york and so he began to prate of the smallness of human affairs and how that even so slight a removal from earth made man and his works look like one tenth part of a dollar thrice computed and that one should consider the sidereal system and the maxims of epictetus and be comforted you don t carry me with you said daisy say i think it s awful to be up so high that folks look like fleas one of them we saw might have been joe why jiminy we might as well be in new jersey say i m afraid up here the philosopher smiled fatuously the earth said he is itself only as a grain of wheat in space look up there daisy gazed upward apprehensively the short day was spent and the stars were coming out above yonder star said dabster is venus the evening star she is miles from the sun fudge said daisy with a brief flash of spirit where do you think i come from brooklyn susie price in our store her brother sent her a ticket to go to san francisco that s only three thousand miles the philosopher smiled indulgently our world he said is miles from the sun there are eighteen stars of the first magnitude that are times further from us than the sun is if one of them should be extinguished it would be three years before we would see its light go out there are six thousand stars of the sixth magnitude it takes thirty six years for the light of one of them to reach the earth with an eighteen foot telescope we can see stars including those of the thirteenth magnitude whose light takes years to reach us each of these stars you re lyin cried daisy angrily you re tryin to scare me and you have i want to go down she stamped her foot arcturus began the philosopher soothingly but he was interrupted by a demonstration out of the vastness of the nature that he was endeavoring to portray with his memory instead of his heart for to the heart expounder of nature the stars were set in the firmament expressly to give soft light to lovers wandering happily beneath them and if you stand tiptoe some september night with your sweetheart on your arm you can almost touch them with your hand three years for their light to reach us indeed out of the west leaped a meteor lighting the roof of the skyscraper almost to midday its fiery parabola was limned against the sky toward the east it hissed as it went and daisy screamed take me down she cried vehemently you you mental arithmetic dabster got her to the elevator and inside of it she was wild eyed and she shuddered when the express made its debilitating drop outside the revolving door of the skyscraper the philosopher lost her she vanished and he stood bewildered without figures or statistics to aid him joe had a lull in trade and by squirming among his stock succeeded in lighting a cigarette and getting one cold foot against the attenuated stove the door was burst open and daisy laughing crying scattering fruit and candies tumbled into his arms oh joe i ve been up on the skyscraper ain t it cozy and warm and homelike in here i m ready for you joe whenever you want me a bird of bagdad without a doubt much of the spirit and genius of the caliph harun al rashid descended to the margrave august michael von paulsen quigg quigg s restaurant is in fourth avenue that street that the city seems to have forgotten in its growth fourth avenue born and bred in the bowery staggers northward full of good resolutions where it crosses fourteenth street it struts for a brief moment proudly in the glare of the museums and cheap theatres it may yet become a fit mate for its high born sister boulevard to the west or its roaring polyglot broad waisted cousin to the east it passes union square and here the hoofs of the dray horses seem to thunder in unison recalling the tread of marching hosts hooray but now come the silent and terrible mountains buildings square as forts high as the clouds shutting out the sky where thousands of slaves bend over desks all day on the ground floors are only little fruit shops and laundries and book shops where you see copies of littell s living age and g w m reynold s novels in the windows and next poor fourth avenue the street glides into a mediaeval solitude on each side are shops devoted to antiques let us say it is night men in rusty armor stand in the windows and menace the hurrying cars with raised rusty iron gauntlets hauberks and helms blunderbusses cromwellian breastplates matchlocks creeses and the swords and daggers of an army of dead and gone gallants gleam dully in the ghostly light here and there from a corner saloon lit with jack o lanterns or phosphorus stagger forth shuddering home bound citizens nerved by the tankards within to their fearsome journey adown that eldrich avenue lined with the bloodstained weapons of the fighting dead what street could live inclosed by these mortuary relics and trod by these spectral citizens in whose sunken hearts scarce one good whoop or tra la la remained not fourth avenue not after the tinsel but enlivening glories of the little rialto not after the echoing drum beats of union square there need be no tears ladies and gentlemen tis but the suicide of a street with a shriek and a crash fourth avenue dives headlong into the tunnel at thirty fourth and is never seen again near the sad scene of the thoroughfare s dissolution stood the modest restaurant of quigg it stands there yet if you care to view its crumbling red brick front its show window heaped with oranges tomatoes layer cakes pies canned asparagus its papier m ach e lobster and two maltese kittens asleep on a bunch of lettuce if you care to sit at one of the little tables upon whose cloth has been traced in the yellowest of coffee stains the trail of the japanese advance to sit there with one eye on your umbrella and the other upon the bogus bottle from which you drop the counterfeit sauce foisted upon us by the cursed charlatan who assumes to be our dear old lord and friend the nobleman in india quigg s title came through his mother one of her ancestors was a margravine of saxony his father was a tammany brave on account of the dilution of his heredity he found that he could neither become a reigning potentate nor get a job in the city hall so he opened a restaurant he was a man full of thought and reading the business gave him a living though he gave it little attention one side of his house bequeathed to him a poetic and romantic adventure the other have him the restless spirit that made him seek adventure by day he was quigg the restaurateur by night he was the margrave the caliph the prince of bohemia going about the city in search of the odd the mysterious the inexplicable the recondite one night at at which hour the restaurant closed quigg set forth upon his quest there was a mingling of the foreign the military and the artistic in his appearance as he buttoned his coat high up under his short trimmed brown and gray beard and turned westward toward the more central life conduits of the city in his pocket he had stored an assortment of cards written upon without which he never stirred out of doors each of those cards was good at his own restaurant for its face value some called simply for a bowl of soup or sandwiches and coffee others entitled their bearer to one two three or more days of full meals a few were for single regular meals a very few were in effect meal tickets good for a week of riches and power margrave quigg had none but he had a caliph s heart it may be forgiven him if his head fell short of the measure of harun al rashid s perhaps some of the gold pieces in bagdad had put less warmth and hope into the complainants among the bazaars than had quigg s beef stew among the fishermen and one eyed calenders of manhattan continuing his progress in search of romance to divert him or of distress that he might aid quigg became aware of a fast gathering crowd that whooped and fought and eddied at a corner of broadway and the crosstown street that he was traversing hurrying to the spot he beheld a young man of an exceedingly melancholy and preoccupied demeanor engaged in the pastime of casting silver money from his pockets in the middle of the street with each motion of the generous one s hand the crowd huddled upon the falling largesse with yells of joy traffic was suspended a policman in the centre of the mob stooped often to the ground as he urged the blockaders to move on the margrave saw at a glance that here was food for his hunger after knowledge concerning abnormal working of the human heart he made his way swiftly to the young man s side and took his arm come with me at once he said in the low but commanding voice that his waiters had learned to fear pinched remarked the young man looking up at him with expressionless eyes pinched by a painless dentist take me away flatty and give me gas some lay eggs and some lay none when is a hen still deeply seized by some inward grief but tractable he allowed quigg to lead him away and down the street to a little park there seated on a bench he upon whom a corner of the great caliph s mantle has descended spake with kindness and discretion seeking to know what evil had come upon the other disturbing his soul and driving him to such ill considered and ruinous waste of his substance and stores i was doing the monte cristo act as adapted by pompton n j wasn t i asked the young man you were throwing small coins into the street for the people to scramble after said the margrave that s it you buy all the beer you can hold and then you throw chicken feed to oh curse that word chicken and hens feathers roosters eggs and everything connected with it young sir said the margrave kindly but with dignity though i do not ask your confidence i invite it i know the world and i know humanity man is my study though i do not eye him as the scientist eyes a beetle or as the philanthropist gazes at the objects of his bounty through a veil of theory and ignorance it is my pleasure and distraction to interest myself in the peculiar and complicated misfortunes that life in a great city visits upon my fellow men you may be familiar with the history of that glorious and immortal ruler the caliph harun al rashid whose wise and beneficent excursions among his people in the city of bagdad secured him the privilege of relieving so much of their distress in my humble way i walk in his footsteps i seek for romance and adventure in city streets not in ruined castles or in crumbling palaces to me the greatest marvels of magic are those that take place in men s hearts when acted upon by the furious and diverse forces of a crowded population in your strange behavior this evening i fancy a story lurks i read in your act something deeper than the wanton wastefulness of a spendthrift i observe in your countenance the certain traces of consuming grief or despair i repeat i invite your confidence i am not without some power to alleviate and advise will you not trust me gee how you talk exclaimed the young man a gleam of admiration supplanting for a moment the dull sadness of his eyes you ve got the astor library skinned to a synopsis of preceding chapters i mind that old turk you speak of i read the arabian nights when i was a kid he was a kind of bill devery and charlie schwab rolled into one but say you might wave enchanted dishrags and make copper bottles smoke up coon giants all night without ever touching me my case won t yield to that kind of treatment if i could hear your story said the margrave with his lofty serious smile i ll spiel it in about nine words said the young man with a deep sigh but i don t think you can help me any unless you re a peach at guessing it s back to the bosphorous for you on your magic linoleum the story of the young man and the harness maker s riddle i work in hildebrant s saddle and harness shop down in grant street i ve worked there five years i get a week that s enough to marry on ain t it well i m not going to get married old hildebrant is one of

arab guy that gave away libraries in bagdad well now can you whistle up a fairy that ll solve this hen query or not when the young man ceased the margrave arose and paced to and fro by the park bench for several minutes finally he sat again and said in grave and impressive tones i must confess sir that during the eight years that i have spent in search of adventure and in relieving distress i have never encountered a more interesting or a more perplexing case i fear that i have overlooked hens in my researches and observations as to their habits their times and manner of laying their many varieties and cross breedings their span of life their oh don t make an ibsen drama of it interrupted the young man flippantly riddles especially old hildebrant s riddles don t have to be worked out seriously they are light themes such as sim ford and harry thurston peck like to handle but somehow i can t strike just the answer bill watson may and he may not to morrow will tell well your majesty i m glad anyhow that you butted in and whiled the time away i guess mr al rashid himself would have bounced back if one of his constituents had conducted him up against this riddle i ll say good night peace fo yours and what you may call its of allah the margrave still with a gloomy air held out his hand i cannot exppress my regret he said sadly never before have i found myself unable to assist in some way what kind of a hen lays the longest it is a baffling problem there is a hen i believe called the plymouth rock that cut it out said the young man the caliph trade is a mighty serious one i don t suppose you d even see anything funny in a preacher s defense of john d rockefeller well good night your nibs from habit the margrave began to fumble in his pockets he drew forth a card and handed it to the young man do me the favor to accept this anyhow he said the time may come when it might be of use to you thanks said the young man pocketing it carelessly my name is simmons shame to him who would hint that the reader s interest shall altogether pursue the margrave august michael von paulsen quigg i am indeed astray if my hand fail in keeping the way where my peruser s heart would follow then let us on the morrow peep quickly in at the door of hildebrant harness maker hildebrant s pounds reposed on a bench silverbuckling a raw leather martingale bill watson came in first vell said hildebrant shaking all over with the vile conceit of the joke maker haf you guessed him vat kind of a hen lays der longest er why i think so said bill rubbing a servile chin i think so mr hildebrant the one that lives the longest is that right nein said hildebrant shaking his head violently you haf not guessed der answer bill passed on and donned a bed tick apron and bachelorhood in came the young man of the arabian night s fiasco pale melancholy hopeless vell said hildebrant haf you guessed him vat kind of a hen lays der longest simmons regarded him with dull savagery in his eye should he curse this mountain of pernicious humor curse him and die why should but there was laura dogged speechless he thrust his hands into his coat pockets and stood his hand encountered the strange touch of the margrave s card he drew it out and looked at it as men about to be hanged look at a crawling fly there was written on it in quigg s bold round hand good for one roast chicken to bearer simmons looked up with a flashing eye a dead one said he goot roared hildebrant rocking the table with giant glee dot is right you gome at mine house at o clock to der party compliments of the season there are no more christmas stories to write fiction is exhausted and newspaper items the next best are manufactured by clever young journalists who have married early and have an engagingly pessimistic view of life therefore for seasonable diversion we are reduced to very questionable sources facts and philosophy we will begin with whichever you choose to call it children are pestilential little animals with which we have to cope under a bewildering variety of conditions especially when childish sorrows overwhelm them are we put to our wits end we exhaust our paltry store of consolation and then beat them sobbing to sleep then we grovel in the dust of a million years and ask god why thus we call out of the rat trap as for the children no one understands them except old maids hunchbacks and shepherd dogs now comes the facts in the case of the rag doll the tatterdemalion and the twenty fifth of december on the tenth of that month the child of the millionaire lost her rag doll there were many servants in the millionaire s palace on the hudson and these ransacked the house and grounds but without finding the lost treasure the child was a girl of five and one of those perverse little beasts that often wound the sensibilities of wealthy parents by fixing their affections upon some vulgar inexpensive toy instead of upon diamond studded automobiles and pony phaetons the child grieved sorely and truly a thing inexplicable to the millionaire to whom the rag doll market was about as interesting as bay state gas and to the lady the child s mother who was all form that is nearly all as you shall see the child cried inconsolably and grew hollow eyed knock kneed spindling and corykilverty in many other respects the millionaire smiled and tapped his coffers confidently the pick of the output of the french and german toymakers was rushed by special delivery to the mansion but rachel refused to be comforted she was weeping for her rag child and was for a high protective tariff against all foreign foolishness then doctors with the finest bedside manners and stop watches were called in one by one they chattered futilely about peptomanganate of iron and sea voyages and hypophosphites until their stop watches showed that bill rendered was under the wire for show or place then as men they advised that the rag doll be found as soon as possible and restored to its mourning parent the child sniffed at therapeutics chewed a thumb and wailed for her betsy and all this time cablegrams were coming from santa claus saying that he would soon be here and enjoining us to show a true christian spirit and let up on the pool rooms and tontine policies and platoon systems long enough to give him a welcome everywhere the spirit of christmas was diffusing itself the banks were refusing loans the pawn brokers had doubled their gang of helpers people bumped your shins on the streets with red sleds thomas and jeremiah bubbled before you on the bars while you waited on one foot holly wreaths of hospitality were hung in windows of the stores they who had em were getting their furs you hardly knew which was the best bet in balls three high moth or snow it was no time at which to lose the rag doll or your heart if doctor watson s investigating friend had been called in to solve this mysterious disappearance he might have observed on the millionaire s wall a copy of the vampire that would have quickly suggested by induction a rag and a bone and a hank of hair flip a scotch terrier next to the rag doll in the child s heart frisked through the halls the hank of hair aha x the unfound quantity represented the rag doll but the bone well when dogs find bones they done it were an easy and a fruitful task to examine flip s forefeet look watson earth dried earth between the toes of course the dog but sherlock was not there therefore it devolves but topography and architecture must intervene the millionaire s palace occupied a lordly space in front of it was a lawn close mowed as a south ireland man s face two days after a shave at one side of it and fronting on another street was a pleasuance trimmed to a leaf and the garage and stables the scotch pup had ravished the rag doll from the nursery dragged it to a corner of the lawn dug a hole and buried it after the manner of careless undertakers there you have the mystery solved and no checks to write for the hypodermical wizard of fi pun notes to toss to the sergeant then let s get down to the heart of the thing tiresome readers the christmas heart of the thing fuzzy was drunk not riotously or helplessly or loquaciously as you or i might get but decently appropriately and inoffensively as becomes a gentleman down on his luck fuzzy was a soldier of misfortune the road the haystack the park bench the kitchen door the bitter round of eleemosynary beds with shower bath attachment the petty pickings and ignobly garnered largesse of great cities these formed the chapters of his history fuzzy walked toward the river down the street that bounded one side of the millionaire s house and grounds he saw a leg of betsy the lost rag doll protruding like the clue to a lilliputian murder mystery from its untimely grave in a corner of the fence he dragged forth the maltreated infant tucked it under his arm and went on his way crooning a road song of his brethrren that no doll that has been brought up to the sheltered life should hear well for betsy that she had no ears and well that she had no eyes save unseeing circles of black for the faces of fuzzy and the scotch terrier were those of brothers and the heart of no rag doll could withstand twice to become the prey of such fearsome monsters though you may not know it grogan s saloon stands near the river and near the foot of the street down which fuzzy traveled in grogan s christmas cheer was already rampant fuzzy entered with his doll he fancied that as a mummer at the feast of saturn he might earn a few drops from the wassail cup he set betsy on the bar and addressed her loudly and humorously seasoning his speech with exaggerated compliments and endearments as one entertaining his lady friend the loafers and bibbers around caught the farce of it and roared the bartender gave fuzzy a drink oh many of us carry rag dolls one for the lady suggested fuzzy impudently and tucked another contribution to art beneath his waistcoat he began to see possibilities in betsy his first night had been a success visions of a vaudeville circuit about town dawned upon him in a group near the stove sat pigeon mccarthy black riley and one ear mike well and unfavorably known in the tough shoestring district that blackened the left bank of the river they passed a newspaper back and forth among themselves the item that each solid and blunt forefinger pointed out was an advertisement headed one hundred dollars reward to earn it one must return the rag doll lost strayed or stolen from the millionaire s mansion it seemed that grief still ravaged unchecked in the bosom of the too faithful child flip the terrier capered and shook his absurd whisker before her powerless to distract she wailed for her betsy in the faces of walking talking mama ing and eye closing french mabelles and violettes the advertisement was a last resort black riley came from behind the stove and approached fuzzy in his one sided parabolic way the christmas mummer flushed with success had tucked betsy under his arm and was about to depart to the filling of impromptu dates elsewhere say bo said black riley to him where did you cop out dat doll this doll asked fuzzy touching betsy with his forefinger to be sure that she was the one referred to his doll was presented to me by the emperor of beloochistan i have seven hundred others in my country home in newport this doll cheese the funny business said riley you swiped it or picked it up at de house on de hill where but never mind dat you want to take fifty cents for de rags and take it quick me brother s kid at home might be wantin to play wid it hey what he produced the coin fuzzy laughed a gurgling insolent alcoholic laugh in his face go to the office of sarah bernhardt s manager and propose to him that she be released from a night s performance to entertain the tackytown lyceum and literary coterie you will hear the duplicate of fuzzy s laugh black riley gauged fuzzy quickly with his blueberry eye as a wrestler does his hand was itching to play the roman and wrest the rag sabine from the extemporaneous merry andrew who was entertaining an angel unaware but he refrained fuzzy was fat and solid and big three inches of well nourished corporeity defended from the winter winds by dingy linen intervened between his vest and trousers countless small circular wrinkles running around his coat sleeves and knees guaranteed the quality of his bone and muscle his small blue eyes bathed in the moisture of altruism and wooziness looked upon you kindly yet without abashment he was whiskerly whiskyly fleshily formidable so black riley temporized wot ll you take for it den he asked money said fuzzy with husky firmness cannot buy her he was intoxicated with the artist s first sweet cup of attainment to set a faded blue earth stained rag doll on a bar to hold mimic converse with it and to find his heart leaping with the sense of plaudits earned and his throat scorching with free libations poured in his honor could base coin buy him from such achievements you will perceive that fuzzy had the temperament fuzzy walked out with the gait of a trained sea lion in search of other caf es to conquer though the dusk of twilight was hardly yet apparent lights were beginning to spangle the city like pop corn bursting in a deep skillet christmas eve impatiently expected was peeping over the brink of the hour millions had prepared for its celebration towns would be painted red you yourself have heard the horns and dodged the capers of the saturnalians pigeon mccarthy black riley and one ear mike held a hasty converse outside grogan s they were narrow chested pallid striplings not fighters in the open but more dangerous in their ways of warfare than the most terrible of turks fuzzy in a pitched battle could have eaten the three of them in a go as you please encounter he was already doomed they overtook him just as he and betsy were entering costigan s casino they deflected him and shoved the newspaper under his nose fuzzy could read and more boys said he you are certainly damn true friends give me a week to think it over the soul of a real artist is quenched with difficulty the boys carefully pointed out to him that advertisements were soulless and that the deficiencies of the day might not be supplied by the morrow a cool hundred said fuzzy thoughtfully and mushily booys said he you are true friends i ll go up and claim the reward the show business is not what it used to be night was falling more surely the three tagged at his sides to the foot of the rise on which stood the millionaire s house there fuzzy turned upon them acrimoniously you are a pack of putty faced beagle hounds he roared go away they went away a little way in pigeon mccarthy s pocket was a section of one inch gas pipe eight inches long in one end of it and in the middle of it was a lead plug one half of it was packed tight with solder black riley carried a slung shot being a conventional thug

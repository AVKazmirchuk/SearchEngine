of all things in the world tobacco must be quickest forthcoming to a fellow man desiring it but that beyond the immediate temporary need requisition upon the store of a comrade is pressed with great danger to friendship then the blackness of the pit arose and filled the heart of burney sucking the corpse of his deceased dudheen he staggered through his duties with his barrowful of stones and dirt feeling for the first time that the curse of adam was upon him other men bereft of a pleasure might have recourse to other delights but burney had only two comforts in life one was his pipe the other was an ecstatic hope that there would be no speedways to build on the other side of jordan at meal times he would let the other men go first into the grub boat and then he would go down on his hands and knees grovelling fiercely upon the ground where they had been sitting trying to find some stray crumbs of tobacco once he sneaked down the river bank and filled his pipe with dead willow leaves at the first whiff of the smoke he spat in the direction of the boat and put the finest curse he knew on corrigan one that began with the first corrigans born on earth and ended with the corrigans that shall hear the trumpet of gabriel blow he began to hate corrigan with all his shaking nerves and soul even murder occurred to him in a vague sort of way five days he went without the taste of tobacco he who had smoked all day and thought the night misspent in which he had not awakened for a pipeful or two under the bedclothes one day a man stopped at the boat to say that there was work to be had in the bronx park where a large number of labourers were required in making some improvements after dinner burney walked thirty yards down the river bank away from the maddening smell of the others pipes he sat down upon a stone he was thinking he would set out for the bronx at least he could earn tobacco there what if the books did say he owed corrigan any man s work was worth his keep but then he hated to go without getting even with the hard hearted screw who had put his pipe out was there any way to do it softly stepping among the clods came tony he of the race of goths who worked in the kitchen he grinned at burney s elbow and that unhappy man full of race animosity and holding urbanity in contempt growled at him what d ye want ye dago tony also contained a grievance and a plot he too was a corrigan hater and had been primed to see it in others how you like a mr corrigan he asked you think a him a nice a man to hell with m he said may his liver turn to water and the bones of him crack in the cold of his heart may dog fennel grow upon his ancestors graves and the grandsons of his children be born without eyes may whiskey turn to clabber in his mouth and every time he sneezes may he blister the soles of his feet and the smoke of his pipe may it make his eyes water and the drops fall on the grass that his cows eat and poison the butter that he spreads on his bread though tony remained a stranger to the beauties of this imagery he gathered from it the conviction that it was sufficiently anti corrigan in its tendency so with the confidence of a fellow conspirator he sat by burney upon the stone and unfolded his plot it was very simple in design every day after dinner it was corrigan s habit to sleep for an hour in his bunk at such times it was the duty of the cook and his helper tony to leave the boat so that no noise might disturb the autocrat the cook always spent this hour in walking exercise tony s plan was this after corrigan should be asleep he tony and burney would cut the mooring ropes that held the boat to the shore tony lacked the nerve to do the deed alone then the awkward boat would swing out into a swift current and surely overturn against a rock there was below come on and do it said burney if the back of ye aches from the lick he gave ye as the pit of me stomach does for the taste of a bit of smoke we can t cut the ropes too quick all a right said tony but better wait bout a ten minute more give a corrigan plenty time get good a sleep they waited sitting upon the stone the rest of the men were at work out of sight around a bend in the road everything would have gone well except perhaps with corrigan had not tony been moved to decorate the plot with its conventional accompaniment he was of dramatic blood and perhaps he intuitively divined the appendage to villainous machinations as prescribed by the stage he pulled from his shirt bosom a long black beautiful venomous cigar and handed it to burney you like a smoke while we wait he asked burney clutched it and snapped off the end as a terrier bites at a rat he laid it to his lips like a long lost sweetheart when the smoke began to draw he gave a long deep sigh and the bristles of his gray red moustache curled down over the cigar like the talons of an eagle slowly the red faded from the whites of his eyes he fixed his gaze dreamily upon the hills across the river the minutes came and went bout time to go now said tony that damn a corrigan he be in

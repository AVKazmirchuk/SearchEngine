the dog wolf prepare a toddy as i told you said doctor james wake your mistress have her drink it and tell her what has happened some ten minutes afterward mrs chandler entered supported by old cindy s arm she appeared to be a little stronger since her sleep and the stimulant she had taken doctor james had covered with a sheet the form upon the bed the lady turned her mournful eyes once with a half frightened look toward it and pressed closer to her loyal protector her eyes were dry and bright sorrow seemed to have done its utmost with her the fount of tears was dried feeling itself

powers of goodness to prevail but on the day before mrs maloney had found the book in her room and had carried it away declaring sharply that it would not do for servants to read at night they lost sleep and did not work briskly the next day can one only eleven years old living away from one s mamma and never having any time to play live entirely deprived of grimm just try it once and you will see what a difficult thing it is lena s home was in texas away up among the little mountains on the pedernales river in a little town called fredericksburg they are all german people who live in fredericksburg of evenings they sit at little tables along the sidewalk and drink beer and play pinochle and scat they are very thrifty people thriftiest among them was peter hildesmuller lena s father and that is why lena was sent to work in the hotel at the quarries thirty miles away she earned three dollars every week there and peter added her wages to his well guarded store peter had an ambition to become as rich as his neighbour hugo heffelbauer who smoked a meerschaum pipe three feet long and had wiener schnitzel and hassenpfeffer for dinner every day in the week and now lena was quite old enough to work and assist in the accumulation of riches but conjecture if you can what it means to be sentenced at eleven years of age from a home in the pleasant little rhine village to hard labour in the ogre s castle where you must fly to serve the ogres while they devour cattle and sheep growling fiercely as they stamp white limestone dust from their great shoes for you to sweep and scour with your weak aching fingers and then to have grimm taken away from you lena raised the lid of an old empty case that had once contained canned corn and got out a sheet of paper and a piece of pencil she was going to write a letter to her mamma tommy ryan was going to post it for her at ballinger s tommy was seventeen worked in the quarries went home to ballinger s every night and was now waiting in the shadows under lena s window for her to throw the letter out to him that was the only way she could send a letter to fredericksburg mrs maloney did not like for her to write letters the stump of the candle was burning low so lena hastily bit the wood from around the lead of her pencil and began this is the letter she wrote dearest mamma i want so much to see you and gretel and claus and heinrich and little adolf i am so tired i want to see you to day i was slapped by mrs maloney and had no supper i could not bring in enough wood for my hand hurt she took my book yesterday i mean grimm s fairy tales which uncle leo gave me it did not hurt any one for me to read the book i try to work as well as i can but there is so much to do i read only a little bit every night dear mamma i shall tell you what i am going to do unless you send for me to morrow to bring me home i shall go to a deep place i know in the river and drown it is wicked to drown i suppose but i wanted to see you and there is no one else i am very tired and tommy is waiting for the letter you will excuse me mamma if i do it your respectful and loving daughter lena tommy was still waiting faithfully when the letter was concluded and when lena dropped it out she saw him pick it up and start up the steep hillside without undressing she blew out the candle and curled herself upon the mattress on the floor at o clock old man ballinger came out of his house in his stocking feet and leaned over the gate smoking his pipe he looked down the big road white in the moonshine and rubbed one ankle with the toe of his other foot it was time for the fredericksburg mail to come pattering up the road old man ballinger had waited only a few minutes when he heard the lively hoofbeats of fritz s team of little black mules and very soon afterward his covered spring wagon stood in front of the gate fritz s big spectacles flashed in the moonlight and his tremendous voice shouted a greeting to the postmaster of ballinger s the mail carrier jumped out and took the bridles from the mules for he always fed them oats at ballinger s while the mules were eating from their feed bags old man ballinger brought out the mail sack and threw it into the wagon fritz bergmann was a man of three sentiments or to be more accurate four the pair of mules deserving to be reckoned individually those mules were the chief interest and joy of his existence next came the emperor of germany and lena hildesmuller tell me said fritz when he was ready to start contains the sack a letter to frau hildesmuller from the little lena at the quarries one came in the last mail to say that she is a little sick already her mamma is very anxious to hear again yes said old man ballinger thar s a letter for mrs helterskelter or some

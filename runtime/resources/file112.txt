the water s brink waist deep in the curling vines as he gazed upon the scarecrow figure in the stern of the dory a sprightly interest beamed upon his mobile face months of wageless and thankless service had dimmed the admiral s splendor his red trousers were patched and ragged most of the bright buttons and yellow braid were gone from his jacket the visor of his cap was torn and depended almost to his eyes the admiral s feet were bare dear admiral cried the large man and his voice was like a blast from a horn i kiss your hands i knew we could build upon your fidelity you had our despatch from general martinez a little nearer with your boat dear admiral upon these devils of shifting vines we stand with the smallest security felipe regarded him with a stolid face provisions and

as was its custom the breeze veered and swept back from the mountains cool and steady bringing a taste of the stagnant lagoons and mangrove swamps that guttered the lowlands the mainsail of the sloop was hoisted and swelled to it and at that moment they heard shouts and a waxing clamor from the bosky profundities of the shore the butchers my dear admiral said the large man smiling too late for the

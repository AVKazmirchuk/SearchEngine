carried off the cumberland presbyterian minister it don t matter i just want you to know you are safe in the hands of your shepherd now don t play hearts on spades and don t get nervous still harping says ogden laughing again don t you suppose that if i was black bill and thought you suspected me i d put a winchester bullet into you and stop my nervousness if i had any not any says i a man who s got the nerve to hold up a train single handed wouldn t do a trick like that i ve knocked about enough to know that them are the kind of men who put a value on a friend not that i can claim being a friend of yours mr ogden says i being only your sheep herder but under more expeditious circumstances we might have been forget the sheep temporarily i beg says ogden and cut for deal about four days afterward while my muttons was nooning on the water hole and i deep in the interstices of making a pot of coffee up rides softly on the grass a mysterious person in the garb of the being he wished to represent he was dressed somewhere between a kansas city detective buffalo bill and the town dog catcher of baton rouge his chin and eye wasn t molded on fighting lines so i knew he was only a scout herdin sheep he asks me well says i to a man of your evident gumptional endowments i wouldn t have the nerve to state that i am engaged in decorating old bronzes or oiling bicycle sprockets you don t talk or look like a sheep herder to me says he but you talk like what you look like to me says i and then he asks me who i was working for and i shows him rancho chiquito two miles away in the shadow of a low hill and he tells me he s a deputy sheriff there s a train robber called black bill supposed to be somewhere in these parts says the scout he s been traced as far as san antonio and maybe farther have you seen or heard of any strangers around here during the past month i have not says i except a report of one over at the mexican quarters of loomis ranch on the frio what do you know about him asks the deputy he s three days old says i what kind of a looking man is the man you work for he asks does old george ramey own this place yet he s run sheep here for the last ten years but never had no success the old man has sold out and gone west i tells him another sheep fancier bought him out about a month ago what kind of a looking man is he asks the deputy again oh says i a big fat kind of a dutchman with long whiskers and blue specs i don t think he knows a sheep from a ground squirrel i guess old george soaked him pretty well on the deal says i after indulging himself in a lot more non communicative information and two thirds of my dinner the deputy rides away that night i mentions the matter to ogden they re drawing the tendrils of the octopus around black bill says i and then i told him about the deputy sheriff and how i d described him to the deputy and what the deputy said about the matter oh well says ogden let s don t borrow any of black bill s troubles we ve a few of our own get the bourbon out of the cupboard and we ll drink to his health unless says he with his little cackling laugh you re prejudiced against train robbers i ll drink says i to any man who s a friend to a friend and i believe that black bill i goes on would be that so here s to black bill and may he have good luck and both of us drank about two weeks later comes shearing time the sheep had to be driven up to the ranch and a lot of frowzy headed mexicans would snip the fur off of them with back action scissors so the afternoon before the barbers were to come i hustled my underdone muttons over the hill across the dell down by the winding brook and up to the ranch house where i penned em in a corral and bade em my nightly adieus i went from there to the ranch house i find h ogden esquire lying asleep on his little cot bed i guess he had been overcome by anti insomnia or diswakefulness or some of the diseases peculiar to the sheep business his mouth and vest were open and he breathed like a second hand bicycle pump i looked at him and gave vent to just a few musings imperial caesar says i asleep in such a way might shut his mouth and keep the wind away a man asleep is certainly a sight to make angels weep what good is all his brain muscle backing nerve influence and family connections he s at the mercy of his enemies and more so of his friends and he s about as beautiful as a cab horse leaning against the metropolitan opera house at a m dreaming of the plains of arabia now a woman asleep you regard as different no matter how she looks you know it s better for all hands for her to be that way well i took a drink of bourbon and one for ogden and started in to be comfortable while he was taking his nap he had some books on his table on indigenous subjects such as japan and drainage and physical culture and some tobacco which seemed more to the point after i d smoked a few and listened to the sartorial breathing of h o i happened to look out the window toward the shearing pens where there was a kind of a road coming up from a kind of a road across a kind of a creek farther away i saw five men riding up to the house all of em carried guns across their saddles and among em was the deputy that had talked to me at my camp they rode up careful in open formation with their guns ready i set apart with my eye the one i opinionated to be the boss muck raker of this law and order cavalry good evening gents says i won t you light and tie your horses the boss rides up close and swings his gun over till the opening in it seems to cover my whole front elevation don t you move your hands none says he till you and me indulge in a adequate amount of necessary conversation i will not says i i am no deaf mute and therefore will not have to disobey your injunctions in replying we are on the lookout says he for black bill the man that held up the katy for in may we are searching the ranches and everybody on em what is your name and what do you do on this ranch captain says i percival saint clair is my occupation and my name is sheep herder i ve got my flock of veals no muttons penned here to night the shearers are coming to morrow to give them a hair cut with baa a rum i suppose where s the boss of this ranch the captain of the gang asks me wait just a minute cap n says i wasn t there a kind of a reward offered for the capture of this desperate character you have referred to in your preamble there s a thousand dollars reward offered says the captain but it s for his capture and conviction there don t seem to be no provision made for an informer it looks like it might rain in a day or so says i in a tired way looking up at the cerulean blue sky if you know anything about the locality disposition or secretiveness of this here black bill says he in a severe dialect you are amiable to the law in not reporting it i heard a fence rider say says i in a desultory kind of voice that a mexican told a cowboy named jake over at pidgin s store on the nueces that he heard that black bill had been seen in matamoras by a sheepman s cousin two weeks ago tell you what i ll do tight mouth says the captain after looking me over for bargains if you put us on so we can scoop black bill i ll pay you a hundred dollars out of my own out of our own pockets that s liberal says he you ain t entitled to anything now what do you say cash down now i asks the captain has a sort of discussion with his helpmates and they all produce the contents of their pockets for analysis out of the general results they figured up in cash and worth of plug tobacco come nearer capitan meeo says i and listen he so did i am mighty poor and low down in the world says i i am working for twelve dollars a month trying to keep a lot of animals together whose only thought seems to be to get asunder although says i i regard myself as some better than the state of south dakota it s a come down to a man who has heretofore regarded sheep only in the form of chops i m pretty far reduced in the world on account of foiled ambitions and rum and a kind of cocktail they make along the p r r all the way from scranton to cincinnati dry gin french vermouth one squeeze of a lime and a good dash of orange bitters if you re ever up that way don t fail to let one try you and again says i i have never yet went back on a friend i ve stayed by em when they had plenty and when adversity s overtaken me i ve never forsook em but i goes on this is not exactly the case of a friend twelve dollars a month is only bowing acquaintance money and i do not consider brown beans and corn bread the food of friendship i am a poor man says i and i have a widowed mother in texarkana you will find black bill says i lying asleep in this house on a cot in the room to your right he s the man you want as i know from his words and conversation he was in a way a friend i explains and if i was the man i once was the entire product of the mines of gondola would not have tempted me to betray him but says i every week half of the beans was wormy and not nigh enough wood in camp better go in careful gentlemen says i he seems impatient at times and when you think of his late professional pursuits one would look for abrupt actions if he was come upon sudden so the whole posse unmounts and ties their horses and unlimbers their ammunition and equipments and tiptoes into the house and i follows like delilah when she set the philip stein on to samson the leader of the posse shakes ogden and wakes him up and then he jumps up and two more of the reward hunters grab him ogden was mighty tough with all his slimness and he gives em as neat a single footed tussle against odds as i ever see what does this mean he says after they had him down you re scooped in mr black bill says the captain that s all it s an outrage says h ogden madder yet it was says the peace and good will man the katy wasn t bothering you and there s a law against monkeying with express packages and he sits on h ogden s stomach and goes through his pockets symptomatically and careful i ll make you perspire for this says ogden perspiring some himself i can prove who i am so can i says the captain as he draws from h ogden s inside coat pocket a handful of new bills of the second national bank of espinosa city your regular engraved tuesdays and fridays visiting card wouldn t have a louder voice in proclaiming your indemnity than this here currency you can get up now and prepare to go with us and expatriate your sins h ogden gets up and fixes his necktie he says no more after they have taken the money off of him a well greased idea says the sheriff captain admiring to slip off down here and buy a little sheep ranch where the hand of man is seldom heard it was the slickest hide out i ever see says the captain so one of the men goes to the shearing pen and hunts up the other herder a mexican they call john sallies and he saddles ogden s horse and the sheriffs all ride tip close around him with their guns in hand ready to take their prisoner to town before starting ogden puts the ranch in john sallies hands and gives him orders about the shearing and where to graze the sheep just as if he intended to be back in a few days and a couple of hours afterward one percival saint clair an ex sheep herder of the rancho chiquito might have been seen with a hundred and nine dollars wages and blood money in his pocket riding south on another horse belonging to said ranch the red faced man paused and listened the whistle of a coming freight train sounded far away among the low hills the fat seedy man at his side sniffed and shook his frowzy head slowly and disparagingly what is it snipy asked the other got the blues again no i ain t said the seedy one sniffing again but i don t like your talk you and me have been friends off and on for fifteen year and i never yet knew or heard of you giving anybody up to the law not no one and here was a man whose saleratus you had et and at whose table you had played games of cards if casino can be so called and yet you inform him to the law and take money for it it never was like you i say this h ogden resumed the red faced man through a lawyer proved himself free by alibis and other legal terminalities as i so heard afterward he never suffered no harm he did me favors and i hated to hand him over how about the bills they found in his pocket asked the seedy man i put em there said the red faced man while he was asleep when i saw the posse riding up i was black bill look out snipy here she comes we ll board her on the bumpers when she takes water at the tank schools and schools i old jerome warren lived in a hundred thousand dollar house at east fifty soforth street he was a down town broker so rich that he could afford to walk for his health a few blocks in the direction of his office every morning and then call a cab he had an adopted son the son of an old friend named gilbert cyril scott could play him nicely who was becoming a successful painter as fast as he could squeeze the paint out of his tubes another member of the household was barbara ross a stepniece man is born to trouble so as old jerome had no family of his own he took up the burdens of others gilbert and barbara got along swimmingly there was a tacit and tactical understanding all round that the two would stand up under a floral bell some high noon and promise the minister to keep old jerome s money in a state of high commotion but at this point complications must be introduced thirty years before when old jerome was young jerome there was a brother of his named dick dick went west to seek his or somebody else s fortune nothing was heard of him until one day old jerome had a letter from his brother it was badly written on ruled paper that smelled of salt bacon and coffee grounds the writing was asthmatic and the spelling st vitusy it appeared that instead of dick having forced fortune to stand and deliver he had been held up himself and made to give hostages to the enemy that is as his letter disclosed he was on the point of pegging out with a complication of disorders that even whiskey had failed to check all that his thirty years of prospecting had netted him was one daughter nineteen years old as per invoice whom he was shipping east charges prepaid for jerome to clothe feed educate comfort and cherish for the rest of her natural life or until matrimony should them part old jerome was a board walk everybody knows that the world is supported by the shoulders of atlas and that atlas stands on a rail fence and that the rail fence is built on a turtle s back now the turtle has to stand on something and that is a board walk made of men like old jerome i do not know whether immortality shall accrue to man but if not so i would like to know when men like old jerome get what is due them they met nevada warren at the station she was a little girl deeply sunburned and wholesomely good looking with a manner that was frankly unsophisticated yet one that not even a cigar drummer would intrude upon without thinking twice looking at her somehow you would expect to see her in a short skirt and leather leggings shooting glass balls or taming mustangs but in her plain white waist and black skirt she sent you guessing again with an easy exhibition of strength she swung along a heavy valise which the uniformed porters tried in vain to wrest from her i am sure we shall be the best of friends said barbara pecking at the firm sunburned cheek i hope so said nevada dear little niece said old jerome you are as welcome to my home as if it were your father s own thanks said nevada and i am going to call you cousin said gilbert with his charming smile take the valise please said nevada it weighs a million pounds it s got samples from six of dad s old mines in it she explained to barbara i calculate they d assay about nine cents to the thousand tons but i promised him to bring them along ii it is a common custom to refer to the usual complication between one man and two ladies or one lady and two men or a lady and a man and a nobleman or well any of those problems as the triangle but they are never unqualified triangles they are always isosceles never equilateral so upon the coming of nevada warren she and gilbert and barbara ross lined up into such a figurative triangle and of that triangle barbara formed the hypotenuse one morning old jerome was lingering long after breakfast over the dullest morning paper in the city before setting forth to his down town fly trap he had become quite fond of nevada finding in her much of his dead brother s quiet independence and unsuspicious frankness a maid brought in a note for miss nevada warren a messenger boy delivered it at the door please she said he s waiting for an answer nevada who was whistling a spanish waltz between her teeth and watching the carriages and autos roll by in the street took the envelope she knew it was from gilbert before she opened it by the little gold palette in the upper left hand corner after tearing it open she pored over the contents for a while absorbedly then with a serious face she went and stood at her uncle s elbow uncle jerome gilbert is a nice boy isn t he why bless the child said old jerome crackling his paper loudly of course he is i raised him myself he wouldn t write anything to anybody that wasn t exactly i mean that everybody couldn t know and read would he i d just like to see him try it said uncle tearing a handful from his newspaper why what read this note he just sent me uncle and see if you think it s all right and proper you see i don t know much about city people and their ways old jerome threw his paper down and set both his feet upon it he took gilbert s note and fiercely perused it twice and then a third time why child said he you had me almost excited although i was sure of that boy he s a duplicate of his father and he was a gilt edged diamond he only asks if you and barbara will be ready at four o clock this afternoon for an automobile drive over to long island i don t see anything to criticise in it except the stationery i always did hate that shade of blue would it be all right to go asked nevada eagerly yes yes yes child of course why not still it pleases me to see you so careful and candid go by all means i didn t know said nevada demurely i thought i d ask you couldn t you go with us uncle i no no no no i ve ridden once in a car that boy was driving never again but it s entirely proper for you and barbara to go yes yes but i will not no no no no nevada flew to the door and said to the maid you bet we ll go i ll answer for miss barbara tell the boy to say to mr warren you bet we ll go nevada called old jerome pardon me my dear but wouldn t it be as well to send him a note in reply just a line would do no i won t bother about that said nevada gayly gilbert will understand he always does i never rode in an automobile in my life but i ve paddled a canoe down little devil river through the lost horse canon and if it s any livelier than that i d like to know iii two months are supposed to have elapsed barbara sat in the study of the hundred thousand dollar house it was a good place for her many places are provided in the world where men and women may repair for the purpose of extricating themselves from divers difficulties there are cloisters wailing places watering places confessionals hermitages lawyer s offices beauty parlors air ships and studies and the greatest of these are studies it usually takes a hypotenuse a long time to discover that it is the longest side of a triangle but it s a long line that has no turning barbara was alone uncle jerome and nevada had gone to the theatre barbara had not cared to go she wanted to stay at home and study in the study if you miss were a stunning new york girl and saw every day that a brown ingenuous western witch was getting hobbles and a lasso on the young man you wanted for yourself you too would lose taste for the oxidized silver setting of a musical comedy barbara sat by the quartered oak library table her right arm rested upon the table and her dextral fingers nervously manipulated a sealed letter the letter was addressed to nevada warren and in the upper left hand corner of the envelope was gilbert s little gold palette it had been delivered at nine o clock after nevada had left barbara would have given her pearl necklace to know what the letter contained but she could not open and read it by the aid of steam or a pen handle or a hair pin or any of the generally approved methods because her position in society forbade such an act she had tried to read some of the lines of the letter by holding the envelope up to a strong light and pressing it hard against the paper but gilbert had too good a taste in stationery to make that possible at eleven thirty the theatre goers returned it was a delicious winter night even so far as from the cab to the door they were powdered thickly with the big flakes downpouring diagonally from the cast old jerome growled good naturedly about villanous cab service and blockaded streets nevada colored like a rose with sapphire eyes babbled of the stormy nights in the mountains around dad s cabin during all these wintry apostrophes barbara cold at heart sawed wood the only appropriate thing she could think of to do old jerome went immediately up stairs to hot water bottles and quinine nevada fluttered into the study the only cheerfully lighted room subsided into an arm chair and while at the interminable task of unbuttoning her elbow gloves gave oral testimony as to the demerits of the show yes i think mr fields is really amusing sometimes said barbara here is a letter for you dear that came by special delivery just after you had gone who is it from asked nevada tugging at a button well really said barbara with a smile i can only guess the envelope has that queer little thing in one corner that gilbert calls a palette but which looks to me rather like a gilt heart on a school girl s valentine i wonder what he s writing to me about remarked nevada listlessly we re all alike said barbara all women we try to find out what is in a letter by studying the postmark as a last resort we use scissors and read it from the bottom upward here it is she made a motion as if to toss the letter across the table to nevada great catamounts exclaimed nevada these centre fire buttons are a nuisance i d rather wear buckskins oh barbara please shuck the hide off that letter and read it it ll be midnight before i get these gloves off why dear you don t want me to open gilbert s letter to you it s for you and you wouldn t wish any one else to read it of course nevada raised her steady calm sapphire eyes from her gloves nobody writes me anything that everybody mightn t read she said go on barbara maybe gilbert wants us to go out in his car again to morrow curiosity can do more things than kill a cat and if emotions well recognized as feminine are inimical to feline life then jealousy would soon leave the whole world catless barbara opened the letter with an indulgent slightly bored air well dear said she i ll read it if you want me to she slit the envelope and read the missive with swift travelling eyes read it again and cast a quick shrewd glance at nevada who for the time seemed to consider gloves as the world of her interest and letters from rising artists as no more than messages from mars for a quarter of a minute barbara looked at nevada with a strange steadfastness and then a smile so small that it widened her mouth only the sixteenth part of an inch and narrowed her eyes no more than a twentieth flashed like an inspired thought across her face since the beginning no woman has been a mystery to another woman swift as light travels each penetrates the heart and mind of another sifts her sister s words of their cunningest disguises reads her most hidden desires and plucks the sophistry from her wiliest talk like hairs from a comb twiddling them sardonically between her thumb and fingers before letting them float away on the breezes of fundamental doubt long ago eve s son rang the door bell of the family residence in paradise park bearing a strange lady on his arm whom he introduced eve took her daughter in law aside and lifted a classic eyebrow the land of nod said the bride languidly flirting the leaf of a palm i suppose you ve been there of course not lately said eve absolutely unstaggered don t you think the apple sauce they serve over there is execrable i rather like that mulberry leaf tunic effect dear but of course the real fig goods are not to be had over there come over behind this lilac bush while the gentlemen split a celery tonic i think the caterpillar holes have made your dress open a little in the back so then and there according to the records was the alliance formed by the only two who s who ladies in the world then it was agreed that woman should forever remain as clear as a pane of glass though glass was yet to be discovered to other women and that she should palm herself off on man as a mystery barbara seemed to hesitate really nevada she said with a little show of embarrassment you shouldn t have insisted on my opening this i i m sure it wasn t meant for any one else to know nevada forgot her gloves for a moment then read it aloud she said since you ve already read it what s the difference if mr warren has written to me something that any one else oughtn t to know that is all the more reason why everybody should know it well said barbara this is what it says dearest nevada come to my studio at twelve o clock to night do not fail barbara rose and dropped the note in nevada s lap i m awfully sorry she said that i knew it isn t like gilbert there must be some mistake just consider that i am ignorant of it will you dear i must go up stairs now i have such a headache i m sure i don t understand the note perhaps gilbert has been dining too well and will explain good night iv nevada tiptoed to the hall and heard barbara s door close upstairs the bronze clock in the study told the hour of twelve was fifteen minutes away she ran swiftly to the front door and let herself out into the snow storm gilbert warren s studio was six squares away by aerial ferry the white silent forces of the storm attacked the city from beyond the sullen east river already the snow lay a foot deep on the pavements the drifts heaping themselves like scaling ladders against the walls of the besieged town the avenue was as quiet as a street in pompeii cabs now and then skimmed past like white winged gulls over a moonlit ocean and less frequent motor cars sustaining the comparison hissed through the foaming waves like submarine boats on their jocund perilous journeys nevada plunged like a wind driven storm petrel on her way she looked up at the ragged sierras of cloud capped buildings that rose above the streets shaded by the night lights and the congealed vapors to gray drab ashen lavender dun and cerulean tints they were so like the wintry mountains of her western home that she felt a satisfaction such as the hundred thousand dollar house had seldom brought her a policeman caused her to waver on a corner just by his eye and weight hello mabel said he kind of late for you to be out ain t it i i am just going to the drug store said nevada hurrying past him the excuse serves as a passport for the most sophisticated does it prove that woman never progresses or that she sprang from adam s rib full fledged in intellect and wiles turning eastward the direct blast cut down nevada s speed one half she made zigzag tracks in the snow but she was as tough as a pinon sapling and bowed to it as gracefully suddenly the studio building loomed before her a familiar landmark like a cliff above some well remembered canon the haunt of business and its hostile neighbor art was darkened and silent the elevator stopped at ten up eight flights of stygian stairs nevada climbed and rapped firmly at the door numbered she had been there many times before with barbara and uncle jerome gilbert opened the door he had a crayon pencil in one hand a green shade over his eyes and a pipe in his mouth the pipe dropped to the floor am i late asked nevada i came as quick as i could uncle and me were at the theatre this evening here i am gilbert gilbert did a pygmalion and galatea act he changed from a statue of stupefaction to a young man with a problem to tackle he admitted nevada got a whiskbroom and began to brush the snow from her clothes a great lamp with a green shade hung over an easel where the artist had been sketching in crayon you wanted me said nevada simply and i came you said so in your letter what did you send for me for you read my letter inquired gilbert sparring for wind barbara read it to me i saw it afterward it said come to my studio at twelve to night and do not fail i thought you were sick of course but you don t seem to be aha said gilbert irrelevantly i ll tell you why i asked you to come nevada i want you to marry me immediately to night what s a little snow storm will you do it you might have noticed that i would long ago said nevada and i m rather stuck on the snow storm idea myself i surely would hate one of these flowery church noon weddings gilbert i didn t know you had grit enough to propose it this way let s shock em it s our funeral ain t it you bet said gilbert where did i hear that expression he added to himself wait a minute nevada i want to do a little phoning he shut himself in a little dressing room and called upon the lightnings of tile heavens condensed into unromantic numbers and districts that you jack you confounded sleepyhead yes wake up this is me or i oh bother the difference in grammar i m going to be married right away yes wake up your sister don t answer me back bring her along too you must remind agnes of the time i saved her from drowning in lake ronkonkoma i know it s caddish to refer to it but she must come with you yes nevada is here waiting we ve been engaged quite a while some opposition among the relatives you know and we have to pull it off this way we re waiting here for you don t let agnes out talk you bring her you will good old boy i ll order a carriage to call for you double quick time confound you jack you re all right gilbert returned to the room where nevada waited my old friend jack peyton and his sister were to have been here at a quarter to twelve he explained but jack is so confoundedly slow i ve just phoned them to hurry they ll be here in a few minutes i m the happiest man in the world nevada what did you do with the letter i sent you to day i ve got it cinched here said nevada pulling it out from beneath her opera cloak gilbert drew the letter from the envelope and looked it over carefully then he looked at nevada thoughtfully didn t you think it rather queer that i should ask you to come to my studio at midnight he asked why no said nevada rounding her eyes not if you needed me out west when a pal sends you a hurry call ain t that what you say here we get there first and talk about it after the row is over and it s usually snowing there too when things happen so i didn t mind gilbert rushed into another room and came back burdened with overcoats warranted to turn wind rain or snow put this raincoat on he said holding it for her we have a quarter of a mile to go old jack and his sister will be here in a few minutes he began to struggle into a heavy coat oh nevada he said just look at the head lines on the front page of that evening paper on the table will you it s about your section of the west and i know it will interest you he waited a full minute pretending to find trouble in the getting on of his overcoat and then turned nevada had not moved she was looking at him with strange and pensive directness her cheeks had a flush on them beyond the color that had been contributed by the wind and snow but her eyes were steady i was going to tell you she said anyhow before you before we before well before anything dad never gave me a day of schooling i never learned to read or write a darned word now if pounding their uncertain way up stairs the feet of jack the somnolent and agnes the grateful were heard v when mr and mrs gilbert warren were spinning softly homeward in a closed carriage after the ceremony gilbert s said nevada would you really like to know what i wrote you in the letter that you received to night fire away said his bride word for word said gilbert it was this my dear miss warren you were right about the flower it was a hydrangea and not a lilac all right said nevada but let s forget it the joke s on barbara anyway thimble thimble these are the directions for finding the i office of carteret carteret mill supplies and leather belting you follow the broadway trail down until you pass the crosstown line the bread line and the dead line and come to the big canons of the moneygrubber tribe then you turn to the left to the right dodge a push cart and the tongue of a two ton four horse dray and hop skip and jump to a granite ledge on the side of a twenty one story synthetic mountain of stone and iron in the twelfth story is the office of carteret carteret the factory where they make the mill supplies and leather belting is in brooklyn those commodities to say nothing of brooklyn not being of interest to you let us hold the incidents within the confines of a one act one scene play thereby lessening the toil of the reader and the expenditure of the publisher so if you have the courage to face four pages of type and carteret carteret s office boy percival you shall sit on a varnished chair in the inner office and peep at the little comedy of the old nigger man the hunting case watch and the open faced question mostly borrowed from the late mr frank stockton as you will conclude first biography but pared to the quick must intervene i am for the inverted sugar coated quinine pill the bitter on the outside the carterets were or was columbia college professors please rule an old virginia family long time ago the gentlemen of the family had worn lace ruffles and carried tinless foils and owned plantations and had slaves to burn but the war had greatly reduced their holdings of course you can perceive at once that this flavor has been shoplifted from mr f hopkinson smith in spite of the et after carter well anyhow in digging up the carteret history i shall not take you farther back than the year the two original american carterets came over in that year but by different means of transportation one brother named john came in the mayflower and became a pilgrim father you ve seen his picture on the covers of the thanksgiving magazines hunting turkeys in the deep snow with a blunderbuss blandford carteret the other brother crossed the pond in his own brigantine landed on the virginia coast and became an f f v john became distinguished for piety and shrewdness in business blandford for his pride juleps marksmanship and vast slave cultivated plantations then came the civil war i must condense this historical interpolation stonewall jackson was shot lee surrendered grant toured the world cotton went to nine cents old crow whiskey and jim crow cars were invented the seventy ninth massachusetts volunteers returned to the ninety seventh alabama zouaves the battle flag of lundy s lane which they bought at a second hand store in chelsea kept by a man named skzchnzski georgia sent the president a sixty pound watermelon and that brings us up to the time when the story begins my but that was sparring for an opening i really must brush op on my aristotle the yankee carterets went into business in new york long before the war their house as far as leather belting and mill supplies was concerned was as musty and arrogant and solid as one of those old east india tea importing concerns that you read about in dickens there were some rumors of a war behind its counters but not enough to affect the business during and after the war blandford carteret f f v lost his plantations juleps marksmanship and life he bequeathed little more than his pride to his surviving family so it came to pass that blandford carteret the fifth aged fifteen was invited by the leather and millsupplies branch of that name to come north and learn business instead of hunting foxes and boasting of the glory of his fathers on the reduced acres of his impoverished family the boy jumped at the chance and at the age of twenty five sat in the office of the firm equal partner with john the fifth of the blunderbuss and turkey branch here the story begins again the young men were about the same age smooth of face alert easy of manner and with an air that promised mental and physical quickness they were razored blue serged straw hatted and pearl stick pinned like other young new yorkers who might be millionaires or bill clerks one afternoon at four o clock in the private office of the firm blandford carteret opened a letter that a clerk had just brought to his desk after reading it he chuckled audibly for nearly a minute john looked around from his desk inquiringly it s from mother said blandford i ll read you the funny part of it she tells me all the neighborhood news first of course and then cautions me against getting my feet wet and musical comedies after that come some vital statistics about calves and pigs and an estimate of the wheat crop and now i ll quote some and what do you think old uncle jake who was seventy six last wednesday must go travelling nothing would do but he must go to new york and see his young marster blandford old as he is he has a deal of common sense so i ve let him go i couldn t refuse him he seemed to have concentrated all his hopes and desires into this one adventure into the wide world you know he was born on the plantation and has never been ten miles away from it in his life and he was your father s body servant during the war and has been always a faithful vassal and servant of the family he has often seen the gold watch the watch that was your father s and your father s father s i told him it was to be yours and he begged me to allow him to take it to you and to put it into your hands himself so he has it carefully inclosed in a buck skin case and is bringing it to you with all the pride and importance of a king s messenger i gave him money for the round trip and for a two weeks stay in the city i wish you would see to it that he gets comfortable quarters jake won t need much looking after he s able to take care of himself but i have read in the papers that african bishops and colored potentates generally have much trouble in obtaining food and lodging in the yankee metropolis that may be all right but i don t see why the best hotel there shouldn t take jake in still i suppose it s a rule i gave him full directions about finding you and packed his valise myself you won t have to bother with him but i do hope you ll see that he is made comfortable take the watch that he brings you it s almost a decoration it has been worn by true carterets and there isn t a stain upon it nor a false movement of the wheels bringing it to you is the crowning joy of old jake s life i wanted him to have that little outing and that happiness before it is too late you have often heard us talk about how jake pretty badly wounded himself crawled through the reddened grass at chancellorsville to where your father lay with the bullet in his dear heart and took the watch from his pocket to keep it from the yanks so my son when the old man comes consider him as a frail but worthy messenger from the old time life and home you have been so long away from home and so long among the people that we have always regarded as aliens that i m not sure that jake will know you when he sees you but jake has a keen perception and i rather believe that he will know a virginia carteret at sight i can t conceive that even ten years in yankee land could change a boy of mine anyhow i m sure you will know jake i put eighteen collars in his valise if he should have to buy others he wears a number please see that he gets the right ones he will be no trouble to you at all if you are not too busy i d like for you to find him a place to board where they have white meal corn bread and try to keep him from taking his shoes off in your office or on the street his right foot swells a little and he likes to be comfortable if you can spare the time count his handkerchiefs when they come back from the wash i bought him a dozen new ones before he left he should be there about the time this letter reaches you i told him to go straight to your office when he arrives as soon as blandford had finished the reading of this something happened as there should happen in stories and must happen on the stage percival the office boy with his air of despising the world s output of mill supplies and leather belting came in to announce that a colored gentleman was outside to see mr blandford carteret bring him in said blandford rising john carteret swung around in his chair and said to percival ask him to wait a few minutes outside we ll let you know when to bring him in then he turned to his cousin with one of those broad slow smiles that was an inheritance of all the carterets and said bland i ve always had a consuming curiosity to understand the differences that you haughty southerners believe to exist between you all and the people of the north of course i know that you consider yourselves made out of finer clay and look upon adam as only a collateral branch of your ancestry but i don t know why i never could understand the differences between us well john said blandford laughing what you don t understand about it is just the difference of course i suppose it was the feudal way in which we lived that gave us our lordly baronial airs and feeling of superiority but you are not feudal now went on john since we licked you and stole your cotton and mules you ve had to go to work just as we damyankees as you call us have always been doing and you re just as proud and exclusive and upper classy as you were before the war so it wasn t your money that caused it maybe it was the climate said blandford lightly or maybe our negroes spoiled us i ll call old jake in now i ll be glad to see the old villain again wait just a moment said john i ve got a little theory i want to test you and i are pretty much alike in our general appearance old jake hasn t seen you since you were fifteen let s have him in and play fair and see which of us gets the watch the old darky surrey ought to be able to pick out his young marster without any trouble the alleged aristocratic superiority of a reb ought to be visible to him at once he couldn t make the mistake of handing over the timepiece to a yankee of course the loser buys the dinner this evening and two dozen collars for jake is it a go blandford agreed heartily percival was summoned and told to usher the colored gentleman in uncle jake stepped inside the private office cautiously he was a little old man as black as soot wrinkled and bald except for a fringe of white wool cut decorously short that ran over his ears and around his head there was nothing of the stage uncle about him his black suit nearly fitted him his shoes shone and his straw hat was banded with a gaudy ribbon in his right hand he carried something carefully concealed by his closed fingers uncle jake stopped a few steps from the door two young men sat in their revolving desk chairs ten feet apart and looked at him in friendly silence his gaze slowly shifted many times from one to the other he felt sure that he was in the presence of one at least of the revered family among whose fortunes his life had begun and was to end one had the pleasing but haughty carteret air the other had the unmistakable straight long family nose both had the keen black eyes horizontal brows and thin smiling lips that had distinguished both the carteret of the mayflower and him of the brigantine old jake had thought that he could have picked out his young master instantly from a thousand northerners but he found himself in difficulties the best he could do was to use strategy howdy marse blandford howdy suh he said looking midway between the two young men howdy uncle jake they both answered pleasantly and in unison sit down have you brought the watch uncle jake chose a hard bottom chair at a respectful distance sat on the edge of it and laid his hat carefully on the floor the watch in its buckskin case he gripped tightly he had not risked his life on the battle field to rescue that watch from his old marster s foes to hand it over again to the enemy without a struggle yes suh i got it in my hand suh i m gwine give it to you right away in jus a minute old missus told me to put it in young marse blandford s hand and tell him to wear it for the family pride and honor it was a mighty longsome trip for an old nigger man to make ten thousand miles it must be back to old vi ginia suh you ve growed mightily young marster i wouldn t have reconnized you but for yo powerful resemblance to old marster with admirable diplomacy the old man kept his eyes roaming in the space between the two men his words might have been addressed to either though neither wicked nor perverse he was seeking for a sign blandford and john exchanged winks i reckon you done got you ma s letter went on uncle jake she said she was gwine to write to you bout my comin along up this er way yes yes uncle jake said john briskly my cousin and i have just been notified to expect you we are both carterets you know although one of us said blandford was born and raised in the north so if you will hand over the watch said john my cousin and i said blandford will then see to it said john that comfortable quarters are found for you said blandford with creditable ingenuity old jake set up a cackling high pitched protracted laugh he beat his knee picked up his hat and bent the brim in an apparent paroxysm of humorous appreciation the seizure afforded him a mask behind which he could roll his eyes impartially between above and beyond his two tormentors i sees what he chuckled after a while you gen lemen is tryin to have fun with the po old nigger but you can t fool old jake i knowed you marse blandford the minute i sot eyes on you you was a po skimpy little boy no mo than about fo teen when you lef home to come no th but i knowed you the minute i sot eyes on you you is the mawtal image of old marster the other gen leman resembles you mightily suh but you can t fool old jake on a member of the old vi ginia family no suh at exactly the same time both carterets smiled and extended a hand for the watch uncle jake s wrinkled black face lost the expression of amusement to which he had vainly twisted it he knew that he was being teased and that it made little real difference as far as its safety went into which of those outstretched hands he placed the family treasure but it seemed to him that not only his own pride and loyalty but much of the virginia carterets was at stake he had heard down south during the war about that other branch of the family that lived in the north and fought on the yuther side and it had always grieved him he had followed his old marster s fortunes from stately luxury through war to almost poverty and now with the last relic and reminder of him blessed by old missus and intrusted implicitly to his care he had come ten thousand miles as it seemed to deliver it into the hands of the one who was to wear it and wind it and cherish it and listen to it tick off the unsullied hours that marked the lives of the carterets of virginia his experience and conception of the yankees had been an impression of tyrants low down common trash in blue laying waste with fire and sword he had seen the smoke of many burning homesteads almost as grand as carteret hall ascending to the drowsy southern skies and now he was face to face with one of them and he could not distinguish him from his young marster whom he had come to find and bestow upon him the emblem of his kingship even as the arm clothed in white samite mystic wonderful laid excalibur in the right hand of arthur he saw before him two young men easy kind courteous welcoming either of whom might have been the one he sought troubled bewildered sorely grieved at his weakness of judgment old jake abandoned his loyal subterfuges his right hand sweated against the buckskin cover of the watch he was deeply humiliated and chastened seriously now his prominent yellow white eyes closely scanned the two young men at the end of his scrutiny he was conscious of but one difference between them one wore a narrow black tie with a white pearl stickpin the other s four in hand was a narrow blue one pinned with a black pearl and then to old jake s relief there came a sudden distraction drama knocked at the door with imperious knuckles and forced comedy to the wings and drama peeped with a smiling but set face over the footlights percival the hater of mill supplies brought in a card which he handed with the manner of one bearing a cartel to blue tie olivia de ormond read blue tie from the card he looked inquiringly at his cousin why not have her in said black tie and bring matters to a conclusion uncle jake said one of the young men would you mind taking that chair over there in the corner for a while a lady is coming in on some business we ll take up your case afterward the lady whom percival ushered in was young and petulantly decidedly freshly consciously and intentionally pretty she was dressed with such expensive plainness that she made you consider lace and ruffles as mere tatters and rags but one great ostrich plume that she wore would have marked her anywhere in the army of beauty as the wearer of the merry helmet of navarre miss de ormond accepted the swivel chair at blue tie s desk then the gentlemen drew leather upholstered seats conveniently near and spoke of the weather yes said she i noticed it was warmer but i mustn t take up too much of your time during business hours that is she continued unless we talk business she addressed her words to blue tie with a charming smile very well said he you don t mind my cousin being present do you we are generally rather confidential with each other especially in business matters oh no caroled miss de ormond i d rather he did hear he knows all about it anyhow in fact he s quite a material witness because he was present when you when it happened i thought you might want to talk things over before well before any action is taken as i believe the lawyers say have you anything in the way of a proposition to make asked black tie miss de ormond looked reflectively at the neat toe of one of her dull kid pumps i had a proposal made to me she said if the proposal sticks it cuts out the proposition let s have that settled first well as far as began blue tie excuse me cousin interrupted black tie if you don t mind my cutting in and then he turned

the two surly tramps made a collection of all the matches in the party whistling dick contributing his quota with propitiatory alacrity and then they departed in the dim starlight in the direction of the road of the three remaining vagrants two goggles and indiana tom reclined lazily upon convenient lumber and regarded whistling dick with undisguised disfavour boston observing that the dissenting recruit was disposed to remain peaceably relaxed a little of his vigilance whistling dick arose presently and strolled leisurely up and down keeping carefully within the territory assigned him dis

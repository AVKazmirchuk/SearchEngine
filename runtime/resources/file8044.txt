sprung to his feet upsetting the chair the words of katie reverberated in his ears they re going to eat me sam this then was the monstrous fate to which she had been delivered by her unnatural parent the carriage he had seen drive up from the plaza was captain peek s where was katie perhaps already before he could decide what to do a loud scream came from the tent the old mexican woman ran out a flashing knife in her hand i have released her she cried you shall kill no more they will hang you ingrato encatador torres with a hissing exclamation sprang at her ramoncito she shrieked once you loved me the mexican s arm raised and descended you are old he cried and she fell and lay motionless another scream the flaps of the tent were flung aside and there stood katie white with fear her wrists still bound with a cruel cord sam she cried save me again tansey rounded the table and flung himself with superb nerve upon the mexican just then a clangour began the clocks of the city were tolling the midnight hour tansey clutched at torres and for a moment felt in his grasp the crunch of velvet and the cold facets of the glittering gems the next instant the bedecked caballero turned in his hands to a shrunken leather visaged white bearded old old screaming mummy sandalled ragged and four hundred and three the mexican woman was crawling to her feet and laughing she shook her brown hand in the face of the whining viejo go now she cried and seek your senorita it was i ramoncito who brought you to this within each moon you eat of the life giving chili it was i that kept the wrong time for you you should have eaten yesterday instead of to morrow it is too late off with you hombre you are too old for me this decided tansey releasing his hold of the gray beard is a private family matter concerning age and no business of mine with one of the table knives he hastened to saw asunder the fetters of the fair captive and then for the second time that night he kissed katie peek tasted again the sweetness the wonder the thrill of it attained once more the maximum of his incessant dreams the next instant an icy blade was driven deep between his shoulders he felt his blood slowly congeal heard the senile cackle of the perennial spaniard saw the plaza rise and reel till the zenith crashed into the horizon and knew no more when tansey opened his eyes again he was sitting upon those self same steps gazing upon the dark bulk of the sleeping convent in the middle of his back was still the acute chilling pain how had he been conveyed back there again he got stiffly to his feet and stretched his cramped limbs supporting himself against the stonework he revolved in his mind the extravagant adventures that had befallen him each time he had strayed from the steps that night in reviewing them certain features strained his credulity had he really met captain peek or katie or the unparalleled mexican in his wanders had he really encountered them under commonplace conditions and his over stimulated brain had supplied the incongruities however that might be a sudden elating thought caused him an intense joy nearly all of us have at some point in our lives either to excuse our own stupidity or to placate our consciences promulgated some theory of fatalism we have set up an intelligent fate that works by codes and signals tansey had done likewise and now he read through the night s incidents the finger prints of destiny each excursion that he had made had led to the one paramount finale to katie and that kiss which survived and grew strong and intoxicating in his memory clearly fate was holding up to him the mirror that night calling him to observe what awaited him at the end of whichever road he might take he immediately turned and hurried homeward clothed in an elaborate pale blue wrapper cut to fit miss katie peek reclined in an armchair before a waning fire in her room her little bare feet were thrust into house shoes rimmed with swan s down by the light of a small lamp she was attacking the society news of the latest sunday paper some happy substance seemingly indestructible was being rhythmically crushed between her small white teeth miss katie read of functions and furbelows but she kept a vigilant ear for outside sounds and a frequent eye upon the clock over the mantel at every footstep upon the asphalt sidewalk her smooth round chin would cease for a moment its regular rise and fall and a frown of listening would pucker her pretty brows at last she heard the latch of the iron gate click she sprang up tripped softly to the mirror where she made a few of those feminine flickering passes at her front hair and throat which are warranted to hypnotize the approaching guest the door bell rang miss katie in her haste turned the blaze of the lamp lower instead of higher and hastened noiselessly down stairs into the hall she turned the key the door opened and mr tansey side stepped in why the i de a exclaimed miss katie is this you mr tansey it s after midnight aren t you ashamed to wake me up at such an hour to let you in you re just awful i was late said tansey brilliantly i should think you were ma was awfully worried about you when you weren t in by ten that hateful tom mcgill said you were out calling on another said you were out calling on some young lady i just despise mr mcgill well i m not going to scold you any more mr tansey if it is a little late oh i turned it the wrong way miss katie gave a little scream absent mindedly she had turned the blaze of the lamp entirely out instead of higher it was very dark tansey heard a musical soft giggle and breathed an entrancing odour of heliotrope a groping light hand touched his arm how awkward i was can you find your way sam i i think i have a match miss k katie a scratching sound a flame a glow of light held at arm s length by the recreant follower of destiny illuminating a tableau which shall end the ignominious chronicle a maid with unkissed curling contemptuous lips slowly lifting the lamp chimney and allowing the wick to ignite then waving a scornful and abjuring hand toward the staircase the unhappy tansey erstwhile champion in the prophetic lists of fortune ingloriously ascending to his just and certain doom while let us imagine half within the wings stands the imminent figure of fate jerking wildly at the wrong strings and mixing things up in her usual able manner a departmental case in texas you may travel a thousand miles in a straight line if your course is a crooked one it is likely that both the distance and your rate of speed may be vastly increased clouds there sail serenely against the wind the whip poor will delivers its disconsolate cry with the notes exactly reversed from those of his northern brother given a drought and a subsequently lively rain and lo from a glazed and stony soil will spring in a single night blossomed lilies miraculously fair tom green county was once the standard of measurement i have forgotten how many new jerseys and rhode islands it was that could have been stowed away and lost in its chaparral but the legislative axe has slashed tom green into a handful of counties hardly larger than european kingdoms the legislature convenes at austin near the centre of the state and while the representative from the rio grande country is gathering his palm leaf fan and his linen duster to set out for the capital the pan handle solon winds his muffler above his well buttoned overcoat and kicks the snow from his well greased boots ready for the same journey all this merely to hint that the big ex republic of the southwest forms a sizable star on the flag and to prepare for the corollary that things sometimes happen there uncut to pattern and unfettered by metes and bounds the commissioner of insurance statistics and history of the state of texas was an official of no very great or very small importance the past tense is used for now he is commissioner of insurance alone statistic and history are no longer proper nouns in the government records in the year the governor appointed luke coonrod standifer to be the head of this department standifer was then fifty five years of age and a texan to the core his father had been one of the state s earliest settlers and pioneers standifer himself had served the commonwealth as indian fighter soldier ranger and legislator much learning he did not claim but he had drank pretty deep of the spring of experience if other grounds were less abundant texas should be well up in the lists of glory as the grateful republic for both as republic and state it has busily heaped honours and solid rewards upon its sons who rescued it from the wilderness wherefore and therefore luke coonrod standifer son of ezra standifer ex terry ranger simon pure democrat and lucky dweller in an unrepresented portion of the politico geographical map was appointed commissioner of insurance statistics and history standifer accepted the honour with some doubt as to the nature of the office he was to fill and his capacity for filling it but he accepted and by wire he immediately set out from the little country town where he maintained and was scarcely maintained by a somnolent and unfruitful office of surveying and map drawing before departing he had looked up under the i s s s and h s in the encyclopaedia britannica what information and preparation toward his official duties that those weighty volumes afforded a few weeks of incumbency diminished the new commissioner s awe of the great and important office he had been called upon to conduct an increasing familiarity with its workings soon restored him to his accustomed placid course of life in his office was an old spectacled clerk a consecrated informed able machine who held his desk regardless of changes of administrative heads old kauffman instructed his new chief gradually in the knowledge of the department without seeming to do so and kept the wheels revolving without the slip of a cog indeed the department of insurance statistics and history carried no great heft of the burden of state its main work was the regulating of the business done in the state by foreign insurance companies and the letter of the law was its guide as for statistics well you wrote letters to county officers and scissored other people s reports and each year you got out a report of your own about the corn crop and the cotton crop and pecans and pigs and black and white population and a great many columns of figures headed bushels and acres and square miles etc and there you were history the branch was purely a receptive one old ladies interested in the science bothered you some with long reports of proceedings of their historical societies some twenty or thirty people would write you each year that they had secured sam houston s pocket knife or santa ana s whisky flask or davy crockett s rifle all absolutely authenticated and demanded legislative appropriation to purchase most of the work in the history branch went into pigeon holes one sizzling august afternoon the commissioner reclined in his office chair with his feet upon the long official table covered with green billiard cloth the commissioner was smoking a cigar and dreamily regarding the quivering landscape framed by the window that looked upon the treeless capitol grounds perhaps he was thinking of the rough and ready life he had led of the old days of breathless adventure and movement of the comrades who now trod other paths or had ceased to tread any of the changes civilization and peace had brought and maybe complacently of the snug and comfortable camp pitched for him under the dome of the capitol of the state that had not forgotten his services the business of the department was lax insurance was easy statistics were not in demand history was dead old kauffman the efficient and perpetual clerk had requested an infrequent half holiday incited to the unusual dissipation by the joy of having successfully twisted the tail of a connecticut insurance company that was trying to do business contrary to the edicts of the great lone star state the office was very still a few subdued noises trickled in through the open door from the other departments a dull tinkling crash from the treasurer s office adjoining as a clerk tossed a bag of silver to the floor of the vault the vague intermittent clatter of a dilatory typewriter a dull tapping from the state geologist s quarters as if some woodpecker had flown in to bore for his prey in the cool of the massive building and then a faint rustle and the light shuffling of the well worn shoes along the hall the sounds ceasing at the door toward which the commissioner s lethargic back was presented following this the sound of a gentle voice speaking words unintelligible to the commissioner s somewhat dormant comprehension but giving evidence of bewilderment and hesitation the voice was feminine the commissioner was of the race of cavaliers who make salaam before the trail of a skirt without considering the quality of its cloth there stood in the door a faded woman one of the numerous sisterhood of the unhappy she was dressed all in black poverty s perpetual mourning for lost joys her face had the contours of twenty and the lines of forty she may have lived that intervening score of years in a twelve month there was about her yet an aurum of indignant unappeased protesting youth that shone faintly through the premature veil of unearned decline i beg your pardon ma am said the commissioner gaining his feet to the accompaniment of a great creaking and sliding of his chair are you the governor sir asked the vision of melancholy the commissioner hesitated at the end of his best bow with his hand in the bosom of his double breasted frock truth at last conquered well no ma am i am not the governor i have the honour to be commissioner of insurance statistics and history is there anything ma am i can do for you won t you have a chair ma am the lady subsided into the chair handed her probably from purely physical reasons she wielded a cheap fan last token of gentility to be abandoned her clothing seemed to indicate a reduction almost to extreme poverty she looked at the man who was not the governor and saw kindliness and simplicity and a rugged unadorned courtliness emanating from a countenance tanned and toughened by forty years of outdoor life also she saw that his eyes were clear and strong and blue just so they had been when he used them to skim the horizon for raiding kiowas and sioux his mouth was as set and firm as it had been on that day when he bearded the old lion sam houston himself and defied him during that season when secession was the theme now in bearing and dress luke coonrod sandifer endeavoured to do credit to the important arts and sciences of insurance statistics and history he had abandoned the careless dress of his country home now his broad brimmed black slouch hat and his long tailed frock made him not the least imposing of the official family even if his office was reckoned to stand at the tail of the list you wanted to see the governor ma am asked the commissioner with a deferential manner he always used toward the fair sex i hardly know said the lady hesitatingly i suppose so and then suddenly drawn by the sympathetic look of the other she poured forth the story of her need it was a story so common that the public has come to look at its monotony instead of its pity the old tale of an unhappy married life made so by a brutal conscienceless husband a robber a spendthrift a moral coward and a bully who failed to provide even the means of the barest existence yes he had come down in the scale so low as to strike her it happened only the day before there was the bruise on one temple she had offended his highness by asking for a little money to live on and yet she must needs woman like append a plea for her tyrant he was drinking he had rarely abused her thus when sober i thought mourned this pale sister of sorrow that maybe the state might be willing to give me some relief i ve heard of such things being done for the families of old settlers i ve heard tell that the state used to give land to the men who fought for it against mexico and settled up the country and helped drive out the indians my father did all of that and he never received anything he never would take it i thought the governor would be the one to see and that s why i came if father was entitled to anything they might let it come to me it s possible ma am said standifer that such might be the case but most all the veterans and settlers got their land certificates issued and located long ago still we can look that up in the land office and be sure your father s name now was amos colvin sir good lord exclaimed standifer rising and unbuttoning his tight coat excitedly are you amos colvin s daughter why ma am amos colvin and me were thicker than two hoss thieves for more than ten years we fought kiowas drove cattle and rangered side by side nearly all over texas i remember seeing you once before now you were a kid about seven a riding a little yellow pony up and down amos and me stopped at your home for a little grub when we were trailing that band of mexican cattle thieves down through karnes and bee great tarantulas and you re amos colvin s little girl did you ever hear your father mention luke standifer just kind of casually as if he d met me once or twice a little pale smile flitted across the lady s white face it seems to me she said that i don t remember hearing him talk about much else every day there was some story he had to tell about what he and you had done mighty near the last thing i heard him tell was about the time when the indians wounded him and you crawled out to him through the grass with a canteen of water while they yes yes well oh that wasn t anything said standifer hemming loudly and buttoning his coat again briskly and now ma am who was the infernal skunk i beg your pardon ma am who was the gentleman you married benton sharp the commissioner plumped down again into his chair with a groan this gentle sad little woman in the rusty black gown the daughter of his oldest friend the wife of benton sharp benton sharp one of the most noted bad men in that part of the state a man who had been a cattle thief an outlaw a desperado and was now a gambler a swaggering bully who plied his trade in the larger frontier towns relying upon his record and the quickness of his gun play to maintain his supremacy seldom did any one take the risk of going up against benton sharp even the law officers were content to let him make his own terms of peace sharp was a ready and an accurate shot and as lucky as a brand new penny at coming clear from his scrapes standifer wondered how this pillaging eagle ever came to be mated with amos colvin s little dove and expressed his wonder mrs sharp sighed you see mr standifer we didn t know anything about him and he can be very pleasant and kind when he wants to we lived down in the little town of goliad benton came riding down that way and stopped there a while i reckon i was some better looking then than i am now he was good to me for a whole year after we were married he insured his life for me for five thousand dollars but for the last six months he has done everything but kill me i often wish he had done that too he got out of money for a while and abused me shamefully for not having anything he could spend then father died and left me the little home in goliad my husband made me sell that and turned me out into the world i ve barely been able to live for i m not strong enough to work lately i heard he was making money in san antonio so i went there and found him and asked for a little help this touching the livid bruise on her temple is what he gave me so i came on to austin to see the governor i once heard father say that there was some land or a pension coming to him from the state that he never would ask for luke standifer rose to his feet and pushed his chair back he looked rather perplexedly around the big office with its handsome furniture it s a long trail to follow he said slowly trying to get back dues from the government there s red tape and lawyers and rulings and evidence and courts to keep you waiting i m not certain continued the commissioner with a profoundly meditative frown whether this department that i m the boss of has any jurisdiction or not it s only insurance statistics and history ma am and it don t sound as if it would cover the case but sometimes a saddle blanket can be made to stretch you keep your seat just for a few minutes ma am till i step into the next room and see about it the state treasurer was seated within his massive complicated railings reading a newspaper business for the day was about over the clerks lolled at their desks awaiting the closing hour the commissioner of insurance statistics and history entered and leaned in at the window the treasurer a little brisk old man with snow white moustache and beard jumped up youthfully and came forward to greet standifer they were friends of old uncle frank said the commissioner using the familiar name by which the historic treasurer was addressed by every texan how much money have you got on hand the treasurer named the sum of the last balance down to the odd cents something more than a million dollars the commissioner whistled lowly and his eyes grew hopefully bright you know or else you ve heard of amos colvin uncle frank knew him well said the treasurer promptly a good man a valuable citizen one of the first settlers in the southwest his daughter said standifer is sitting in my office she s penniless she s married to benton sharp a coyote and a murderer he s reduced her to want and broken her heart her father helped build up this state and it s the state s turn to help his child a couple of thousand dollars will buy back her home and let her live in peace the state of texas can t afford to refuse it give me the money uncle frank and i ll give it to her right away we ll fix up the red tape business afterward the treasurer looked a little bewildered why standifer he said you know i can t pay a cent out of the treasury without a warrant from the comptroller i can t disburse a dollar without a voucher to show for it the commissioner betrayed a slight impatience i ll give you a voucher he declared what s this job they ve given me for am i just a knot on a mesquite stump can t my office stand for it charge it up to insurance and the other two sideshows don t statistics show that amos colvin came to this state when it was in the hands of greasers and rattlesnakes and comanches and fought day and night to make a white man s country of it don t they show that amos colvin s daughter is brought to ruin by a villain who s trying to pull down what you and i and old texans shed our blood to build up don t history show that the lone star state never yet failed to grant relief to the suffering and oppressed children of the men who made her the grandest commonwealth in the union if statistics and history don t bear out the claim of amos colvin s child i ll ask the next legislature to abolish my office come now uncle frank let her have the money i ll sign the papers officially if you say so and then if the governor or the comptroller or the janitor or anybody else makes a kick by the lord i ll refer the matter to the people and see if they won t endorse the act the treasurer looked sympathetic but shocked the commissioner s voice had grown louder as he rounded off the sentences that however praiseworthy they might be in sentiment reflected somewhat upon the capacity of the head of a more or less important department of state the clerks were beginning to listen now standifer said the treasurer soothingly you know i d like to help in this matter but stop and think a moment please every cent in the treasury is expended only by appropriation made by the legislature and drawn out by checks issued by the comptroller i can t control the use of a cent of it neither can you your department isn t disbursive it isn t even administrative it s purely clerical the only way for the lady to obtain relief is to petition the legislature and to the devil with the legislature said standifer turning away the treasurer called him back i d be glad standifer to contribute a hundred dollars personally toward the immediate expenses of colvin s daughter he reached for his pocketbook never mind uncle frank said the commissioner in a softer tone there s no need of that she hasn t asked for anything of that sort yet besides her case is in my hands i see now what a little rag tag bob tail gotch eared department i ve been put in charge of it seems to be about as important as an almanac or a hotel register but while i m running it it won t turn away any daughters of amos colvin without stretching its jurisdiction to cover if possible you want to keep your eye on the department of insurance statistics and history the commissioner returned to his office looking thoughtful he opened and closed an inkstand on his desk many times with extreme and undue attention why don t you get a divorce he asked suddenly i haven t the money to pay for it answered the lady just at present announced the commissioner in a formal tone the powers of my department appear to be considerably string halted statistics seem to be overdrawn at the bank and history isn t good for a square meal but you ve come to the right place ma am the department will see you through where did you say your husband is ma am he was in san antonio yesterday he is living there now suddenly the commissioner abandoned his official air he took the faded little woman s hands in his and spoke in the old voice he used on the trail and around campfires your name s amanda isn t it yes sir i thought so i ve heard your dad say it often enough well amanda here s your father s best friend the head of a big office in the state government that s going to help you out of your troubles and here s the old bushwhacker and cowpuncher that your father has helped out of scrapes time and time again wants to ask you a question amanda have you got money enough to run you for the next two or three days mrs sharp s white face flushed the least bit plenty sir for a few days all right then ma am now you go back where you are stopping here and you come to the office again the day after to morrow at four o clock in the afternoon very likely by that time there will be something definite to report to you the commissioner hesitated and looked a trifle embarrassed you said your husband had insured his life for do you know whether the premiums have been kept paid upon it or not he paid for a whole year in advance about five months ago said mrs sharp i have the policy and receipts in my trunk oh that s all right then said standifer it s best to look after things of that sort some day they may come in handy mrs sharp departed and soon afterward luke standifer went down to the little hotel where he boarded and looked up the railroad time table in the daily paper half an hour later he removed his coat and vest and strapped a peculiarly constructed pistol holster across his shoulders leaving the receptacle close under his left armpit into the holster he shoved a short barrelled calibre revolver putting on his clothes again he strolled to the station and caught the five twenty afternoon train for san antonio the san antonio express of the following morning contained this sensational piece of news benton sharp meets his match the most noted desperado in southwest texas shot to death in the gold front restaurant prominent state official successfully defends himself against the noted bully magnificent exhibition of quick gun play last night about eleven o clock benton sharp with two other men entered the gold front restaurant and seated themselves at a table sharp had been drinking and was loud and boisterous as he always was when under the influence of liquor five minutes after the party was seated a tall well dressed elderly gentleman entered the restaurant few present recognized the honourable luke standifer the recently appointed commissioner of insurance statistics and history going over to the same side where sharp was mr standifer prepared to take a seat at the next table in hanging his hat upon one of the hooks along the wall he let it fall upon sharp s head sharp turned being in an especially ugly humour and cursed the other roundly mr standifer apologized calmly for the accident but sharp continued his vituperations mr standifer was observed to draw near and speak a few sentences to the desperado in so low a tone that no one else caught the words sharp sprang up wild with rage in the meantime standifer had stepped some yards away and was standing quietly with his arms folded across the breast of his loosely hanging coat with that impetuous and deadly rapidity that made sharp so dreaded he reached for the gun he always carried in his hip pocket a movement that has preceded the death of at least a dozen men at his hands quick as the motion was the bystanders assert that it was met by the most beautiful exhibition of lightning gun pulling ever witnessed in the southwest as sharp s pistol was being raised and the act was really quicker than the eye could follow a glittering appeared as if by some conjuring trick in the right hand of mr standifer who without a perceptible movement of his arm shot benton sharp through the heart it seems that the new commissioner of insurance statistics and history has been an old time indian fighter and ranger for many years which accounts for the happy knack he has of handling a it is not believed that mr standifer will be put to any inconvenience beyond a necessary formal hearing to day as all the witnesses who were present unite in declaring that the deed was done in self defence when mrs sharp appeared at the office of the commissioner according to appointment she found that gentleman calmly eating a golden russet apple he greeted her without embarrassment and without hesitation at approaching the subject that was the topic of the day i had to do it ma am he said simply or get it myself mr kauffman he added turning to the old clerk please look up the records of the security life insurance company and see if they are all right no need to look grunted kauffman who had everything in his head it s all o k they pay all losses within ten days mrs sharp soon rose to depart she had arranged to remain in town until the policy was paid the commissioner did not detain her she was a woman and he did not know just what to say to her at present rest and time would bring her what she needed but as she was leaving luke standifer indulged himself in an official remark the department of insurance statistics and history ma am has done the best it could with your case twas a case hard to cover according to red tape statistics failed and history missed fire but if i may be permitted to say it we came out particularly strong on insurance the renaissance at charleroi grandemont charles was a little creole gentleman aged thirty four with a bald spot on the top of his head and the manners of a prince by day he was a clerk in a cotton broker s office in one of those cold rancid mountains of oozy brick down near the levee in new orleans by night in his three story high chambre garnier in the old french quarter he was again the last male descendant of the charles family that noble house that had lorded it in france and had pushed its way smiling rapiered and courtly into louisiana s early and brilliant days of late years the charleses had subsided into the more republican but scarcely less royally carried magnificence and ease of plantation life along the mississippi perhaps grandemont was even marquis de brasse there was that title in the family but a marquis on seventy five dollars per month vraiment still it has been done on less grandemont had saved out of his salary the sum of six hundred dollars enough you would say for any man to marry on so after a silence of two years on that subject he reopened that most hazardous question to mlle adele fauquier riding down to meade d or her father s plantation her answer was the same that it had been any time during the last ten years first find my brother monsieur charles this time he had stood before her perhaps discouraged by a love so long and hopeless being dependent upon a contingency so unreasonable and demanded to be told in simple words whether she loved him or no adele looked at him steadily out of her gray eyes that betrayed no secrets and answered a little more softly grandemont you have no right to ask that question unless you can do what i ask of you either bring back brother victor to us or the proof that he died somehow though five times thus rejected his heart was not so heavy when he left she had not denied that she loved upon what shallow waters can the bark of passion remain afloat or shall we play the doctrinaire and hint that at thirty four the tides of life are calmer and cognizant of many sources instead of but one as at four and twenty victor fauquier would never be found in those early days of his disappearance there was money to the charles name and grandemont had spent the dollars as if they were picayunes in trying to find the lost youth even then he had had small hope of success for the mississippi gives up a victim from its oily tangles only at the whim of its malign will a thousand times had grandemont conned in his mind the scene of victor s disappearance and at each time that adele had set her stubborn but pitiful alternative against his suit still clearer it repeated itself in his brain the boy had been the family favourite daring winning reckless his unwise fancy had been captured by a girl on the plantation the daughter of an overseer victor s family was in ignorance of the intrigue as far as it had gone to save them the inevitable pain that his course promised grandemont strove to prevent it omnipotent money smoothed the way the overseer and his daughter left between a sunset and dawn for an undesignated bourne grandemont was confident that this stroke would bring the boy to reason he rode over to meade d or to talk with him the two strolled out of the house and grounds crossed the road and mounting the levee walked its broad path while they conversed a thunder cloud was hanging imminent above but as yet no rain fell at grandemont s disclosure of his interference in the clandestine romance victor attacked him in a wild and sudden fury grandemont though of slight frame possessed muscles of iron he caught the wrists amid a shower of blows descending upon him bent the lad backward and stretched him upon the levee path in a little while the gust of passion was spent and he was allowed to rise calm now but a powder mine where he had been but a whiff of the tantrums victor extended his hand toward the dwelling house of meade d or you and they he cried have conspired to destroy my happiness none of you shall ever look upon my face again turning he ran swiftly down the levee disappearing in the darkness grandemont followed as well as he could calling to him but in vain for longer than an hour he pursued the search descending the side of the levee he penetrated the rank density of weeds and willows that undergrew the trees until the river s edge shouting victor s name there was never an answer though once he thought he heard a bubbling scream from the dun waters sliding past then the storm broke and he returned to the house drenched and dejected there he explained the boy s absence sufficiently he thought not speaking of the tangle that had led to it for he hoped that victor would return as soon as his anger had cooled afterward when the threat was made good and they saw his face no more he found it difficult to alter his explanations of that night and there clung a certain mystery to the boy s reasons for vanishing as well as to the manner of it it was on that night that grandemont first perceived a new and singular expression in adele s eyes whenever she looked at him and through the years following that expression was always there he could not read it for it was born of a thought she would never otherwise reveal perhaps if he had known that adele had stood at the gate on that unlucky night where she had followed lingering to await the return of her brother and lover wondering why they had chosen so tempestuous an hour and so black a spot to hold converse if he had known that a sudden flash of lightning had revealed to her sight that short sharp struggle as victor was sinking under his hands he might have explained everything and she i know what she would have done but one thing is clear there was something besides her brother s disappearance between grandemont s pleadings for her hand and adele s yes ten years had passed and what she had seen during the space of that lightning flash remained an indelible picture she had loved her brother but was she holding out for the solution of that mystery or for the truth women have been known to reverence it even as an abstract principle it is said there have been a few who in the matter of their affections have considered a life to be a small thing as compared with a lie that i do not know but i wonder had grandemont cast himself at her feet crying that his hand had sent victor to the bottom of that inscrutable river and that he could no longer sully his love with a lie i wonder if i wonder what she would have done but grandemont charles arcadian little gentleman never guessed the meaning of that look in adele s eyes and from this last bootless payment of his devoirs he rode away as rich as ever in honour and love but poor in hope that was in september it was during the first winter month that grandemont conceived his idea of the renaissance since adele would never be his and wealth without her were useless trumpery why need he add to that hoard of slowly harvested dollars why should he even retain that hoard hundreds were the cigarettes he consumed over his claret sitting at the little polished tables in the royal street cafes while thinking over his plan by and by he had it perfect it would cost beyond doubt all the money he had but le jeu vaut la chandelle for some hours he would be once more a charles of charleroi once again should the nineteenth of january that most significant day in the fortunes of the house of charles be fittingly observed on that date the french king had seated a charles by his side at table on that date armand charles marquis de brasse landed like a brilliant meteor in new orleans it was the date of his mother s wedding of grandemont s birth since grandemont could remember until the breaking up of the family that anniversary had been the synonym for feasting hospitality and proud commemoration charleroi was the old family plantation lying some twenty miles down the river years ago the estate had been sold to discharge the debts of its too bountiful owners once again it had changed hands and now the must and mildew of litigation had settled upon it a question of heirship was in the courts and the dwelling house of charleroi unless the tales told of ghostly powdered and laced charleses haunting its unechoing chambers were true stood uninhabited grandemont found the solicitor in chancery who held the keys pending the decision he proved to be an old friend of the family grandemont explained briefly that he desired to rent the house for two or three days he wanted to give a dinner at his old home to a few friends that was all take it for a week a month if you will said the solicitor but do not speak to me of rental with a sigh he concluded the dinners i have eaten under that roof mon fils there came to many of the old established dealers in furniture china silverware decorations and household fittings at their stores on canal chartres st charles and royal streets a quiet young man with a little bald spot on the top of his head distinguished manners and the eye of a connoisseur who explained what he wanted to hire the complete and elegant equipment of a dining room hall reception room and cloak rooms the goods were to be packed and sent by boat to the charleroi landing and would be returned within three or four days all damage or loss to be promptly paid for many of those old merchants knew grandemont by sight and the charleses of old by association some of them were of creole stock and felt a thrill of responsive sympathy with the magnificently indiscreet design of this impoverished clerk who would revive but for a moment the ancient flame of glory with the fuel of his savings choose what you want they said to him handle everything carefully see that the damage bill is kept low and the charges for the loan will not oppress you to the wine merchants next and here a doleful slice was lopped from the six hundred it was an exquisite pleasure to grandemont once more to pick among the precious vintages the champagne bins lured him like the abodes of sirens but these he was forced to pass with his six hundred he stood before them as a child with a penny stands before a french doll but he bought with taste and discretion of other wines chablis moselle chateau d or hochheimer and port of right age and pedigree the matter of the cuisine gave him some studious hours until he suddenly recollected andre andre their old chef the most sublime master of french creole cookery in the mississippi valley perhaps he was yet somewhere about the plantation the solicitor had told him that the place was still being cultivated in accordance with a compromise agreement between the litigants on the next sunday after the thought grandemont rode horseback down to charleroi the big square house with its two long ells looked blank and cheerless with its closed shutters and doors the shrubbery in the yard was ragged and riotous fallen leaves from the grove littered the walks and porches turning down the lane at the side of the house grandemont rode on to the quarters of the plantation hands he found the workers just streaming back from church careless happy and bedecked in gay yellows reds and blues yes andre was still there his wool a little grayer his mouth as wide his laughter as ready as ever grandemont told him of his plan and the old chef swayed with pride and delight with a sigh of relief knowing that he need have no further concern until the serving of that dinner was announced he placed in andre s hands a liberal sum for the cost of it giving carte blanche for its creation among the blacks were also a number of the old house servants absalom the former major domo and a half dozen of the younger men once waiters and attaches of the kitchen pantry and other domestic departments crowded around to greet m shi grande absalom guaranteed to marshal of these a corps of assistants that would perform with credit the serving of the dinner after distributing a liberal largesse among the faithful grandemont rode back to town well pleased there were many other smaller details to think of and provide for but eventually the scheme was complete and now there remained only the issuance of the invitations to his guests along the river within the scope of a score of miles dwelt some half dozen families with whose princely hospitality that of the charleses had been contemporaneous they were the proudest and most august of the old regime their small circle had been a brilliant one their social relations close and warm their houses full of rare welcome and discriminating bounty those friends said grandemont should once more if never again sit at charleroi on a nineteenth of january to celebrate the festal day of his house grandemont had his cards of invitation engraved they were expensive but beautiful in one particular their good taste might have been disputed but the creole allowed himself that one feather in the cap of his fugacious splendour might he not be allowed for the one day of the renaissance to be grandemont du puy charles of charleroi he sent the invitations out early in january so that the guests might not fail to receive due notice at eight o clock on the morning of the nineteenth the lower coast steamboat river belle gingerly approached the long unused landing at charleroi the bridge was lowered and a swarm of the plantation hands streamed along the rotting pier bearing ashore a strange assortment of freight great shapeless bundles and bales and packets swathed in cloth and bound with ropes tubs and urns of palms evergreens and tropical flowers tables mirrors chairs couches carpets and pictures all carefully bound and padded against the dangers of transit grandemont was among them the busiest there to the safe conveyance of certain large hampers eloquent with printed cautions to delicate handling he gave his superintendence for they contained the fragile china and glassware the dropping of one of those hampers would have cost him more than he could have saved in a year the last article unloaded the river belle backed off and continued her course down stream in less than an hour everything had been conveyed to the house and came then absalom s task directing the placing of the furniture and wares there was plenty of help for that day was always a holiday at charleroi and the negroes did not suffer the old traditions to lapse almost the entire population of the quarters volunteered their aid a score of piccaninnies were sweeping at the leaves in the yard in the big kitchen at the rear andre was lording it with his old time magnificence over his numerous sub cooks and scullions shutters were flung wide dust spun in clouds the house echoed to voices and the tread of busy feet the prince had come again and charleroi woke from its long sleep the full moon as she rose across the river that night and peeped above the levee saw a sight that had long been missing from her orbit the old plantation house shed a soft and alluring radiance from every window of its two score rooms only four had been refurnished the larger reception chamber the dining hall and two smaller rooms for the convenience of the expected guests but lighted wax candles were set in the windows of every room the dining hall was the chef d oeuvre the long table set with twenty five covers sparkled like a winter landscape with its snowy napery and china and the icy gleam of crystal the chaste beauty of the room had required small adornment the polished floor burned to a glowing ruby with the reflection of candle light the rich wainscoting reached half way to the ceiling along and above this had been set the relieving lightness of a few water colour sketches of fruit and flower the reception chamber was fitted in a simple but elegant style its arrangement suggested nothing of the fact that on the morrow the room would again be cleared and abandoned to the dust and the spider the entrance hall was imposing with palms and ferns and the light of an immense candelabrum at seven o clock grandemont in evening dress with pearls a family passion in his spotless linen emerged from somewhere the invitations had specified eight as the dining hour he drew an armchair upon the porch and sat there smoking cigarettes and half dreaming the moon was an hour high fifty years back from the gate stood the house under its noble grove the road ran in front and then came the grass grown levee and the insatiate river beyond just above the levee top a tiny red light was creeping down and a tiny green one was creeping up then the passing steamers saluted and the hoarse din startled the drowsy silence of the melancholy lowlands the stillness returned save for the little voices of the night the owl s recitative the capriccio of the crickets the concerto of the frogs in the grass the piccaninnies and the dawdlers from the quarters had been dismissed to their confines and the melee of the day was reduced to an orderly and intelligent silence the six coloured waiters in their white jackets paced cat footed about the table pretending to arrange where all was beyond betterment absalom in black and shining pumps posed superior here and there where the lights set off his grandeur and grandemont rested in his chair waiting for his guests he must have drifted into a dream and an extravagant one for he was master of charleroi and adele was his wife she was coming out to him now he could hear her steps he could feel her hand upon his shoulder pardon moi m shi grande it was absalom s hand touching him it was absalom s voice speaking the patois of the blacks but it is eight o clock eight o clock grandemont sprang up in the moonlight he could see the row of hitching posts outside the gate long ago the horses of the guests should have stood there they were vacant a chanted roar of indignation a just waxing bellow of affront and dishonoured genius came from andre s kitchen filling the house with rhythmic protest the beautiful dinner the pearl of a dinner the little excellent superb jewel of a dinner but one moment more of waiting and not even the thousand thunders of black pigs of the quarter would touch it they are a little late said grandemont calmly they will come soon tell andre to hold back dinner and ask him if by some chance a bull from the pastures has broken roaring into the house he seated himself again to his cigarettes though he had said it he scarcely believed charleroi would entertain company that night for the first time in history the invitation of a charles had been ignored so simple in courtesy and honour was grandemont and perhaps so serenely confident in the prestige of his name that the most likely reasons for the vacant board did not occur to him charleroi stood by a road travelled daily by people from those plantations whither his invitations had gone no doubt even on the day before the sudden reanimation of the old house they had driven past and observed the evidences of long desertion and decay they had looked at the corpse of charleroi and then at grandemont s invitations and though the puzzle or tasteless hoax or whatever the thing meant left them perplexed they would not seek its solution by the folly of a visit to that deserted house the moon was now above the grove and the yard was pied with deep shadows save where they lightened in the tender glow of outpouring candle light a crisp breeze from the river hinted at the possibility of frost when the night should have become older the grass at one side of the steps was specked with the white stubs of grandemont s cigarettes the cotton broker s clerk sat in his chair with the smoke spiralling above him i doubt that he once thought of the little fortune he had so impotently squandered perhaps it was compensation enough for him to sit thus at charleroi for a few retrieved hours idly his mind wandered in and out many fanciful paths of memory he smiled to himself as a paraphrased line of scripture strayed into his mind a certain poor man made a feast he heard the sound of absalom coughing a note of summons grandemont stirred this time he had not been asleep only drowsing nine o clock m shi grande said absalom in the uninflected voice of a good servant who states

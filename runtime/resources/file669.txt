and the world laughs with you weep and they give you the laugh she quoted i have learned that mr donovan i have no friends or acquaintances in this city but you have been kind to me i appreciate it highly he had passed her the pepper twice at the table it s tough to be alone in new york that s a cinch said mr donovan but say whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit say you took a little stroll in the park miss conway don t you think it might chase away some of your mullygrubs and if you d allow me thanks mr donovan i d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you through the open gates of the iron railed old downtown park where the elect once took the air they strolled and found a quiet bench there is this difference between the grief of youth and that of old age youth s burden is lightened by as much of it as another shares old age may give and give but the sorrow remains the same he was my fiance confided miss conway at the end of an hour we were going to be married next spring i don t want you to think that i am stringing you mr donovan but he was a real count he had an estate and a castle in italy count fernando mazzini was his name i never saw the beat of him for elegance papa objected of course and once we eloped but papa overtook us and took us back i thought sure papa and fernando would fight a duel papa has a livery business in p kipsee you know finally papa came round all right and said we might be married next spring fernando showed him proofs of his title and wealth and then went over to italy to get the castle fixed up for us papa s very proud and when fernando wanted to give me several thousand dollars for my trousseau he called him down something awful he wouldn t even let me take a ring or any presents from him and when fernando sailed i came to the city and got a position as cashier in a candy store three days ago i got a letter from italy forwarded from p kipsee saying that fernando had been killed in a gondola accident that is why i am in mourning my heart mr donovan will remain forever in his grave i guess i am poor company mr donovan but i cannot take any interest in no one i should not care to keep you from gayety and your friends who can smile and entertain you perhaps you would prefer to walk back to the house now girls if you want to observe a young man hustle out after a pick and shovel just tell him that your heart is in some other fellow s grave young men are grave robbers by nature ask any widow something must be done to restore that missing organ to weeping angels in crepe de chine dead men certainly get the worst of it from all sides i m awfully sorry said mr donovan gently no we won t walk back to the house just yet and don t say you haven t no friends in this city miss conway i m awful sorry and i want you to believe i m your friend and that i m awful sorry i ve got his picture here in my locket said miss conway after wiping her eyes with her handkerchief i never showed it to anybody but i will to you mr donovan because i believe you to be a true friend mr donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that miss conway opened for him the face of count mazzini was one to command interest it was a smooth intelligent bright almost a handsome face the face of a strong cheerful man who might well be a leader among his fellows i have a larger one framed in my room said miss conway when we return i will show you that they are all i have to remind me of fernando but he ever will be present in my heart that s a sure thing a subtle task confronted mr donovan that of supplanting the unfortunate count in the heart of miss conway this his admiration for her determined him to do but the magnitude or the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits the sympathetic but cheerful friend was the role he essayed and he played it so successfully that the next half hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice cream though yet there wars no diminution of the sadness in miss conway s large gray eyes before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf mr donovan surveyed it with inscrutable eyes he gave me this the night he left for italy said miss conway i had the one for the locket made from this a fine looking man said mr donovan heartily how would it suit you miss conway to give me the pleasure of your company to coney next sunday afternoon a month later they announced their engagement to mrs scott and the other boarders miss conway continued to wear black a week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic picture of them in the moonlight but donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day he was so silent to night that love s lips could not keep back any longer the questions

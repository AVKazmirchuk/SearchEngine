his pocket a little pad of prescription blanks he scribbled upon one of them a formula suited according to the best practice to the needs of the sufferer going to the door of the inner room he softly called the old woman gave her the prescription and bade her take it to some drug store and fetch the medicine when she had gone muttering to herself the doctor stepped to the bedside of the lady she still slept soundly her pulse was a little stronger her forehead was cool save where the inflammation of the bruise extended and a slight moisture covered it unless disturbed she would yet sleep for hours he found the key in the door and locked it after him when he returned doctor james looked at his watch he could call half an hour his own since before that time the old woman could scarcely return from her mission then he sought and found water in a pitcher and a glass tumbler opening his medicine case he took out the vial containing the nitroglycerine the oil as his brethren of the brace and bit term it one drop of the faint yellow thickish liquid he let fall in the tumbler he took out his silver hypodermic syringe case and screwed the needle into its place carefully measuring each modicum of water in the graduated glass barrel of the syringe he diluted the one drop with nearly half a tumbler of water two hours earlier that night doctor james had with that syringe injected the undiluted liquid into a hole drilled in the lock of a safe and had destroyed with one dull explosion the machinery that controlled the movement of the bolts he now purposed with the same means to shiver the prime machinery of a human being to rend its heart and each shock was for the sake of the money to follow the same means but in a different guise whereas that was the giant in its rude primary dynamic strength this was the courtier whose no less deadly arms were concealed by velvet and lace for the liquid in the tumbler and in the syringe that the physician carefully filled was now a solution of glonoin the most powerful heart stimulant known to medical science two ounces had riven the solid door of the iron safe with one fiftieth part of a minim he was now about to still forever the intricate mechanism of a human life but not immediately it was not so intended first there would be a quick increase of vitality a powerful impetus given to every organ and faculty the heart would respond bravely to the fatal spur the blood in the veins return more rapidly to its source but as doctor james well knew over stimulation in this form of heart disease means death as sure as by a rifle shot when the clogged arteries should suffer congestion from the increased flow of blood pumped into them by the power of the burglar s oil they would rapidly become no thoroughfare and the fountain of life would cease to flow the physician bared the chest of the unconscious chandler easily and skilfully he injected subcutaneously the contents of the syringe into the muscles of the region over the heart true to his neat habits in both professions he next carefully dried his needle and re inserted the fine wire that threaded it when not in use in three minutes chandler opened his eyes and spoke in a voice faint but audible inquiring who attended upon him doctor james again explained his presence there where is my wife asked the patient she is asleep from exhaustion and worry said the doctor i would not awaken her unless it isn t necessary chandler spoke with spaces between his words caused by his short breath that some demon was driving too fast she wouldn t thank you to disturb her on my account doctor james drew a chair to the bedside conversation must not be squandered a few minutes ago he began in the grave candid tones of his other profession you were trying to tell me something regarding some money i do not seek your confidence but it is my duty to advise you that anxiety and worry will work against your recovery if you have any communication to make about this to relieve your mind about this twenty thousand dollars i think was the amount you mentioned you would better do so chandler could not turn his head but he rolled his eyes in the direction of the speaker did i say where this money is no answered the physician i only inferred from your scarcely intelligible words that you felt a solicitude concerning its safety if it is in this room doctor james paused did he only seem to perceive a flicker of understanding a gleam of suspicion upon the ironical features of his patient had he seemed too eager had he said too much chandler s next words restored his confidence where should it be he gasped but in the safe there with his eyes he indicated a corner of the room where now for the first time the doctor perceived a small iron safe half concealed by the trailing end of a window curtain rising he took the sick man s wrist his pulse was beating in great throbs with ominous intervals between lift your arm said doctor james you know i can t move doctor the physician stepped swiftly to the hall door opened it and listened all was still without further circumvention he went to the safe and examined it of a primitive make and simple design it afforded little more security than protection against light fingered servants to his skill it was a mere toy a thing of straw and paste board the money was as good as in his hands with his clamps he could draw the knob punch the tumblers and

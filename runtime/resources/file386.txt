old traditions to lapse almost the entire population of the quarters volunteered their aid a score of piccaninnies were sweeping at the leaves in the yard in the big kitchen at the rear andre was lording it with his old time magnificence over his numerous sub cooks and scullions shutters were flung wide dust spun in clouds the house echoed to voices and the tread of busy feet the prince had come again and charleroi woke from its long sleep the full moon as she rose across the river that night and peeped above the levee saw a sight that had long been missing from her orbit the old plantation house shed a soft and alluring radiance from every window of its two score rooms only four had been refurnished the larger reception chamber the dining hall and two smaller rooms for the convenience of the expected guests but lighted wax candles were set in the windows of every room the dining hall was the chef d oeuvre the long table set with twenty five covers sparkled like a winter landscape with its snowy napery and china and the icy gleam of crystal the chaste beauty of the room had required small adornment the polished floor burned to a glowing ruby with the reflection of candle light the rich wainscoting reached half way to the ceiling along and above this had been set the relieving lightness of a few water colour sketches of fruit and flower the reception chamber was fitted in a simple but elegant style its arrangement suggested nothing of the fact that on the morrow the room would again be cleared and abandoned to the dust and the spider the entrance hall was imposing with palms and ferns and the light of an immense candelabrum at seven o clock grandemont in evening dress with pearls a family passion in his spotless linen emerged from somewhere the invitations had specified eight as the dining hour he drew an armchair upon the porch and sat there smoking cigarettes and half dreaming the moon was an hour high fifty years back from the gate stood the house under its noble grove the road ran in front and then came the grass grown levee and the insatiate river beyond just above the levee top a tiny red light was creeping down and a tiny green one was creeping up then the passing steamers saluted and the hoarse din startled the drowsy silence of the melancholy lowlands the stillness returned save for the little voices of the night the owl s recitative the capriccio of the crickets the concerto of the frogs in the grass the piccaninnies and the dawdlers from the quarters had been dismissed to their confines and the melee of the day was reduced to an orderly and intelligent silence the six coloured waiters in their white jackets paced cat footed about the table pretending to arrange where all was beyond betterment absalom in black and shining pumps posed superior here and there where the lights set off his grandeur and grandemont rested in his chair waiting for his guests he must have drifted into a dream and an extravagant one for he was master of charleroi and adele was his wife she was coming out to him now he could hear her steps he could feel her hand upon his shoulder pardon moi m shi grande it was absalom s hand touching him it was absalom s voice speaking the patois of the blacks but it is eight o clock eight o clock grandemont sprang up in the moonlight he could see the row of hitching posts outside the gate long ago the horses of the guests should have stood there they were vacant a chanted roar of indignation a just waxing bellow of affront and dishonoured genius came from andre s kitchen filling the house with rhythmic protest the beautiful dinner the pearl of a dinner the little excellent superb jewel of a dinner but one moment more of waiting and not even the thousand thunders of black pigs of the quarter would touch it they are a little late said grandemont calmly they will come soon tell andre to hold back dinner and ask him if by some chance a bull from the pastures has broken roaring into the house he seated himself again to his cigarettes though he had said it he scarcely believed charleroi would entertain company that night for the first time in history the invitation of a charles had been ignored so simple in courtesy and honour was grandemont and perhaps so serenely confident in the prestige of his name that the most likely reasons for the vacant board did not occur to him charleroi stood by a road travelled daily by people from those plantations whither his invitations had gone no doubt even on the day before the sudden reanimation of the old house they had driven past and observed the evidences of long desertion and decay they had looked at the corpse of charleroi and then at grandemont s invitations and though the puzzle or tasteless hoax or whatever the thing meant left them perplexed they would not seek its solution by the folly of a visit to that deserted house the moon was now above the grove and the yard was pied with deep shadows save where they lightened in the tender glow of outpouring candle light a crisp breeze from the river hinted at the possibility of frost when the night should have become older the grass at one side of the steps was specked with the white stubs of grandemont s cigarettes the cotton broker s clerk sat in his chair with the smoke spiralling above him i doubt that he once thought of the little fortune he had so impotently squandered perhaps it was compensation enough for him to sit thus at charleroi for a few retrieved hours idly his mind wandered in and out many

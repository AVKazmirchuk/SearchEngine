electric cars thus as if to challenge the poet s flaunt at ro mance and to punish him for his recreancy to the undying spirit of youth and beauty this vision bad dawned upon him with a thrilling and accusive power and so metabolic was the power that in an instant the atoms of ravenel s entire world were redistrib uted the laden drays that passed the house in which she lived rumbled a deep double bass to the tune of love the newsboys shouts were the notes of singing birds that garden was the pleasance of the capulets the janitor was an ogre himself a knight ready with sword lance or lute thus does romance show herself amid forests of brick and stone when she gets lost in the city and there has to be sent out a general alarm to find her again at four in the afternoon ravenel looked out across the garden in the window of his hopes were set four small vases each containing a great full blown rose red and white and as he gazed she leaned above them shaming them with her loveliness and seeming to direct her eyes pensively toward his own window and then as though she had caught his respectful but ardent regard she melted away leaving the fragrant emblems on the window sill yes emblems he would be unworthy if be had not understood she had read his poem the four roses it had reached her heart and this was its romantic answer of course she must know that ravenel the poet lived there across her garden his picture too she must have seen in the magazines the delicate tender modest flattering message could not be ignored ravenel noticed beside the roses a small flowering pot containing a plant without shame be brought his opera glasses and employed them from the cover of his window curtain a nutmeg geranium with the true poetic instinct be dragged a book of useless information from his shelves and tore open the leaves at the language of flowers geranium nutmeg i expect a meeting so romance never does things by halves if she comes back to you she brings gifts and her knitting and will sit in your chimney corner if you will let her and now ravenel smiled the lover smiles when be thinks he has won the woman who loves ceases to smile with victory he ends a battle she begins hers what a pretty idea to set the four roses in her window for him to see she must have a sweet poetic soul and now to contrive the meeting a whistling and slamming of doors preluded the coming of sammy brown ravenel smiled again even sammy brown was shone upon by the far flung rays of the renaissance sammy with his ultra clothes his horseshoe pin his plump face his trite slang his uncomprehending admiration of ravenel the broker s clerk made an excellent foil to the new bright unseen visitor to the poet s sombre apartment sammy went to his old seat by the window and looked out over the dusty green foliage in the garden then he looked at his watch and rose hastily by grabs he exclaimed twenty after four i can t stay old man i ve got a date at why did you come then asked ravenel with sarcastic jocularity if you had an engagement at that time i thought you business men kept better account of your minutes and seconds than that sammy hesitated in the doorway and turned pinker fact is ravvy be explained as to a customer whose margin is exhausted i didn t know i had it till i came i ll tell you old man there s a dandy girl in that old house next door that i m dead

meet her it s to day maybe i ought to have explained sooner but i know it s all right with you so long how do you get your tip as you call it asked ravenel losing a little spontaneity from his smile roses said sammy briefly four of em to day means four o clock at the corner of broadway and twenty third but the geranium persisted ravenel clutch ing at the end of flying romance s trailing robe

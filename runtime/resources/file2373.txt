in as fine a stock of shoes as could be bought in the north you have a picturesque town here john i hope business will be as good as your letter justifies me in expecting johnny s agony was abbreviated by the arrival of keogh who hurried up with the news that mrs goodwin would be much pleased to place rooms at the disposal of mr hemstetter and his daughter so there mr hemstetter and rosine were at once conducted and left to recuperate from the fatigue of the voyage while johnny went down to see that the cases of shoes were safely stored in the customs warehouse pending their examination by the officials keogh grinning like a shark skirmished about to find goodwin to instruct him not to expose to mr hemstetter the true state of coralio as a shoe market until johnny had been given a chance to redeem the situation if such a thing were possible that night the consul and keogh held a desperate consultation on the breezy porch of the consulate send em back home began keogh reading johnny s thoughts i would said johnny after a little silence but i ve been lying to you billy all right about that said keogh affably i ve told you hundreds of times said johnny slowly that i had forgotten that girl haven t i about three hundred and seventy five admitted the monument of patience i lied repeated the consul every time i never forgot her for one moment i was an obstinate ass for running away just because she said no once and i was too proud a fool to go back i talked with rosine a few minutes this evening up at goodwin s i found out one thing you remember that farmer fellow who was always after her dink pawson asked keogh pink dawson well he wasn t a hill of beans to her she says she didn t believe a word of the things be told her about me but i m sewed up now billy that tomfool letter we sent ruined whatever chance i had left she ll despise me when she finds out that her old father has been made the victim of a joke that a decent schoolboy wouldn t have been guilty of shoes why he couldn t sell twenty pairs of shoes in coralio if he kept store here for twenty years you put a pair of shoes on one of these caribs or spanish brown boys and what d he do stand on his head and squeal until he d kicked em off none of em ever wore shoes and they never will if i send em back home i ll have to tell the whole story and what ll she think of me i want that girl worse than ever billy and now when she s in reach i ve lost her forever because i tried to be funny when the thermometer was at keep cheerful said the optimistic keogh and let em open the store i ve been busy myself this afternoon we can stir up a temporary boom in foot gear anyhow i ll buy six pairs when the doors open i ve been around and seen all the fellows and explained the catastrophe they ll all buy shoes like they was centipedes frank goodwin will take cases of em the geddies want about eleven pairs between em clancy is going to invest the savings of weeks and even old doc gregg wants three pairs of alligator hide slippers if they ve got any tens blanchard got a look at miss hemstetter and as he s a frenchman no less than a dozen pairs will do for him a dozen customers said johnny for a stock of shoes it won t work there s a big problem here to figure out you go home billy and leave me alone i ve got to work at it all by myself take that bottle of three star along with you no sir not another ounce of booze for the united states consul i ll sit here tonight and pull out the think stop if there s a soft place on this proposition anywhere i ll land on it if there isn t there ll be another wreck to the credit of the gorgeous tropics keogh left feeling that he could be of no use johnny laid a handful of cigars on a table and stretched himself in a steamer chair when the sudden daylight broke silvering the harbor ripples he was still sitting there then he got up whistling a little tune and took his bath at nine o clock he walked down to the dingy little cable office and hung for half an hour over a blank the result of his application was the following message which he signed and had transmitted at a cost of to pinkney dawson dalesburg ala draft for comes to you next mail ship me immediately pounds stiff dry cockleburrs new use here in arts market price twenty cents pound further orders likely rush xiii ships within a week a suitable building had been secured in the calle grande and mr hemstetter s stock of shoes arranged upon their shelves the rent of the store was moderate and the stock made a fine showing of neat white boxes attractively displayed johnny s friends stood by him loyally on the first day keogh strolled into the store in a casual kind of way about once every hour and bought shoes after he had purchased a pair each of extension soles congress gaiters button kids low quartered calfs dancing pumps rubber boots tans of various hues tennis shoes and flowered slippers he sought out johnny to be prompted as to the names of other kinds that he might inquire for the other english speaking residents also played their parts nobly by buying often and liberally keogh was grand marshal and made them distribute their patronage thus keeping up a fair run of custom for several days mr hemstetter was gratified by the amount of business done thus far but expressed surprise that the natives were so backward with their custom oh they re awfully shy explained johnny as he wiped his forehead nervously they ll get the habit pretty soon they ll come with a rush when they do come one afternoon keogh dropped into the consul s office chewing an unlighted cigar thoughtfully got anything up your sleeve he inquired of johnny if you have it s about time to show it if you can borrow some gent s hat in the audience and make a lot of customers for an idle stock of shoes come out of it you d better spiel the boys have all laid in enough footwear to last em ten years and there s nothing doing in the shoe store but dolcy far nienty i just came by there your venerable victim was standing in the door gazing through his specs at the bare toes passing by his emporium the natives here have got the true artistic temperament me and clancy took eighteen tintypes this morning in two hours there s been but one pair of shoes sold all day blanchard went in and bought a pair of furlined house slippers because he thought he saw miss hemstetter go into the store i saw him throw the slippers into the lagoon afterwards there s a mobile fruit steamer coming in tomorrow or next day said johnny we can t do anything until then what are you going to do try to create a demand political economy isn t your strong point said the consul impudently you can t create a demand but you can create a necessity for a demand that s what i am going to do two weeks after the consul sent his cable a fruit steamer brought him a huge mysterious brown bale of some unknown commodity johnny s influence with the custom house people was sufficiently strong for him to get the goods turned over to him without the usual inspection he had the bale taken to the consulate and snugly stowed in the back room that night he ripped open a corner of it and took out a handful of the cockleburrs he examined them with the care with which a warrior examines his arms before he goes forth to battle for his lady love and life the burrs were the ripe august product as hard as filberts and bristling with spines as tough and sharp as needles johnny whistled softly a little tune and went out to find billy keogh later in the night when coralio was steeped in slumber he and billy went forth into the deserted streets with their coats bulging like balloons all up and down the calle grande they went sowing the sharp burrs carefully in the sand along the narrow sidewalks in every foot of grass between the silent houses and then they took the side streets and byways missing none no place where the foot of man woman or child might fall was slighted many trips they made to and from the prickly hoard and then nearly at the dawn they laid themselves down to rest calmly as great generals do after planning a victory according to the revised tactics and slept knowing that they had sowed with the accuracy of satan sowing tares and the perseverance of paul planting with the rising sun came the purveyors of fruits and meats and arranged their wares in and around the little market house at one end of the town near the seashore the market house stood and the sowing of the burrs had not been carried that far the dealers waited long past the hour when their sales usually began none came to buy que hay they began to exclaim one to another at their accustomed time from every dobe and palm hut and grass thatched shack and dim patio glided women black women brown women lemon colored women women dun and yellow and tawny they were the marketers starting to purchase the family supply of cassava plantains meat fowls and tortillas decollete they were and bare armed and bare footed with a single skirt reaching below the knee stolid and ox eyed they stepped from their doorways into the narrow paths or upon the soft grass of the streets the first to emerge uttered ambiguous squeals and raised one foot quickly another step and they sat down with shrill cries of alarm to pick at the new and painful insects that had stung them upon the feet que picadores diablos they screeched to one another across the narrow ways some tried the grass instead of the paths but there they were also stung and bitten by the strange little prickly balls they plumped down in the grass and added their lamentations to those of their sisters in the sandy paths all through the town was heard the plaint of the feminine jabber the venders in the market still wondered why no customers came then men lords of the earth came forth they too began to hop to dance to limp and to curse they stood stranded and foolish or stopped to pluck at the scourge that attacked their feet and ankles some loudly proclaimed the pest to be poisonous spiders of an unknown species and then the children ran out for their morning romp and now to the uproar was added the howls of limping infants and cockleburred childhood every minute the advancing day brought forth fresh victims dona maria castillas y buenventura de las casas stepped from her honored doorway as was her daily custom to procure fresh bread from the panaderia across the street she was clad in a skirt of flowered yellow satin a chemise of ruffled linen and wore a purple mantilla from the looms of spain her lemon tinted feet alas were bare her progress was majestic for were not her ancestors hidalgos of aragon three steps she made across the velvety grass and set her aristocratic sole upon a bunch of johnny s burrs dona maria castillas y buenventura de las casas emitted a yowl even as a wild cat turning about she fell upon hands and knees and crawled ay like a beast of the field she crawled back to her honorable door sill don senor ildefonso federico valdazar juez de la paz weighing twenty stone attempted to convey his bulk to the pulperia at the corner of the plaza in order to assuage his matutinal thirst the first plunge of his unshod foot into the cool grass struck a concealed mine don ildefonso fell like a crumpled cathedral crying out that he had been fatally bitten by a deadly scorpion everywhere were the shoeless citizens hopping stumbling limping and picking from their feet the venomous insects that had come in a single night to harass them the first to perceive the remedy was esteban delgado the barber a man of travel and education sitting upon a stone he plucked burrs from his toes and made oration behold my friends these bugs of the devil i know them well they soar through the skies in swarms like pigeons these are dead ones that fell during the night in yucatan i have seen them as large as oranges yes there they hiss like serpents and have wings like bats it is the shoes the shoes that one needs zapatos zapatos para mi esteban hobbled to mr hemstetter s store and bought shoes coming out he swaggered down the street with impunity reviling loudly the bugs of the devil the suffering ones sat up or stood upon one foot and beheld the immune barber men women and children took up the cry zapatos zapatos the necessity for the demand had been created the demand followed that day mr hemstetter sold three hundred pairs of shoes it is really surprising he said to johnny who came up in the evening to help him straighten out the stock how trade is picking up yesterday i made but three sales i told you they d whoop things up when they got started said the consul i think i shall order a dozen more cases of goods to keep the stock up said mr hemstetter beaming through his spectacles i wouldn t send in any orders yet advised johnny wait till you see how the trade holds up each night johnny and keogh sowed the crop that grew dollars by day at the end of ten days two thirds of the stock of shoes had been sold and the stock of cockleburrs was exhausted johnny cabled to pink dawson for another pounds paying twenty cents per pound as before mr hemstetter carefully made up an order for worth of shoes from northern firms johnny hung about the store until this order was ready for the mail and succeeded in destroying it before it reached the postoffice that night he took rosine under the mango tree by godwin s porch and confessed everything she looked him in the eye and said you are a very wicked man father and i will go back home you say it was a joke i think it is a very serious matter but at the end of half an hour s argument the conversation had been turned upon a different subject the two were considering the respective merits of pale blue and pink wall paper with which the old colonial mansion of the atwoods in dalesburg was to be decorated after the wedding on the next morning johnny confessed to mr hemstetter the shoe merchant put on his spectacles and said through them you strike me as being a most extraordinary young scamp if i had not managed this enterprise with good business judgment my entire stock of goods might have been a complete loss now how do you propose to dispose of the rest of it when the second invoice of cockleburrs arrived johnny loaded them and the remainder of the shoes into schooner and sailed down the coast to alazan there in the same dark and diabolical manner he repeated his success and came back with a bag of money and not so much as a shoestring and then he besought his great uncle of the waving goatee and starred vest to accept his resignation for the lotus no longer lured him he hankered for the spinach and cress of dalesburg the services of mr william terence keogh as acting consul pro term were suggested and accepted and johnny sailed with the hemstetters back to his native shores keogh slipped into the sinecure of the american consulship with the ease that never left him even in such high places the tintype establishment was soon to become a thing of the past although its deadly work along the peaceful and helpless spanish main was never effaced the restless partners were about to be off again scouting ahead of the slow ranks of fortune but now they would take different ways there were rumors of a promising uprising in peru and thither the martial clancy would turn his adventurous steps as for keogh he was figuring in his mind and on quires of government letter heads a scheme that dwarfed the art of misrepresenting the human countenance upon tin what suits me keogh used to say in the way of a business proposition is something diversified that looks like a longer shot than it is something in the way of a genteel graft that isn t worked enough for the correspondence schools to be teaching it by mail i take the long end but i like to have at least as good a chance to win as a man learning to play poker on an ocean steamer or running for governor of texas on the republican ticket and when i cash in my winnings i don t want to find any widows and orphans chips in my stack the grass grown globe was the green table on which keogh gambled the games he played were of his own invention he was no grubber after the diffident dollar nor did he care to follow it with horn and hounds rather he loved to coax it with egregious and brilliant flies from its habitat in the waters of strange streams yet keogh was a business man and his schemes in spite of their singularity were as solidly set as the plans of a building contractor in arthur s time sir william keogh would have been a knight of the round table in these modern days he rides abroad seeking the graft instead of the grail three days after johnny s departure two small schooners appeared off coralio after some delay a boat put off from one of them and brought a sunburned young man ashore this young man had a shrewd and calculating eye and he gazed with amazement at the strange things that he saw he found on the beach some one who directed him to the consul s office and thither he made his way at a nervous gait keogh was sprawled in the official chair drawing caricatures of his uncle s head on an official pad of paper he looked up at his visitor where s johnny atwood inquired the sunburned young man in a business tone gone said keogh working carefully at uncle sam s necktie that s just like him remarked the nut brown one leaning against the table he always was a fellow to gallivant around instead of tending to business will he be in soon don t think so said keogh after a fair amount of deliberation i s pose he s out at some of his tomfoolery conjectured the visitor in a tone of virtuous conviction johnny never would stick to anything long enough to succeed i wonder how he manages to run his business here and never be round to look after it i m looking after the business just now admitted the pro term consul are you then say where s the factory what factory asked keogh with a mildly polite interest why the factory where they use them cockleburrs lord knows what they use em for anyway i ve got the basements of both them ships out there loaded with em i ll give you a bargain in this lot i ve had every man woman and child around dalesburg that wasn t busy pickin em for a month i hired these ships to bring em over everybody thought i was crazy now you can have this lot for fifteen cents a pound delivered on land and if you want more i guess old alabam can come up to the demand johnny told me when he left home that if he struck anything down here that there was any money in he d let me in on it shall i drive the ships in and hitch a look of supreme almost incredulous delight dawned in keogh s ruddy countenance he dropped his pencil his eyes turned upon the sunburned young man with joy in them mingled with fear lest his ecstasy should prove a dream for god s sake tell me said keogh earnestly are you dink pawson my name is pinkney dawson said the cornerer of the cockleburr market billy keogh slid rapturously and gently from his chair to his favorite strip of matting on the floor there were not many sounds in coralio on that sultry afternoon among those that were may be mentioned a noise of enraptured and unrighteous laughter from a prostrate irish american while a sunburned young man with a shrewd eye looked on him with wonder and amazement also the tramp tramp tramp of many well shod feet in the streets outside also the lonesome wash of the waves that beat along the historic shores of the spanish main xiv masters of arts a two inch stub of a blue pencil was the wand with which keogh performed the preliminary acts of his magic so with this he covered paper with diagrams and figures while he waited for the united states of america to send down to coralio a successor to atwood resigned the new scheme that his mind had conceived his stout heart indorsed and his blue pencil corroborated was laid around the characteristics and human frailties of the new president ofanchuria these characteristics and the situation out of which keogh hoped to wrest a golden tribute deserve chronicling contributive to the clear order of events president losada many called him dictator was a man whose genius would have made him conspicuous even among anglo saxons had not that genius been intermixed with other traits that were petty and subversive he had some of the lofty patriotism of washington the man he most admired the force of napoleon and much of the wisdom of the sages these characteristics might have justified him the assumption of the title of the illustrious liberator had they not been accompanied by a stupendous and amazing vanity that kept him in the less worthy ranks of the dictators yet he did his country great service with a mighty grasp he shook it nearly free from the shackles of ignorance and sloth and the vermin that fed upon it and all but made it a power in the council of nations he established schools and hospitals built roads bridges railroads and palaces and bestowed generous subsidies upon the arts and sciences he was the absolute despot and the idol of his people the wealth of the country poured into his hands other presidents had been rapacious without reason losada amassed enormous wealth but his people had their share of the benefits the joint in his armor was his insatiate passion for monuments and tokens commemorating his glory in every town he caused to be erected statues of himself bearing legends in praise of his greatness in the walls of every public edifice tablets were fixed reciting his splendor and the gratitude of his subjects his statuettes and portraits were scattered throughout the land in every house and hut one of the sycophants in his court painted him as st john with a halo and a train of attendants in full uniform losada saw nothing incongruous in this picture and had it hung in a church in the capital he ordered from a french sculptor a marble group including himself with napoleon alexander the great and one or two others whom he deemed worthy of the honor he ransacked europe for decorations employing policy money and intrigue to cajole the orders he coveted from kings and rulers on state occasions his breast was covered from shoulder to shoulder with crosses stars golden roses medals and ribbons it was said that the man who could contrive for him a new decoration or invent some new method of extolling his greatness might plunge a hand deep into the treasury this was the man upon whom billy keogh had his eye the gentle buccaneer had observed the rain of favors that fell upon those who ministered to the president s vanities and he did not deem it his duty to hoist his umbrella against the scattering drops of liquid fortune in a few weeks the new consul arrived releasing keogh from his temporary duties he was a young man fresh from college who lived for botany alone the consulate at coralio gave him the opportunity to study tropical flora he wore smoked glasses and carried a green umbrella he filled the cool back porch of the consulate with plants and specimens so that space for a bottle and chair was not to be found keogh gazed on him sadly but without rancor and began to pack his gripsack for his new plot against stagnation along the spanish main required of him a voyage overseas soon came the karlsefin again she of the trampish habits gleaning a cargo of coconuts for a speculative descent upon the new york market keogh was booked for a passage on the return trip yes i m going to new york he explained to the group of his countrymen that had gathered on the beach to see him off but i ll be back before you miss me i ve undertaken the art education of this piebald country and i m not the man to desert it while it s in the early throes of tintypes with this mysterious declaration of his intentions keogh boarded the karlsefin ten days later shivering with the collar of his thin coat turned high he burst into the studio of carolus white at the top of a tall building in tenth street new york city carolus white was smoking a cigarette and frying sausages over an oil stove he was only twenty three and had noble theories about art billy knight exclaimed white extending the hand that was not busy with the frying pan from what part of the uncivilized world i wonder hello carry said keogh dragging forward a stool and holding his fingers close to the stove i m glad i found you so soon i ve been looking for you all day in the directories and art galleries the free lunch man on the corner told me where you were quick i was sure you d be painting pictures yet keogh glanced about the studio with the shrewd eye of a connoisseur in business yes you can do it he declared with many gentle nods of his head that big one in the corner with the angels and greeh clouds and band wagon is just the sort of thing we want what would you call that carry scene from coney island ain t it that said white i had intended to call the translation of elijah but you may be nearer right than i am name doesn t matter said keogh largely it s the frame and the varieties of paint that does the trick now i can tell you in a minute what i want i ve come on a little voyage of two thousand miles to take you in with me on a scheme i thought of you as soon as the scheme showed itself to me how would you like to go back with me and paint a picture ninety days for the trip and five thousand dollars for the job cereal food or hair tonic posters asked white it isn t an ad what kind of a picture is it to be it s a long story said keogh go ahead with it if you don t mind while you talk i ll just keep my eye on these sausages let em get one shade deeper than a vandyke brown and you spoil em keogh explained his project they were to return to coralio where white was to pose as a distinguished american portrait painter who was touring in the tropics as a relaxation from his arduous and remunerative professional labors it was not an unreasonable hope even to those who trod in the beaten paths of business that an artist with so much prestige might secure a commission to perpetuate upon canvas the lineaments of the president and secure a share of the pesos that were raining upon the caterers to his weaknesses keogh had set his price at ten thousand dollars artists had been paid more for portraits he and white were to share the expenses of the trip and divide the possible profits thus he laid the scheme before white whom he had known in the west before one declared for art and the other became a bedouin before long the two machinators abandoned the rigor of the bare studio for a snug corner of a cafe there they sat far into the night with old envelopes and keogh s stub of blue pencil between them at twelve o clock white doubled up in his chair with his chin on his fist and shut his eyes at the unbeautiful wall paper i ll go you billy he said in the quiet tones of decision i ve got two or three hundred saved up for sausages and rent and i ll take the chance with you five thousand it will give me two years in paris and one in italy i ll begin to pack tomorrow you ll begin in ten minutes said keogh it s to morrow now the karlsefin starts back at four p m come on to your painting shop and i ll help you for five months in the year coralio is the newport of anchuria then only does the town possess life from november to march it is practically the seat of government the president with his official family sojourns there and society follows him the pleasure loving people make the season one long holiday of amusement and rejoicing fiestas balls games sea bathing processions and small theatres contribute to their enjoyment the famous swiss band from the capital plays in the little plaza every evening while the fourteen carriages and vehicles in the town circle in funereal but complacent procession indians from the interior mountains looking like pre historic stone idols come down to peddle their handiwork in the streets the people throng the narrow ways a chattering happy careless stream of buoyant humanity preposterous children rigged out with the shortest of ballet skirts and gilt wings howl underfoot among the effervescent crowds especially is the arrival of the presidential party at the opening of the season attended with pomp show and patriotic demonstrations of enthusiasm and delight when keogh and white reached their destination on the return trip of the karlsefin the gay winter season was well begun as they stepped upon the beach they could hear the band playing in the plaza the village maidens with fireflies already fixed in their dark locks were gliding barefoot and coy eyed along the paths dandies in white linen swinging their canes were beginning their seductive strolls the air was full of human essence of artificial enticement of coquetry indolence pleasure the man made sense of existence the first two or three days after their arrival were spent in preliminaries keogh escorted the artist about town introducing him to the little circle of english speaking residents and pulling whatever wires he could to effect the spreading of white s fame as a painter and then keogh planned a more spectacular demonstration of the idea he wished to keep before the public he and white engaged rooms in the hotel de los extranjeros the two were clad in new suits of immaculate duck with american straw hats and carried canes of remarkable uniqueness and inutility few caballeros in coralio even the gorgeously uniformed officers of the anchurian army were as conspicuous for ease and elegance of demeanor as keogh and his friend the great american painter senor white white set up his easel on the beach and made striking sketches of the mountain and sea views the native population formed at his rear in a vast chattering semicircle to watch his work keogh with his care for details had arranged for himself a pose which he carried out with fidelity his ro e was that of friend to the great artist a man of affairs and leisure the visible emblem of his position was a pocket camera for branding the man who owns it said he a genteel dilettante with a bank account and an easy conscience a steam yacht ain t in it with a camera you see a man doing nothing but loafing around making snap shots and you know right away he reads up well in bradstreet you notice these old millionaire boys soon as they get through taking everything else in sight they go to taking photographs people are more impressed by a kodak than they are by a title or a four karat scarf pin so keogh strolled blandly about coralio snapping the scenery and the shrinking senoritas while white posed conspicuously in the higher regions of art two weeks after their arrival the scheme began to bear fruit an aide de camp of the president drove to the hotel in a dashing victoria the president desired that senor white come to the casa morena for an informal interview keogh gripped his pipe tightly between his teeth not a cent less than ten thousand he said to the artist remember the price and in gold or its equivalent don t let him stick you with this bargain counter stuff they call money here perhaps it isn t that he wants said white get out said keogh with splendid confidence i know what he wants he wants his picture painted by the celebrated young american painter and filibuster now sojourning in his down trodden country off you go the victoria sped away with the artist keogh walked up and down puffing great clouds of smoke from his pipe and waited in an hour the victoria swept again to the door of the hotel deposited white and vanished the artist dashed up the stairs three at a step keogh stopped smoking and became a silent interrogation point landed exclaimed white with his boyish face flushed with elation billy you are a wonder he wants a picture i ll tell you all about it by heavens that dictator chap is a corker he s a dictator clear down to his finger ends he s a kind of combination of julius caesar lucifer and chauncey depew done in sepia polite and grim that s his way the room i saw him in was about ten acres big and looked like a mississippi steamboat with its gilding and mirrors and white paint he talks english better than i can ever hope to the matter of the price came up i mentioned ten thousand i expected him to call the guard and have me taken out and shot he didn t move an eyelash he just waved one of his chestnut hands in a careless way and said whatever you say i am to go back tomorrow and discuss with him the details of the picture keogh hung his head self abasement was easy to read in his downcast countenance i m failing carry he said sorrowfully i m not fit to handle these man s size schemes any longer peddling oranges in a push cart is about the suitable graft for me when i said ten thousand i swear i thought i had sized up that brown man s limit to within two cents he d have melted down for fifteen thousand just as easy say carry you ll see old man keogh safe in some nice quiet idiot asylum won t you if he makes a break like that again the casa morena although only one story in height was a building of brown stone luxurious as a palace in its interior it stood on a low hill in a walled garden of splendid tropical flora at the upper edge of coralio the next day the president s carriage came again for the artist keogh went out for a walk along the beach where he and his picture box were now familiar sights when he returned to the hotel white was sitting in a steamer chair on the balcony well said keogh did you and his nibs decide on the kind of a chromo he wants white got up and walked back and forth on the balcony a few times then he stopped and laughed strangely his face was flushed and his eyes were bright with a kind of angry amusement look here billy he said somewhat roughly when you first came to me in my studio and mentioned a picture i thought you wanted a smashed oats or a hair tonic poster painted on a range of mountains or the side of a continent well either of those jobs would have been art in its highest form compared to the one you ve steered me against i can t paint that picture billy you ve got to let me out let me try to tell you what that barbarian wants he had it all planned out and even a sketch made of his idea the old boy doesn t draw badly at all but ye goddesses of art listen to the monstrosity he expects me to paint he wants himself in the center of the canvas of course he is to be painted as jupiter sitting on olympus with the clouds at his feet at one side of him stands george washington in full regimentals with his hand on the president s shoulder an angel with outstretched wings hovers overhead and is placing a laurel wreath on the president s head crowning him queen of the may i suppose in the background is to be cannon more angels and soldiers the man who would paint that picture would have to have the soul of a dog and would deserve to go down into oblivion without even a tin can tied to his tail to sound his memory little beads of moisture crept out all over billy keogh s brow the stub of his blue pencil had not figured out a contingency like this the machinery of his plan had run with flattering smoothness until now he dragged another chair upon the balcony and got white back to his seat he lit his pipe with apparent calm now sonny he said with gentle grimness you and me will have an art to art talk you ve got your art and i ve got mine yours is the real pierian stuff that turns up its nose at bock beer signs and oleographs of the old mill mine s the art of business this was my scheme and it worked out like two and two paint that president man as old king cole or venus or a landscape or a fresco or a bunch of lilies or anything he thinks he looks like but get the paint on the canvas and collect the spoils you wouldn t throw me down carry at this stage of the game think of that ten thousand i can t help thinking of it said white and that s what hurts i m tempted to throw every ideal i ever had down in the mire and steep my soul in infamy by painting that picture that five thousand meant three years of foreign study to me and i d almost sell my soul for that now it ain t as bad as that said keogh soothingly it s a business proposition it s so much paint and time against money i don t fall in with your idea that that picture would so everlastingly jolt the art side of the question george washington was all right you know and nobody could say a word against the angel i don t think so bad of that group if you was to give jupiter a pair of epaulets and a sword and kind of work the clouds around to look like a blackberry patch it wouldn t make such a bad battle scene why if we hadn t already settled on the price he ought to pay an extra thousand for washington and the angel ought to raise it five hundred you don t understand billy said white with an uneasy laugh some of us fellows who try to paint have big notions about art i wanted to paint a picture some day that people would stand before and forget that it was made of paint i wanted it to creep into them like a bar of music and mushroom there like a soft bullet and i wanted em to go away and ask what else has he done and i didn t want em to find a thing not a portrait nor a magazine cover nor an illustration nor a drawing of a girl nothing but the picture that s why i ve lived on fried sausages and tried to keep true to myself i persuaded myself to do this portrait for the chance it might give me to study abroad but this howling screaming caricature good lord can t you see how it is sure said keogh as tenderly as he would have spoken to a child and he laid a long forefinger on white s knee i see it s bad to have your art all slugged up like that i know you wanted to paint a big thing like the panorama of the battle of gettysburg but let me kalsomine you a little mental sketch to consider up to date we re out on this scheme our capital took every cent both of us could raise we ve got about enough left to get back to new york on i need my share of that ten thousand i want to work a copper deal in idaho and make a hundred thousand that s the business end of the thing come down off your art perch carry and let s land that hatful of dollars billy said white with an effort i ll try i won t say i ll do it but i ll try i ll go at it and put it through if i can that s business said keogh heartily good boy now here s another thing rush that picture crowd it through as quick as you can get a couple of boys to help you mix the paint if necessary i ve picked up some pointers around town the people here are beginning to get sick of mr president they say he s been too free with concessions and they accuse him of trying to make a dicker with england to sell out the country we want that picture done and paid for before there s any row in the great patio of casa morena the president caused to be stretched a huge canvas under this white set up his temporary studio for two hours each day the great man sat to him white worked faithfully but as the work progressed he had seasons of bitter scorn of infinite self contempt of sullen gloom and sardonic gaiety keogh with the patience of a great general soothed coaxed argued kept him at the picture at the end of a month white announced that the picture was completed jupiter washington angels clouds cannon and all his face was pale and his mouth drawn straight when he told keogh he said the president was much pleased with it it was to be hung in the national gallery of statesmen and heroes the artist had been requested to return to casa morena on the following day to receive payment at the appointed time he left the hotel silent under his friend s joyful talk of their success an hour later he walked into the room where keogh was waiting threw his hat on the floor and sat upon the table billy he said in strained and laboring tones i ve a little money out west in a small business that my brother is running it s what i ve been living on while i ve been studying art i ll draw out my share and pay you back what you ve lost on this scheme lost exclaimed keogh jumping up didn t you get paid for the picture yes i got paid said white but just now there isn t any picture and there isn t any pay if you care to hear about it here are the edifying details the president and i were looking at the painting his secretary brought a bank draft on new york for ten thousand dollars and handed it to me the moment i touched it i went wild i tore it into little pieces and threw them on the floor a workman was repainting the pillars inside the patio a bucket of his paint happened to be convenient i picked up his brush and slapped a quart of blue paint all over that ten thousand dollar nightmare i bowed and walked out the president didn t move or speak that was one time he was taken by surprise it s tough on you billy but i couldn t help it there seemed to be excitement in coralio outside there was a confused rising murmur pierced by high pitched cries bajo el traidor muerte el traidor were the words they seemed to form listen to that exclaimed white bitterly i know that much spanish they re shouting down with the traitor i heard them before i felt that they meant me i was a traitor to art the picture had to go down with the blank fool would have suited your case better said keogh with fiery emphasis you tear up ten thousand dollars like an old rag because the way you ve spread on five dollars worth of paint hurts your conscience next time i pick a side partner in a scheme the man has got to go before a notary and swear he never even heard the word ideal mentioned keogh strode from the room white hot white paid little attention to his resentment the scorn of billy keogh seemed a trifling thing beside the greater self scorn he had escaped in coralio the excitement waxed an outburst was imminent the cause of this demonstration of displeasure was the presence in the town of a big pink cheeked englishman who it was said was an agent of his government come to clinch the bargain by which the president placed his people in the hands of a foreign power it was charged that not only had he given away priceless concessions but that the public debt was to be transferred into the hands of the english and the custom houses turned over to them as a guarantee the long enduring people had determined to make their protest felt on that night in coralio and in other towns their ire found vent veiling mobs mercurial but dangerous roamed the streets they overthrew the great bronze statue of the president that stood in the center of the plaza and hacked it to shapeless pieces they tore from public buildings the tablets set there proclaiming the glory of the illustrious liberator his pictures in the government offices were demolished the mobs even attacked the casa morena but were driven away by the military which remained faithful to the executive all the night terror reigned the greatness of losada was shown by the fact that by noon the next day order was restored and he was still absolute he issued proclamations denying positively that any negotiation of any kind had been entered into with england sir stafford vaughn the pink cheeked englishman also declared in placards and in public print that his presence there had no international significance he was a traveller without guile in fact so he stated he had not even spoken with the president or been in his presence since his arrival during this disturbance white was preparing for his homeward voyage in the steamship that was to sail within two or three days about noon keogh the restless took his camera out with the hope of speeding the lagging hours the town was now as quiet as if peace had never departed from her perch on the red tiled roofs about the middle of the afternoon keogh hurried back to the hotel with something decidedly special in his air he retired to the little room where he developed his pictures later on he came out to white on the balcony with a luminous grim predatory smile on his face do you know what that is he asked holding up a x photograph mounted on cardboard snap shot of a senorita sitting in the sand alliteration unintentional guessed white lazily wrong saidkeogh with shining eyes it s a slung shot it s a can of dynamite it s a gold mine it s a sight draft on your president man for twenty thousand dollars yes sir twenty thousand this time and no spoiling the picture no ethics of art in the way art you with your smelly little tubes i ve got you skinned to death with a kodak take a look at that white took the picture in his hand and gave a long whistle jove he exclaimed but wouldn t that stir up a row in town if you let it be seen how in the world did you get it billy you know that high wall around the president man s back garden i was up there trying to get a bird s eye of the town i happened to notice a chink in the wall where a stone and a lot of plaster had slid out thinks i i ll take a peep through to see how mr president s cabbages are growing the first thing i saw was him and this sir englishman sitting at a little table about twenty feet away they had the table all spread over with documents and they were hobnobbing over them as thick as two pirates twas a nice corner of the garden all private and shady with palms and orange trees and they had a pail of champagne set by handy in the grass i knew then was the time for me to make my big hit in art so i raised the machine up to the crack and pressed the button just as i did so them old boys shook hands on the deal you see they took that way in the picture keogh put on his coat and hat what are you going to do with it asked white me said keogh in a hurt tone why i m going to tie a pink ribbon to it and hang it on the what not of course i m surprised at you but while i m out you just try to figure out what ginger cake potentate would be most likely to want to buy this work of art for his private collection just to keep it out of circulation the sunset was reddening the tops of the coconut palms when billy keogh came back from casa morena he nodded to the artist s questioning gaze and lay down on a cot with his hands under the back of his head i saw him he paid the money like a little man they didn t want to let me in at first i told em it was important yes that president man is on the plenty able list he s got a beautiful business system about the way he uses his brains all i had to do was to hold up the photograph so he could see it and name the price he just smiled and walked over to a safe and got the cash twenty one thousand dollar brand new united states treasury notes he laid on the table like i d pay out a dollar and a quarter fine notes too they crackled with a sound like burning the brush off a ten acre lot let s try the feel of one said white curiously i never saw a thousand dollar bill keogh did not immediately respond carry he said in an absent minded way you think a heap of your art don t you more said white frankly than has been for the financial good of my self and my friends i thought you were a fool the other day went on keogh quietly and i m not sure now that you wasn t but if you was so am i i ve been in some funny deals carry but i ve always managed to scramble fair and match my brains and capital against the other fellow s but when it comes to well when you ve got the other fellow cinched and the screws on him and he s got to put up why it don t strike me as being a man s game they ve got a name for it you know it s confound you don t you understand a fellow feels it s some thing like that blamed art of yours he well i tore that photograph up and laid the pieces on that stack of money and shoved the whole business back across the table excuse me mr losada i said but i guess i ve made a mistake in the price you get the photo for nothing now carry you get out the pencil and we ll do some more figuring i d like to save enough out of our capital for you to have some fried sausages in your joint when you get back to new york xv dickey there is little consecutiveness along the spanish main things happen there intermittently even time seems hang his scythe daily on the branch of an orange tree while he takes a siesta and a cigarette after the ineffectual revolt against the administration of president losada the country settled again into quiet toleration of the abuses with which he had been charged in coralio old political enemies went arm in arm lightly eschewing for the time all differences of opinion the failure of the art expedition did not stretch the cat footed keogh upon his back the ups and downs of fortune made smooth travelling for his nimble steps his blue pencil stub was at work again before the smoke of the steamer on which white sailed had cleared away from the horizon he had but to speak a word to geddie to find his credit negotiable for whatever goods he wanted from the store of brannigan company on the same day on which white arrived in new york keogh at the rear of a train of five pack mules loaded with hardware and cutlery set his face toward the grim interior mountains there the indian tribes wash gold dust from the auriferous streams and when a market is brought to them trading is brisk and muy bueno in the cordilleras in coralio time folded his wings and paced wearily along his drowsy path they who had most cheered the torpid hours were gone clancy had sailed on a spanish barque for colon contemplating a cut across the isthmus and then a further voyage to end at callao where the fighting was said to be on geddie whose quiet and genial nature had once served to mitigate the frequent dull reaction of lotus eating was now a home man happy with his bright orchid paula and never even dreaming of or regretting the unsolved sealed and monogramed bottle whose contents now inconsiderable were held safely in the keeping of the sea well may the walrus most discerning and eclectic of beasts place sealing wax midway on his program of topics that fall pertinent and diverting upon the ear atwood was gone he of the hospitable back porch and ingenuous cunning doctor gregg with his trepanning story smoldering within him was a whiskered volcano always showing signs of imminent eruption and was not to be considered in the ranks of those who might contribute to the amelioration of ennui the new consul s note chimed with the sad sea waves and the violent tropical greens he had not a bar of scheherezade or of the round table in his lute goodwin was employed with large projects what time he was loosed from them found him at his home where he loved to be therefore it will be seen that there was a dearth of fellowship and entertainment among the foreign contingent of coralio and then dicky maloney dropped down from the clouds upon the town and amused it nobody knew where dicky maloney hailed from or how he reached coralio he appeared there one day and that was all he afterward said that he came on the fruit steamer thor but an inspection of the thor s passenger list of that date was found to be maloneyless curiosity however soon perished and dicky took his place among the odd fish cast up by the caribbean he was an active devil may care rollicking fellow with an engaging gray eye the most irresistible grin a rather dark or much sunburned complexion and a head of the fieriest red hair ever seen in that country speaking the spanish language as well as he spoke english and seeming always to have plenty of silver in his pockets it was not long before he was a welcome companion whithersoever he went he had an extreme fondness for vino blanco and gained the reputation of being able to drink more of it than any three men in town everybody called him dicky everybody cheered up at the sight of him especially the natives to whom his marvellous red hair and his free and easy style were a constant delight and envy wherever you went in the town you would soon see dicky or hear his genial laugh and find around him a group of admirers who appreciated him both for his good nature and the white wine he was always so ready to buy a considerable amount of speculation was had concerning the object of his sojourn there until one day he silenced this by opening a small shop for the sale of tobacco dulces and the handiwork of the interior indians fibre and silk woven goods deerskin zapatos and basketwork of tule reeds even then he did not change his habits for he was drinking and playing cards half the day and night with the comandante the collector of customs

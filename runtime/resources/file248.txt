dixie that is one of the most remarkable literary efforts that has ever come under my observation none but a master mind and talent could have produced it it would just fill the space that i have reserved for its possible use thacker looked anxious what kind of stuff is it he asked eight thousand words sounds suspicious the oldest families must have been collaborating is there going to be another secession the author of the article continued the colonel ignoring thacker s allusions is a writer of some reputation he has also distinguished himself in other ways i do not feel at liberty to reveal to you his name at least not until i have decided whether or not to accept his contribution well said thacker nervously is it a continued story or an account of the unveiling of the new town pump in whitmire south carolina or a revised list of general lee s body servants or what you are disposed to be facetious said colonel telfair calmly the article is from the pen of a thinker a philosopher a lover of mankind a student and a rhetorician of high degree it must have been written by a syndicate said thacker but honestly colonel you want to go slow i don t know of any eight thousand word single doses of written matter that are read by anybody these days except supreme court briefs and reports of murder trials you haven t by any accident gotten hold of a copy of one of daniel webster s speeches have you colonel telfair swung a little in his chair and looked steadily from under his bushy eyebrows at the magazine promoter mr thacker he said gravely i am willing to segregate the somewhat crude expression of your sense of humor from the solicitude that your business investments undoubtedly have conferred upon you but i must ask you to cease your jibes and derogatory comments upon the south and the southern people they sir will not be tolerated in the office of the rose of dixie for one moment and before you proceed with more of your covert insinuations that i the editor of this magazine am not a competent judge of the merits of the matter submitted to its consideration i beg that you will first present some evidence or proof that you are my superior in any way shape or form relative to the question in hand oh come colonel said thacker good naturedly i didn t do anything like that to you it sounds like an indictment by the fourth assistant attorney general let s get back to business what s this to shot about the article said colonel telfair acknowledging the apology by a slight bow covers a wide area of knowledge it takes up theories and questions that have puzzled the world for centuries and disposes of them logically and concisely one by one it holds up to view the evils of the world points out the way of eradicating them and then conscientiously and in detail comments the good there is hardly a phase of human life that it does not discuss wisely calmly and equitably the great policies of governments the duties of private citizens the obligations of home life law ethics morality all these important subjects are handled with a calm wisdom and confidence that i must confess has captured my admiration it must be a crackerjack said thacker impressed it is a great contribution to the world s wisdom said the colonel the only doubt remaining in my mind as to the tremendous advantage it would be to us to give it publication in the rose of dixie is that i have not yet sufficient information about the author to give his work publicity in our magazine i thought you said he is a distinguished man said thacker he is replied the colonel both in literary and in other more diversified and extraneous fields but i am extremely careful about the matter that i accept for publication my contributors are people of unquestionable repute and connections which fact can be verified at any time as i said i am holding this article until i can acquire more information about its author i do not know whether i will publish it or not if i decide against it i shall be much pleased mr thacker to substitute the matter that you are leaving with me in its place thacker was somewhat at sea i don t seem to gather said he much about the gist of this inspired piece of literature it sounds more like a dark horse than pegasus to me it is a human document said the colonel editor confidently from a man of great accomplishments who in my opinion has obtained a stronger grasp on the world and its outcomes than that of any man living to day thacker rose to his feet excitedly say he said it isn t possible that you ve cornered john d rockefeller s memoirs is it don t tell me that all at once no sir said colonel telfair i am speaking of mentality and literature not of the less worthy intricacies of trade well what s the trouble about running the article asked thacker a little impatiently if the man s well known and has got the stuff colonel telfair sighed mr thacker said he for once i have been tempted nothing has yet appeared in the rose of dixie that has not been from the pen of one of its sons or daughters i know little about the author of this article except that he has acquired prominence in a section of the country that has always been inimical to my heart and mind but i recognize his genius and as i have told you i have instituted an investigation of his personality perhaps it will be futile but i shall pursue the inquiry until that is finished i must leave open

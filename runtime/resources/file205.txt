got the capital to go into business together modern rural sports jeff peters must be reminded whenever he is called upon pointedly for a story he will maintain that his life has been as devoid of incident as the longest of trollope s novels but lured he will divulge therefore i cast many and divers flies upon the current of his thoughts before i feel a nibble i notice said i that the western farmers in spite of their prosperity are running after their old populistic idols again it s the running season said jeff for farmers shad maple trees and the connemaugh river i know something about farmers i thought i struck one once that had got out of the rut but andy tucker proved to me i was mistaken once a farmer always a sucker said andy he s the man that s shoved into the front row among bullets ballots and the ballet he s the funny bone and gristle of the country said andy and i don t know who we would do without him one morning me and andy wakes up with sixty eight cents between us in a yellow pine hotel on the edge of the pre digested hoe cake belt of southern indiana how we got off the train there the night before i can t tell you for she went through the village so fast that what looked like a saloon to us through the car window turned out to be a composite view of a drug store and a water tank two blocks apart why we got off at the first station we could belongs to a little oroide gold watch and alaska diamond deal we failed to pull off the day before over the kentucky line when i woke up i heard roosters crowing and smelt something like the fumes of nitro muriatic acid and heard something heavy fall on the floor below us and a man swearing cheer up andy says i we re in a rural community somebody has just tested a gold brick downstairs we ll go out and get what s coming to us from a farmer and then yoicks and away farmers was always a kind of reserve fund to me whenever i was in hard luck i d go to the crossroads hook a finger in a farmer s suspender recite the prospectus of my swindle in a mechanical kind of a way look over what he had give him back his keys whetstone and papers that was of no value except to owner and stroll away without asking any questions farmers are not fair game to me as high up in our business as me and andy was but there was times when we found em useful just as wall street does the secretary of the treasury now and then when we went down stairs we saw we was in the midst of the finest farming section we ever see about two miles away on a hill was a big white house in a grove surrounded by a wide spread agricultural agglomeration of fields and barns and pastures and out houses whose house is that we asked the landlord that says he is the domicile and the arboreal terrestrial and horticultural accessories of farmer ezra plunkett one of our county s most progressive citizens after breakfast me and andy with eight cents capital left casts the horoscope of the rural potentate let me go alone says i two of us against one farmer would look as one sided as roosevelt using both hands to kill a grizzly all right says andy i like to be a true sport even when i m only collecting rebates from the rutabag raisers what bait are you going to use for this ezra thing andy asks me oh i says the first thing that come to hand in the suit case i reckon i ll take along some of the new income tax

necklace found on the train and a pocket size goldbrick and a that ll be enough says andy any one of the lot ought to land on ezra and say jeff make that succotash fancier give you nice clean new bills it s a disgrace to our department of agriculture civil service and pure food law the kind of stuff some of these farmers hand out to use i ve had to take rolls from em that looked like bundles of microbe cultures captured out of a red cross ambulance so i goes to a livery stable and hires a buggy on my looks i drove out to the plunkett farm and hitched there was a man sitting on the front

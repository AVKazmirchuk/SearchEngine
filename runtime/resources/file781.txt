a favour manner you have cast a serious reflection upon the literary standards of the paper that employs you you have also assisted materially in giving us the biggest beat of the year i will let you know in a day or two whether you are to be discharged or retained at a larger salary somebody send ames to me ames was the king pin the snowy petalled marguerite the star bright looloo of the rewrite

derelict potato at a passing automobile when not rewriting ames sat on the porch of his brooklyn villa playing checkers with his ten year old son ames and the war editor shut themselves in a room there was a map in there stuck full of little pins that represented armies and divisions their fingers had been itching for days to move those pins along the crooked line of the yalu they did so now

are words and how they make friends one with another being oft associated until not even obituary notices them do part on the second day following the city editor halted at vesey s desk where the reporter was writing the story of a man who had broken his leg by falling into a coal hole ames having failed to find a murder motive in it the old man says your salary is to be raised to twenty a

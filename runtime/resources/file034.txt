imposed upon the ranger s warlike ecstasy instead of dealing the traditional downward stroke the mexican lunged straight with his knife buckley took the precarious chance and caught his wrist fair and firm then he delivered the good saxon knock out blow always so pathetically disastrous to the fistless latin races and garcia was down and out with his head under a clump of prickly pears the ranger looked up again to the queen of the serpents alvarita scrambled down to the path i m mighty glad i happened along when i did said the ranger he he frightened me so cooed alvarita they did not hear the long low hiss of the python under the shrubs wiliest of the beasts no doubt he was expressing the humiliation he felt at having so long dwelt in subjection to this trembling and colouring mistress of his whom he had deemed so strong and potent and fearsome then came galloping to the spot the civic authorities and to them the ranger awarded the prostrate disturber of the peace whom they bore away limply across the saddle of one of their mounts but buckley and alvarita lingered slowly slowly they walked the ranger regained his belt of weapons with a fine timidity she begged the indulgence of fingering the great s with little ohs and ahs of new born delicious shyness the canoncito was growing dusky beyond its terminus in the river bluff they could see the outer world yet suffused with the waning glory of sunset a scream a piercing scream of fright from alvarita back she cowered and the ready protecting arm of buckley formed her refuge what terror so dire as to thus beset the close of the reign of the never before daunted queen across the path there crawled a caterpillar a horrid fuzzy two inch caterpillar truly kuku thou went avenged thus abdicated the queen of the serpent tribe viva la reina the higher abdication curly the tramp sidled toward the free lunch counter he caught a fleeting glance from the bartender s eye and stood still trying to look like a business man who had just dined at the menger and was waiting for a friend who had promised to pick him up in his motor car curly s histrionic powers were equal to the impersonation but his make up was wanting the bartender rounded the bar in a casual way looking up at the ceiling as though he was pondering some intricate problem of kalsomining and then fell upon curly so suddenly that the roadster had no excuses ready irresistibly but so composedly that it seemed almost absendmindedness on his part the dispenser of drinks pushed curly to the swinging doors and kicked him out with a nonchalance that almost amounted to sadness that was the way of the southwest curly arose from the gutter leisurely he felt no anger or resentment toward his ejector fifteen years of tramphood spent out of the twenty two years of his life had hardened the fibres of his spirit the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune fell blunted from the buckler of his armoured pride with especial resignation did he suffer contumely and injury at the hands of bartenders naturally they were his enemies and unnaturally they were often his friends he had to take his chances with them but he had not yet learned to estimate these cool languid southwestern knights of the bungstarter who had the manners of an earl of pawtucket and who when they disapproved of your presence moved you with the silence and despatch of a chess automaton advancing a pawn curly stood for a few moments in the narrow mesquite paved street san antonio puzzled and disturbed him three days he had been a non paying guest of the town having dropped off there from a box car of an i g n freight because greaser johnny had told him in des moines that the alamo city was manna fallen gathered cooked and served free with cream and sugar curly had found the tip partly a good one there was hospitality in plenty of a careless liberal irregular sort but the town itself was a weight upon his spirits after his experience with the rushing business like systematised cities of the north and east here he was often flung a dollar but too frequently a good natured kick would follow it once a band of hilarious cowboys had roped him on military plaza and dragged him across the black soil until no respectable rag bag would have stood sponsor for his clothes the winding doubling streets leading nowhere bewildered him and then there was a little river crooked as a pot hook that crawled through the middle of the town crossed by a hundred little bridges so nearly alike that they got on curly s nerves and the last bartender wore a number nine shoe the saloon stood on a corner the hour was eight o clock homefarers and outgoers jostled curly on the narrow stone sidewalk between the buildings to his left he looked down a cleft that proclaimed itself another thoroughfare the alley was dark except for one patch of light where there was light there were sure to be human beings where there were human beings after nightfall in san antonio there might be food and there was sure to be drink so curly headed for the light the illumination came from schwegel s cafe on the sidewalk in front of it curly picked up an old envelope it might have contained a check for a million it was empty but the wanderer read the address mr otto schwegel and the name of the town and state the postmark was detroit curly entered the saloon and now in the light it could be perceived that he bore the stamp of many years of vagabondage he had none of the tidiness of the calculating and shrewd professional tramp his wardrobe represented

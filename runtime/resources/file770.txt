partly filled with straw into the patio here and take my trunk to the sloop there is more money yet now hurry for one time mateo walked away without shuffling his feet angela cried mrs conant almost fiercely come and help me pack i am going away out with this trunk my clothes first stir yourself those dark dresses first hurry from the first she did not waver from her decision her view was clear and final her door had opened and let the world in her love for merriam was not lessened but it now appeared a hopeless and unrealizable thing the visions of their future that had seemed so blissful and complete had vanished she tried to assure herself that her renunciation was rather for his sake than for her own now that she was cleared of her burden at least technically would not his own weigh too heavily upon him if she should cling to him would not the difference forever silently mar and corrode their happiness thus she reasoned but there were a thousand little voices calling to her that she could feel rather than hear like the hum of distant powerful machinery the little voices of the world that when raised in unison can send their insistent call through the thickest door once while packing a brief shadow of the lotus dream came back to her she held merriam s picture to her heart with one hand while she threw a pair of shoes into the trunk with her other at six o clock mateo returned and reported the sloop ready he and his brother lifted the trunk into the cart covered it with straw and conveyed it to the point of embarkation from there they transferred it on board in the sloop s dory then mateo returned for additional orders mrs conant was ready she had settled all business matters with angela and was impatiently waiting she wore a long loose black silk duster that she often walked about in when the evenino s were chilly on her head was a small round hat and over it the apricot coloured lace mantilla dusk had quickly followed the short twilight mateo led her by dark and grass grown streets toward the point behind which the sloop was anchored on turning a corner they beheld the hotel orilla del mar three streets away nebulously aglow with its array of kerosene lamps mrs conant paused with streamin eyes i must i must see him once before i go she murmured in anguish but even then she did not falter in her decision quickly she invented a plan by which she might speak to him and yet make her departure without his knowing she would walk past the hotel ask some one to call him out and talk a few moments on some trivial excuse leaving him expecting to see her at her home at seven she unpinned her hat and gave it to mateo keep this and wait here till i come she ordered then she draped the mantilla over her head as she usually did when walking after sunset and went straight to the orilla del mar she was glad to see the bulky white clad figure of tio pancho standing alone on the gallery tio pancho she said with a charming smile may i trouble you to ask mr merriam to come out for just a few moments that i may speak with him tio pancho bowed as an elephant bows buenas tardes se ora conant he said as a cavalier talks and then he went on less at his ease but does not the se ora know that se or merriam sailed on the pajaro for panama at three o clock of this afternoon the theory and the hound not many days ago my old friend from the tropics j

a yellow pug the dog entangled himself with bridger s legs and mumbled his ankles in a snarling peevish sulky bite bridger with a happy smile kicked the breath out of the brute the woman showered us with a quick rain of well conceived adjectives that left us in no doubt as to our place in her opinion and we passed on ten yards farther an old woman with dis ordered white hair and her bankbook tucked well hidden beneath her tattered shawl begged bridger stopped and disinterred for her a quarter from his holiday waist coat on the next corner a quarter of a ton of well clothed man with a rice powdered fat white jowl stood holding the chain of a devil born bulldog whose forelegs were strangers by the length of a dachshund a little woman in a last season s hat confronted him and wept which was plainly all she could do while he cursed her in low sweet practised tones bridger smiled again strictly to himself and this time he took out a little memorandum book and made a note of it this he had no right to do without due explanation and i said so it s a new theory said bridger that i picked up down in ratona i ve been gathering support for it as i knock about the world isn t ripe for it

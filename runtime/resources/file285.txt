away contemptuously i went straight to captain floyd and says to him sam i don t think this war is a straight game you know as well as i do that bob turner was one of the whitest fellows that ever threw a leg over a saddle and now these wirepullers in washington have fixed his clock he s politically and ostensibly dead it ain t fair why should they keep this thing up if they want spain licked why don t they turn the san augustine rifles and joe seely s ranger company and a car load of west texas deputy sheriffs onto these spaniards and let us exonerate them from the face of the earth i never did says i care much about fighting by the lord chesterfield ring rules i m going to hand in my resignation and go home if anybody else i am personally acquainted with gets hurt in this war if you can get somebody in my place sam says i i ll quit the first of next week i don t want to work in an army that don t give its help a chance never mind my wages says i let the secretary of the treasury keep em well ben says the captain to me your allegations and estimations of the tactics of war government patriotism guard mounting and democracy are all right but i ve looked into the system of international arbitration and the ethics of justifiable slaughter a little closer maybe than you have now you can hand in your resignation the first of next week if you are so minded but if you do says sam i ll order a corporal s guard to take you over by that limestone bluff on the creek and shoot enough lead into you to ballast a submarine air ship i m captain of this company and i ve swore allegiance to the amalgamated states regardless of sectional secessional and congressional differences have you got any smoking tobacco winds up sam mine got wet when i swum the creek this morning the reason i drag all this non ex parte evidence in is because willie robbins was standing there listening to us i was a second sergeant and he was a private then but among us texans and westerners there never was as much tactics and subordination as there was in the regular army we never called our captain anything but sam except when there was a lot of major generals and admirals around so as to preserve the discipline and says willie robbins to me in a sharp construction of voice much unbecoming to his light hair and previous record you ought to be shot ben for emitting any such sentiments a man that won t fight for his country is worse than a horse thief if i was the cap i d put you in the guard house for thirty days on round steak and tamales war says willie is great and glorious i didn t know you were a coward i m not says i if i was i d knock some of the pallidness off of your marble brow i m lenient with you i says just as i am with the spaniards because you have always reminded me of something with mushrooms on the side why you little lady of shalott says i you underdone leader of cotillions you glassy fashion and moulded form you white pine soldier made in the cisalpine alps in germany for the late new year trade do you know of whom you are talking to we ve been in the same social circle says i and i ve put up with you because you seemed so meek and self un satisfying i don t understand why you have so sudden taken a personal interest in chivalrousness and murder your nature s undergone a complete revelation now how is it well you wouldn t understand ben says willie giving one of his refined smiles and turning away come back here says i catching him by the tail of his khaki coat you ve made me kind of mad in spite of the aloofness in which i have heretofore held you you are out for making a success in this hero business and i believe i know what for you are doing it either because you are crazy or because you expect to catch some girl by it now if it s a girl i ve got something here to show you i wouldn t have done it but i was plumb mad i pulled a san augustine paper out of my hip pocket and showed him an item it was a half a column about the marriage of myra allison and joe granberry willie laughed and i saw i hadn t touched him oh says he everybody knew that was going to happen i heard about that a week ago and then he gave me the laugh again all right says i then why do you so recklessly chase the bright rainbow of fame do you expect to be elected president or do you belong to a suicide club and then captain sam interferes you gentlemen quit jawing and go back to your quarters says he or i ll have you escorted to the guard house now scat both of you before you go which one of you has got any chewing tobacco we re off sam says i it s supper time anyhow but what do you think of what we was talking about i ve noticed you throwing out a good many grappling hooks for this here balloon called fame what s ambition anyhow what does a man risk his life day after day for do you know of anything he gets in the end that can pay him for the trouble i want to go back home says i i don t care whether cuba sinks or swims and i don

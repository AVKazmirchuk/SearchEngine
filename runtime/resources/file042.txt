to be reminded of things she never heard of a one sided view of objects is disjointing to the female composition tis a misfortune of mine begotten by nature and travel continued jeff looking thoughtfully between his elevated feet at the grocery stove to look deeper into some subjects than most people do i ve breathed gasoline smoke talking to street crowds in nearly every town in the united states i ve held em spellbound with music oratory sleight of hand and prevarications while i ve sold em jewelry medicine soap hair tonic and junk of other nominations and during my travels as a matter of recreation and expiation i ve taken cognisance some of women it takes a man a lifetime to find out about one particular woman but if he puts in say ten years industrious and curious he can acquire the general rudiments of the sex one lesson i picked up was when i was working the west with a line of brazilian diamonds and a patent fire kindler just after my trip from savannah down through the cotton belt with dalby s anti explosive lamp oil powder twas when the oklahoma country was in first bloom guthrie was rising in the middle of it like a lump of self raising dough it was a boom town of the regular kind you stood in line to get a chance to wash your face if you ate over ten minutes you had a lodging bill added on if you slept on a plank at night they charged it to you as board the next morning by nature and doctrines i am addicted to the habit of discovering choice places wherein to feed so i looked around and found a proposition that exactly cut the mustard i found a restaurant tent just opened up by an outfit that had drifted in on the tail of the boom they had knocked together a box house where they lived and did the cooking and served the meals in a tent pitched against the side that tent was joyful with placards on it calculated to redeem the world worn pilgrim from the sinfulness of boarding houses and pick me up hotels try mother s home made biscuits what s the matter with our apple dumplings and hard sauce hot cakes and maple syrup like you ate when a boy our fried chicken never was heard to crow there was literature doomed to please the digestions of man i said to myself that mother s wandering boy should munch there that night and so it came to pass and there is where i contracted my case of mame dugan old man dugan was six feet by one of indiana loafer and he spent his time sitting on his shoulder blades in a rocking chair in the shanty memorialising the great corn crop failure of ma dugan did the cooking and mame waited on the table as soon as i saw mame i knew there was a mistake in the census reports there wasn t but one girl in the united states when you come to specifications it isn t easy she was about the size of an angel and she had eyes and ways about her when you come to the kind of a girl she was you ll find a belt of em reaching from the brooklyn bridge west as far as the courthouse in council bluffs ia they earn their own living in stores restaurants factories and offices they re chummy and honest and free and tender and sassy and they look life straight in the eye they ve met man face to face and discovered that he s a poor creature they ve dropped to it that the reports in the seaside library about his being a fairy prince lack confirmation mame was that sort she was full of life and fun and breezy she passed the repartee with the boarders quick as a wink you d have smothered laughing i am disinclined to make excavations into the insides of a personal affection i am glued to the theory that the diversions and discrepancies of the indisposition known as love should be as private a sentiment as a toothbrush tis my opinion that the biographies of the heart should be confined with the historical romances of the liver to the advertising pages of the magazines so you ll excuse the lack of an itemised bill of my feelings toward mame pretty soon i got a regular habit of dropping into the tent to eat at irregular times when there wasn t so many around mame would sail in with a smile in a black dress and white apron and say hello jeff why don t you come at mealtime want to see how much trouble you can be of course friedchickenbeefsteakporkchopshamandeggspotpie and so on she called me jeff but there was no significations attached designations was all she meant the front names of any of us she used as they came to hand i d eat about two meals before i left and string em out like a society spread where they changed plates and wives and josh one another festively between bites mame stood for it pleasant for it wasn t up to her to take any canvas off the tent by declining dollars just because they were whipped in after meal times it wasn t long until there was another fellow named ed collier got the between meals affliction and him and me put in bridges between breakfast and dinner and dinner and supper that made a three ringed circus of that tent and mame s turn as waiter a continuous performance that collier man was saturated with designs and contrivings he was in well boring or insurance or claim jumping or something i ve forgotten which he was a man well lubricated with gentility and his words were such as recommended you to his point of view

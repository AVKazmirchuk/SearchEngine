to mind anything else me and buck knew more about selling corn salve than we did about wall street but even we could see how the golconda gold bond investment company was making money you take in money and pay back ten per cent of it it s plain enough that you make a clean legitimate profit of per cent less expenses as long as the fish bite atterbury wanted to be president and treasurer too but buck winks an eye at him and says you was to furnish the brains do you call it good brain work when you propose to take in money at the door too think again i hereby nominate myself treasurer ad valorem sine die and by acclamation i chip in that much brain work free me and pickens we furnished the capital and we ll handle the unearned increment as it incremates it costs us for office rent and first payment on furniture more went for printing and advertising atterbury knew his business three months to a minute we ll last says he a day longer than that and we ll have to either go under or go under an alias by that time we ought to clean up and then a money belt and a lower berth for me and the yellow journals and the furniture men can pick the bones our ads done the work country weeklies and washington hand press dailies of course says i when we was ready to make contracts man says atterbury as its advertising manager you would cause a limburger cheese factory to remain undiscovered during a hot summer the game we re after is right here in new york and brooklyn and the harlem reading rooms they re the people that the street car fenders and the answers to correspondents columns and the pickpocket notices are made for we want our ads in the biggest city dailies top of column next to editorials on radium and pictures of the girl doing health exercises pretty soon the money begins to roll in buck didn t have to pretend to be busy his desk was piled high up with money orders and checks and greenbacks people began to drop in the office and buy stock every day most of the shares went in small amounts and and and a good many and lots and the bald and inviolate cranium of president atterbury shines with enthusiasm and demerit while colonel tecumseh pickens the rude but reputable croesus of the west consumes so many apples that the peelings hang to the floor from the mahogany garbage chest that he calls his desk just as atterbury said we ran along about three months without being troubled buck cashed the paper as fast as it came in and kept the money in a safe deposit vault a block or so away buck never thought much of banks for such purposes we paid the interest regular on the stock we d sold so there was nothing for anybody to squeal about we had nearly on hand and all three of us had been living as high as prize fighters out of training one morning as me and buck sauntered into the office fat and flippant from our noon grub we met an easy looking fellow with a bright eye and a pipe in his mouth coming out we found atterbury looking like he d been caught a mile from home in a wet shower know that man he asked us we said we didn t i don t either says atterbury wiping off his head but i ll bet enough gold bonds to paper a cell in the tombs that he s a newspaper reporter what did he want asks buck information says our president said he was thinking of buying some stock he asked me about nine hundred questions and every one of em hit some sore place in the business i know he s on a paper you can t fool me you see a man about half shabby with an eye like a gimlet smoking cut plug with dandruff on his coat collar and knowing more than j p morgan and shakespeare put together if that ain t a reporter i never saw one i was afraid of this i don t mind detectives and post office inspectors i talk to em eight minutes and then sell em stock but them reporters take the starch out of my collar boys i recommend that we declare a dividend and fade away the signs point that way me and buck talked to atterbury and got him to stop sweating and stand still that fellow didn t look like a reporter to us reporters always pull out a pencil and tablet on you and tell you a story you ve heard and strikes you for the drinks but atterbury was shaky and nervous all day the next day me and buck comes down from the hotel about ten thirty on the way we buys the papers and the first thing we see is a column on the front page about our little imposition it was a shame the way that reporter intimated that we were no blood relatives of the late george w childs he tells all about the scheme as he sees it in a rich racy kind of a guying style that might amuse most anybody except a stockholder yes atterbury was right it behooveth the gaily clad treasurer and the pearly pated president and the rugged vice president of the golconda gold bond and investment company to go away real sudden and quick that their days might be longer upon the land me and buck hurries down to the office we finds on the stairs and in the hall a crowd of people trying to squeeze into our office which is already jammed full inside to the railing they ve nearly all got golconda stock and gold bonds in their

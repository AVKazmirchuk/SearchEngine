called to the office boy lock the outer door archibald and admit no one then he moved with long silent strides into the room in which client number one waited that gentleman sat patiently scanning the pictures in the magazine with a cigar in his mouth and his feet upon a table well he remarked cheerfully as the lawyer entered have you made up your mind does five hundred dollars go for getting the fair lady a divorce you mean that as a retainer asked lawyer gooch softly interrogative hey no for the whole job it s enough ain t it my fee said lawyer gooch would be one thousand five hundred

that led into the hallway as the gentleman flowed out of the compartment and down the stairs lawyer gooch smiled to himself exit mr jessup he murmured as he fingered the henry clay tuft of hair at his ear and now for the forsaken husband he returned to the middle office and assumed a businesslike manner i understand he said to client number three that you agree to pay one thousand dollars if i bring about or am instrumental in bringing about the return of mrs billings to her home and her abandonment of her infatu ated pursuit of the man for whom she has conceived such a violent fancy also that the case is now unreservedly in my hands on that basis is that correct entirely said the other eagerly and i can produce the cash any time at two hours notice lawyer gooch stood up at his full height his thin figure seemed to expand his thumbs sought the arm holes of his vest upon his face was a look of sym pathetic benignity that he always wore during such undertakings then sir he said in kindly tones i think i can promise you an early relief from your troubles i have that much confidence in my powers of argument and persuasion in the natural impulses of the human heart toward good and in the strong influence of a husband s unfaltering love mrs billinos sir is here in that room the lawyer s long arm pointed to the door i will call her in at once and our united pleadings lawyer gooch paused for client number three had leaped from his chair as if propelled by steel springs and clutched his satchel what the devil he exclaimed harshly do vou mean that woman in there i thought i shook

ocean of prairie in the midst of which chicken with his futile rolling stock was as completely stranded as was robinson with his land locked boat a white post stood near the rails going up to it chicken read the letters at the top s a laredo was nearly as far to the south he was almost a hundred miles from any town coyotes began to yelp in the mysterious sea around him chicken felt lonesome he had lived in boston without an education in chicago without nerve in philadelphia without a sleeping place in new york without a pull and in pittsburg sober and yet he had never felt so lonely as now suddenly through the intense silence he heard the whicker of a horse the sound came from the side of the track toward the east and chicken began to explore timorously in that direction he stepped high along the mat of curly mesquit grass for he was afraid of everything there might be in this wilderness snakes rats brigands centipedes mirages cowboys fandangoes tarantulas tamales he had read of them in the story papers rounding a clump of prickly pear that reared high its fantastic and menacing array of rounded heads he was struck to shivering terror by a snort and a thunderous plunge as the horse himself startled bounded away some fifty yards and then resumed his grazing but here was the one thing in the desert that chicken did not fear he had been reared on a farm he had handled horses understood them and could ride approaching slowly and speaking soothingly he followed the animal which after its first flight seemed gentle enough and secured the end of the twenty foot lariat that dragged after him in the grass it required him but a few moments to contrive the rope into an ingenious nose bridle after the style of the mexican borsal in another he was upon the horse s back and off at a splendid lope giving the animal free choice of direction he will take me somewhere said chicken to himself it would have been a thing of joy that untrammelled gallop over the moonlit prairie even to chicken who loathed exertion but that his mood was not for it his head ached a growing thirst was upon him the somewhere whither his lucky mount might convey him was full of dismal peradventure and now he noted that the horse moved to a definite goal where the prairie lay smooth he kept his course straight as an arrow s toward the east deflected by hill or arroyo or impractical spinous brakes he quickly flowed again into the current charted by his unerring instinct at last upon the side of a gentle rise he suddenly subsided to a complacent walk a stone s cast away stood a little mott of coma trees beneath it a jacal such as the mexicans erect a one room house of upright poles daubed with clay and roofed with grass or tule reeds an experienced eye would have estimated the spot as the headquarters of a small sheep ranch in the moonlight the ground in the nearby corral showed pulverized to a level smoothness by the hoofs of the sheep everywhere was carelessly distributed the paraphernalia of the place ropes bridles saddles sheep pelts wool sacks feed troughs and camp litter the barrel of drinking water stood in the end of the two horse wagon near the door the harness was piled promiscuous upon the wagon tongue soaking up the dew chicken slipped to earth and tied the horse to a tree he halloed again and again but the house remained quiet the door stood open and he entered cautiously the light was sufficient for him to see that no one was at home the room was that of a bachelor ranchman who was content with the necessaries of life chicken rummaged intelligently until he found what he had hardly dared hope for a small brown jug that still contained something near a quart of his desire half an hour later chicken now a gamecock of hostile aspect emerged from the house with unsteady steps he had drawn upon the absent ranchman s equipment to replace his own ragged attire he wore a suit of coarse brown ducking the coat being a sort of rakish bolero jaunty to a degree boots he had donned and spurs that whirred with every lurching step buckled around him was a belt full of cartridges with a big six shooter in each of its two holsters prowling about he found blankets a saddle and bridle with which he caparisoned his steed again mounting he rode swiftly away singing a loud and tuneless song bud king s band of desperadoes outlaws and horse and cattle thieves were in camp at a secluded spot on the bank of the frio their depredations in the rio grande country while no bolder than usual had been advertised more extensively and captain kinney s company of rangers had been ordered down to look after them consequently bud king who was a wise general instead of cutting out a hot trail for the upholders of the law as his men wished to do retired for the time to the prickly fastnesses of the frio valley though the move was a prudent one and not incompatible with bud s well known courage it raised dissension among the members of the band in fact while they thus lay ingloriously perdu in the brush the question of bud king s fitness for the leadership was argued with closed doors as it were by his followers never before had bud s skill or efficiency been brought to criticism but his glory was wandering and such is glory s fate in the light of a newer star the sentiment of the band was crystallizing into the opinion that black eagle could lead them with more lustre profit and distinction this black eagle sub

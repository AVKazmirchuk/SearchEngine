removed they artfully sounded the employees of the late jeweller and dogged his customers for information concerning his habits like bloodhounds they traced every step of the supposed defaulter as nearly as might be for years along the limited and monotonous paths he had trodden at the end of their labours mr morin stood an immaculate man not one weakness that might be served up as a criminal tendency not one deviation from the path of rectitude not even a hint of a predilection for the opposite sex was found to be placed in his debit his life had been as regular and austere as a monk s his habits simple and unconcealed generous charitable and a model in propriety was the verdict of all who knew him what now asked robbins fingering his empty notebook cherchez la femme said dumars lighting a cigarette try lady bellairs this piece of femininity was the race track favourite of the season being feminine she was erratic in her gaits and there were a few heavy losers about town who had believed she could be true the reporters applied for information mr morin certainly not he was never even a spectator at the races not that kind of a man surprised the gentlemen should ask shall we throw it up suggested robbins and let the puzzle department have a try cherchez la femme hummed dumars reaching for a match try the little sisters of what d you call em it had developed during the investigation that mr morin had held this benevolent order in particular favour he had contributed liberally toward its support and had chosen its chapel as his favourite place of private worship it was said that he went there daily to make his devotions at the altar indeed toward the last of his life his whole mind seemed to have fixed itself upon religious matters perhaps to the detriment of his worldly affairs thither went robbins and dumars and were admitted through the narrow doorway in the blank stone wall that frowned upon bonhomme street an old woman was sweeping the chapel she told them that sister felicite the head of the order was then at prayer at the altar in the alcove in a few moments she would emerge heavy black curtains screened the alcove they waited soon the curtains were disturbed and sister felicite came forth she was tall tragic bony and plain featured dressed in the black gown and severe bonnet of the sisterhood robbins a good rough and tumble reporter but lacking the delicate touch began to speak they represented the press the lady had no doubt heard of the morin affair it was necessary in justice to that gentleman s memory to probe the mystery of the lost money it was known that he had come often to this chapel any information now concerning mr morin s habits tastes the friends he had and so on would be of value in doing him posthumous justice sister felicite had heard whatever she knew would be willingly told but it was very little monsieur morin had been a good friend to the order sometimes contributing as much as a hundred dollars the sisterhood was an independent one depending entirely upon private contributions for the means to carry on its charitable work mr morin had presented the chapel with silver candlesticks and an altar cloth he came every day to worship in the chapel sometimes remaining for an hour he was a devout catholic consecrated to holiness yes and also in the alcove was a statue of the virgin that he had himself modeled cast and presented to the order oh it was cruel to cast a doubt upon so good a man robbins was also profoundly grieved at the imputation but until it was found what mr morin had done with madame tibault s money he feared the tongue of slander would not be stilled sometimes in fact very often in affairs of the kind there was er as the saying goes er a lady in the case in absolute confidence now if perhaps sister felicite s large eyes regarded him solemnly there was one woman she said slowly to whom he bowed to whom he gave his heart robbins fumbled rapturously for his pencil

through a stained glass window within a deep niche in the bare stone wall stood an image of the virgin mary the colour of pure gold dumars a conventional catholic succumbed to the dramatic in the act he bowed his head for an instant and made the sign of the cross the somewhat abashed robbins murmuring an indistinct apology backed awkwardly away sister felicite drew back the curtain and the reporters departed on the narrow sidewalk of bonhomme street robbins turned to dumars with unworthy sarcasm well what next churchy law fem absinthe said dumars with the history of the missing money thus partially related some conjecture may be formed of the sudden idea that madame tibault s words seemed to have suggested to robbins s brain was it so wild a surmise that the religious fanatic had offered up his wealth or rather madame tibault s in the shape of a material symbol of his consuming devotion stranger things have been done in the name of worship was it not possible that the lost thousands were molded into that lustrous image that the goldsmith had formed it of the pure and precious metal and set it there through some hope of a perhaps disordered brain to propitiate the saints

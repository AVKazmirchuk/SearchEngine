office and my better impulses that your leading juven iles are supposed to awaken and the magazines that pay on publication i guess i ll always be broke i m sorry said tommy sympathetically but i can t help myself any more than you can it s one of the canons of household fiction that no burglar shall be suc cessful the burglar must be foiled by a kid like me or by a young lady heroine or at the last moment by his old pal red mike who recognizes the house as one in which he used to be the coachman you have got the worst end of it in any kind of a story well i suppose i must be clearing out now said the burglar taking up his lantern and bracebit you have to take the rest of this chicken and the bottle of wine with you for bessie and her mother said tommy calmly but confound it exclaimed

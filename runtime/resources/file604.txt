the assassin is only the matter of a few hours the detective force has not yet been called on for assistance jolnes and i went out and up the street toward the corner where we were to catch a surface car half way up the block we met rheingelder an acquaintance of ours who held a city hall position good morning rheingelder said jolnes halting nice breakfast that was you had this morning always on the lookout for the detective s remarkable feats of deduction i saw jolnes s eye flash for an instant upon a long yellow splash on the shirt bosom and a smaller one upon the chin of rheingelder both undoubtedly made by the yolk of an egg oh dot is some of your detectiveness said rheingelder shaking all over with a smile vell i pet you trinks und cigars all round dot you cannot tell vot i haf eaten for breakfast done said jolnes sausage pumpernickel and coffee rheingelder admitted the correctness of the surmise and paid the bet when we had proceeded on our way i said to jolnes i thought you looked at the egg spilled on his chin and shirt front i did said jolnes that is where i began my deduction rheingelder is a very economical saving man yesterday eggs dropped in the market to twenty eight cents per dozen to day they are quoted at forty two rheingelder ate eggs yesterday and to day he went back to his usual fare a little thing like this isn t anything whatsup it belongs to the primary arithmetic class when we boarded the street car we found the seats all occupied principally by ladies jolnes and i stood on the rear platform about the middle of the car there sat an elderly man with a short gray beard who looked to be the typical well dressed new yorker at successive corners other ladies climbed aboard and soon three or four of them were standing over the man clinging to straps and glaring meaningly at the man who occupied the coveted seat but he resolutely retained his place we new yorkers i remarked to jolnes have about lost our manners as far as the exercise of them in public goes perhaps so said jolnes lightly but the man you evidently refer to happens to be a very chivalrous and courteous gentleman from old virginia he is spending a few days in new york with his wife and two daughters and he leaves for the south to night you know him then i said in amazement i never saw him before we stepped on the car declared the detective smilingly by the gold tooth of the witch of endor i cried if you can construe all that from his appearance you are dealing in nothing else than black art the habit of observation nothing more said jolnes if the old gentleman gets off the car before we do i think i can demonstrate to you the accuracy of my deduction three blocks farther along the gentleman rose to leave the car jolnes addressed him at the door pardon me sir but are you not colonel hunter of norfolk virginia no suh was the extremely courteous answer my name suh is ellison major winfield r ellison from fairfax county in the same state i know a good many people suh in norfolk the goodriches the tollivers and the crabtrees suh but i never had the pleasure of meeting yo friend colonel hunter i am happy to say suh that i am going back to virginia to night after having spent a week in yo city with my wife and three daughters i shall be in norfolk in about ten days and if you will give me yo name suh i will take pleasure in looking up colonel hunter and telling him that you inquired after him suh thank you said jolnes tell him that reynolds sent his regards if you will be so kind i glanced at the great new york detective and saw that a look of intense chagrin had come upon his clear cut features failure in the slightest point always galled shamrock jolnes did you say your three daughters he asked of the virginia gentleman yes suh my three daughters all as fine girls as there are in fairfax county was the answer with that major ellison stopped the car and began to descend the step shamrock jolnes clutched his arm one moment sir he begged in an urbane voice in which i alone detected the anxiety am i not right in believing that one of the young ladies is an adopted daughter you are suh admitted the major from the ground but how the devil you knew it suh is mo than i can tell and mo than i can tell too i said as the car went on jolnes was restored to his calm observant serenity by having wrested victory from his apparent failure so after we got off the car he invited me into a cafe promising to reveal the process of his latest wonderful feat in the first place he began after we were comfortably seated i knew the gentleman was no new yorker because he was flushed and uneasy and restless on account of the ladies that were standing although he did not rise and give them his seat i decided from his appearance that he was a southerner rather than a westerner next i began to figure out his reason for not relinquishing his seat to a lady when he evidently felt strongly but not overpoweringly impelled to do so i very quickly decided upon that i noticed that one of his eyes had received a severe jab in one corner which was red and inflamed and that all over his face were tiny round marks about the size of the end of an uncut lead pencil also upon both of his patent leather shoes were a

it a success ask the public that s all what miss carroll says is true in part said the author for five months the comedietta was a drawing card in the best houses but during the last two weeks it has lost favour there is one scene in it in which miss carroll made a big hit now she hardly gets a hand out of it she spoils it by acting it entirely different from her old way it is not my fault reiterated the actress there are only two of you on in the scene argued the playwright hotly you and delmars here then it s his fault declared miss carroll with a lightning glance of scorn from her dark eyes the comedian caught it and gazed with increased melancholy at the panels of the sergeant s desk the night was a dull one in that particular police station the sergeant s long blunted curiosity awoke a little i ve heard you he said to the author and then he addressed the thin faced and ascetic looking lady of the company who played aunt turnip top in the little comedy who do you think spoils the scene you are fussing about he asked i m no knocker said that lady and everybody knows it so when i say that clarice falls down every time in that scene i m judging her art and not herself she was great in it once she does it something fierce now it ll dope the show if she keeps it up the sergeant looked at the comedian you and the lady have this scene together i under stand i suppose there s no use asking you which one of you queers it the comedian avoided the direct rays from the two fixed stars of miss carroll s eyes i don t know he said looking down at his patent leather toes are you one of the actors asked the sergeant of a dwarfish youth with a middle aged face why say replied the last thespian witness you don t notice any tin spear in my hands do you you haven t heard me shout see the emperor comes since i ve been in here have you i guess i m on the stage long enough for em not to start a panic by mistaking me for a thin curl of smoke rising above the footlights in your opinion if you ve got one said the sergeant is the frost that gathers on the scene in question the work of the lady or the gentleman who takes part in it the middle aged youth looked pained i regret to say he answered that miss carroll seems to have lost her grip on that scene she s all right in the rest of the play but but i tell you sergeant she can do it she has done it equal to any of em and she can do it again miss carroll ran forward glowing and palpitating thank you jimmy for the first good word i ve had in many a day she cried and then she turned her eager face toward the desk i ll show you sergeant whether i am to blame i ll show them whether i can do that same come mr delmars let us begin you will let us won t you sergeant how long will it take asked the sergeant dubiously eight minutes said the playwright the entire play consumes but thirty you may go ahead said the sergeant most of you seem to side against the little lady maybe she had a right to crack up a saucer or two in that restaurant we ll see how she does the turn before we take that up the matron of the police station had been standing near listening to the singular argument she came nigher and stood near the sergeant s chair two or three of the reserves strolled in big and yawning before beginning the scene said the playwright and assuming that you have not seen a production of a gay coquette i will make a brief but necessary explanation it is a musical farce comedy burlesque comedietta as the title implies miss carroll s r le is that of a gay rollicking mischievous heartless coquette she sustains that character throughout the entire comedy part of the production and i have designed the extravaganza features so that she may preserve and present the same coquettish idea now the scene in which we take exception to miss carroll s acting is called the gorilla dance she is costumed to represent a wood nymph and there is a great song and dance scene with a gorilla played by mr delmars the comedian a tropical forest stage is set that used to get four and five recalls the main thing was the acting and the dance it was the funniest thing in new york for five months delmars s song i ll woo thee to my sylvan home while he and miss carroll were cutting hide and seek capers among the tropical plants was a winner what s the trouble with the scene now asked the sergeant miss carroll spoils it right in the middle of it said the playwright wrathfully with a wide gesture of her ever moving arms the actress waved back the little group of spectators leaving a space in front of the desk for the scene of her vindication or fall then she whipped off her long tan cloak and tossed it across the arm of the policeman who still stood officially among them miss carroll had gone to supper well cloaked but in the costume of the tropic wood nymph a skirt of fern leaves touched her knee she was like a humming bird green and golden and purple and then she danced a fluttering

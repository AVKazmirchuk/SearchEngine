by the ear with a lemon squeezer led him to the door and kicked him into the street thus the mind of chicken was brought to realize the signs of coming winter the night was cold the stars shone with unkindly brilliancy people were hurrying along the streets in two egotistic jostling streams men had donned their overcoats and chicken knew to an exact percentage the increased difficulty of coaxing dimes from those buttoned in vest pockets the time had come for his annual exodus to the south a little boy five or six years old stood looking with covetous eyes in a confectioner s window in one small hand he held an empty two ounce vial in the other he grasped tightly something flat and round with a shining milled edge the scene presented a field of operations commensurate to chicken s talents and daring after sweeping the horizon to make sure that no official tug was cruising near he insidiously accosted his prey the boy having been early taught by his household to regard altruistic advances with extreme suspicion received the overtures coldly then chicken knew that he must make one of those desperate nerve shattering plunges into speculation that fortune sometimes requires of those who would win her favour five cents was his capital and this he must risk against the chance of winning what lay within the close grasp of the youngster s chubby hand it was a fearful lottery chicken knew but he must accomplish his end by strategy since he had a wholesome terror of plundering infants by force once in a park driven by hunger he had committed an onslaught upon a bottle of peptonized infant s food in the possession of an occupant of a baby carriage the outraged infant had so promptly opened its mouth and pressed the button that communicated with the welkin that help arrived and chicken did his thirty days in a snug coop wherefore he was as he said leary of kids beginning artfully to question the boy concerning his choice of sweets he gradually drew out the information he wanted mamma said he was to ask the drug store man for ten cents worth of paregoric in the bottle he was to keep his hand shut tight over the dollar he must not stop to talk to anyone in the street he must ask the drug store man to wrap up the change and put it in the pocket of his trousers indeed they had pockets two of them and he liked chocolate creams best chicken went into the store and turned plunger he invested his entire capital in c a n d y stocks simply to pave the way to the greater risk following he gave the sweets to the youngster and had the satisfaction of perceiving that confidence was established after that it was easy to obtain leadership of the expedition to take the investment by the hand and lead it to a nice drug store he knew of in the same block there chicken with a parental air passed over the dollar and called for the medicine while the boy crunched his candy glad to be relieved of the responsibility of the purchase and then the successful investor searching his pockets found an overcoat button the extent of his winter trousseau and wrapping it carefully placed the ostensible change in the pocket of confiding juvenility setting the youngster s face homeward and patting him benevolently on the back for chicken s heart was as soft as those of his feathered namesakes the speculator quit the market with a profit of per cent on his invested capital two hours later an iron mountain freight engine pulled out of the railroad yards texas bound with a string of empties in one of the cattle cars half buried in excelsior chicken lay at ease beside him in his nest was a quart bottle of very poor whisky and a paper bag of bread and cheese mr ruggles in his private car was on his trip south for the winter season for a week that car was trundled southward shifted laid over and manipulated after the manner of rolling stock but chicken stuck to it leaving it only at necessary times to satisfy his hunger and thirst he knew it must go down to the cattle country and san antonio in the heart of it was his goal there the air was salubrious and mild the people indulgent and long suffering the bartenders there would not kick him if he should eat too long or too often at one place they would swear at him as if by rote and without heat they swore so drawlingly and they rarely paused short of their full vocabulary which was copious so that chicken had often gulped a good meal during the process of the vituperative prohibition the season there was always spring like the plazas were pleasant at night with music and gaiety except during the slight and infrequent cold snaps one could sleep comfortably out of doors in case the interiors should develop inhospitability at texarkana his car was switched to the i and g n then still southward it trailed until at length it crawled across the colorado bridge at austin and lined out straight as an arrow for the run to san antonio when the freight halted at that town chicken was fast asleep in ten minutes the train was off again for laredo the end of the road those empty cattle cars were for distribution along the line at points from which the ranches shipped their stock when chicken awoke his car was stationary looking out between the slats he saw it was a bright moonlit night scrambling out he saw his car with three others abandoned on a little siding in a wild and lonesome country a cattle pen and chute stood on one side of the track the railroad bisected a vast dim

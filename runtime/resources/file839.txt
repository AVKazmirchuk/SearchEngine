in the buckboard seated by teddy in a feather weight buckboard behind a pair of wild cream coloured spanish ponies octavia abandoned all thought for the exhilaration of the present they swept out of the little town and down the level road toward the south soon the road dwindled and dis appeared and they struck across a world carpeted with an endless reach of curly mesquite grass the wheels made no sound the tireless ponies bounded ahead at an unbroken gallop the temperate wind made fragrant by thousands of acres of blue and yellow wild flowers roared gloriously in their ears the motion was a rial ecstatic with a thrilling sense of perpetuity in its effect octavia sat silent possessed by a feeling of elemental sensual bliss teddy seemed to be wrestling with some internal problem i m going to call you madama he announced as the result of his labours that is what the mexicans will call you they re nearly all mexicans on the ranch you know that seems to me about the proper thing very well mr westlake said octavia primly oh now said teddy in some consternation that s carrying the thing too far isn t it don t worry me with your beastly etiquette i m just beginning to live don t remind me of anything artificial if only this air could be bottled this much alone is worth coming for oh look i there goes a deer jack rabbit said teddy without turning his head could i might i drive suggested octavia pant ing with rose tinted cheeks and the eye of an eager child on one condition could i might i smoke forever cried octavia taking the lines with solemn joy how shall i know which way to drive keep her sou by sou east and all sail set you see that black speck on the horizon under that lowermost gulf cloud that s a group of live oaks and a land mark steer halfway between that and the little hill to the left i ll recite you the whole code of driving rules for the texas prairies keep the reins from under the horses feet and swear at em frequent i m too happy to swear ted oh why do people buy yachts or travel in palace cars when a buckboard and a pair of plugs and a spring morning like this can satisfy all desire now i ll ask you protested teddy who was futilely striking match after match on the dashboard not to call those denizens of the air plugs they can kick out a hundred miles between daylight and dark at last he succeeded in snatching a light for his cigar from the flame held in the hollow of his hands room said octavia intensely that s what produces the effect i know now what i ve wanted scope range room smoking room said teddy unsentimentally i love to smoke in a buckboard the wind blows the smoke into you and out again it saves exertion the two fell so naturally into their old time goodfellow ship that it was only by degrees that a sense of the strange ness of the new relations between them came to be felt madama said teddy wonderingly however did you get it into your bead to cut the crowd and come down here is it a fad now among the upper classes to trot off to sheep ranches instead of to newport i was broke teddy said octavia sweetly with her interest centred upon steering safely between a spanish dagger plant and a clump of chaparral i haven t a thing in the world but this ranch not even any other home to go to come now said teddy anxiously but ineredu lously you don t mean it when my husband said octavia with a shy slurring of the word died three months ago i thought i had a reasonable amount of the world s goods his lawyer exploded that theory in a sixty minute fully illustrated lecture i took to the sheep as a last resort do you happen to know of any fashionable caprice among the gilded youth of manhattan that induces them to abandon polo and club windows to become managers of sheep ranches it s easily explained in my case responded teddy promptly i had to go to work i couldn t have earned my board in new york so i chummed a while with old sandford one of the syndicate that owned the ranch before colonel beaupree bought it and got a place down here i wasn t manager at first i jogged around on ponies and studied the business in detail until i got all the points in my head i saw where it was losing and what the reme dies were and then sandford put me in charge i get a hundred dollars a month and i earn it poor teddy said octavia with a smile you needn t i like it i save half my wages and i m as hard as a water plug it beats polo will it furnish bread and tea and jam for another out cast from civilization the spring shearing said the manager just cleaned up a deficit in last year s business wastefulness and inattention have been the rule heretofore the autumn clip will leave a small profit over all expenses next year there will be jam when about four o clock in the afternoon the ponies rounded a gentle brush covered hill and then swooped like a double cream coloured cyclone upon the rancho de las sombras octavia gave a little cry of delight a lordly grove of magnificent live oaks cast an area of

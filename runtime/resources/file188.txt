mcguire s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds a detective saw you on the rubberneck up at central park and phoned down to take you in do your explaining at the station house james williams s wife his bride of two weeks looked him in the face with a strange soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks looked him in the face and said go with em quietly pinky and maybe it ll be in your favour and then as the glaring at gotham car rolled away she turned and threw a kiss his wife threw a kiss at some one high up on the seats of the rubberneck your girl gives you good advice mcguire said donovan come on now and then madness descended upon and occupied james williams he pushed his hat far upon the back of his head my wife seems to think i am a burglar he said recklessly i never heard of her being crazy therefore i must be and if i m crazy they can t do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops had to be whistled for and afterwards the reserves to disperse a few thousand delighted spectators at the station house the desk sergeant asked for his name mcdoodle the pink or pinky the brute i forget which was james williams s answer but you can bet i m a burglar don t leave that out and you might add that it took five of em to pluck the pink i d especially like to have that in the records in an hour came mrs james williams with uncle thomas of madison avenue in a respect compelling motor car and proofs of the hero s innocence for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an automobile mfg co after the police had sternly reprimanded james williams for imitating a copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the department was capable of mrs williams rearrested him and swept him into an angle of the station house james williams regarded her with one eye he always said that donovan closed the other while somebody was holding his good right hand never before had he given her a word of reproach or of reproof if you can explain he began rather stiffly why you dear she interrupted listen it was an hour s pain and trial to you i did it for her i mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach i was so happy jim so happy with you that i didn t dare to refuse that happiness to another jim they were married only this morning those two and i wanted him to get away while they were struggling with you i saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park that s all of it dear i had to do it thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one by rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings but bride knoweth bride at the glance of an eye and between them swiftly passes comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of the romance of a busy broker pitcher confidential clerk in the office of harvey maxwell broker allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half past nine in company with his young lady stenographer with a snappy good morning pitcher maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were intending to leap over it and then plunged into the great heap of letters and telegrams waiting there for him the young lady had been maxwell s stenographer for a year she was beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic she forewent the pomp of the alluring pompadour she wore no chains bracelets or lockets she had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to luncheon her dress was grey and plain but it fitted her figure with fidelity and discretion in her neat black turban hat was the gold green wing of a macaw on this morning she was softly and shyly radiant her eyes were dreamily bright her cheeks genuine peachblow her expression a happy one tinged with reminiscence pitcher still mildly curious noticed a difference in her ways this morning instead of going straight into the adjoining room where her desk was she lingered slightly irresolute in the outer office once she moved over by maxwell s desk near enough for him to be aware of her presence the machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man it was a busy new york broker moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs well what is it anything asked maxwell sharply his opened mail lay like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk his keen grey eye impersonal and brusque flashed upon her half impatiently nothing answered the stenographer moving away with a little smile mr pitcher she said to the confidential clerk did mr maxwell say anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer he did answered pitcher he told me to get another one i notified the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning it s o clock and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple chewing gum has showed up yet i will do the work as usual then said the young lady until some one comes to fill the place and she went to her desk at once and hung the black turban hat with the gold green macaw wing in its accustomed place he who has been denied the spectacle of a busy manhattan broker during a rush of business

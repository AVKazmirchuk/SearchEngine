six seconds there were twenty or so bullets due to be whizzing in the direction of mr mcroy i ll shoot better next time yelled johnny and there ll be a next time he backed rapidly out the door carson the sheepman spurred on to attempt further exploits by the success of his plate throwing was first to reach the door mcroy s bullet from the darkness laid him low the cattlemen then swept out upon him calling for vengeance for while the slaughter of a sheepman has not always lacked condonement it was a decided mis demeanour in this instance carson was innocent he was no accomplice at the matrimonial proceedings nor had any one heard him quote the line christmas comes but once a year to the guests but the sortie failed in its vengeance mcroy was on his horse and away shouting back curses and threats as he galloped into the concealing chaparral that night was the birthnight of the frio kid he became the bad man of that portion of the state the rejection of his suit by miss mcmullen turned him to a dangerous man when officers went after him for the shooting of carson he killed two of them and entered upon the life of an outlaw he became a marvellous shot with either hand he would turn up in towns and settlements raise a quarrel at the slightest opportunity pick off his man and laugh at the officers of the law he was so cool so deadly so rapid so inhumanly blood thirsty that none but faint attempts were ever made to capture him when he was at last shot and killed by a little one armed mexican who was nearly dead himself from fright the frio kid had the deaths of eighteen men on his head about half of these were killed in fair duels depending upon the quickness of the draw the other half were men whom be assassinated from absolute wantonness and cruelty many tales are told along the border of his impudent courage and daring but he was not one of the breed of desperadoes who have seasons of generosity and even of softness they say he never had mercy on the object of his anger yet at this and every christmastide it is well to give each one credit if it can be done for what ever speck of good he may have possessed if the frio kid ever did a kindly act or felt a throb of generosity in his heart it was once at such a time and season and this is the way it happened one who has been crossed in love should never breathe the odour from the blossoms of the ratama tree it stirs the memory to a dangerous degree one december in the frio country there was a ratama tree in full bloom for the winter had been as warm as springtime that way rode the frio kid and his satellite aw co murderer mexican frank the kid reined in his mustang and sat in his saddle thoughtful and grim with dangerously narrowing eyes the rich sweet scent touched him somewhere beneath his ice and iron i don t know what i ve been thinking about mex he remarked in his usual mild drawl to have forgot all about a christmas present i got to give i m going to ride over to morrow night and shoot madison lane in his own house he got my girl rosita would have had me if he hadn t cut into the game i wonder why i happened to overlook it up to now ah shucks kid said mexican don t talk foolish ness you know you can t get within a mile of mad lane s house to morrow night i see old man allen day before yesterday and he says mad is going to have christmas doings at his house you remember how you shot up the festivities when mad was married and about the threats you made don t you suppose mad lane ll kind of keep his eye open for a certain mr kid you plumb make me tired kid with such remarks i m going repeated the frio kid without heat to go to madison lane s christmas doings and kill him i ought to have done it a long time ago why mex just two weeks ago i dreamed me and rosita was married instead of her and him and we was living in a house and i could see her smiling at me and oh h l mex he got her and i ll get him yes sir on christmas eve he got her and then s when i ll get him there s other ways of committing suicide advised mexican why don t you go and surrender to the sheriff i ll get him said the kid christmas eve fell as balmy as april perhaps there was a hint of far away frostiness in the air but it tingles like seltzer perfumed faintly with late prairie blossoms and the mesquite grass when night came the five or six rooms of the ranch house were brightly lit in one room was a christmas tree for the lanes had a boy of three and a dozen or more guests were expected from the nearer ranches at nightfall madison lane called aside jim belcher and three other cowboys employed on his ranch now boys said lane keep your eyes open walk around the house and watch the road well all of you know the frio kid as they call him now and if you see him open fire on him without asking any questions i m not afraid of his coming around but rosita is she s been afraid he d come in on us every christmas since we were married the guests had arrived in buckboards and on horseback and were making themselves comfortable inside the evening went along

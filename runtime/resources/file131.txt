pose as a distinguished american portrait painter who was touring in the tropics as a relaxation from his arduous and remunerative professional labors it was not an unreasonable hope even to those who trod in the beaten paths of business that an artist with so much prestige might secure a commission to perpetuate upon canvas the lineaments of the president and secure a share of the pesos that were raining upon the caterers to his weaknesses keogh had set his price at ten thousand dollars artists had been paid more for portraits he and white were to share the expenses of the trip and divide the possible profits thus he laid the scheme before white whom he had known in the west before one declared for art and the other became a bedouin before long the two machinators abandoned the rigor of the bare studio for a snug corner of a cafe there they sat far into the night with old envelopes and keogh s stub of blue pencil between them at twelve o clock white doubled up in his chair with his chin on his fist and shut his eyes at the unbeautiful wall paper i ll go you billy he said in the quiet tones of decision i ve got two or three hundred saved up for sausages and rent and i ll take the chance with you five thousand it will give me two years in paris and one in italy i ll begin to pack tomorrow you ll begin in ten minutes said keogh it s to morrow now the karlsefin starts back at four p m come on to your painting shop and i ll help you for five months in the year coralio is the newport of anchuria then only does the town possess life from november to march it is practically the seat of government the president with his official family sojourns there and society follows him the pleasure loving people make the season one long holiday of amusement and rejoicing fiestas balls games sea bathing processions and small theatres contribute to their enjoyment the famous swiss band from the capital plays in the little plaza every evening while the fourteen carriages and vehicles in the town circle in funereal but complacent procession indians from the interior mountains looking like pre historic stone idols come down to peddle their handiwork in the streets the people throng the narrow ways a chattering happy careless stream of buoyant humanity preposterous children rigged out with the shortest of ballet skirts and gilt wings howl underfoot among the effervescent crowds especially is the arrival of the presidential party at the opening of the season attended with pomp show and patriotic demonstrations of enthusiasm and delight when keogh and white reached their destination on the return trip of the karlsefin the gay winter season was well begun as they stepped upon the beach they could hear the band playing in the plaza the village maidens with fireflies already fixed in their dark locks were gliding barefoot and coy eyed along the paths dandies in white linen swinging their canes were beginning their seductive strolls the air was full of human essence of artificial enticement of coquetry indolence pleasure the man made sense of existence the first two or three days after their arrival were spent in preliminaries keogh escorted the artist about town introducing him to the little circle of english speaking residents and pulling whatever wires he could to effect the spreading of white s fame as a painter and then keogh planned a more spectacular demonstration of the idea he wished to keep before the public he and white engaged rooms in the hotel de los extranjeros the two were clad in new suits of immaculate duck with american straw hats and carried canes of remarkable uniqueness and inutility few caballeros in coralio even the gorgeously uniformed officers of the anchurian army were as conspicuous for ease and elegance of demeanor as keogh and his friend the great american painter senor white white set up his easel on the beach and made striking sketches of the mountain and sea views the native population formed at his rear in a vast chattering semicircle to watch his work keogh with his care for details had arranged for himself a pose which he carried out with fidelity his ro e was that of friend to the great artist a man of affairs and leisure the visible emblem of his position was a pocket camera for branding the man who owns it said he a genteel dilettante with a bank account and an easy conscience a steam yacht ain t in it with a camera you see a man doing nothing but loafing around making snap shots and you know right away he reads up well in bradstreet you notice these old millionaire boys soon as they get through taking everything else in sight they go to taking photographs people are more impressed by a kodak than they are by a title or a four karat scarf pin so keogh strolled blandly about coralio snapping the scenery and the shrinking senoritas while white posed conspicuously in the higher regions of art two weeks after their arrival the scheme began to bear fruit an aide de camp of the president drove to the hotel in a dashing victoria the president desired that senor white come to the casa morena for an informal interview keogh gripped his pipe tightly between his teeth not a cent less than ten thousand he said to the artist remember the price and in gold or its equivalent don t let him stick you with this bargain counter stuff they call money here perhaps it isn t that he wants said white get out said keogh with splendid confidence i know what he wants he wants his picture painted by the celebrated young american painter and filibuster now sojourning in his down trodden country off you go

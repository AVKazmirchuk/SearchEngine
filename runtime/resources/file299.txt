of it best seller i one day last summer i went to pittsburgh well i had to go there on business my chair car was profitably well filled with people of the kind one usually sees on chair cars most of them were ladies in brown silk dresses cut with square yokes with lace insertion and dotted veils who refused to have the windows raised then there was the usual number of men who looked as if they might be in almost any business and going almost anywhere some students of human nature can look at a man in a pullman and tell you where he is from his occupation and his stations in life both flag and social but i never could the only way i can correctly judge a fellow traveller is when the train is held up by robbers or when he reaches at the same time i do for the last towel in the dressing room of the sleeper the porter came and brushed the collection of soot on the window sill off to the left knee of my trousers i removed it with an air of apology the temperature was eighty eight one of the dotted veiled ladies demanded the closing of two more ventilators and spoke loudly of interlaken i leaned back idly in chair no and looked with the tepidest curiosity at the small black bald spotted head just visible above the back of no suddenly no hurled a book to the floor between his chair and the window and looking i saw that it was the rose lady and trevelyan one of the best selling novels of the present day and then the critic or philistine whichever he was veered his chair toward the window and i knew him at once for john a pescud of pittsburgh travelling salesman for a plate glass company an old acquaintance whom i had not seen in two years in two minutes we were faced had shaken hands and had finished with such topics as rain prosperity health residence and destination politics might have followed next but i was not so ill fated i wish you might know john a pescud he is of the stuff that heroes are not often lucky enough to be made of he is a small man with a wide smile and an eye that seems to be fixed upon that little red spot on the end of your nose i never saw him wear but one kind of necktie and he believes in cuff holders and button shoes he is as hard and true as anything ever turned out by the cambria steel works and he believes that as soon as pittsburgh makes smoke consumers compulsory st peter will come down and sit at the foot of smithfield street and let somebody else attend to the gate up in the branch heaven he believes that our plate glass is the most important commodity in the world and that when a man is in his home town he ought to be decent and law abiding during my acquaintance with him in the city of diurnal night i had never known his views on life romance literature and ethics we had browsed during our meetings on local topics and then parted after chateau margaux irish stew flannel cakes cottage pudding and coffee hey there with milk separate now i was to get more of his ideas by way of facts he told me that business had picked up since the party conventions and that he was going to get off at coketown ii say said pescud stirring his discarded book with the toe of his right shoe did you ever read one of these best sellers i mean the kind where the hero is an american swell sometimes even from chicago who falls in love with a royal princess from europe who is travelling under an alias and follows her to her father s kingdom or principality i guess you have they re all alike sometimes this going away masher is a washington newspaper correspondent and sometimes he is a van something from new york or a chicago wheat broker worthy fifty millions but he s always ready to break into the king row of any foreign country that sends over their queens and princesses to try the new plush seats on the big four or the b and there doesn t seem to be any other reason in the book for their being here well this fellow chases the royal chair warmer home as i said and finds out who she is he meets here on the corso or the strasse one evening and gives us ten pages of conversation she reminds him of the difference in their stations and that gives him a chance to ring in three solid pages about america s uncrowned sovereigns if you d take his remarks and set em to music and then take the music away from em they d sound exactly like one of george cohan s songs well you know how it runs on if you ve read any of em he slaps the king s swiss body guards around like everything whenever they get in his way he s a great fencer too now i ve known of some chicago men who were pretty notorious fences but i never heard of any fencers coming from there he stands on the first landing of the royal staircase in castle schutzenfestenstein with a gleaming rapier in his hand and makes a baltimore broil of six platoons of traitors who come to massacre the said king and then he has to fight duels with a couple of chancellors and foil a plot by four austrian archdukes to seize the kingdom for a gasoline station but the great scene is when his rival for the princess hand count feodor attacks him between the portcullis and the ruined chapel armed with a mitrailleuse a yataghan and

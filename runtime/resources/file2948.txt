chair think of the sleep i m losing but it s tough on both of us old man i wish you could get out of the story and really rob somebody maybe you ll have the chance if they dramatize us never said the burglar gloomily between the box office and my better impulses that your leading juven iles are supposed to awaken and the magazines that pay on publication i guess i ll always be broke i m sorry said tommy sympathetically but i can t help myself any more than you can it s one of the canons of household fiction that no burglar shall be suc cessful the burglar must be foiled by a kid like me or by a young lady heroine or at the last moment by his old pal red mike who recognizes the house as one in which he used to be the coachman you have got the worst end of it in any kind of a story well i suppose i must be clearing out now said the burglar taking up his lantern and bracebit you have to take the rest of this chicken and the bottle of wine with you for bessie and her mother said tommy calmly but confound it exclaimed the burglar in an annoyed tone they don t want it i ve got five cases of chateau de beychsvelle at home that was bottled in that claret of yours is corked and you couldn t get either of them to look at a chicken unless it was stewed in champagne you know after i get out of the story i don t have so many limitations i make a turn now and then yes but you must take them said tommy loading his arms with the bundles bless you young master recited the burglar obedient second story saul will never forget you and now hurry and let me out kid our words must be nearly up tommy led the way through the hall toward the front door suddenly the burglar stopped and called to him softly ain t there a cop out there in front somewhere sparking the girl yes said tommy but what i m afraid he ll catch me said the burglar you mustn t forget that this is fiction great head said tommy turning come out by the back door a chaparral christmas gift the original cause of the trouble was about twenty years in growing at the end of that time it was worth it had you lived anywhere within fifty miles of sun down ranch you would have heard of it it possessed a quantity of jet black hair a pair of extremely frank deep brown eyes and a laugh that rippled across the prairie like the sound of a hidden brook the name of it was rosita mcmullen and she was the daughter of old man mcmullen of the sundown sheep ranch there came riding on red roan steeds or to be more explicit on a paint and a flea bitten sorrel two wooers one was madison lane and the other was the frio kid but at that time they did not call him the frio kid for he had not earned the honours of special nomenclature his name was simply johnny mcroy it must not be supposed that these two were the sum of the agreeable rosita s admirers the bronchos of a dozen others champed their bits at the long hitching rack of the sundown ranch many were the sheeps eves that were cast in those savannas that did not belong to the flocks of dan mcmullen but of all the cavaliers madison lane and johnny meroy galloped far ahead wherefore they are to be chronicled madison lane a young cattleman from the nueces country won the race he and rosita were married one christmas day armed hilarious vociferous mag nanimous the cowmen and the sheepmen laying aside their hereditary hatred joined forces to celebrate the occasion sundown ranch was sonorous with the cracking of jokes and sixshooters the shine of buckles and bright eyes the outspoken congratulations of the herders of kine but while the wedding feast was at its liveliest there descended upon it johnny meroy bitten by jealousy like one possessed i ll give you a christmas present he yelled shrilly at the door with his in his hand even then he had some reputation as an offhand shot his first bullet cut a neat underbit in madison lane s right ear the barrel of his gun moved an inch the next shot would have been the bride s had not carson a sheepman possessed a mind with triggers somewhat well oiled and in repair the guns of the wedding party had been hung in their belts upon nails in the wall when they sat at table as a concession to good taste but carson with great promptness hurled his plate of roast venison and frijoles at mcroy spoiling his aim the second bullet then only shattered the white petals of a spanish dagger flower suspended two feet above rosita s head the guests spurned their chairs and jumped for their weapons it was considered an improper act to shoot the bride and groom at a wedding in about six seconds there were twenty or so bullets due to be whizzing in the direction of mr mcroy i ll shoot better next time yelled johnny and there ll be a next time he backed rapidly out the door carson the sheepman spurred on to attempt further exploits by the success of his plate throwing was first to reach the door mcroy s bullet from the darkness laid him low the cattlemen then swept out upon him calling for vengeance for while the slaughter of a sheepman has not always lacked condonement it was a decided mis demeanour in this instance carson was innocent he was no accomplice at the matrimonial proceedings nor had any one heard him quote the line christmas comes but once a year to the guests but the sortie failed in its vengeance mcroy was on his horse and away shouting back curses and threats as he galloped into the concealing chaparral that night was the birthnight of the frio kid he became the bad man of that portion of the state the rejection of his suit by miss mcmullen turned him to a dangerous man when officers went after him for the shooting of carson he killed two of them and entered upon the life of an outlaw he became a marvellous shot with either hand he would turn up in towns and settlements raise a quarrel at the slightest opportunity pick off his man and laugh at the officers of the law he was so cool so deadly so rapid so inhumanly blood thirsty that none but faint attempts were ever made to capture him when he was at last shot and killed by a little one armed mexican who was nearly dead himself from fright the frio kid had the deaths of eighteen men on his head about half of these were killed in fair duels depending upon the quickness of the draw the other half were men whom be assassinated from absolute wantonness and cruelty many tales are told along the border of his impudent courage and daring but he was not one of the breed of desperadoes who have seasons of generosity and even of softness they say he never had mercy on the object of his anger yet at this and every christmastide it is well to give each one credit if it can be done for what ever speck of good he may have possessed if the frio kid ever did a kindly act or felt a throb of generosity in his heart it was once at such a time and season and this is the way it happened one who has been crossed in love should never breathe the odour from the blossoms of the ratama tree it stirs the memory to a dangerous degree one december in the frio country there was a ratama tree in full bloom for the winter had been as warm as springtime that way rode the frio kid and his satellite aw co murderer mexican frank the kid reined in his mustang and sat in his saddle thoughtful and grim with dangerously narrowing eyes the rich sweet scent touched him somewhere beneath his ice and iron i don t know what i ve been thinking about mex he remarked in his usual mild drawl to have forgot all about a christmas present i got to give i m going to ride over to morrow night and shoot madison lane in his own house he got my girl rosita would have had me if he hadn t cut into the game i wonder why i happened to overlook it up to now ah shucks kid said mexican don t talk foolish ness you know you can t get within a mile of mad lane s house to morrow night i see old man allen day before yesterday and he says mad is going to have christmas doings at his house you remember how you shot up the festivities when mad was married and about the threats you made don t you suppose mad lane ll kind of keep his eye open for a certain mr kid you plumb make me tired kid with such remarks i m going repeated the frio kid without heat to go to madison lane s christmas doings and kill him i ought to have done it a long time ago why mex just two weeks ago i dreamed me and rosita was married instead of her and him and we was living in a house and i could see her smiling at me and oh h l mex he got her and i ll get him yes sir on christmas eve he got her and then s when i ll get him there s other ways of committing suicide advised mexican why don t you go and surrender to the sheriff i ll get him said the kid christmas eve fell as balmy as april perhaps there was a hint of far away frostiness in the air but it tingles like seltzer perfumed faintly with late prairie blossoms and the mesquite grass when night came the five or six rooms of the ranch house were brightly lit in one room was a christmas tree for the lanes had a boy of three and a dozen or more guests were expected from the nearer ranches at nightfall madison lane called aside jim belcher and three other cowboys employed on his ranch now boys said lane keep your eyes open walk around the house and watch the road well all of you know the frio kid as they call him now and if you see him open fire on him without asking any questions i m not afraid of his coming around but rosita is she s been afraid he d come in on us every christmas since we were married the guests had arrived in buckboards and on horseback and were making themselves comfortable inside the evening went along pleasantly the guests enjoyed and praised rosita s excellent supper and after ward the men scattered in groups about the rooms or on the broad gallery smoking and chatting the christmas tree of course delighted the youngsters and above all were they pleased when santa claus himself in magnificent white beard and furs appeared and began to distribute the toys it s my papa announced billy sampson aged six i ve seen him wear em before berkly a sheepman an old friend of lane stopped rosita as she was passing by him on the gallery where he was sitting smoking well mrs lane said he i suppose by this christ mas you ve gotten over being afraid of that fellow mcroy haven t you madison and i have talked about it you know very nearly said rosita smiling but i am still nervous sometimes i shall never forget that awful time when he came so near to killing us he s the most cold hearted villain in the world said berkly the citizens all along the border ought to turn out and hunt him down like a wolf he has committed awful crimes said rosita but i don t know i think there is a spot of good somewhere in everybody he was not always bad that i know rosita turned into the hallway between the rooms santa claus in muffling whiskers and furs was just coming through i heard what you said through the window mrs lane he said i was just going down in my pocket for a christmas present for your husband but i ve left one for you instead it s in the room to your right oh thank you kind santa claus said rosita brightly rosita went into the room while santa claus stepped into the cooler air of the yard she found no one in the room but madison where is my present that santa said he left for me in here she asked haven t seen anything in the way of a present said her husband laughing unless he could have meant me the next day gabriel radd the foreman of the x ranch dropped into the post office at loma alta well the frio kid s got his dose of lead at last he remarked to the postmaster that so how d it happen one of old sanchez s mexican sheep herders did it think of it the frio kid killed bv a sheep herder the greaser saw him riding along past his camp about twelve o clock last night and was so skeered that he up with a winchester and let him have it funniest part of it was that the kid was dressed all up with white angora skin whiskers and a regular santy claus rig out from head to foot think of the frio kid playing santy a little local colour i mentioned to rivington that i was in search of characteristic new york scenes and incidents some thing typical i told him without necessarily having to spell the first syllable with an i oh for your writing business said rivington you couldn t have applied to a better shop what i don t know about little old new york wouldn t make a sonnet to a sunbonnet i ll put you right in the middle of so much local colour that you won t know whether you are a magazine cover or in the erysipelas ward when do you want to begin rivington is a young man about town and a new yorker by birth preference and incommutability i told him that i would be glad to accept his escort and guardianship so that i might take notes of manhattan s grand gloomy and peculiar idiosyncrasies and that the time of so doing would be at his own convenience we ll begin this very evening said rivington him self interested like a good fellow dine with me at seven and then i ll steer you up against metropolitan phases so thick you ll have to have a kinetoscope to record em so i dined with rivington pleasantly at his club in forty eleventh street and then we set forth in pursuit of the elusive tincture of affairs as we came out of the club there stood two men on the sidewalk near the steps in earnest conversation and by what process of ratiocination said one of them do you arrive at the conclusion that the division of society into producing and non possessing classes predicates failure when compared with competitive systems that are monopolizing in tendency and result inimically to industrial evolution oh come off your perch said the other man who wore glasses your premises won t come out in the wash you wind jammers who apply bandy legged theories to concrete categorical syllogisms send logical conclusions skallybootin into the infinitesimal ragbag you can t pull my leg with an old sophism with whiskers on it you quote marx and hyndman and kautsky what are they shines tolstoi his garret is full of rats i put it to you over the home plate that the idea of a cooperative commonwealth and an abolishment of competitive systems simply takes the rag off the bush and gives me hyperesthesia of the roopteetoop the skoo kum house for yours i stopped a few yards away and took out my little notebook oh come ahead said rivington somewhat ner vously you don t want to listen to that why man i whispered this is just what i do want to hear these slang types are among your city s most distinguishing features is this the bowery variety i really must hear more of it if i follow you said the man who had spoken flrst you do not believe it possible to reorganize society on the basis of common interest shinny on your own side said the man with glasses you never heard any such music from my foghorn what i said was that i did not believe it practicable just now the guys with wads are not in the frame of mind to slack up on the mazuma and the man with the portable tin banqueting canister isn t exactly ready to join the bible class you can bet your variegated socks that the situation is all spifflicated up from the battery to breakfast what the country needs is for some bully old bloke like cobden or some wise guy like old ben frank lin to sashay up to the front and biff the nigger s head with the baseball do you catch my smoke what rivington pulled me by the arm impatiently please come on he said let s go see something this isn t what you want indeed it is i said resisting this tough talk is the very stuff that counts there is a picturesqueness about the speech of the lower order of people that is quite unique did you say that this is the bowery variety of slang oh well said rivington giving it up i ll tell you straight that s one of our college professors talking he ran down for a day or two at the club it s a sort of fad with him lately to use slang in his conversation he thinks it improves language the man he is talking to is one of new york s famous social economists now will you come on you can t use that you know no i agreed i can t use that would you call that typical of new york of course not said rivington with a sigh of relief i m glad you see the difference but if you want to hear the real old tough bowery slang i ll take you down where you ll get your fill of it i would like it i said that is if it s the real thing i ve often read it in books but i never heard it do you think it will be dangerous to go unprotected among those characters oh no said rivington not at this time of night to tell the truth i haven t been along the bowery in a long time but i know it as well as i do broadway we ll look up some of the typical bowery boys and get them to talk it ll be worth your while they talk a peculiar dialect that you won t hear any where else on earth rivington and i went east in a forty second street car and then south on the third avenue line at houston street we got off and walked we are now on the famous bowery said rivington the bowery celebrated in song and story we passed block after block of gents furnishing stores the windows full of shirts with prices attached and cuffs inside in other windows were neckties and no shirts people walked up and down the sidewalks in some ways said i this reminds me of koko mono ind during the peach crating season rivington was nettled step into one of these saloons or vaudeville shows said he with a large roll of money and see how quickly the bowery will sustain its reputation you make impossible conditions said i coldly by and by rivington stopped and said we were in the heart of the bowery there was a policeman on the corner whom rivington knew hallo donahue said my guide how goes it my friend and i are down this way looking up a bit of local colour he s anxious to meet one of the bowery types can t you put us on to something genuine in that line something that s got the colour you know policeman donahue turned himself about ponder ously his florid face full of good nature he pointed with his club down the street sure he said huskily here comes a lad now that was born on the bowery and knows every inch of it if he s ever been above bleecker street he s kept it to himself a man about twenty eight or twenty nine with a smooth face was sauntering toward us with his hands in his coat pockets policeman donahue stopped him with a courteous wave of his club evening kerry he said here s a couple of gents friends of mine that want to hear you spiel something about the bowery can you reel em off a few yards certainly donahue said the young man pleas antly good evening gentlemen he said to us with a pleasant smile donahue walked off on his beat this is the goods whispered rivington nudging me with his elbow look at his jaw say cull said rivington pushing back his hat wot s doin me and my friend s taking a look down de old line see de copper tipped us off dat you was wise to de bowery is dat right i could not help admiring rivington s power of adapt ing himself to his surroundings donahue was right said the young man frankly i was brought up on the bowery i have been news boy teamster pugilist member of an organized band of toughs bartender and a sport in various mean ings of the word the experience certainly warrants the supposition that i have at least a passing acquaintance with a few phases of bowery life i will be pleased to place whatever knowledge and experience i have at the service of my friend donahue s friends rivington seemed ill at ease i say he said somewhat entreatingly i thought you re not stringing us are you it isn t just the kind of talk we expected you haven t even said hully gee once do you really belong on the bowery i am afraid said the bowery boy smilingly that at some time you have been enticed into one of the dives of literature and had the counterfeit coin of the bowery passed upon you the argot to which you doubtless refer was the invention of certain of your literary dis coverers who invaded the unknown wilds below third avenue and put strange sounds into the mouths of the inhabitants safe in their homes far to the north and west the credulous readers who were beguiled by this new dialect perused and believed like marco polo and mungo park pioneers indeed but ambitious souls who could not draw the line of demarcation between dis covery and invention the literary bones of these explorers are dotting the trackless wastes of the sub way while it is true that after the publication of the mythical language attributed to the dwellers along the bowery certain of its pat phrases and apt metaphors were adopted and to a limited extent used in this locality it was because our people are prompt in assimilating whatever is to their commercial advantage to the tourists who visited our newly discovered clime and who expected a realization of their literary guide books they supplied the demands of the market but perhaps i am wandering from the question in what way can i assist you gentlemen i beg you will believe that the hospitality of the street is extended to all there are i regret to say many catchpenny places of entertainment but i cannot conceive that they would entice you i felt rivington lean somewhat heavily against me say he remarked with uncertain utterance come and have a drink with us thank you but i never drink i find that alcohol even in the smallest quantities alters the perspective and i must preserve my perspective for i am studyinc the bowery i have lived in it nearly thirty years and i am just beginning to understand its heartbeats it is like a great river fed by a hundred alien streams each influx brings strange seeds on its flood strange silt and weeds and now and then a flower of rare promise to construe this river requires a man who can build dykes against the overflow who is a naturalist a geologist a humanitarian a diver and a strong swimmer i love my bowery it was my cradle and is my inspiration i have published one book the critics have been kind i put my heart in it i am writing another into which i hope to put both heart and brain consider me your guide gentlemen is there arything i can take you to see any place to which i can conduct you i was afraid to look at rivington except with one eye thanks said rivington we were looking up that is my friend confound it it s against all precedent you know awfully obliged just the same in case said our friend you would like to meet some of our bowery young men i would be pleased to have you visit the quarters of our east side kappa delta phi society only two blocks east of here awfully sorry said rivington but my friend s got me on the jump to nioht he s a terror when he s out after local colour now there s nothing i would like better than to drop in at the kappa delta phi but some other time we said our farewells and boarded a home bound car we had a rabbit on upper broadway and then i parted with rivington on a street corner well anyhow said he braced and recovered it couldn t have happened anywhere but in little old new york which to say the least was typical of rivington georgia s ruling if you should chance to visit the general land office step into the draughtsmen s room and ask to be shown the map of salado county a leisurely german pos sibly old kampfer himself will bring it to you it will be four feet square on heavy drawing cloth the lettering and the figures will be beautifully clear and distinct the title will be in splendid undecipherable german text ornamented with classic teutonic designs very likely ceres or pomona leaning against the initial letters with cornucopias venting grapes and wieners you must tell him that this is not the map you wish to see that he will kindly bring you its official predecessor he will then say ach so and bring out a map half the size of the first dim old tattered and faded by looking carefully near its northwest corner you will presently come upon the worn contours of chiquito river and maybe if your eyes are good discern the silent witness to this story the commissioner of the land office was of the old style his antique courtesy was too formal for his day he dressed in fine black and there was a suggestion of roman drapery in his long coat skirts his collars were undetached blame haberdashery for the word his tie was a narrow funereal strip tied in the same knot as were his shoe strings his gray hair was a trifle too long behind but he kept it smooth and orderly his face was clean shaven like the old statesmen s most people thought it a stern face but when its official expression was off a few had seen altogether a different countenance especially tender and gentle it had appeared to those who were about him during the last illness of his only child the commissioner had been a widower for years and his life outside his official duties had been so devoted to little georgia that people spoke of it as a touching and admirable thing he was a reserved man and dignified almost to austerity but the child had come below it all and rested upon his very heart so that she scarcely missed the mother s love that had been taken away there was a wonderful companionship between them for she had many of his own ways being thoughtful and serious beyond her years one day while she was lying with the fever burning brightly in her checks she said suddenly papa i wish i could do something good for a whole lot of children what would you like to do dear asked the com missioner give them a party oh i don t mean those kind i mean poor children who haven t homes and aren t loved and cared for as i am i tell you what papa what my own child if i shouldn t get well i ll leave them you not give you but just lend you for you must come to mamma and me when you die too if you can find time wouldn t you do something to help them if i ask you papa hush hush dear dear child said the commissioner holding her hot little hand against his cheek you ll get well real soon and you and i will see what we can do for them together but in whatsoever paths of benevolence thus vaguely premeditated the commissioner might tread he was not to have the company of his beloved that night the little frail body grew suddenly too tired to struggle further and georgia s exit was made from the great stage when she had scarcely begun to speak her little piece before the footlights but there must be a stage manager who understands she had given the cue to the one who was to speak after her a week after she was laid away the commissioner reappeared at the office a little more courteous a little paler and sterner with the black frock coat hanging a little more loosely from his tall figure his desk was piled with work that had accumulated during the four heartbreaking weeks of his absence his chief clerk had done what he could but there were ques tions of law of fine judicial decisions to be made concern ing the issue of patents the marketing and leasing of school lands the classification into grazing agricultural watered and timbered of new tracts to be opened to settlers the commissioner went to work silently and ob stinately putting back his grief as far as possible forcing his mind to attack the complicated and important busi ness of his office on the second day after his return he called the porter pointed to a leather covered chair that stood near his own and ordered it removed to a lumber room at the top of the building in that chair georgia would always sit when she came to the office for him of afternoons as time passed the commissioner seemed to grow more silent solitary and reserved a new phase of mind developed in him he could not endure the presence of a child often when a clattering youngster belonging to one of the clerks would come chattering into the big business room adjoining his little apartment the com missioner would steal softly and close the door he would always cross the street to avoid meeting the school children when they came dancing along in happy groups upon the sidewalk and his firm mouth would close into a mere line it was nearly three months after the rains had washed the last dead flower petals from the mound above little georgia when the land shark firm of hamlin and avery filed papers upon what they considered the fattest vacancy of the year it should not be supposed that all who were termed land sharks deserved the name many of them were reputable men of good business character some of them could walk into the most august councils of the state and say gentlemen we would like to have this and that and matters go thus but next to a three years drought and the boll worm the actual settler hated the land shark the land shark haunted the land office where all the land records were kept and hunted vacancies that is tracts of unappro priated public domain generally invisible upon the official maps but actually existing upon the ground the law entitled any one possessing certain state scrip to file by virtue of same upon any land not previously legally appropriated most of the scrip was now in the hands of the land sharks thus at the cost of a few hundred dollars they often secured lands worth as many thousands naturally the search for vacancies was lively but often very often the land they thus secured though legally unappropriated would be occupied by happy and contented settlers who had laboured for years to build up their homes only to discover that their titles were worthless and to receive peremptory notice to quit thus came about the bitter and not unjustifiable hatred felt by the toiling settlers toward the shrewd and seldom merciful speculators who so often turned them forth destitute and homeless from their fruitless labours the history of the state teems with their antagonism mr land shark seldom showed his face on locations from which he should have to eject the unfortunate victims of a monstrously tangled land system but let his emis saxies do the work there was lead in every cabin moulded into balls for him many of his brothers had enriched the grass with their blood the fault of it all lay far back when the state was young she felt the need of attract ing newcomers and of rewarding those pioneers already within her borders year after year she issued land scrip headrights bounties veteran donations confeder ates and to railroads irrigation companies colonies and tillers of the soil galore all required of the grantee was that he or it should have the scrip properly surveyed upon the public domain by the county or district surveyor and the land thus appropriated became the property of him or it or his or its heirs and assigns forever in those days and here is where the trouble began the state s domain was practically inexhaustible and the old surveyors with princely yea even western american liberality gave good measure and over flowing often the jovial man of metes and bounds would dispense altogether with the tripod and chain mounted on a pony that could cover something near a vara at a step with a pocket compass to direct his course he would trot out a survey by counting the beat of his pony s hoofs mark his corners and write out his field notes with the complacency produced by an act of duty well performed sometimes and who could blame the surveyor when the pony was feeling his oats he might step a little higher and farther and in that case the beneficiary of the scrip might get a thousand or two more acres in his survey than the scrip called for but look at the boundless leagues the state had to spare however no one ever had to complain of the pony under stepping nearly every old survey in the state con tained an excess of land in later years when the state became more populous and land values increased this careless work entailed incalculable trouble endless litigation a period of riotous land grabbing and no little bloodshed the land sharks voraciously attacked these excesses in the old surveys and filed upon such portions with new scrip as unappropriated public domain wherever the identi fications of the old tracts were vague and the corners were not to be clearly established the land office would recognize the newer locations as valid and issue title to the locators here was the greatest hardship to be found these old surveys taken from the pick of the land were already nearly all occupied by unsuspecting and peaceful settlers and thus their titles were demolished and the choice was placed before them either to buy their land over at a double price or to vacate it with their families and personal belongings immediately land locators sprang up by hundreds the country was held up and searched for vacancies at the point of a compass hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of splendid acres were wrested from their innocent purchasers and holders there began a vast hegira of evicted settlers in tattered wagons going nowhere cursing injustice stunned purposeless homeless hopeless their children began to look up to them for bread and cry it was in consequence of these conditions that hamil ton and avery had filed upon a strip of land about a mile wide and three miles long comprising about two thou sand acres it being the excess over complement of the elias denny three league survey on chiquito river in one of the middle western counties this two thousand acre body of land was asserted by them to be vacant land and improperly considered a part of the denny survey they based this assertion and their claim upon the land upon the demonstrated facts that the beginning corner of the denny survey was plainly identified that its field notes called to run west varas and then called for chiquito river thence it ran south with the meanders and so on and that the chiquito river was on the ground fully a mile farther west from the point reached by course and distance to sum up there were two thousand acres of vacant land between the denny survey proper and chiquito river one sweltering day in july the commissioner called for the papers in connection with this new location they were brought and heaped a foot deep upon his desk field notes statements sketches affidavits connecting lines documents of every description that shrewdness and money could call to the aid of hamlin and avery the firm was pressing the commissioner to issue a patent upon their location they possesed inside infor mation concerning a new railroad that would probably pass somewhere near this land the general land office was very still while the com missioner was delving into the heart of the mass of evi dence the pigeons could be heard on the roof of the old castle like building cooing and fretting the clerks were droning everywhere scarcely pretending to earn their salaries each little sound echoed hollow and loud from the bare stone flagged floors the plastered walls and the iron joisted ceiling the impalpable perpetual lime stone dust that never settled whitened a long streamer of sunlight that pierced the tattered window awning it seemed that hamlin and avery had builded well the denny survey was carelessly made even for a care less period its beginning corner was identical with that of a well defined old spanish grant but its other calls were sinfully vague the field notes contained no other object that survived no tree no natural object save chiquito river and it was a mile wrong there according to precedent the office would be justified in giving it its complement by course and distance and considering the remainder vacant instead of a mere excess the actual settler was besieging the office with wild protests in re having the nose of a pointer and the eye of a hawk for the land shark he had observed his myrmi dons running the lines upon his ground making inquiries he learned that the spoiler had attacked his home and he left the plough in the furrow and took his pen in hand one of the protests the commissioner read twice it was from a woman a widow the granddaughter of elias denny himself she told how her grandfather had sold most of the survey years before at a trivial price land that was now a principality in extent and value her mother had also sold a part and she herself had succeeded to this western portion along chiquito river much of it she had been forced to part with in order to live and now she owned only about three hundred acres on which she had her home her letter wound up rather pathetically i ve got eight children the oldest fifteen years i work all day and half the night to till what little land i can and keep us in clothes and books i teach my children too my neighbours is all poor and has big families the drought kills the crops every two or three years and then we has hard times to get enough to eat there is ten families on this land what the land sharks is trying to rob us of and all of them got titles from me i sold to them cheap and they aint paid out yet but part of them is and if their land should be took from them i would die my grandfather was an honest man and he helped to build up this state and he taught his children to be honest and how could i make it up to them who bought me mr commissioner if you let them land sharks take the roof from over my children and the little from them as they has to live on whoever again calls this state great or its government just will have a lie in their mouths the commissioner laid this letter aside with a sigh many many such letters he had received he had never been hurt by them nor had he ever felt that they appealed to him personally he was but the state s servant and must follow its laws and yet somehow this reflection did not always eliminate a certain responsible feeling that hung upon him of all the state s officers he was supremest in his department not even excepting the governor broad general land laws he followed it was true but he had a wide latitude in particular ramifica tions rather than law what he followed was rulings office rulings and precedents in the complicated and new questions that were being engendered by the state s development the commissioner s ruling was rarely appealed from even the courts sustained it when its equity was apparent the commissioner stepped to the door and spoke to a clerk in the other room spoke as he always did as if he were addressing a prince of the blood mr weldon will you be kind enough to ask mr ashe the state school land appraiser to please come to my office as soon as convenient ashe came quickly from the big table where he was arranging his reports mr ashe said the commissioner you worked along the chiquito river in salado colinty during your last trip i believe do you remember anything of the elias denny three league survey yes sir i do the blunt breezy surveyor answered i crossed it on my way to block h on the north side of it the road runs with the chiquito river along the valley the denny survey fronts three miles on the chiquito it is claimed continued the commissioner that it fails to reach the river by as much as a mile the appraiser shrugged his shoulder he was by birth and instinct an actual settler and the natural foe of the land shark it has always been considered to extend to the river he said dryly but that is not the point i desired to discuss said the commissioner what kind of country is this valley portion of let us say then the denny tract the spirit of the actual settler beamed in ashe s face beautiful he said with enthusiasm valley as level as this floor with just a little swell on like the sea and rich as cream just enough brakes to shelter the cattle in winter black loamy soil for six feet and then clay holds water a dozen nice little houses on it with windmills and gardens people pretty poor i guess too far from market but comfortable never saw so many kids in my life they raise flocks inquired the commissioner ho ho i mean two legged kids lauched the surveyor two legged and bare legged and tow headed children oh children mused the commissioner as though a new view had opened to him they raise children it s a lonesome country commissioner said the surveyor can you blame em i suppose continued the commissioner slowly as one carefully pursues deductions from a new stupendous theory not all of them are tow headed it would not be unreasonable mr ashe i conjecture to believe that a portion of them have brown or even black hair brown and black sure said ashe also red no doubt said the commissioner well i thank you for your courtesy in informing me mr ashe i will not detain you any longer from your duties later in the afternoon came hamlin and avery big handsome genial sauntering men clothed in white duck and low cut shoes they permeated the whole office with an aura of debonair prosperity they passed among the clerks and left a wake of abbreviated given names and fat brown cigars these were the aristocracy of the land sharks who went in for big things full of serene confidence in them selves there was no corporation no syndicate no rail road company or attorney general too big for them to tackle the peculiar smoke of their rare fat brown cigars was to be perceived in the sanctum of every department of state in every committee room of the legislature in every bank parlour and every private caucus room in the state capital always pleasant never in a hurry in seeming to possess unlimited leisure people wondered when they gave their attention to the many audacious enterprises in which they were knnown to be engaged by and by the two dropped carelessly into the com missioner s room and reclined lazily in the big leather upholstered arm chairs they drawled a good natured complaint of the weather and hamlin told the com missioner an excellent story he had amassed that morn ing from the secretary of state but the commissioner knew why they were there he had half promised to render a decision that day upon their location the chief clerk now brought in a batch of duplicate certificates for the commissioner to sign as he traced his sprawling signature hollis summerfield comr genl land office on each one the chief clerk stood deftly removing them and applying the blotter i notice said the chief clerk you ve been going through that salado county location kampfer is mak ing a new map of salado and i believe is platting in that section of the county now i will see it said the comissioner a few moments later he went to the draughtsmen s room as he entered he saw five or six of the draughtsmen grouped about kampfer s desk gargling away at each other in pectoral german and gazing at something there upon at the commissioner s approach they scattered to their several places kampfer a wizened little ger man with long frizzled ringlets and a watery eye began to stammer forth some sort of an apology the commis sioner thought for the congregation of his fellows about his desk never mind said the commissioner i wish to see the map you are making and passing around the old german seated himself upon the high draughtsman s stool kampfer continued to break english in trving to explain herr gommissioner i assure you blenty sat i haf not it bremeditated sat it wass sat it itself make look you from se field notes wass it blatted blease to observe se calls south degrees west varas south degrees east varas south south west south degrees west and so on herr gommissioner nefer would i have the commissioner raised one white hand silently kampfer dropped his pipe and fled with a hand at each side of his face and his elbows resting upon the desk the commissioner sat staring at the map which was spread and fastened there staring at the sweet and living profile of little georgia drawn thereupon at her face pensive delicate and infantile outlined in a perfect likeness when his mind at length came to inquire into the rea son of it he saw that it must have been as kampfer had said unpremeditated the old draughtsman had been platting in the elias denny survey and georgia s likeness striking though it was was formed by nothing more than the meanders of chiquito river indeed kampfer s blotter whereon his preliminary work was done showed the laborious tracings of the calls and the countless pricks of the compasses then over his faint pencilling kampfer had drawn in india ink with a full firm pen the similitude of chiquito river and forth had blossomed mysteriously the dainty pathetic profile of the child the commissioner sat for half an hour with his face in his hands gazing downward and none dared approach him then he arose and walked out in the business office he paused long enough to ask that the denny file be brought to his desk he found hamlin and avery still reclining in their chairs apparently oblivious of business they were lazily discussing summer opera it being their habit perhaps their pride also to appear supernaturally indifferent whenever they stood with large interests imperilled and they stood to win more on this stake than most people knew they possessed inside infor mation to the effect that a new railroad would within a year split this very chiquito river valley and send land values ballooning all along its route a dollar under thirty thousand profit on this location if it should hold good would be a loss to their expectations so while they chatted lightly and waited for the commissioner to open the subject there was a quick sidelong sparkle in their eyes evincing a desire to read their title clear to those fair acres on the chiquito a clerk brought in the file the commissioner seated himself and wrote upon it in red ink then he rose to his feet and stood for a while looking straight out of the window the land office capped the summit of a bold hill the eyes of the commissioner passed over the roofs of many houses set in a packing of deep green the whole checkered by strips of blinding white streets the horizon where his gaze was focussed swelled to a fair wooded eminence flecked with faint dots of shining white there was the cemetery where lay many who were forgot ten and a few who had not lived in vain and one lay there occupying very small space whose childish heart had been large enough to desire while near its last beats good to others the commissioner s lips moved slightly as he whispered to himself it was her last will and testament and i have neglected it so long the big brown cigars of hamlin and avery were fireless but they still gripped them between their teeth and waited while they marvelled at the absent expression upon the commissioner s face by and by he spoke suddenly and promptly gentlemen i have just indorsed the elias denny survey for patenting this office will not regard your location upon a part of it as legal he paused a moment and then extending his hand as those dear old time ones used to do in debate he enunciated the spirit of that ruling that subsequently drove the land sharks to the wall and placed the seal of peace and security over the doors of ten thousand homes and furthermore he continued with a clear soft light upon his face it may interest you to know that from this time on this office will consider that when a survey of land made by virtue of a certificate granted by this state to the men who wrested it from the wilderness and the savage made in good faith settled in good faith and left in good faith to their children or innocent pur chasers when such a survey although overrunning its complement shall call for any natural object visible to the eye of man to that object it shall hold and be good and valid and the children of this state shall lie down to sleep at night and rumours of disturbers of title shall not disquiet them for concluded the commissioner of such is the kingdom of heaven in the silence that followed a laugh floated up from the patent room below the man who carried down the denny file was exhibiting it among the clerks look here he said delightedly the old man has forgotten his name he s written patent to original grantee and signed it georgia summerfield comr the speech of the commissioner rebounded lightly from the impregnable hamlin and avery they smiled rose gracefully spoke of the baseball team and argued feelingly that quite a perceptible breeze had arisen from the east they lit fresh fat brown cigars and drifted courteously away but later they made another tiger spring for their quarry in the courts but the courts according to reports in the papers coolly roasted them a remarkable performance suggestive of liquid air didoes and sustained the commissioner s ruling and this ruling itself grew to be a precedent and the actual settler framed it and taught his children to spell from it and there was sound sleep o nights from the pines to the sage brush and from the chaparral to the great brown river of the north but i think and i am sure the commissioner never thought otherwise that whether kampfer was a snuffy old instrument of destiny or whether the meanders of the chiquito accidentally platted themselves into that memo rable sweet profile or not there was brought about some thing good for a whole lot of children and the result ought to be called georgia s ruling blind man s holiday alas for the man and for the artist with the shifting point of perspective life shall be a confusion of ways to the one the landscape shall rise up and confound the other take the case of lorison at one time he appeared to himself to be the feeblest of fools at another he conceived that he followed ideals so fine that the world was not yet ready to accept them during one mood he cursed his folly possessed by the other he bore himself with a serene grandeur akin to greatness in neither did he attain the perspective generations before the name had been larsen his race had bequeathed him its fine strung melancholy temperament its saving balance of thrift and industry from his point of perspective he saw himself an outcast from society forever to be a shady skulker along the ragged edge of respectability a denizen des trois quartz de monde that pathetic spheroid lying between the haut and the demi whose inhabitants envy each of their neigh bours and are scorned by both he was self condemned to this opinion as he was self exiled through it to this quaint southern city a thousand miles from his former home here he had dwelt for longer than a year know ing but few keeping in a subjective world of shadows which was invaded at times by the perplexing bulks of jarring realities then he fell in love with a girl whom he met in a cheap restaurant and his story begins the rue chartres in new orleans is a street of ghosts it lies in the quarter where the frenchman in his prime set up his translated pride and glory where also the arrogant don had swaggered and dreamed of gold and grants and ladies gloves every flagstone has its grooves worn by footsteps going royally to the wooing and the fighting every house has a princely heartbreak each doorway its untold tale of gallant promise and slow decay by night the rue chartres is now but a murky fissure from which the groping wayfarer sees flung against the sky the tangled filigree of moorish iron balconies ths old houses of monsieur stand yet indomitable against the century but their essence is gone the street is one of ghosts to whosoever can see them a faint heartbeat of the street s ancient glory still sur vives in a corner occupied by the caf carabine d or once men gathered there to plot against kings and to warn presidents they do so yet but they are not the same kind of men a brass button will scatter these those would have set their faces against an army above the door hangs the sign board upon which has been depicted a vast animal of unfamiliar species in the act of firing upon this monster is represented an unobtrusive human levelling an obtrusive gun once the colour of bright gold now the legend above the picture is faded beyond conjecture the gun s relation to the title is a matter of faith the menaced animal wearied of the long aim of the hunter has resolved itself into a shapeless blot the place is known as antonio s as the name white upon the red lit transparency and gilt upon the windows attests there is a promise in antonio a justifiable expectancy of savoury things in oil and pepper and wine and perhaps an angel s whisper of garlic but the rest of the name is o riley antonio o riley the carabine d or is an ignominious ghost of the rue chartres the caf where bienville and conti dined where a prince has broken bread is become a family ristaurant its customers are working men and women almost to a unit occasionally you will see chorus girls from the cheaper theatres and men who follow avocations sub ject to quick vicissitudes but at antonio s name rich in bohemian promise but tame in fulfillment manners debonair and gay are toned down to the family stand ard should you light a cigarette mine host will touch you on the arrum and remind you that the proprieties are menaced antonio entices and beguiles from fiery legend without but o riley teaches decorum within it was at this restaurant that lorison first saw the girl a flashy fellow with a predatory eye had followed her in and had advanced to take the other chair at the little table where she stopped but lorison slipped into the seat before him their acquaintance began and grew and how for two months they had sat at the same table each evening not meeting by appointment but as if by a series of fortuitous and happy accidents after dining they would take a walk together

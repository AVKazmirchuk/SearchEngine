street corner as solid as granite in the rush hour tide of humanity stood the man from nome the arctic winds and sun had stained him berry brown his eye still held the azure glint of the glaciers he was as alert as a fox as tough as a caribou cutlet and as broad gauged as the aurora borealis he stood sprayed by a niagara of sound the crash of the elevated trains clanging cars pounding of rubberless tires and the antiphony of the cab and truck drivers indulging in scarifying repartee and so with his gold dust cashed in to the merry air of a hundred thousand and with the cakes and ale of one week in gotham turning bitter on his tongue the man from nome sighed to set foot again in chilkoot the exit from the land of street noises and dead sea apple pies up sixth avenue with the tripping scurrying chattering bright eyed homing tide came the girl from sieber mason s the man from nome looked and saw first that she was supremely beautiful after his own conception of beauty and next that she moved with exactly the steady grace of a dog sled on a level crust of snow his third sensation was an instantaneous conviction that he desired her greatly for his own this quickly do men from nome make up their minds besides he was going back to the north in a short time and to act quickly was no less necessary a thousand girls from the great department store of sieber mason flowed along the sidewalk making navigation dangerous to men whose feminine field of vision for three years has been chiefly limited to siwash and chilkat squaws but the man from nome loyal to her who had resurrected his long cached heart plunged into the stream of pulchritude and followed her down twenty third street she glided swiftly looking to neither side no more flirtatious than the bronze diana above the garden her fine brown hair was neatly braided her neat waist and unwrinkled black skirt were eloquent of the double virtues taste and economy ten yards behind followed the smitten man from nome miss claribel colby the girl from sieber mason s belonged to that sad company of mariners known as jersey commuters she walked into the waiting room of the ferry and up the stairs and by a marvellous swift little run caught the ferry boat that was just going out the man from nome closed up his ten yards in three jumps and gained the deck close beside her miss colby chose a rather lonely seat on the outside of the upper cabin the night was not cold and she desired to be away from the curious eyes and tedious voices of the passengers besides she was extremely weary and drooping from lack of sleep on the previous night she had graced the annual ball and oyster fry of the west side wholesale fish dealers assistants social club no thus reducing her usual time of sleep to only three hours and the day had been uncommonly troublous customers had been inordinately trying the buyer in her department had scolded her roundly for letting her stock run down her best friend mamie tuthill had snubbed her by going to lunch with that dockery girl the girl from sieber mason s was in that relaxed softened mood that often comes to the independent feminine wage earner it is a mood most propitious for the man who would woo her then she has yearnings to be set in some home and heart to be comforted and to hide behind some strong arm and rest rest but miss claribel colby was also very sleepy there came to her side a strong man browned and dressed carelessly in the best of clothes with his hat in his hand lady said the man from nome respectfully excuse me for speaking to you but i i

he did not have the perfidious smirk or the brazen swagger of the lady killer sincerity and modesty shone through his boreal tan it seemed to her that it might be good to hear a little of what he had to say you may sit down she said laying her hand over a yawn with ostentatious politness and mind don t get fresh or i ll call the steward the man from nome sat by her side he admired her greatly he more than admired her she had exactly the looks he had tried so long in vain to find in a woman could she ever come to like him well that was to be seen he must do all in his power to stake his claim anyhow my name s blayden said he henry blayden are you real sure it ain t jones asked the girl leaning toward him with delicious knowing raillery i m down from nome he went on with anxious seriousness

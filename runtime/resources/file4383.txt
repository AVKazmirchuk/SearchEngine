apart and how she used to send me the sign that she wanted to see me old man mac promised to make me look like a colander if i ever come in gun shot of the ranch you remember the sign she used to send

lead pencil on the newspapers i see one of em once chalked on the back of a new cook that old man mcallister sent out from the ranch danged if i didn t santa s father explained webb gently got her to promise that she wouldn t write to me or send me any word that heart and cross sign was her scheme whenever she wanted to see me in particular she managed to put that mark on somethin at the ranch that she knew i d see and i never laid eyes on it but what i burnt the wind for the ranch the same night i used to see her in that coma mott back of the little horse corral we knowed it chanted baldy but we never let on we was all for you we knowed why you always kept that fast paint in camp and when we see that gizzard and crossbones figured out on the truck from the ranch we knowed old pinto was goin to eat up miles that night instead of grass you remember scurry that educated horse wrangler we had the college fellow that tangle foot drove to the range whenever scurry saw that come meet your honey brand on anything from the ranch he d wave his hand like that and say our friend lee andrews will again swim the hell s point to night the last time santa sent me the sign said webb was once when she was sick i noticed it as soon as i hit camp and i galloped pinto forty mile that night she wasn t at the coma mott i went to the house and old mcallister met me at the door did you come here to get killed says he i ll disoblige you for once i just started a mexican to bring you santa wants you go in that room and see her and then come out here and see me santa was lyin in bed pretty sick but she gives out a kind of a smile and her hand and mine lock horns and i sets down by the bed mud and spurs and chaps and all i ve heard you ridin across the grass for hours webb she says i was sure you d come you saw the sign she whispers the minute i hit camp says i twas marked on the bag of potatoes and onions they re always together says she soft like always together in life they go well together i says in a stew i mean hearts and crosses says santa our sign to love and to suffer that s what they mean and there was old doc musgrove amusin himself with whisky and a palm leaf fan and by and by santa goes to sleep and doc feels her forehead and he says to me you re not such a bad febrifuge but you d better slide out now for the diagnosis don t call for you in regular doses the little lady ll be all right when she wakes up i seen old mcallister outside she s asleep says i and now you can start in with your colander work take your time for i left my gun on my saddle horn old mac

me admire for to use you as a target you ain t my idea for a member of the family but i can use you on the nopalito if you ll keep outside of a radius with the ranch house in the middle of it you go upstairs and lay down on a cot and when you get some sleep we ll talk it over baldy woods pulled down his hat and uncurled his leg from his saddle horn webb shortened his rein and his pony danced anxious to be off the two men shook hands with western ceremony adios baldy said webb i m glad i seen you and had this talk with a pounding rush that sounded like the rise of a covey of quail the riders sped away toward different points of the compass a hundred yards on his route baldy reined in on the top of a bare knoll and emitted a yell he swayed on his horse had he been on foot the earth would have risen and conquered him but in the saddle he was a master of equilibrium and laughed at whisky and despised the centre of gravity webb turned in his saddle at the signal if i was you came baldy s strident and perverting tones i d be king at eight o clock on the following morning bud turner rolled from his saddle in front of the nopalito ranch house and stumbled with whizzing rowels toward the gallery bud was in charge of the bunch of beef cattle that was to strike the trail that morning for san antonio mrs yeager was on the gallery watering a cluster of hyacinths growing in a red earthenware jar king mcallister had bequeathed to his daughter many of his strong characteristics his resolution his gay courage his contumacious self reliance his pride as a reigning monarch of hoofs and horns allegro and fortissimo had been mcallister s temp and tone in santa they survived transposed to the feminine key substantially she preserved the image of the mother who had been summoned to wander in other and less finite green pastures long before the waxing herds of kine had conferred royalty upon the house she had her mother s slim strong figure and grave soft prettiness that relieved in her the severity of the imperious mcallister eye and the mcallister air of royal independence webb stood on one end of the gallery giving orders to two or three sub bosses of various camps and outfits who had ridden in for instructions morning said bud briefly where do you want them beeves to go in town to barber s as usual now to answer that had been the prerogative of the queen all the reins of business buying selling and banking had been held by her capable fingers the handling of cattle had been entrusted fully to her husband in the days of king mcallister santa had been his secretary and helper and she had continued her work with wisdom and profit but before she could reply the prince consort spake up with calm decision you drive that bunch to zimmerman and nesbit s pens i spoke to zimmerman about it some time ago bud turned on his high boot heels wait called santa quickly she looked at her husband with surprise in her steady gray eyes why what do you mean webb she asked with a small wrinkle gathering between her brows i never deal with zimmerman and nesbit barber has handled every head of stock from this ranch in that market for five years i m not going to take the business out of his hands she faced bud turner deliver those cattle to barber she concluded positively bud gazed impartially at the water jar hanging on the gallery stood on his other leg and chewed a mesquite leaf i want this bunch of beeves to go to zimmerman and nesbit said webb with a frosty light in his blue eyes nonsense said santa impatiently you d better start on bud so as to noon at the little elm water hole tell barber we ll have another lot of culls ready in about a month bud allowed a hesitating eye to steal upward and meet webb s webb saw apology in his look and fancied he saw commiseration you deliver them cattle he said grimly to barber finished santa sharply let that settle it is there anything else you are waiting for bud no m m said bud but before going he lingered while a cow s tail could have switched thrice for man is man s ally and even the philistines must have blushed when they took samson in the way they did you hear your boss cried webb sardonically he took off his hat and bowed until it touched the floor before his wife webb said santa rebukingly you re acting mighty foolish to day court fool your majesty said webb in his slow tones which had changed their quality what else can you expect let me tell you i was a man before i married a cattle queen what am i now the laughing stock of the camps i ll be a man again santa looked at him closely don t be unreasonable webb she said calmly you haven t been slighted in any way do i ever interfere in your management of the cattle i know the business side of the ranch much better than you do i learned it from dad be sensible kingdoms and queendoms said webb don t suit me unless i am in the pictures too i punch the cattle and you wear the crown all right i d rather be high lord chancellor of a cow camp than the eight spot in a queen high flush it s your ranch and barber gets the beeves webb s horse was tied to the rack he walked into the house and brought out his roll of blankets that he never took with him except on long rides and his slicker and his longest stake rope of plaited raw hide these he began to tie deliberately upon his saddle santa a little pale followed him webb swung up into the saddle his serious smooth face was without expression except for a stubborn light that smouldered in his eyes there s a herd of cows and calves said he near the hondo water hole on the frio that ought to be moved away from timber lobos have killed three of the calves i forgot to leave orders you d better tell simms to attend to it santa laid a hand on the horse s bridle and looked her husband in the eye are you going to leave me webb she asked quietly i am going to be a man again he answered i wish you success in a praiseworthy attempt she said with a sudden coldness she turned and walked directly into the house webb yeager rode to the southeast as straight as the topography of west texas permitted and when he reached the horizon he might have ridden on into blue space as far as knowledge of him on the nopalito went and the days with sundays at their head formed into hebdomadal squads and the weeks captained by the full moon closed ranks into menstrual companies crying tempus fugit on their banners and the months marched on toward the vast camp ground of the years but webb yeager came no more to the dominions of his queen one day a being named bartholomew a sheep man and therefore of little account from the lower rio grande country rode in sight of the nopalito ranch house and felt hunger assail him ex consuetudine he was soon seated at the mid day dining table of that hospitable kingdom talk like water gushed from him he might have been smitten with aaron s rod that is your gentle shepherd when an audience is vouchsafed him whose ears are not overgrown with wool missis yeager he babbled i see a man the other day on the rancho seco down in hidalgo county by your name webb yeager was his he d just been engaged as manager he was a tall light haired man not saying much perhaps he was some kin of yours do you think a husband said santa cordially the seco has done well mr yeager is one of the best stockmen in the west the dropping out of a prince consort rarely disorganises a monarchy queen santa had appointed as mayordomo of the ranch a trusty subject named ramsay who had been one of her father s faithful vassals and there was scarcely a ripple on the nopalito ranch save when the gulf breeze created undulations in the grass of its wide acres for several years the nopalito had been making experiments with an english breed of cattle that looked down with aristocratic contempt upon the texas long horns the experiments were found satisfactory and a pasture had been set aside for the blue bloods the fame of them had gone forth into the chaparral and pear as far as men ride in saddles other ranches woke up rubbed their eyes and looked with new dissatisfaction upon the long horns as a consequence one day a sunburned capable silk kerchiefed nonchalant youth garnished with revolvers and attended by three mexican vaqueros alighted at the nopalito ranch and presented the following business like epistle to the queen thereof mrs yeager the nopalito ranch dear madam i am instructed by the owners of the rancho seco to purchase head of two and three year old cows of the sussex breed owned by you if you can fill the order please deliver the cattle to the bearer and a check will be forwarded to you at once respectfully webster yeager manager the rancho seco business is business even very scantily did it escape being written especially in a kingdom that night the head of cattle were driven up from the pasture and penned in a corral near the ranch house for delivery in the morning when night closed down and the house was still did santa yeager throw herself down clasping that formal note to her bosom weeping and calling out a name that pride either in one or the other had kept from her lips many a day or did she file the letter in her business way retaining her royal balance and strength wonder if you will but royalty is sacred and there is a veil but this much you shall learn at midnight santa slipped softly out of the ranch house clothed in something dark and plain she paused for a moment under the live oak trees the prairies were somewhat dim and the moonlight was pale orange diluted with particles of an impalpable flying mist but the mock bird whistled on every bough of vantage leagues of flowers scented the air and a kindergarten of little shadowy rabbits leaped and played in an open space near by santa turned her face to the southeast and threw three kisses thitherward for there was none to see then she sped silently to the blacksmith shop fifty yards away and what she did there can only be surmised but the forge glowed red and there was a faint hammering such as cupid might make when he sharpens his arrow points later she came forth with a queer shaped handled thing in one hand and a portable furnace such as are seen in branding camps in the other to the corral where the sussex cattle were penned she sped with these things swiftly in the moonlight she opened the gate and slipped inside the corral the sussex cattle were mostly a dark red but among this bunch was one that was milky white notable among the others and now santa shook from her shoulder something that we had not seen before a rope lasso she freed the loop of it coiling the length in her left hand and plunged into the thick of the cattle the white cow was her object she swung the lasso which caught one horn and slipped off the next throw encircled the forefeet and the animal fell heavily santa made for it like a panther but it scrambled up and dashed against her knocking her over like a blade of grass again she made her cast while the aroused cattle milled around the four sides of the corral in a plunging mass this throw was fair the white cow came to earth again and before it could rise santa had made the lasso fast around a post of the corral with a swift and simple knot and had leaped upon the cow again with the rawhide hobbles in one minute the feet of the animal were tied no record breaking deed and santa leaned against the corral for the same space of time panting and lax and then she ran swiftly to her furnace at the gate and brought the branding iron queerly shaped and white hot the bellow of the outraged white cow as the iron was applied should have stirred the slumbering auricular nerves and consciences of the near by subjects of the nopalito but it did not and it was amid the deepest nocturnal silence that santa ran like a lapwing back to the ranch house and there fell upon a cot and sobbed sobbed as though queens had hearts as simple ranchmen s wives have and as though she would gladly make kings of prince consorts should they ride back again from over the hills and far away in the morning the capable revolvered youth and his vaqueros set forth driving the bunch of sussex cattle across the prairies to the rancho seco ninety miles it was a six days journey grazing and watering the animals on the way the beasts arrived at rancho seco one evening at dusk and were received and counted by the foreman of the ranch the next morning at eight o clock a horseman loped out of the brush to the nopalito ranch house he dismounted stiffly and strode with whizzing spurs to the house his horse gave a great sigh and swayed foam streaked with down drooping head and closed eyes but waste not your pity upon belshazzar the flea bitten sorrel to day in nopalito horse pasture he survives pampered beloved unridden cherished record holder of long distance rides the horseman stumbled into the house two arms fell around his neck and someone cried out in the voice of woman and queen alike webb oh webb i was a skunk said webb yeager hush said santa did you see it i saw it said webb what they meant god knows and you shall know if you rightly read the primer of events be the cattle queen said webb and overlook it if you can i was a mangy sheep stealing coyote hush said santa again laying her fingers upon his mouth there s no queen here do you know who i am i am santa yeager first lady of the bedchamber come here she dragged him from the gallery into the room to the right there stood a cradle with an infant in it a red ribald unintelligible babbling beautiful infant sputtering at life in an unseemly manner there s no queen on this ranch said santa again look at the king he s got your eyes webb down on your knees and look at his highness but jingling rowels sounded on the gallery and bud turner stumbled there again with the same query that he had brought lacking a few days a year ago morning them beeves is just turned out on the trail shall i drive em to barber s or he saw webb and stopped open mouthed ba ba ba ba ba ba shrieked the king in his cradle beating the air with his fists you hear your boss bud said webb yeager with a broad grin just as he had said a year ago and that is all except that when old man quinn owner of the rancho seco went out to look over the herd of sussex cattle that he had bought from the nopalito ranch he asked his new manager what s the nopalito ranch brand wilson x bar y said wilson i thought so said quinn but look at that white heifer there she s got another brand a heart with a cross inside of it what brand is that the ransom of mack me and old mack lonsbury we got out of that little hide and seek gold mine affair with about apiece i say old mack but he wasn t old forty one i should say but he always seemed old andy he says to me i m tired of hustling you and me have been working hard together for three years say we knock off for a while and spend some of this idle money we ve coaxed our way the proposition hits me just right says i let s be nabobs for a while and see how it feels what ll we do take in the niagara falls or buck at faro for a good many years says mack i ve thought that if i ever had extravagant money i d rent a two room cabin somewhere hire a chinaman to cook and sit in my stocking feet and read buckle s history of civilisation that sounds self indulgent and gratifying without vulgar ostentation says i and i don t see how money could be better invested give me a cuckoo clock and a sep winner s self instructor for the banjo and i ll join you a week afterwards me and mack hits this small town of pina about thirty miles out from denver and finds an elegant two room house that just suits us we deposited half a peck of money in the pina bank and shook hands with every one of the citizens in the town we brought along the chinaman and the cuckoo clock and buckle and the instructor with us from denver and they made the cabin seem like home at once never believe it when they tell you riches don t bring happiness if you could have seen old mack sitting in his rocking chair with his blue yarn sock feet up in the window and absorbing in that buckle stuff through his specs you d have seen a picture of content that would have made rockefeller jealous and i was learning to pick out old zip coon on the banjo and the cuckoo was on time with his remarks and ah sing was messing up the atmosphere with the handsomest smell of ham and eggs that ever laid the honeysuckle in the shade when it got too dark to make out buckle s nonsense and the notes in the instructor me and mack would light our pipes and talk about science and pearl diving and sciatica and egypt and spelling and fish and trade winds and leather and gratitude and eagles and a lot of subjects that we d never had time to explain our sentiments about before one evening mack spoke up and asked me if i was much apprised in the habits and policies of women folks why yes says i in a tone of voice i know em from alfred to omaha the feminine nature and similitude says i is as plain to my sight as the rocky mountains is to a blue eyed burro i m onto all their little side steps and punctual discrepancies i tell you andy says mack with a kind of sigh i never had the least amount of intersection with their predispositions maybe i might have had a proneness in respect to their vicinity but i never took the time i made my own living since i was fourteen and i never seemed to get my ratiocinations equipped with the sentiments usually depicted toward the sect i sometimes wish i had says old mack they re an adverse study says i and adapted to points of view although they vary in rationale i have found em quite often obviously differing from each other in divergences of contrast it seems to me goes on mack that a man had better take em in and secure his inspirations of the sect when he s young and so preordained i let my chance go by and i guess i m too old now to go hopping into the curriculum oh i don t know i tells him maybe you better credit yourself with a barrel of money and a lot of emancipation from a quantity of uncontent still i don t regret my knowledge of em i says it takes a man who understands the symptoms and by plays of women folks to take care of himself in this world we stayed on in pina because we liked the place some folks might enjoy their money with noise and rapture and locomotion but me and mack we had had plenty of turmoils and hotel towels the people were friendly ah sing got the swing of the grub we liked mack and buckle were as thick as two body snatchers and i was hitting out a cordial resemblance to buffalo gals can t you come out to night on the banjo one day i got a telegram from speight the man that was working on a mine i had an interest in out in new mexico i had to go out there and i was gone two months i was anxious to get back to pina and enjoy life once more when i struck the cabin i nearly fainted mack was standing in the door and if angels ever wept i saw no reason why they should be smiling then that man was a spectacle yes he was worse he was a spyglass he was the great telescope in the lick observatory he had on a coat and shiny shoes and a white vest and a high silk hat and a geranium as big as an order of spinach was spiked onto his front and he was smirking and warping his face like an infernal storekeeper or a kid with colic hello andy says mack out of his face glad to see you back things have happened since you went away i know it says i and a sacrilegious sight it is god never made you that way mack lonsbury why do you scarify his works with this presumptuous kind of ribaldry why andy says he they ve elected me justice of the peace since you left i looked at mack close he was restless and inspired a justice of the peace ought to be disconsolate and assuaged just then a young woman passed on the sidewalk and i saw mack kind of half snicker and blush and then he raised up his hat and smiled and bowed and she smiled and bowed and went on by no hope for you says i if you ve got the mary jane infirmity at your age i thought it wasn t going to take on you and patent leather shoes all this in two little short months i m going to marry the young lady who just passed to night says mack in a kind of flutter i forgot something at the post office says i and walked away quick i overtook that young woman a hundred yards away i raised my hat and told her my name she was about nineteen and young for her age she blushed and then looked at me cool like i was the snow scene from the two orphans i understand you are to be married to night i said correct says she you got any objections listen sissy i begins my name is miss rebosa redd says she in a pained way i know it says i now rebosa i m old enough to have owed money to your father and that old specious dressed up garbled sea sick ptomaine prancing about avidiously like an irremediable turkey gobbler with patent leather shoes on is my best friend why did you go and get him invested in this marriage business why he was the only chance there was answers miss rebosa nay says i giving a sickening look of admiration at her complexion and style of features with your beauty you might pick any kind of a man listen rebosa old mack ain t the man you want he was twenty two when you was n e reed as the papers say this bursting into bloom won t last with him he s all ventilated with oldness and rectitude and decay old mack s down with a case of indian summer he overlooked his bet when he was young and now he s suing nature for the interest on the promissory note he took from cupid instead of the cash rebosa are you bent on having this marriage occur why sure i am says she oscillating the pansies on her hat and so is somebody else i reckon what time is it to take place i asks at six o clock says she i made up my mind right away what to do i d save old mack if i could to have a good seasoned ineligible man like that turn chicken for a girl that hadn t quit eating slate pencils and buttoning in the back was more than i could look on with easiness rebosa says i earnest drawing upon my display of knowledge concerning the feminine intuitions of reason ain t there a young man in pina a nice young man that you think a heap of yep says rebosa nodding her pansies sure there is what do you think gracious does he like you i asks how does he stand in the matter crazy says rebosa ma has to wet down the front steps to keep him from sitting there all the time but i guess that ll be all over after to night she winds up with a sigh rebosa says i you don t really experience any of this adoration called love for old mack do you lord no says the girl shaking her head i think he s as dry as a lava bed the idea who is this young man that you like rebosa i inquires it s eddie bayles says she he clerks in crosby s grocery but he don t make but thirty five a month ella noakes was wild about him once old mack tells me i says that he s going to marry you at six o clock this evening that s the time says she it s to be at our house rebosa says i listen to me if eddie bayles had a thousand dollars cash a thousand dollars mind you would buy him a store of his own if you and eddie had that much to excuse matrimony on would you consent to marry him this evening at five o clock the girl looks at me a minute and i can see these inaudible cogitations going on inside of her as women will a thousand dollars says she of course i would come on says i we ll go and see eddie we went up to crosby s store and called eddie outside he looked to be estimable and freckled and he had chills and fever when i made my proposition at five o clock says he for a thousand dollars please don t wake me up well you are the rich uncle retired from the spice business in india i ll buy out old crosby and run the store myself we went inside and got old man crosby apart and explained it i wrote my check for a thousand dollars and handed it to him if eddie and rebosa married each other at five he was to turn the money over to them and then i gave em my blessing and went to wander in the wildwood for a season i sat on a log and made cogitations on life and old age and the zodiac and the ways of women and all the disorder that goes with a lifetime i passed myself congratulations that i had probably saved my old friend mack from his attack of indian summer i knew when he got well of it and shed his infatuation and his patent leather shoes he would feel grateful to keep old mack disinvolved thinks i from relapses like this is worth more than a thousand dollars and most of all i was glad that i d made a study of women and wasn t to be deceived any by their means of conceit and evolution it must have been half past five when i got back home i stepped in and there sat old mack on the back of his neck in his old clothes with his blue socks on the window and the history of civilisation propped up on his knees this don t look like getting ready for a wedding at six i says to seem innocent oh says mack reaching for his tobacco that was postponed back to five o clock they sent me over a note saying the hour had been changed it s all over now what made you stay away so long andy you heard about the wedding i asks i operated it says he i told you i was justice of the peace the preacher is off east to visit his folks and i m the only one in town that can perform the dispensations of marriage i promised eddie and rebosa a month ago i d marry em he s a busy lad and he ll have a grocery of his own some day he will says i there was lots of women at the wedding says mack smoking up but i didn t seem to get any ideas from em i wish i was informed in the structure of their attainments like you said you was that was two months ago says i reaching up for the banjo telemachus friend returning from a hunting trip i waited at the little town of los pinos in new mexico for the south bound train which was one hour late i sat on the porch of the summit house and discussed the functions of life with telemachus hicks the hotel proprietor perceiving that personalities were not out of order i asked him what species of beast had long ago twisted and mutilated his left ear being a hunter i was concerned in the evils that may befall one in the pursuit of game that ear says hicks is the relic of true friendship an accident i persisted no friendship is an accident said telemachus and i was silent the only perfect case of true friendship i ever knew went on my host was a cordial intent between a connecticut man and a monkey the monkey climbed palms in barranquilla and threw down cocoanuts to the man the man sawed them in two and made dippers which he sold for two reales each and bought rum the monkey drank the milk of the nuts through each being satisfied with his own share of the graft they lived like brothers but in the case of human beings friendship is a transitory art subject to discontinuance without further notice i had a friend once of the entitlement of paisley fish that i imagined was sealed to me for an endless space of time side by side for seven years we had mined ranched sold patent churns herded sheep took photographs and other things built wire fences and picked prunes thinks i neither homocide nor flattery nor riches nor sophistry nor drink can make trouble between me and paisley fish we was friends an amount you could hardly guess at we was friends in business and we let our amicable qualities lap over and season our hours of recreation and folly we certainly had days of damon and nights of pythias one summer me and paisley gallops down into these san andres mountains for the purpose of a month s surcease and levity dressed in the natural store habiliments of man we hit this town of los pinos which certainly was a roof garden spot of the world and flowing with condensed milk and honey it had a street or two and air and hens and a eating house and that was enough for us we strikes the town after supper time and we concludes to sample whatever efficacy there is in this eating house down by the railroad tracks by the time we had set down and pried up our plates with a knife from the red oil cloth along intrudes widow jessup with the hot biscuit and the fried liver now there was a woman that would have tempted an anchovy to forget his vows she was not so small as she was large and a kind of welcome air seemed to mitigate her vicinity the pink of her face was the in hoc signo of a culinary temper and a warm disposition and her smile would have brought out the dogwood blossoms in december widow jessup talks to us a lot of garrulousness about the climate and history and tennyson and prunes and the scarcity of mutton and finally wants to know where we came from spring valley says i big spring valley chips in paisley out of a lot of potatoes and knuckle bone of ham in his mouth that was the first sign i noticed that the old fidus diogenes business between me and paisley fish was ended forever he knew how i hated a talkative person and yet he stampedes into the conversation with his amendments and addendums of syntax on the map it was big spring valley but i had heard paisley himself call it spring valley a thousand times without saying any more we went out after supper and set on the railroad track we had been pardners too long not to know what was going on in each other s mind i reckon you understand says paisley that i ve made up my mind to accrue that widow woman as part and parcel in and to my hereditaments forever both domestic sociable legal and otherwise until death us do part why yes says i i read it between the lines though you only spoke one and i suppose you are aware says i that i have a movement on foot that leads up to the widow s changing her name to hicks and leaves you writing to the society column to inquire whether the best man wears a japonica or seamless socks at the wedding there ll be some hiatuses in your program says paisley chewing up a piece of a railroad tie i d give in to you says he in most any respect if it was secular affairs but this is not so the smiles of woman goes on paisley is the whirlpool of squills and chalybeates into which vortex the good ship friendship is often drawn and dismembered i d assault a bear that was annoying you says paisley or i d endorse your note or rub the place between your shoulder blades with opodeldoc the same as ever but there my sense of etiquette ceases in this fracas with mrs jessup we play it alone i ve notified you fair and then i collaborates with myself and offers the following resolutions and by laws friendship between man and man says i is an ancient historical virtue enacted in the days when men had to protect each other against lizards with eighty foot tails and flying turtles and they ve kept up the habit to this day and stand by each other till the bellboy comes up and tells them the animals are not really there i ve often heard i says about ladies stepping in and breaking up a friendship between men why should that be i ll tell you paisley the first sight and hot biscuit of mrs jessup appears to have inserted a oscillation into each of our bosoms let the best man of us have her i ll play you a square game and won t do any underhanded work i ll do all of my courting of her in your presence so you will have an equal opportunity with that arrangement i don t see why our steamboat of friendship should fall overboard in the medicinal whirlpools you speak of whichever of us wins out good old hoss says paisley shaking my hand and i ll do the same says he we ll court the lady synonymously and without any of the prudery and bloodshed usual to such occasions and we ll be friends still win or lose at one side of mrs jessup s eating house was a bench under some trees where she used to sit in the breeze after the south bound had been fed and gone and there me and paisley used to congregate after supper and make partial payments on our respects to the lady of our choice and we was so honorable and circuitous in our calls that if one of us got there first we waited for the other before beginning any gallivantery the first evening that mrs jessup knew about our arrangement i got to the bench before paisley did supper was just over and mrs jessup was out there with a fresh pink dress on and almost cool enough to handle i sat down by her and made a few specifications about the moral surface of nature as set forth by the landscape and the contiguous perspective that evening was surely a case in point the moon was attending to business in the section of sky where it belonged and the trees was making shadows on the ground according to science and nature and there was a kind of conspicuous hullabaloo going on in the bushes between the bullbats and the orioles and the jack rabbits and other feathered insects of the forest and the wind out of the mountains was singing like a jew s harp in the pile of old tomato cans by the railroad track i felt a kind of sensation in my left side something like dough rising in a crock by the fire mrs jessup had moved up closer oh mr hicks says she when one is alone in the world don t they feel it more aggravated on a beautiful night like this i rose up off the bench at once excuse me ma am says i but i ll have to wait till paisley comes before i can give a audible hearing to leading questions like that and then i explained to her how we was friends cinctured by years of embarrassment and travel and complicity and how we had agreed to take no advantage of each other in any of the more mushy walks of life such as might be fomented by sentiment and proximity mrs jessup appears to think serious about the matter for a minute and then she breaks into a species of laughter that makes the wildwood resound in a few minutes paisley drops around with oil of bergamot on his hair and sits on the other side of mrs jessup and inaugurates a sad tale of adventure in which him and pieface lumley has a skinning match of dead cows in for a silver mounted saddle in the santa rita valley during the nine months drought now from the start of that courtship i had paisley fish hobbled and tied to a post each one of us had a different system of reaching out for the easy places in the female heart paisley s scheme was to petrify em with wonderful relations of events that he had either come across personally or in large print i think he must have got his idea of subjugation from one of shakespeare s shows i see once called othello there is a coloured man in it who acquires a duke s daughter by disbursing to her a mixture of the talk turned out by rider haggard lew dockstader and dr parkhurst but that style of courting don t work well off the stage now i give you my own recipe for inveigling a woman into that state of affairs when she can be referred to as n e jones learn how to pick up her hand and hold it and she s yours it ain t so easy some men grab at it so much like they was going to set a dislocation of the shoulder that you can smell the arnica and hear em tearing off bandages some take it up like a hot horseshoe and hold it off at arm s length like a druggist pouring tincture of asafoetida in a bottle and most of em catch hold of it and drag it right out before the lady s eyes like a boy finding a baseball in the grass without giving her a chance to forget that the hand is growing on the end of her arm them ways are all wrong i ll tell you the right way did you ever see a man sneak out in the back yard and pick up a rock to throw at a tomcat that was sitting on a fence looking at him he pretends he hasn t got a thing in his hand and that the cat don t see him and that he don t see the cat that s the idea never drag her hand out where she ll have to take notice of it don t let her know that you think she knows you have the least idea she is aware you are holding her hand that was my rule of tactics and as far as paisley s serenade about hostilities and misadventure went he might as well have been reading to her a time table of the sunday trains that stop at ocean grove new jersey one night when i beat paisley to the bench by one pipeful my friendship gets subsidised for a minute and i asks mrs jessup if she didn t think a h was easier to write than a j in a second her head was mashing the oleander flower in my button hole and i leaned over and but i didn t if you don t mind says i standing up we ll wait for paisley to come before finishing this i ve never done anything dishonourable yet to our friendship and this won t be quite fair mr hicks says mrs jessup looking at me peculiar in the dark if it wasn t for but one thing i d ask you to hike yourself down the gulch and never disresume your visits to my house and what is that ma am i asks you are too good a friend not to make a good husband says she in five minutes paisley was on his side of mrs jessup in silver city in the summer of he begins i see jim batholomew chew off a chinaman s ear in the blue light saloon on account of a crossbarred muslin shirt that what was that noise i had resumed matters again with mrs jessup right where we had left off mrs jessup says i has promised to make it hicks and this is another of the same sort paisley winds his feet round a leg of the bench and kind of groans lem says he we been friends for seven years would you mind not kissing mrs jessup quite so loud i d do the same for you all right says i the other kind will do as well this chinaman goes on paisley was the one that shot a man named mullins in the spring of and that was paisley interrupted himself again lem says he if you was a true friend you wouldn t hug mrs jessup quite so hard i felt the bench shake all over just then you know you told me you would give me an even chance as long as there was any mr man says mrs jessup turning around to paisley if you was to drop in to the celebration of mine and mr hicks s silver wedding twenty five years from now do you think you could get it into that hubbard squash you call your head that you are nix cum rous in this business i ve put up with you a long time because you was mr hicks s friend but it seems to me it s time for you to wear the willow and trot off down the hill mrs jessup says i without losing my grasp on the situation as fiance mr paisley is my friend and i offered him a square deal and a equal opportunity as long as there was a chance a chance says she well he may think he has a chance but i hope he won t think he s got a cinch after what he s been next to all the evening well a month afterwards me and mrs jessup was married in the los pinos methodist church and the whole town closed up to see the performance when we lined up in front and the preacher was beginning to sing out his rituals and observances i looks around and misses paisley i calls time on the preacher paisley ain t here says i we ve got to wait for paisley a friend once a friend always that s telemachus hicks says i mrs jessup s eyes snapped some but the preacher holds up the incantations according to instructions in a few minutes paisley gallops up the aisle putting on a cuff as he comes he explains that the only dry goods store in town was closed for the wedding and he couldn t get the kind of a boiled shirt that his taste called for until he had broke open the back window of the store and helped himself then he ranges up on the other side of the bride and the wedding goes on i always imagined that paisley calculated as a last chance that the preacher might marry him to the widow by mistake after the proceedings was over we had tea and jerked antelope and canned apricots and then the populace hiked itself away last of all paisley shook me by the hand and told me i d acted square and on the level with him and he was proud to call me a friend the preacher had a small house on the side of the street that he d fixed up to rent and he allowed me and mrs hicks to occupy it till the ten forty train the next morning when we was going on a bridal tour to el paso his wife had decorated it all up with hollyhocks and poison ivy and it looked real festal and bowery about ten o clock that night i sets down in the front door and pulls off my boots a while in the cool breeze while mrs hicks was fixing around in the room right soon the light went out inside and i sat there a while reverberating over old times and scenes and then i heard mrs hicks call out ain t you coming in soon lem well well says i kind of rousing up durn me if i wasn t waiting for old paisley to but when i got that far concluded telemachus hicks i thought somebody had shot this left ear of mine off with a forty five but it turned out to be only a lick from a broomhandle in the hands of mrs hicks the handbook of hymen tis the opinion of myself sanderson pratt who sets this down that the educational system of the united states should be in the hands of the weather bureau i can give you good reasons for it and you can t tell me why our college professors shouldn t be transferred to the meteorological department they have been learned to read and they could very easily glance at the morning papers and then wire in to the main office what kind of weather to expect but there s the other side of the proposition i am going on to tell you how the weather furnished me and idaho green with an elegant education we was up in the bitter root mountains over the montana line prospecting for gold a chin whiskered man in walla walla carrying a line of hope as excess baggage had grubstaked us and there we was in the foothills pecking away with enough grub on hand to last an army through a peace conference along one day comes a mail rider over the mountains from carlos and stops to eat three cans of greengages and leave us a newspaper of modern date this paper prints a system of premonitions of the weather and the card it dealt bitter root mountains from the bottom of the deck was warmer and fair with light westerly breezes that evening it began to snow with the wind strong in the east me and idaho moved camp into an old empty cabin higher up the mountain thinking it was only a november flurry but after falling three foot on a level it went to work in earnest and we knew we was snowed in we got in plenty of firewood before it got deep and we had grub enough for two months so we let the elements rage and cut up all they thought proper if you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in a eighteen by twenty foot cabin for a month human nature won t stand it when the first snowflakes fell me and idaho green laughed at each other s jokes and praised the stuff we turned out of a skillet and called bread at the end of three weeks idaho makes this kind of a edict to me says he i never exactly heard sour milk dropping out of a balloon on the bottom of a tin pan but i have an idea it would be music of the spears compared to this attenuated stream of asphyxiated thought that emanates out of your organs of conversation the kind of half masticated noises that you emit every day puts me in mind of a cow s cud only she s lady enough to keep hers to herself and you ain t mr green says i you having been a friend of mine once i have some hesitations in confessing to you that if i had my choice for society between you and a common yellow three legged cur pup one of the inmates of this here cabin would be wagging a tail just at present this way we goes on for two or three days and then we quits speaking to one another we divides up the cooking implements and idaho cooks his grub on one side of the fireplace and me on the other the snow is up to the windows and we have to keep a fire all day you see me and idaho never had any education beyond reading and doing if john had three apples and james five on a slate we never felt any special need for a university degree though we had acquired a species of intrinsic intelligence in knocking around the world that we could use in emergencies but snowbound in that cabin in the bitter roots we felt for the first time that if we had studied homer or greek and fractions and the higher branches of information we d have had some resources in the line of meditation and private thought i ve seen them eastern college fellows working in camps all through the west and i never noticed but what education was less of a drawback to em than you would think why once over on snake river when andrew mcwilliams saddle horse got the botts he sent a buckboard ten miles for one of these strangers that claimed to be a botanist but that horse died one morning idaho was poking around with a stick on top of a little shelf that was too high to reach two books fell down to the floor i started toward em but caught idaho s eye he speaks for the first time in a week don t burn your fingers says he in spite of the fact that you re only fit to be the companion of a sleeping mud turtle i ll give you a square deal and that s more than your parents did when they turned you loose in the world with the sociability of a rattle snake and the bedside manner of a frozen turnip i ll play you a game of seven up the winner to pick up his choice of the book the loser to take the other we played and idaho won he picked up his book and i took mine then each of us got on his side of the house and went to reading i never was as glad to see a ten ounce nugget as i was that book and idaho took at his like a kid looks at a stick of candy mine was a little book about five by six inches called herkimer s handbook of indispensable information i may be wrong but i think that was the greatest book that ever was written i ve got it to day and i can stump you or any man fifty times in five minutes with the information in it talk about solomon or the new york tribune herkimer had cases on both of em that man must have put in fifty years and travelled a million miles to find out all that stuff there was the population of all cities in it and the way to tell a girl s age and the number of teeth a camel has it told you the longest tunnel in the world the number of the stars how long it takes for chicken pox to break out what a lady s neck ought to measure the veto powers of governors the dates of the roman aqueducts how many pounds of rice going without three beers a day would buy the average annual temperature of augusta maine the quantity of seed required to plant an acre of carrots in drills antidotes for poisons the number of hairs on a blond lady s head how to preserve eggs the height of all the mountains in the world and the dates of all wars and battles and how to restore drowned persons and sunstroke and the number of tacks in a pound and how to make dynamite and flowers and beds and what to do before the doctor comes and a hundred times as many things besides if there was anything herkimer didn t know i didn t miss it out of the book i sat and read that book for four hours all the wonders of education was compressed in it

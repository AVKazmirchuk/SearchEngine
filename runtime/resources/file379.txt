ready for the same journey all this merely to hint that the big ex republic of the southwest forms a sizable star on the flag and to prepare for the corollary that things sometimes happen there uncut to pattern and unfettered by metes and bounds the commissioner of insurance statistics and history of the state of texas was an official of no very great or very small importance the past tense is used for now he is commissioner of insurance alone statistic and history are no longer proper nouns in the government records in the year the governor appointed luke coonrod standifer to be the head of this department standifer was then fifty five years of age and a texan to the core his father had been one of the state s earliest settlers and pioneers standifer himself had served the commonwealth as indian fighter soldier ranger and legislator much learning he did not claim but he had drank pretty deep of the spring of experience if other grounds were less abundant texas should be well up in the lists of glory as the grateful republic for both as republic and state it has busily heaped honours and solid rewards upon its sons who rescued it from the wilderness wherefore and therefore luke coonrod standifer son of ezra standifer ex terry ranger simon pure democrat and lucky dweller in an unrepresented portion of the politico geographical map was appointed commissioner of insurance statistics and history standifer accepted the honour with some doubt as to the nature of the office he was to fill and his capacity for filling it but he accepted and by wire he immediately set out from the little country town where he maintained and was scarcely maintained by a somnolent and unfruitful office of surveying and map drawing before departing he had looked up under the i s s s and h s in the encyclopaedia britannica what information and preparation toward his official duties that those weighty volumes afforded a few weeks of incumbency diminished the new commissioner s awe of the great and important office he had been called upon to conduct an increasing familiarity with its workings soon restored him to his accustomed placid course of life in his office was an old spectacled clerk a consecrated informed able machine who held his desk regardless of changes of administrative heads old kauffman instructed his new chief gradually in the knowledge of the department without seeming to do so and kept the wheels revolving without the slip of a cog indeed the department of insurance statistics and history carried no great heft of the burden of state its main work was the regulating of the business done in the state by foreign insurance companies and the letter of the law was its guide as for statistics well you wrote letters to county officers and scissored other people s reports and each year you got out a report of your own about the corn crop and the cotton crop and pecans and pigs and black and white population and a great many columns of figures headed bushels and acres and square miles etc and there you were history the branch was purely a receptive one old ladies interested in the science bothered you some with long reports of proceedings of their historical societies some twenty or thirty people would write you each year that they had secured sam houston s pocket knife or santa ana s whisky flask or davy crockett s rifle all absolutely authenticated and demanded legislative appropriation to purchase most of the work in the history branch went into pigeon holes one sizzling august afternoon the commissioner reclined in his office chair with his feet upon the long official table covered with green billiard cloth the commissioner was smoking a cigar and dreamily regarding the quivering landscape framed by the window that looked upon the treeless capitol grounds perhaps he was thinking of the rough and ready life he had led of the old days of breathless adventure and movement of the comrades who now trod other paths or had ceased to tread any of the changes civilization and peace had brought and maybe complacently of the snug and comfortable camp pitched for him under the dome of the capitol of the state that had not forgotten his services the business of the department was lax insurance was easy statistics were not in demand history was dead old kauffman the efficient and perpetual clerk had requested an infrequent half holiday incited to the unusual dissipation by the joy of having successfully twisted the tail of a connecticut insurance company that was trying to do business contrary to the edicts of the great lone star state the office was very still a few subdued noises trickled in through the open door from the other departments a dull tinkling crash from the treasurer s office adjoining as a clerk tossed a bag of silver to the floor of the vault the vague intermittent clatter of a dilatory typewriter a dull tapping from the state geologist s quarters as if some woodpecker had flown in to bore for his prey in the cool of the massive building and then a faint rustle and the light shuffling of the well worn shoes along the hall the sounds ceasing at the door toward which the commissioner s lethargic back was presented following this the sound of a gentle voice speaking words unintelligible to the commissioner s somewhat dormant comprehension but giving evidence of bewilderment and hesitation the voice was feminine the commissioner was of the race of cavaliers who make salaam before the trail of a skirt without considering the quality of its cloth there stood in

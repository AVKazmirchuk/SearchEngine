crockery and lighten up the granite ware with persiflage i was second bookkeeper and if i failed to show up a balance sheet without something comic about the footings or could find no cause for laughter in an invoice of plows the other clerks were disappointed by degrees my fame spread and i became a local character our town was small enough to make this possible the daily newspaper quoted me at social gatherings i was indispensable i believe i did possess considerable wit and a facility for quick and spontaneous repartee this gift i cultivated and improved by practice and the nature of it was kindly and genial not running to sarcasm or offending others people began to smile when they saw me coming and by the time we had met i generally had the word ready to broaden the smile into a laugh i had married early we had a charming boy of three and a girl of five naturally we lived in a vine covered cottage and were happy my salary as bookkeeper in the hardware concern kept at a distance those ills attendant upon superfluous wealth at sundry times i had written out a few jokes and conceits that i considered peculiarly happy and had sent them to certain periodicals that print such things all of them had been instantly accepted several of the editors had written to request further contributions one day i received a letter from the editor of a famous weekly publication he suggested that i submit to him a humorous composition to fill a column of space hinting that he would make it a regular feature of each issue if the work proved satisfactory i did so and at the end of two weeks he offered to make a contract with me for a year at a figure that was considerably higher than the amount paid me by the hardware firm i was filled with delight my wife already crowned me in her mind with the imperishable evergreens of literary success we had lobster croquettes and a bottle of blackberry wine for supper that night here was the chance to liberate myself from drudgery i talked over the matter very seriously with louisa we agreed that i must resign my place at the store and devote myself to humor i resigned my fellow clerks gave me a farewell banquet the speech i made there coruscated it was printed in full by the gazette the next morning i awoke and looked at the clock late by george i exclaimed and grabbed for my clothes louisa reminded me that i was no longer a slave to hardware and contractors supplies i was now a professional humorist after breakfast she proudly led me to the little room off the kitchen dear girl there was my table and chair writing pad ink and pipe tray and all the author s trappings the celery stand full of fresh roses and honeysuckle last year s calendar on the wall the dictionary and a little bag of chocolates to nibble between inspirations dear girl i sat me to work the wall paper is patterned with arabesques or odalisks or perhaps it is trapezoids upon one of the figures i fixed my eyes i bethought me of humor a voice startled me louisa s voice if you aren t too busy dear it said come to dinner i looked at my watch yes five hours had been gathered in by the grim scytheman i went to dinner you mustn t work too hard at first said louisa goethe or was it napoleon said five hours a day is enough for mental labor couldn t you take me and the children to the woods this afternoon i am a little tired i admitted so we went to the woods but i soon got the swing of it within a month i was turning out copy as regular as shipments of hardware and i had success my column in the weekly made some stir and i was referred to in a gossipy way by the critics as something fresh in the line of humorists i augmented my income considerably by contributing to other publications i picked up the tricks of the trade i could take a funny idea and make a two line joke of it earning a dollar with false whiskers on it would serve up cold as a quatrain doubling its producing value by turning the skirt and adding a ruffle of rhyme you would hardly recognize it as vers de societe with neatly shod feet and a fashion plate illustration i began to save up money and we had new carpets and a parlor organ my townspeople began to look upon me as a citizen of some consequence instead of the merry trifier i had been when i clerked in the hardware store after five or six months the spontaniety seemed to depart from my humor quips and droll sayings no longer fell carelessly from my lips i was sometimes hard run for material i found myself listening to catch available ideas from the conversation of my friends sometimes i chewed my pencil and gazed at the wall paper for hours trying to build up some gay little bubble of unstudied fun and then i became a harpy a moloch a jonah a vampire to my acquaintances anxious haggard greedy i stood among them like a veritable killjoy let a bright saying a witty comparison a piquant phrase fall from their lips and i was after it like a hound springing upon a bone i dared not trust my memory but turning aside guiltily and meanly i would make a note of it in my ever present memorandum book or upon my cuff for my own future use my friends regarded me in sorrow and wonder i was not the same man where once i had furnished them entertainment and jollity i now preyed upon them no jests from

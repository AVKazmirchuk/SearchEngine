standifer said the treasurer soothingly you know i d like to help in this matter but stop and think a moment please every cent in the treasury is expended only by appropriation made by the legislature and drawn out by checks issued by the comptroller i can t control the use of a cent of it neither can you your department isn t disbursive it isn t even administrative it s purely clerical the only

are they not the titles and deeds and such things yes said sharp they are supposed to contain all the title papers this one now said the boy taking up bexar scrip no what land does this represent the title of ah i see six hundred and forty acres in b country absalom harris original grantee please tell me i am so ignorant of these things how can you tell a good survey from a bad one i am told that there are a great many illegal and fraudulent surveys in this office i suppose this one is all right no said sharp the certificate is missing it is invalid that paper i just saw you place in that file i suppose is something else field notes or a transfer probably yes said sharp hurriedly corrected field notes excuse me i am a little pressed for time the boy was watching him with bright alert eyes it would never do to leave the certificate in the file but he could not take it out with that inquisitive boy watching him he turned to the file room with a dozen or more files in his hands and accidentally dropped part of them on the floor as he stooped to pick them up he swiftly thrust bexar scrip no in the inside breast pocket of his coat this happened at just half past four o clock and when the file clerk took the files he threw them in a pile in his room came out and locked the door the clerks were moving out of the doors in long straggling lines it was closing time sharp did not desire to take the file from the land office the boy might have seen him place the file in his pocket and the penalty of the law for such an act was very severe some distance back from the file room was the draftsman s room now entirely vacated by its occupants sharp dropped behind the outgoing stream of men and slipped slyly into this room the clerks trooped noisily down the iron stairway singing whistling and talking below the night watchman awaited their exit ready to close and bar the two great doors to the south and cast it is his duty to take careful note each day that no one remains in the building after the hour of closing sharp waited until all sounds had ceased it was his intention to linger until everything was quiet and then to remove the certificate from the file and throw the latter carelessly on some draftsman s desk as if it had been left there during the business of the day he knew also that he must remove the certificate from the office or destroy it as the chance finding of it by a clerk would lead to its immediately being restored to its proper place and the consequent discovery that his location over the old survey was absolutely worthless as he moved cautiously along the stone floor the loud barking of the little black dog kept by the watchman told that his sharp ears had heard the sounds of his steps the great hollow rooms echoed loudly move as lightly as he could sharp sat down at a desk and laid the file before him in all his queer practices and cunning tricks he had not yet included any act that was downright criminal he had always kept on the safe side of the law but in the deed he was about to commit there was no compromise to be made with what little conscience he had left there is no well defined boundary line between honesty and dishonesty the frontiers of one blend with the outside limits of the other and he who attempts to tread this dangerous ground may be sometimes in one domain and sometimes in the other so the only safe road is the broad highway that leads straight through and has been well defined by line and compass sharp was a man of what is called high standing in the community that is his word in a trade was as good as any man s his check was as good as so much cash and so regarded he went to church regularly went in good society and owed no man anything he was regarded as a sure winner in any land trade he chose to make but that was his occupation the act he was about to commit now would place him forever in the ranks of those who chose evil for their portion if it was found out more than that it would rob a widow and her son of property soon to be of great value which if not legally theirs was theirs certainly by every claim of justice but he had gone too far to hesitate his own survey was in the patent room for patenting his own title was about to be perfected by the state s own hand the certificate must be destroyed he leaned his head on his hands for a moment and as he did so a sound behind him caused his heart to leap with guilty fear but before he could rise a hand came over his shoulder and grasped the file he rose quickly as white as paper rattling his chair loudly on the stone floor the boy who land spoken to him earlier stood contemplating him with contemptuous and flashing eyes and quietly placed the file in the left breast pocket of his coat so mr sharp by nature as well as by name he said it seems that i was right in waiting behind the door in order to see you safely out you will appreciate the pleasure i feel in having done so when i tell you my name is harris my mother owns the land on which you have filed and if there is any justice in texas she shall hold it i am not certain

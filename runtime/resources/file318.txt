woman s heart the next evening yvonne was at the well in the road where the young congregated in order that the cure might have business the corner of her eye was engaged in a search for david albeit her set mouth seemed unrelenting he saw the look braved the mouth drew from it a recantation and later a kiss as they walked homeward together three months afterwards they were married david s father was shrewd and prosperous he gave them a wedding that was heard of three leagues away both the young people were favourites in the village there was a procession in the streets a dance on the green they had the marionettes and a tumbler out from dreux to delight the guests then a year and david s father died the sheep and the cottage descended to him he already had the seemliest wife in the village yvonne s milk pails and her brass kettles were bright ouf they blinded you in the sun when you passed that way but you must keep your eyes upon her yard for her flower beds were so neat and gay they restored to you your sight and you might hear her sing aye as far as the double chestnut tree above pere gruneau s blacksmith forge but a day came when david drew out paper from a long shut drawer and began to bite the end of a pencil spring had come again and touched his heart poet he must have been for now yvonne was well nigh forgotten this fine new loveliness of earth held him with its witchery and grace the perfume from her woods and meadows stirred him strangely daily had he gone forth with his flock and brought it safe at night but now he stretched himself under the hedge and pieced words together on his bits of paper the sheep strayed and the wolves perceiving that difficult poems make easy mutton ventured from the woods and stole his lambs david s stock of poems grew longer and his flock smaller yvonne s nose and temper waxed sharp and her talk blunt her pans and kettles grew dull but her eyes had caught their flash she pointed out to the poet that his neglect was reducing the flock and bringing woe upon the household david hired a boy to guard the sheep locked himself in the little room at the top of the cottage and wrote more poems the boy being a poet by nature but not furnished with an outlet in the way of writing spent his time in slumber the wolves lost no time in discovering that poetry and sleep are practically the same so the flock steadily grew smaller yvonne s ill temper increased at an equal rate sometimes she would stand in the yard and rail at david through his high window then you could hear her as far as the double chestnut tree above pere gruneau s blacksmith forge m papineau the kind wise meddling old notary saw this as he saw everything at which his nose pointed he went to david fortified himself with a great pinch of snuff and said friend mignot i affixed the seal upon the marriage certificate of your father it would distress me to be obliged to attest a paper signifying the bankruptcy of his son but that is what you are coming to i speak as an old friend now listen to what i have to say you have your heart set i perceive upon poetry at dreux i have a friend one monsieur bril georges bril he lives in a little cleared space in a houseful of books he is a learned man he visits paris each year he himself has written books he will tell you when the catacombs were made how they found out the names of the stars and why the plover has a long bill the meaning and the form of poetry is to him as intelligent as the baa of a sheep is to you i will give you a letter to him and you shall take him your poems and let him read them then you will know if you shall write more or give your attention to your wife and business write the letter said david i am sorry you did not speak of this sooner at sunrise the next morning he was on the road to dreux with the precious roll of poems under his arm at noon he wiped the dust from his feet at the door of monsieur bril that learned man broke the seal of m papineau s letter and sucked up its contents through his gleaming spectacles as the sun draws water he took david inside to his study and sat him down upon a little island beat upon by a sea of books monsieur bril had a conscience he flinched not even at a mass of manuscript the thickness of a finger length and rolled to an incorrigible curve he broke the back of the roll against his knee and began to read he slighted nothing he bored into the lump as a worm into a nut seeking for a kernel meanwhile david sat marooned trembling in the spray of so much literature it roared in his ears he held no chart or compass for voyaging in that sea half the world he thought must be writing books monsieur bril bored to the last page of the poems then he took off his spectacles and wiped them with his handkerchief my old friend papineau is well he asked in the best of health said david how many sheep have you monsieur mignot three hundred and nine when i counted them yesterday the flock has had ill fortune to that number it has decreased from eight hundred and fifty you have a wife and home and lived in comfort the sheep brought you plenty you went into the fields with them

the venerable and scarcely suspecting victim of may in stalked miss van meeker constantia coulson bony durable tall high nosed frigid well bred thirty five in the neighbourhood of gramercy parkish she put up a lorgnette mrs widdup hastily stooped and arranged the bandages on mr coulson s gouty foot i thought higgins was with you said miss van meeker constantia higgins went out explained her father

weather is lovely isn t it daughter said the old man consciously conscious that s just it replied miss van meeker constantia coulson somewhat obscurely when does mrs wid dup start on her vacation papa i believe she said a week from to day said mr coulson miss van meeker constantia stood for a minute at the window gazing toward the little park flooded with the mellow afternoon sunlight with the eye of a botanist she viewed the flowers most potent weapons of insid ious may with the cool pulses of a virgin of cologne she withstood the attack of the ethereal mildness the arrows of the pleasant sunshine fell back frostbitten from the cold panoply of her unthrilled bosom the odour of the flowers waked no soft sentiments in the unexplored recesses of her dormant heart the chirp of the sparrows gave her a pain she mocked at may but although miss coulson was proof against the season she was keen enough to estimate its power she knew that elderly men and thick waisted women jumped as educated fleas in the ridiculous train of may the merry mocker of the months she had heard of foolish old gentlemen marrying their housekeepers before what a humiliating thing after all was this feeling called love the next morning at o clock when the iceman called the cook told him that miss coulson wanted to see him in the basement well ain t i the olcott and depew not mentioning the first name at all said the iceman admiringly of himself as a concession he rolled his sleeves down dropped his icehooks on a syringe and went back when miss van meeker constantia coulson addressed him he took off his bat there is a rear entrance to this basement said miss coulson which can be reached by driving into the vacant lot next door where they are excavating for a building i want you to bring in that way within two hours pounds of ice you may have to bring another man or two to help you i will show you where i want it placed i also want pounds a day delivered the same way for the next four days your company may charge the ice on our regular bill this is for your extra trouble miss coulson tendered a ten dollar bill the iceman bowed and held his hat in his two hands behind him not if you ll excuse me lady it ll be a pleasure to fix things up for you any way you please alas for may about noon mr coulson knocked two glasses off his table broke the spring of his bell and yelled for higgins at the same time bring an axe commanded mr coulson sardoni cally or send out for a quart of prussic acid or have a policeman come in and shoot me i d rather that than be frozen to death it does seem to be getting cool sir said higgins i hadn t noticed it before i ll close the window sir do said mr coulson they call this spring do they if it keeps up long i ll go back to palm beach house feels like a morgue later miss coulson dutifully came in to inquire how the gout was progressing stantia said the old man how is the weather out doors bright answered miss coulson but chilly feels like the dead of winter to me said mr coulson an instance said constantia gazing abstractedly out the window of winter lingering in the lap of spring though the metaphor is not in the most refined taste a little later she walked down by the side of the little park and on westward to broadway to accomplish a little shopping a little later than that mrs widdup entered the invalid s room did you ring sir she asked dimpling in many places i asked higgins to go to the drug store and i thought i heard your bell i did not said mr coulson i m afraid said mrs widdup i interrupted you sir yesterday when you were about

this house i am freezing to death in my own room and you come in and drivel to me about ivy and hand organs get me an overcoat at once see that all doors and windows are closed below an old fat irresponsible one sided object like you prat ing about springtime and flowers in the middle of winter when higgins comes back tell him to bring me a hot rum punch and now get out but who shall shame

its flight rising in his stirrups he released one foot and bestowed upon the mutinous animal a hearty kick the mule tottered and fell with a crash broadside upon the ground as we gathered around it it walled its great eyes almost humanly towards kearny and expired that was bad but worse to our minds was the concomitant disaster part of the mule s burden had been one hundred pounds of the finest coffee to be had in the tropics the bag burst and spilled the priceless brown mass of the ground berries among the dense vines and weeds of the swampy land mala suerte when you take away from an esperandan his coffee you abstract his patriotism and per cent of his value as a soldier the men began to rake up the precious stuff but i beckoned kearny back along the trail where they would not hear the limit had been reached i took from my pocket a wallet of money and drew out some bills mr kearny said i here are some funds belonging to don rafael valdevia which i am expending in his cause i know of no better service it can buy for him that this here is one hundred dollars luck or no luck we part company here star or no star calamity seems to travel by your side you will return to the steamer she touches at amotapa to discharge her lumber and iron and then puts back to new orleans hand this note to the sailing master who will give you passage i wrote on a leaf torn from my book and placed it and the money in kearny s hand good bye i said extending my own it is not that i am displeased with you but there is no place in this expedition for let us say the senorita phoebe i said this with a smile trying to smooth the thing for him may you have better luck companero kearny took the money and the paper it was just a little touch said he just a little lift with the toe of my boot but what s the odds that blamed mule would have died if i had only dusted his ribs with a powder puff it was my luck well captain i would have liked to be in that little fight with you over in aguas frias success to the cause adios he turned around and set off down the trail without looking back the unfortunate mule s pack saddle was transferred to kearny s pony and we again took up the march four days we journeyed over the foot hills and mountains fording icy torrents winding around the crumbling brows of ragged peaks creeping along rocky flanges that overlooked awful precipices crawling breathlessly over tottering bridges that crossed bottomless chasms on the evening of the seventeenth we camped by a little stream on the bare hills five miles from aguas frias at daybreak we were to take up the march again at midnight i was standing outside my tent inhaling the fresh cold air the stars were shining bright in the cloudless sky giving the heavens their proper aspect of illimitable depth and distance when viewed from the vague darkness of the blotted earth almost at its zenith was the planet saturn and with a half smile i observed the sinister red sparkle of his malignant attendant the demon star of kearny s ill luck and then my thoughts strayed across the hills to the scene of our coming triumph where the heroic and noble don rafael awaited our coming to set a new and shining star in the firmament of nations i heard a slight rustling in the deep grass to my right i turned and saw kearny coming toward me he was ragged and dew drenched and limping his hat and one boot were gone about one foot he had tied some makeshift of cloth and grass but his manner as he approached was that of a man who knows his own virtues well enough to be superior to rebuffs well sir i said staring at him coldly if there is anything in persistence i see no reason why you should not succeed in wrecking and ruining us yet i kept half a day s journey behind said kearny fishing out a stone from the covering of his lame foot so the bad luck wouldn t touch you i couldn t help it captain i wanted to be in on this game it was a pretty tough trip especially in the department of the commissary in the low grounds there were always bananas and oranges higher up it was worse but your men left a good deal of goat meat hanging on the bushes in the camps here s your hundred dollars you re nearly there now captain let me in on the scrapping to morrow not for a hundred times a hundred would i have the tiniest thing go wrong with my plans now i said whether caused by evil planets or the blunders of mere man but yonder is aguas frias five miles away and a clear road i am of the mind to defy saturn and all his satellites to spoil our success now at any rate i will not turn away to night as weary a traveller and as good a soldier as you are lieutenant kearny manuel ortiz s tent is there by the brightest fire rout him out and tell him to supply you with food and blankets and clothes we march again at daybreak kearny thanked me briefly but feelingly and moved away he had gone scarcely a dozen steps when a sudden flash of bright light illumined the surrounding hills a sinister growing hissing sound like escaping steam filled my ears then followed a roar as of distant thunder which grew louder every instant this terrifying noise culminated in a tremendous explosion which seemed to rock the hills

conceive that you have dined during that interval at some one of the thousands of establishments provided for that purpose that do not receive literary advertisement it may suppose for aught i care that you have gone fasting thank you said van sweller rather coolly you are hardly courteous but take care it is at your own risk that you attempt to disregard a fundamental principle in metropolitan fiction one that is dear alike to author and reader i shall of course attend to my duty when it comes time to rescue your heroine but i warn you that it will be your loss if you fail to send me to night to dine at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i will take the consequences if there are to be any i replied i am not yet come to be sandwich man for an eating house i walked over to a table where i had left my cane and gloves i heard the whirr of the alarm in the cab below and i turned quickly van sweller was gone i rushed down the stairs and out to the curb an empty hansom was just passing i hailed the driver excitedly see that auto cab halfway down the block i shouted follow it don t lose sight of it for an instant and i will give you two dollars if i only had been one of the characters in my story instead of myself i could easily have offered or or even but was all i felt justified in expending with fiction at its present rates the cab driver instead of lashing his animal into a foam proceeded at a deliberate trot that suggested a by the hour arrangement but i suspected van sweller s design and when we lost sight of his cab i ordered my driver to proceed at once to see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i found van sweller at a table under a palm just glancing over the menu with a hopeful waiter hovering at his elbow come with me i said inexorably you will not give me the slip again under my eye you shall remain until van sweller countermanded the order for his dinner and arose to accompany me he could scarcely do less a fictitious character is but poorly equipped for resisting a hungry but live author who comes to drag him forth from a restaurant all he said was you were just in time but i think you are making a mistake you cannot afford to ignore the wishes of the great reading public i took van sweller to my own rooms to my room he had never seen anything like it before sit on that trunk i said to him while i observe whether the landlady is stalking us if she is not i will get things at a delicatessen store below and cook something for you in a pan over the gas jet it will not be so bad of course nothing of this will appear in the story jove old man said van sweller looking about him with interest this is a jolly little closet you live in where the devil do you sleep oh that pulls down and i say what is this under the corner of the carpet oh a frying pan i see clever idea fancy cooking over the gas what larks it will be think of anything you could eat i asked try a chop or what anything said van sweller enthusiastically except a grilled bone two weeks afterward the postman brought me a large fat envelope i opened it and took out something that i had seen before and this typewritten letter from a magazine that encourages society fiction your short story the badge of policeman o roon is herewith returned we are sorry that it has been unfavorably passed upon but it seems to lack in some of the essential requirements of our publication the story is splendidly constructed its style is strong and inimitable and its action and character drawing deserve the highest praise as a story per se it has merit beyond anything that we have read for some time but as we have said it fails to come up to some of the standards we have set could you not re write the story and inject into it the social atmosphere and return it to us for further consideration it is suggested to you that you have the hero van sweller drop in for luncheon or dinner once or twice at

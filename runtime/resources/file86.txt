acrimony you said there would be a rifle a fellow can t even smoke i wish i was at home cherokee drove his sleigh to the door and they lifted bobby in beside him the team of fine horses sprang away prancingly over the hard snow cherokee had on his overcoat of baby sealskin the laprobe that he drew about them was as warm as velvet bobby slipped a cigarette from his pocket and was trying to snap a match throw that cigarette away said cherokee in a quiet but new voice bobby hesitated and then dropped the cylinder overboard throw the box too commanded the new voice more reluctantly the boy obeyed

watch half past nine we ll hit the junction plumb on time with christmas day are you cold sit closer son a chaparral prince nine o clock at last and the drudging toil of the day was ended lena climbed to her room in the third half story of the quarrymen s hotel since daylight she had slaved doing the work of a full grown woman scrubbing the floors washing the heavy ironstone plates and cups making the beds and supplying the insatiate demands for wood and water in that turbulent and depressing hostelry the din of the day s quarrying was over the blasting and drilling the creaking of the great cranes the shouts of the foremen the backing and shifting of the flat cars hauling the heavy blocks of limestone down in the hotel office three or four of the labourers were growling and swearing over a belated game of checkers heavy odours of stewed meat hot grease and cheap coffee hung like a depressing fog about the house lena lit the stump of a candle and sat limply upon her wooden chair she was eleven years old thin and ill nourished her back and limbs were sore and aching but the ache in her heart made the biggest trouble the last straw had been added to the burden upon her small shoulders they had taken away grimm always at night however tired she might be she had turned to grimm for comfort and hope each time had grimm whispered to her that the prince or the fairy would come and deliver her out of the wicked enchantment every night she had taken fresh courage and strength from grimm to whatever tale she read she found an analogy in her own condition the woodcutter s lost child the unhappy goose girl the persecuted stepdaughter the little maiden imprisoned in the witch s hut all these were but transparent disguises for lena the overworked kitchenmaid in the quarrymen s hotel and always when the extremity was direst came the good fairy or the gallant prince to the rescue so here in the ogre s castle enslaved by a wicked spell lena had leaned upon grimm and waited longing for the powers of goodness to prevail but on the day before mrs maloney had found the book in her room and had carried it away declaring sharply that it would not do for servants to read at night they lost sleep and did not work briskly the next day can one only eleven years old living away from one s mamma and never having any time to play live entirely deprived of grimm just try it once and you will see what a difficult thing it is lena s home was in texas away up among the little mountains on the pedernales river in a little town called fredericksburg they are all german people who live in fredericksburg of evenings they sit at little tables along the sidewalk and drink beer and play pinochle and scat they are very thrifty people thriftiest among them was peter hildesmuller lena s father and that is why lena was sent to work in the hotel at the quarries thirty miles away she earned three dollars every week there and peter added her wages to his well guarded store peter had an ambition to become as rich as his neighbour hugo heffelbauer who smoked a meerschaum pipe three feet long and had wiener schnitzel and hassenpfeffer for dinner every day in the week and now lena was quite old enough to work and assist in the accumulation of riches but conjecture if you can what it means to be sentenced at eleven years of age from a home in the pleasant little rhine village to hard labour in the ogre s castle where you must fly to serve the ogres while they devour cattle and sheep growling fiercely as they stamp white limestone dust from their great shoes for you to sweep and scour with your weak aching fingers and then to have grimm taken away from you lena raised the lid of an old empty case that had once contained canned corn and got out a sheet of paper and a piece of pencil she was going to write a letter to her mamma tommy ryan was going to post it for her at ballinger s tommy was seventeen worked in the quarries went home to ballinger s every night and was now waiting in the shadows under lena s window for her to throw the letter out to him that was the only way she could send a letter to fredericksburg mrs maloney did not like for her to write letters the stump of the candle was burning low so lena hastily bit the wood from around the lead of her pencil and began this is the letter she wrote dearest mamma i want so much to see you and gretel and claus and heinrich and little adolf i am so tired i want to see you to day i was slapped by mrs maloney and had no supper i could not bring in enough wood for my hand hurt she took my book yesterday i mean grimm s fairy tales which uncle leo gave me it did not hurt any one for me to read the book i try to work as well as i can but there is so much to do i read only a little bit every night dear mamma i shall tell you what i am going to do unless you send for me to morrow to bring me home i shall go to a deep place i know in the river and drown it is wicked to drown i suppose but i wanted to see you and there is no one else i am very tired and tommy is waiting for the letter you will excuse me mamma if i do it your respectful and loving daughter lena tommy was still waiting faithfully when the letter was concluded and when lena dropped it out she saw him pick it up and start up the steep hillside without undressing she blew out the candle and curled herself upon the mattress on the floor at o clock old man ballinger came out of his house in his stocking feet and leaned over the gate smoking his pipe he looked down the big road white in the moonshine and rubbed one ankle with the toe of his other foot it was time for the fredericksburg mail to come pattering up the road old man ballinger had waited only a few minutes when he heard the lively hoofbeats of fritz s team of little black mules and very soon afterward his covered spring wagon stood in front of the gate fritz s big spectacles flashed in the moonlight and his tremendous voice shouted a greeting to the postmaster of ballinger s the mail carrier jumped out and took the bridles from the mules for he always fed them oats at ballinger s while the mules were eating from their feed bags old man ballinger brought out the mail sack and threw it into the wagon fritz bergmann was a man of three sentiments or to be more accurate four the pair of mules deserving to be reckoned individually those mules were the chief interest and joy of his existence next came the emperor of germany and lena hildesmuller tell me said fritz when he was ready to start contains the sack a letter to frau hildesmuller from the little lena at the quarries one came in the last mail to say that she is a little sick already her mamma is very anxious to hear again yes said old man ballinger thar s a letter for mrs helterskelter or some sich name tommy ryan brung it over when he come her little gal workin over thar you say in the hotel shouted fritz as he gathered up the lines eleven years old and not bigger as a frankfurter the close fist of a peter hildesmuller some day i shall with a big club pound that man s dummkopf all in and out the town perhaps in this letter lena will say that she is yet feeling better so her mamma will be glad auf wiedersehen herr ballinger your feets will take cold out in the night air so long fritzy said old man ballinger you got a nice cool night for your drive up the road went the little black mules at their steady trot while fritz thundered at them occasional words of endearment and cheer these fancies occupied the mind of the mail carrier until he reached the big post oak forest eight miles from ballinger s here his ruminations were scattered by the sudden flash and report of pistols and a whooping as if from a whole tribe of indians a band of galloping centaurs closed in around the mail wagon one of them leaned over the front wheel covered the driver with his revolver and ordered him to stop others caught at the bridles of donder and blitzen donnerwetter shouted fritz with all his tremendous voice wass ist release your hands from dose mules ve vas der united states mail hurry up dutch drawled a melancholy voice don t you know when you re in a stick up reverse your mules and climb out of the cart it is due to the breadth of hondo bill s demerit and the largeness of his achievements to state that the holding up of the fredericksburg mail was not perpetrated by way of an exploit as the lion while in the pursuit of prey commensurate to his prowess might set a frivolous foot upon a casual rabbit in his path so hondo bill and his gang had swooped sportively upon the pacific transport of meinherr fritz the real work of their sinister night ride was over fritz and his mail bag and his mules came as gentle relaxation grateful after the arduous duties of their profession twenty miles to the southeast stood a train with a killed engine hysterical passengers and a looted express and mail car that represented the serious occupation of hondo bill and his gang with a fairly rich prize of currency and silver the robbers were making a wide detour to the west through the less populous country intending to seek safety in mexico by means of some fordable spot on the rio grande the booty from the train had melted the desperate bushrangers to jovial and happy skylarkers trembling with outraged dignity and no little personal apprehension fritz climbed out to the road after replacing his suddenly removed spectacles the band had dismounted and were singing capering and whooping thus expressing their satisfied delight in the life of a jolly outlaw rattlesnake rogers who stood at the heads of the mules jerked a little too vigorously at the rein of the tender mouthed donder who reared and emitted a loud protesting snort of pain instantly fritz with a scream of anger flew at the bulky rogers and began to assiduously pummel that surprised freebooter with his fists villain shouted fritz dog bigstiff dot mule he has a soreness by his mouth i vill knock off your shoulders mit your head robbermans yi yi howled rattlesnake roaring with laughter and ducking his head somebody git this here sour krout off n me one of the band yanked fritz back by the coat tail and the woods rang with rattlesnake s vociferous comments the dog goned little wienerwurst he yelled amiably he s not so much of a skunk for a dutchman took up for his animile plum quick didn t he i like to see a man like his hoss even if it is a mule the dad blamed little limburger he went for me didn t he whoa now muley i ain t a goin to hurt your mouth agin any more perhaps the mail would not have been tampered with had not ben moody the lieutenant possessed certain wisdom that seemed to promise more spoils say cap he said addressing hondo bill there s likely to be good pickings in these mail sacks i ve done some hoss tradin with these dutchmen around fredericksburg and i know the style of the varmints there s big money goes through the mails to that town them dutch risk a thousand dollars sent wrapped in a piece of paper before they d pay the banks to handle the money hondo bill six feet two gentle of voice and impulsive in action was dragging the sacks from the rear of the wagon before moody had finished his speech a knife shone in his hand and they heard the ripping sound as it bit through the tough canvas the outlaws crowded around and began tearing open letters and packages enlivening their labours by swearing affably at the writers who seemed to have conspired to confute the prediction of ben moody not a dollar was found in the fredericksburg mail you ought to be ashamed of yourself said hondo bill to the mail carrier in solemn tones to be packing around such a lot of old trashy paper as this what d you mean by it anyhow where do you dutchers keep your money at the ballinger mail sack opened like a cocoon under hondo s knife it contained but a handful of mail fritz had been fuming with terror and excitement until this sack was reached he now remembered lena s letter he addressed the leader of the band asking that that particular missive be spared much obliged dutch he said to the disturbed carrier i guess that s the letter we want got spondulicks in it ain t it here she is make a light boys hondo found and tore open the letter to mrs hildesmuller the others stood about lighting twisted up letters one from another hondo gazed with mute disapproval at the single sheet of paper covered with the angular german script whatever is this you ve humbugged us with dutchy you call this here a valuable letter that s a mighty low down trick to play on your friends what come along to help you distribute your mail that s chiny writin said sandy grundy peering over hondo s shoulder you re off your kazip declared another of the gang an effective youth covered with silk handkerchiefs and nickel plating that s shorthand i see em do it once in court ach no no no dot is german said fritz it is no more as a little girl writing a letter to her mamma one poor little girl sick and vorking hard avay from home ach it is a shame good mr robberman you vill please let me have dot letter what the devil do you take us for old pretzels said hondo with sudden and surprising severity you ain t presumin to insinuate that we gents ain t possessed of sufficient politeness for to take an interest in the miss s health are you now you go on and you read that scratchin out loud and in plain united states language to this here company of educated society hondo twirled his six shooter by its trigger guard and stood towering above the little german who at once began to read the letter translating the simple words into english the gang of rovers stood in absolute silence listening intently how old is that kid asked hondo when the letter was done eleven said fritz and where is she at at dose rock quarries working ach mein gott little lena she speak of drowning i do not know if she vill do it but if she shall i schwear i vill dot peter hildesmuller shoot mit a gun you dutchers said hondo bill his voice swelling with fine contempt make me plenty tired hirin out your kids to work when they ought to be playin dolls in the sand you re a hell of a sect of people i reckon we ll fix your clock for a while just to show what we think of your old cheesy nation here boys hondo bill parleyed aside briefly with his band and then they seized fritz and conveyed him off the road to one side here they bound him fast to a tree with a couple of lariats his team they tied to another tree near by we ain t going to hurt you bad said hondo reassuringly twon t hurt you to be tied up for a while we will now pass you the time of day as it is up to us to depart ausgespielt nixcumrous dutchy don t get any more impatience fritz heard a great squeaking of saddles as the men mounted their horses then a loud yell and a great clatter of hoofs as they galloped pell mell back along the fredericksburg road for more than two hours fritz sat against his tree tightly but not painfully bound then from the reaction after his exciting adventure he sank into slumber how long he slept he knew not but he was at last awakened by a rough shake hands were untying his ropes he was lifted to his feet dazed confused in mind and weary of body rubbing his eyes he looked and saw that he was again in the midst of the same band of terrible bandits they shoved him up to the seat of his wagon and placed the lines in his hands hit it out for home dutch said hondo bill s voice commandingly you ve given us lots of trouble and we re pleased to see the back of your neck spiel zwei bier vamoose hondo reached out and gave blitzen a smart cut with his quirt the little mules sprang ahead glad to be moving again fritz urged them along himself dizzy and muddled over his fearful adventure according to schedule time he should have reached fredericksburg at daylight as it was he drove down the long street of the town at eleven o clock a m he had to pass peter hildesmuller s house on his way to the post office he stopped his team at the gate and called but frau hildesmuller was watching for him out rushed the whole family of hildesmullers frau hildesmuller fat and flushed inquired if he had a letter from lena and then fritz raised his voice and told the tale of his adventure he told the contents of that letter that the robber had made him read and then frau hildesmuller broke into wild weeping her little lena drown herself why had they sent her from home what could be done perhaps it would be too late by the time they could send for her now peter hildesmuller dropped his meerschaum on the walk and it shivered into pieces woman he roared at his wife why did you let that child go away it is your fault if she comes home to us no more every one knew that it was peter hildesmuller s fault so they paid no attention to his words a moment afterward a strange faint voice was heard to call mamma frau hildesmuller at first thought it was lena s spirit calling and then she rushed to the rear of fritz s covered wagon and with a loud shriek of joy caught up lena herself covering her pale little face with kisses and smothering her with hugs lena s eyes were heavy with the deep slumber of exhaustion but she smiled and lay close to the one she had longed to see there among the mail sacks covered in a nest of strange blankets and comforters she had lain asleep until wakened by the voices around her fritz stared at her with eyes that bulged behind his spectacles gott in himmel he shouted how did you get in that wagon am i going crazy as well as to be murdered and hanged by robbers this day you brought her to us fritz cried frau hildesmuller how can we ever thank you enough tell mamma how you came in fritz s wagon said frau hildesmuller i don t know said lena but i know how i got away from the hotel the prince brought me by the emperor s crown shouted fritz we are all going crazy i always knew he would come said lena sitting down on her bundle of bedclothes on the sidewalk last night he came with his armed knights and captured the ogre s castle they broke the dishes and kicked down the doors they pitched mr maloney into a barrel of rain water and threw flour all over mrs maloney the workmen in the hotel jumped out of the windows and ran into the woods when the knights began firing their guns they wakened me up and i peeped down the stair and then the prince came up and wrapped me in the bedclothes and carried me out he was so tall and strong and fine his face was as rough as a scrubbing brush and he talked soft and kind and smelled of schnapps he took me on his horse before him and we rode away among the knights he held me close and i went to sleep that way and didn t wake up till i got home rubbish cried fritz bergmann fairy tales how did you come from the quarries to my wagon the prince brought me said lena confidently and to this day the good people of fredericksburg haven t been able to make her give any other explanation the reformation of calliope calliope catesby was in his humours again ennui was upon him this goodly promontory the earth particularly that portion of it known as quicksand was to him no more than a pestilent congregation of vapours overtaken by the megrims the philosopher may seek relief in soliloquy my lady find solace in tears the flaccid easterner scold at the millinery bills of his women folk such recourse was insufficient to the denizens of quicksand calliope especially was wont to express his ennui according to his lights over night calliope had hung out signals of approaching low spirits he had kicked his own dog on the porch of the occidental hotel and refused to apologise he had become capricious and fault finding in conversation while strolling about he reached often for twigs of mesquite and chewed the leaves fiercely that was always an ominous act another symptom alarming to those who were familiar with the different stages of his doldrums was his increasing politeness and a tendency to use formal phrases a husky softness succeeded the usual penetrating drawl in his tones a dangerous courtesy marked his manners later his smile became crooked the left side of his mouth slanting upward and quicksand got ready to stand from under at this stage calliope generally began to drink finally about midnight he was seen going homeward saluting those whom he met with exaggerated but inoffensive courtesy not yet was calliope s melancholy at the danger point he would seat himself at the window of the room he occupied over silvester s tonsorial parlours and there chant lugubrious and tuneless ballads until morning accompanying the noises by appropriate maltreatment of a jangling guitar more magnanimous than nero he would thus give musical warning of the forthcoming municipal upheaval that quicksand was scheduled to endure a quiet amiable man was calliope catesby at other times quiet to indolence and amiable to worthlessness at best he was a loafer and a nuisance at worst he was the terror of quicksand his ostensible occupation was something subordinate in the real estate line he drove the beguiled easterner in buckboards out to look over lots and ranch property originally he came from one of the gulf states his lank six feet slurring rhythm of speech and sectional idioms giving evidence of his birthplace and yet after taking on western adjustments this languid pine box whittler cracker barrel hugger shady corner lounger of the cotton fields and sumac hills of the south became famed as a bad man among men who had made a life long study of the art of truculence at nine the next morning calliope was fit inspired by his own barbarous melodies and the contents of his jug he was ready primed to gather fresh laurels from the diffident brow of quicksand encircled and criss crossed with cartridge belts abundantly garnished with revolvers and copiously drunk he poured forth into quicksand s main street too chivalrous to surprise and capture a town by silent sortie he paused at the nearest corner and emitted his slogan that fearful brassy yell so reminiscent of the steam piano that had gained for him the classic appellation that had superseded his own baptismal name following close upon his vociferation came three shots from his forty five by way of limbering up the guns and testing his aim a yellow dog the personal property of colonel swazey the proprietor of the occidental fell feet upward in the dust with one farewell yelp a mexican who was crossing the street from the blue front grocery carrying in his hand a bottle of kerosene was stimulated to a sudden and admirable burst of speed still grasping the neck of the shattered bottle the new gilt weather cock on judge riley s lemon and ultramarine two story residence shivered flapped and hung by a splinter the sport of the wanton breezes the artillery was in trim calliope s hand was steady the high calm ecstasy of habitual battle was upon him though slightly embittered by the sadness of alexander in that his conquests were limited to the small world of quicksand down the street went calliope shooting right and left glass fell like hail dogs vamosed chickens flew squawking feminine voices shrieked concernedly to youngsters at large the din was perforated at intervals by the staccato of the terror s guns and was drowned periodically by the brazen screech that quicksand knew so well the occasions of calliope s low spirits were legal holidays in quicksand all along the main street in advance of his coming clerks were putting up shutters and closing doors business would languish for a space the right of way was calliope s and as he advanced observing the dearth of opposition and the few opportunities for distraction his ennui perceptibly increased but some four squares farther down lively preparations were being made to minister to mr catesby s love for interchange of compliments and repartee on the previous night numerous messengers had hastened to advise buck patterson the city marshal of calliope s impending eruption the patience of that official often strained in extending leniency toward the disturber s misdeeds had been overtaxed in quicksand some indulgence was accorded the natural ebullition of human nature providing that the lives of the more useful citizens were not recklessly squandered or too much property needlessly laid waste the community sentiment was against a too strict enforcement of the law but calliope had raised the limit his outbursts had been too frequent and too violent to come within the classification of a normal and sanitary relaxation of spirit buck patterson had been expecting and awaiting in his little ten by twelve frame office that preliminary yell announcing that calliope was feeling blue when the signal came the city marshal rose to his feet and buckled on his guns two deputy sheriffs and three citizens who had proven the edible qualities of fire also stood up ready to bandy with calliope s leaden jocularities gather that fellow in said buck patterson setting forth the lines of the campaign don t have no talk but shoot as soon as you can get a show keep behind cover and bring him down he s a nogood un it s up to calliope to turn up his toes this time i reckon go to him all spraddled out boys and don t git too reckless for what calliope shoots at he hits buck patterson tall muscular and solemn faced with his bright city marshal badge shining on the breast of his blue flannel shirt gave his posse directions for the onslaught upon calliope the plan was to accomplish the downfall of the quicksand terror without loss to the attacking party if possible the splenetic calliope unconscious of retributive plots was steaming down the channel cannonading on either side when he suddenly became aware of breakers ahead the city marshal and one of the deputies rose up behind some dry goods boxes half a square to the front and opened fire at the same time the rest of the posse divided shelled him from two side streets up which they were cautiously manoeuvring from a well executed detour the first volley broke the lock of one of calliope s guns cut a neat underbit in his right ear and exploded a cartridge in his crossbelt scorching his ribs as it burst feeling braced up by this unexpected tonic to his spiritual depression calliope executed a fortissimo note from his upper register and returned the fire like an echo the upholders of the law dodged at his flash but a trifle too late to save one of the deputies a bullet just above the elbow and the marshal a bleeding cheek from a splinter that a ball tore from the box he had ducked behind and now calliope met the enemy s tactics in kind choosing with a rapid eye the street from which the weakest and least accurate fire had come he invaded it at a double quick abandoning the unprotected middle of the street with rare cunning the opposing force in that direction one of the deputies and two of the valorous volunteers waited concealed by beer barrels until calliope had passed their retreat and then peppered him from the rear in another moment they were reinforced by the marshal and his other men and then calliope felt that in order to successfully prolong the delights of the controversy he must find some means of reducing the great odds against him his eye fell upon a structure that seemed to hold out this promise providing he could reach it not far away was the little railroad station its building a strong box house ten by twenty feet resting upon a platform four feet above ground windows were in each of its walls something like a fort it might become to a man thus sorely pressed by superior numbers calliope made a bold and rapid spurt for it the marshal s crowd smoking him as he ran he reached the haven in safety the station agent leaving the building by a window like a flying squirrel as the garrison entered the door patterson and his supporters halted under protection of a pile of lumber and held consultations in the station was an unterrified desperado who was an excellent shot and carried an abundance of ammunition for thirty yards on either side of the besieged was a stretch of bare open ground it was a sure thing that the man who attempted to enter that unprotected area would be stopped by one of calliope s bullets the city marshal was resolved he had decided that calliope catesby should no more wake the echoes of quicksand with his strident whoop he had so announced officially and personally he felt imperatively bound to put the soft pedal on that instrument of discord it played bad tunes standing near was a hand truck used in the manipulation of small freight it stood by a shed full of sacked wool a consignment from one of the sheep ranches on this truck the marshal and his men piled three heavy sacks of wool stooping low buck patterson started for calliope s fort slowly pushing this loaded truck before him for protection the posse scattering broadly stood ready to nip the besieged in case he should show himself in an effort to repel the juggernaut of justice that was creeping upon him only once did calliope make demonstration he fired from a window and some tufts of wool spurted from the marshal s trustworthy bulwark the return shots from the posse pattered against the window frame of the fort no loss resulted on either side the marshal was too deeply engrossed in steering his protected battleship to be aware of the approach of the morning train until he was within a few feet of the platform the train was coming up on the other side of it it stopped only one minute at quicksand what an opportunity it would offer to calliope he had only to step out the other door mount the train and away abandoning his breastwork buck with his gun ready dashed up the steps and into the room driving upon the closed door with one heave of his weighty shoulder the members of the posse heard one shot fired inside and then there was silence at length the wounded man opened his eyes after a blank space he again could see and hear and feel and think turning his eyes about he found himself lying on a wooden bench a tall man with a perplexed countenance wearing a big badge with city marshal engraved upon it stood over him a little old woman in black with a wrinkled face and sparkling black eyes was holding a wet handkerchief against one of his temples he was trying to get these facts fixed in his mind and connected with past events when the old woman began to talk there now great big strong man that bullet never tetched ye jest skeeted along the side of your head and sort of paralysed ye for a spell i ve heerd of sech things afore cun cussion is what they names it abel wadkins used to kill squirrels that way barkin em abe called it you jest been barked sir and you ll be

that train from alabama to see my son big son ain t he lands you wouldn t hardly think he d ever been a baby would ye this is my son sir half turning the old woman looked up at the standing man her worn face lighting with a proud and wonderful smile she reached out one veined and calloused hand and took one of her son s then smiling cheerily down at the prostrate man she continued to dip the handkerchief in the waiting room tin washbasin and gently apply it to his temple she had the benevolent garrulity of old age i ain t seen my son before she continued in eight years one of my nephews elkanah price he s a conductor on one of them railroads and he got me a pass to come out here i can stay a whole week on it and then it ll take me back again jest think now that little boy of mine has

there jest like you was dead and i lowed we d see what might be done to help sot you up i think i ll sit up now said the concussion patient i m feeling pretty fair by this time he sat somewhat weakly yet leaning against the wall he was a rugged man big boned and straight his eyes steady and keen seemed to linger upon the face of the man standing so still above him his look wandered often from the face he studied to the marshal s badge upon the other s breast yes yes you ll be all right said the old woman patting his arm if you don t get to cuttin up agin and havin folks shooting at you son told me about you sir while you was layin senseless on the floor don t you take it as meddlesome fer an old woman with a son as big as you to talk about it and you mustn t hold no grudge ag in my son

boy good when he was growin up and kind and bedient and well behaved won t you let me advise you sir not to do so no more be a good man and leave liquor alone and live peaceably and goodly keep away from bad company and work honest and sleep sweet the black mitted hand of the old pleader gently touched the breast of the man she addressed very earnest and candid her old worn face looked in her rusty black dress and antique bonnet she sat near the close of a long life and epitomised the experience of the world still the man to whom she spoke gazed above her head contemplating the silent son of the old mother what does the marshal say he asked does he believe the advice is good suppose the marshal speaks up and says if the talk s all right the tall man moved uneasily he fingered the badge on his breast for a moment and then he put an arm around the old woman and drew her close to him she smiled the unchanging mother smile of three score years and patted his big brown hand with her crooked mittened fingers while her son spake i says this he said looking squarely into the eyes of the other man that if i was in your place i d follow it if i was a drunken desp rate character without shame or hope i d follow it if i was in your place and you was in mine i d say marshal i m willin to swear if you ll give me the chance i ll quit the racket i ll drop the tanglefoot and the gun play and won t play hoss no more i ll be a good citizen and go to work and quit my foolishness so help me god that s what i d say to you if you was marshal and i was in your place hear my son talkin said the old woman softly hear him sir you promise to be good and he won t do you no harm forty one year ago his heart first beat ag in mine and it s beat true ever since the other man rose to his feet trying his limbs and stretching his muscles then said he if you was in my place and said that and i was marshal i d say go free and do your best to keep your promise lawsy exclaimed the old

carpenter they will tell you in anchuria that president miraflores of that volatile republic died by his own hand in the coast town of coralio that he had reached thus far in flight from the inconveniences of an imminent revolution and that one hundred thousand dollars government funds which he carried with him in an american leather valise as a souvenir of his tempestuous administration was never afterward recovered for a real a boy will show you his grave it is back of the town near a little bridge that spans a mangrove swamp a plain slab of wood stands at its head some one has burned upon the headstone with a hot iron this inscription ramon angel de las cruzes y miraflores presidente de la republica de anchuria que sea su juez dios it is characteristic of this buoyant people that they pursue no man beyond the grave let god be his judge even with the hundred thousand unfound though they greatly coveted the hue and cry went no further than that to the stranger or the guest the people of coralio will relate the story of the tragic end of their former president how he strove to escape from the country with the publice funds and also with dona isabel guilbert the young american opera singer and how being apprehended by members of the opposing political party in coralio he shot himself through the head rather than give up the funds and in consequence the senorita guilbert they will relate further that dona isabel her adventurous bark of fortune shoaled by the simultaneous loss of her distinguished admirer and the souvenir hundred thousand dropped anchor on this stagnant coast awaiting a rising tide they say in coralio that she found a prompt and prosperous tide in the form of frank goodwin an american resident of the town an investor who had grown wealthy by dealing in the products of the country a banana king a rubber prince a sarsaparilla indigo and mahogany baron the senorita guilbert you will be told married senor goodwin one month after the president s death thus in the very moment when fortune had ceased to smile wresting from her a gift greater than the prize withdrawn of the american don frank goodwin and of his wife the natives have nothing but good to say don frank has lived among them for years and has compelled their respect his lady is easily queen of what social life the sober coast affords the wife of the governor of the district herself who was of the proud castilian family of monteleon y dolorosa de los santos y mendez feels honored to unfold her napkin with olive hued ringed hands at the table of senora goodwin were you to refer with your northern prejudices to the vivacious past of mrs goodwin when her audacious and gleeful abandon in light opera captured the mature president s fancy or to her share in that statesman s downfall and malfeasance the latin shrug of the shoulder would be your only answer and rebuttal what prejudices there were in coralio concerning senora goodwin seemed now to be in her favor whatever they had been in the past it would seem that the story is ended instead of begun that the close of tragedy and the climax of a romance have covered the ground of interest but to the more curious reader it shall be some slight instruction to trace the close threads that underlie the ingenious web of circumstances the headpiece bearing the name of president miraflores is daily scrubbed with soap bark and sand an old half breed indian tends the grave with fidelity and the dawdling minuteness of inherited sloth he chops down the weeds and ever springing grass with his machete he plucks ants and scorpions and beetles from it with his horny fingers and sprinkles its turf with water from the plaza fountain there is no grave anywhere so well kept and ordered only by following out the underlying threads will it be made clear why the old indian galves is secretly paid to keep green the grave of president miraflores by one who never saw that unfortunate statesman in life or in death and why that one was wont to walk in the twilight casting from a distance looks of gentle sadness upon that unhonored mound elsewhere than at coralio one learns of the impetuous career of isabel guilbert new orleans gave her birth and the mingled french and spanish creole nature that tinctured her life with such turbulence and warmth she had little education but a knowledge of men and motives that seemed to have come by instinct far beyond the common woman was she endowed with intrepid rashness with a love for the pursuit of adventure to the brink of danger and with desire for the pleasures of life her spirit was one to chafe under any curb she was eve after the fall but before the bitterness of it was felt she wore life as a rose in her bosom of the legion of men who had been at her feet it was said that but one was so fortunate as to engage her fancy to president miraflores the brilliant but unstable ruler of anchuria she yielded the key to her resolute heart how then do we find her as the coralians would have told you the wife of frank goodwin and happily living a life of dull and dreamy inaction the underlying threads reach far stretching across the sea following them out it will be made plain why shorty o day of the columbia detective agency resigned his position and for a lighter pastime it shall be a duty and a pleasing sport to wander with momus beneath the tropic stars where melpomene once stalked austere now to cause laughter to echo from those lavish jungles and frowing crags where formerly rang the cries of pirate s victims to lay aside pike and cutlass and attack with quip and jollity to draw one saving titter of mirth from the rusty casque of romance this were pleasant to do in the shade of the lemon trees on that coast that is curved like lips set for smiling for there are yet tales of the spanish main that segment of continent washed by the tempestuous caribbean and presenting to the sea a formidable border of tropicle jungle topped by the overweening cordilleras is still begirt by mystery and romance in past times buccaneers and revolutionists roused the echoes of its cliffs and the condor wheeled perpetually above where in the green groves they made food for him with their matchlocks and toledos taken and retaken by sea rovers by adverse powers and by sudden uprising of rebellious factions the historic miles of adventurous coast has scarcely known for hundreds of years whom rightly to call its master pizarro balboa sir francis drake and bolivar did what they could to make it a part of christendom sir john morgan lafitte and other eminent swashbucklers bombarded and pounded it in the name of abaddon the game still goes on the guns of the rovers are silenced but the tintype man the enlarged photograph brigand the kodaking tourist and the scouts of the gentle brigade of fakirs have found it out and carry on the work the hucksters of germany france and sicily now bag in small change across their counters gentlemen adventurers throng the waiting rooms of its rulers with proposals for railways and concessions the little opera bouffe nations play at government and intrigue until some day a big silent gunboat glides into the offing and warns them not to break their toys and with these changes comes also the small adventurer with empty pockets to fill light of heart busy brained the modern fairy prince bearing an alarm clock with which more surely than by the sentimental kiss to awaken the beautiful tropics from their centuries sleep generally he wears a shamrock which he matches pridefully against the extravagant palms and it is he who had driven melpomene to the wings and set comedy to dancing before the footlights of the southern cross so there is a little tale to tell of many things perhaps to the promiscuous ear of the walrus it shall come with most avail for in it there are indeed shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbage palms and presidents instead of kings add to these a little love and counterplotting and scatter everywhere throughout the maze a trail of tropical dollars dollars warmed no more by the torrid sun than by the hot palms of the scouts of fortune and after all here seems to be life itself with talk enough to weary the most garrulous of walruses i fox in the morning coralio reclined in the mid day heat like some vacuous beauty lounging in a guarded harem the town lay at the sea s edge on a strip of alluvial coast it was set like a little pearl in an emerald band behind it and seeming almost to topple imminent above it rose the sea following range of the cordilleras in front the sea was spread a smiling jailer but even more incorruptible than the frowning mountains the waves swished along the smooth beach the parrots screamed in the orange and ceiba trees the palms waved their limber fronds foolishly like an awkward chorus at the prima donna s cue to enter suddenly the town was full of excitement a native boy dashed down a grass grown street shrieking busca el senor goodwin ha venido un telegrafo por el the word passed quickly telegrams do not come to any one in coralio the cry for senor goodwin was taken up by a dozen officious voices the main street running parallel to the beach became populated with those who desired to expedite the delivery of the dispatch knots of women with complexions varying from palest olive to deepest brown gathered at street corners and plaintively carolled un telegrafo por senor goodwin the comandante don senor el coronel encarnacion rios who was loyal to the ins and suspected goodwin s devotion to the outs hissed aha and wrote in his secret memorandum book the accusive fact that senor goodwin had on that momentous date received a telegram in the midst of the hullabaloo a man stepped to the door of a small wooden building and looked out above the door was a sign that read keogh and clancy a nomenclature that seemed not to be indigenous to that tropical soil the man in the door was billy keogh scout of fortune and progress and latter day rover of the spanish main tintypes and photographs were the weapons with which keogh and clancy were at that time assailing the hopeless shores outside the shop were set two large frames filled with specimens fo their art and skill keogh leaned in the doorway his bold and humorous countenance wearing a look of interest at the unusual influx of life and sound in the street when the meaning of the disturbance became clear to him he placed a hand beside his mouth and shouted hey frank in such a robustious voice that the feeble clamor of the natives was drowned and silenced fifty yards away on the seaward side of the street stood the abode of the consul for the united states out from the door of this building tumbled goodwin at the call he had been smoking with willard geddie the consul on the back porch of the consulate which was conceded to be the coolest spot in coralio hurry up shouted keogh there s a riot in town on account of a telegram that s come for you you want to be careful about these things my boy it won t do to trifle with the feelings of the public this way you ll be getting a pink note some day with violet scent on it and then the country ll be steeped in the throes of a revolution goodwin had strolled up the street and met the boy with the message the ox eyed women gazed at him with shy admiration for his type drew them he was big blond and jauntily dressed in white linen with buckskin zapatos his manner was courtly with a merciful eye when the telegram had been delivered and the bearer of it dismissed with a gratuity the relieved populace returned to the contiguities of shade from which curiosity had drawn it the women to their baking in the mud ovens under the orange trees or to the interminable combing of their long straight hair the men to their cigarettes and gossip in the cantinas goodwin sat on keogh s doorstep and read his telegram it was from bob englehart an american who lived in san mateo the capital city of anchuria eighty miles in the interior englehart was a gold miner an ardent revolutionist and good people that he was a man of resource and imagination was proven by the telegram he had sent it had had been his task to send a confidential message to his friend in coralio this could not have been accomplished in either spanish or english for the eye politic in anchuria was an active one but englehart was a diplomatist there existed but one code upon which he might make requisition with promise of safety the great and potent code of slang so here is the message that slipped unconstrued through the fingers of curious officials and came to the eye of goodwin his nibs skedaddled yesterday per jack rabbit line with all the coin in the kitty and the bundle of muslin he s spoony about the boodle is six figures short our crowd in good shape but we need the spondulicks you collar it the main guy and the dry goods are headed for the briny you to know what to do bob this screed remarkable as it was had no mystery for goodwin he was the most successful of the small advance guard of speculative americans that had invaded anchuria and he had not reached that enviable pinnacle without having well exercised the arts of foresight and deduction he had taken up political intrigue as a matter of business he was acute enough to wield a certain influence among the leading schemers and he was prosperous enough to be able to purchase the respect of the petty officeholders there was always a revolutionary party and to it he had allied himself for the adherents of a new administration received the rewards of their labors there was now a liberal party seeking to overturn president miraflores if the wheel successfully revolved goodwin stood to win a concession to manzanas of the finest coffee lands in the interior certain incidents in the recent career of president miraflores had excited a shrewd suspicion in goodwin s mind that the government was near a dissolution from another cause than that of a revolution and now englehart s telegram had come as a corroboration of his wisdom the telegram which had remained unintelligible to the anchurian linguists who had applied to it in vain their knowledge of spanish and elemental english conveyed a stimulating piece of news to goodwin s understanding it informed him that the president of the republic had decamped from the capital city with the contents of the treasury furthermore that he was accompanied in his flight by that winning adventuress isabel guilbert the opera singer whose troupe of performers had been entertained by the president at san mateo during the past month on a scale less modest than that with which royal visitors are often content the reference to the jackrabbit line could mean nothing else than the mule back system of transport that prevailed between coralio and the capital the hint that the boodle was six figures short made the condition of the national treasury lamentably clear also it was convincingly true that the ingoing party its way now made a pacific one would need the spondulicks unless its pledges should be fulfilled and the spoils held for the delectation of the victors precarious indeed would be the position of the new government therefore it was exceeding necessary to collar the main guy and recapture the sinews of war and government goodwin handed the message to keogh read that billy he said it s from bob englehart can you manage the cipher keogh sat in the other half of the doorway and carefully perused the telegram tis not a cipher he said finally tis what they call literature and that s a system of language put in the mouths of people that they ve never been introduced to by writers of imagination the magazines invented it but i never knew before that president norvin green had stamped it with the seal of his approval tis now no longer literature but language the dictionaries tried but they couldn t make it go for anything but dialect sure now that the western union indorses it it won t be long till a race of people will spring up that speaks it you re running too much to philology billy said goodwin do you make out the meaning of it sure replied the philosopher of fortune all languages come easy to the man who must know em i ve even failed to misunderstand an order to evacuate in classical chinese when it was backed up by the muzzle of a breech loader this little literary essay i hold in my hands means a game of fox in the morning ever play that frank when you was a kid i think so said goodwin laughing you join hands all round and you do not interrupted keogh you ve got a fine sporting game mixed up in your head with all around the rosebush the spirit of fox in the morning is opposed to the holding of hands i ll tell you how it s played this president man and his companion in play they stand up over in san mateo ready for the run and shout fox in the morning me and you standing here we say goose and gander they say how many miles is it to london town we say only a few if your legs are long enough how many comes out they say more than you re able to catch and then the game commences i catch the idea said goodwin it won t do to let the goose and gander slip through your fingers billy their feathers are too valuable our crowd is prepared and able to step into the shoes of the government at once but with the treasury empty we d stay in power about as long as a tenderfoot would stick on an untamed bronco we must play the fox on every foot of the coast to prevent their getting out of the country by the mule back schedule said keogh it s five days down from san mateo we ve got plenty of time to set our outposts there s only three places on the coast where they can hope to sail from here and solitas and alazan they re the only points we ll have to guard it s as easy as a chess problem fox to play and mate in three moves oh goosey goosey gander whither do you wander by the blessing of the literary telegraph the boodle of this benighted fatherland shall be preserved to the honest political party that is seeking to overthrow it the situation had been justly outlined by keogh the down trail from the capital was at all times a weary road to travel a jiggety joggety journey it was ice cold and hot wet and dry the trail climbed appalling mountains wound like a rotten string about the brows of breathless precipices plunged through chilling snow fed streams and wriggled like a snake through sunless forests teeming with menacing insect and animal life after descending to the foothills it turned to a trident the central prong ending at alazan another branched off to coralio the third penetrated to solitas between the sea and the foothills stretched the five miles breadth of alluvial coast here was the flora ofthe tropics in its rankest and most prodigal growth spaces here and there had been wrested from the jungle and planted with bananas and cane and orange groves the rest was a riot of wild vegetation the home of monkeys tapirs jaguars alligators and prodigious reptiles and insects where no road was cut a serpent could scarcely make its way through the tangle of vines and creepers across the treacherous mangrove swamps few things without wings could safely pass therefore the fugitives could hope to reach the coast only by one of the routes named keep the matter quiet billy advised goodwin we don t want the ins to know that the president is in flight i suppose bob s information is something of a scoop in the capital as yet otherwise he would not have tried to make his message a confidential one and besides everybody would have heard the news i m going around now to see dr zavalla and start a man up the trail to cut the telegraph wire as goodwin rose keogh threw his hat upon the grass by the door and expelled a tremendous sigh what s the trouble billy asked goodwin pausing that s the first time i heard you sigh tis the last said keogh with that sorrowful puff of wind i resign myself to a life of praiseworthy but harassing honesty what are tintypes if you please to the opportunities of the great and hilarious class of ganders and geese not that i would be a president frank and the boodle he s got is too big for me to handle but in some ways i feel my conscience hurting me for addicting myself to photographing a nation instead of running away with it frank did you ever see the bundle of muslin that his excellency has wrapped up and carried off isabel guilbert said goodwin laughing no i never did from what i ve heard of her though i imagine that she wouldn t stick at anything to carry her point don t get romantic billy sometimes i begin to fear that there s irish blood in your ancestry i never saw her either went on keogh but they say she s got all the ladies of mythology sculpture and fiction reduced to chromos they say she can look at a man once and he ll turn monkey and climb trees to pick coconuts for her think of that president man with lord know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars in one hand and this muslin siren in the other galloping down the hill on a sympathetic mule amid songbirds and flowers and here is billy keogh because he is virtuous condemned to the unprofitable swindle of slandering the faces of missing links on tin for an honest living tis an injustice of nature cheer up said goodwin you are a pretty poor fox to be envying a gander maybe the enchanting guilbert will take a fancy to you and your tintypes after we impoverish her royal escort she could do worse reflected keogh but she won t tis not a tintype gallery but a gallery of the gods that she s fitted to adorn she s a very wicked lady and the president man is in luck but i hear clancy swearing in the back room for having to do all the work and keogh plunged for the rear of the gallery whistling gaily in a spontaneous way that belied his recent sigh over the questionable good luck of the flying president goodwin turned from the main street into a much narrower one that intersected it at a right angle these side streets were covered by a growth of thick rank grass which was kept to a navigable shortness by the machetes of the police stone sidewalks little more than a ledge in width ran along the base of the mean and monotonous adobe houses at the outskirts of the village these streets dwindled to nothing and here were set the palm thatched huts of the caribs and the poorer natives and the shabby cabins of negroes from jamaica and the west india islands a few structures raised their heads above the red tiled roofs of the one story houses the bell tower of the calaboza the hotel de los extranjeros the residence of the vesuvius fruit company s agent the store and residence of bernard brannigan a ruined cathedral in which columbus had once set foot and most imposing of all the casa morena the summer white house of the president of anchuria on the principal street running along the beach the broadway of coralio were the larger stores the government bodega and post office the cuartel the rum shops and the market place on his way goodwin passed the house of bernard brannigan it was a modern wooden building two stories in height the ground floor was occupied by brannigan s store the upper one contained the living apartments a wide cool porch ran around the house half way up its outer walls a handsome vivacious girl neatly dressed in flowing white leaned over the railing and smiled down upon goodwin she was no darker than many an andalusian of high descent and she sparkled and glowed like a tropical moonlight good evening miss paula said goodwin taking off his hat with his ready smile there was little difference in his manner whether he addressed women or men everybody in coralio liked to receive the salutation of the big american is there any news mr goodwin please don t say no isn t it warm i feel just like mariana in her moated grange or was it a range it s hot enough no there s no news to tell i believe said goodwin with a mischievous look in his eye except that old geddie is getting grumpier and crosser every day if something doesn t happen to relieve his mind i ll have to quit smoking on his back porch and there s no other place available that is cool enough he isn t grumpy said paula brannigan impulsively when he but she ceased suddenly and drew back with a deepening color for her mother had been a mestizo lady and the spanish blood had brought to paula a certain shyness that was an adornment to the other half of her demonstrative nature ii the lotus and the bottle willard greddie consul for the united states in coralio was working leisurely on his yearly report goodwin who had strolled in as he did daily for a smoke on the much coveted porch had found him so absorbed in his work that he departed after roundly abusing the consul for his lack of hospitality i shall complain to the civil service department said goodwin or is it a department perhaps it s only a theory one gets neither civility nor service from you you won t talk and you won t set out anything to drink what kind of a way is that of representing your government goodwin strolled out and across to the hotel to see if he could bully the quarantine doctor into a game on coralio s solitary billiard table his plans were completed for the interception of the fugitives from the capital and now it was but a waiting game that he had to play the consul was interested in his report he was only twenty four and he had not been in coralio long enough for his enthusiasm to cool in the heat of the tropics a paradox that may be allowed between cancer and capricorn so many thousand bunches of bananas so mnay thousand oranges and coconuts so many ounces of gold dust pounds of rubber coffee indigo and sarparilla actually exports were twenty per cent greater than for the previous year a little thrill of satisfaction ran through the consul perhaps he thought the state department upon reading his introduction would notice and then he leaned back in his chair and laughed he was getting as bad as the others for the moment he had forgotten that coralio was an insignificant republic lying along the by ways of a second rate sea he thought of gregg the quarantine doctor who subscribed for the london lancet expecting to find it quoting his reports to the home board of health concerning the yellow fever germ the consul knew that not one in fifty of his acquaintances in the states had ever heard of coralio he knew that two men at any rate would have to read his report some underling in the state department and a compositor in the public printing office perhaps the typesticker would note the increase of commerce in coralio and speak of it over the cheese and beer to a friend he had just written most unaccountable is the supineness of the large exporters in the united states in permitting the french and german houses to practically control the trade interests of this rich and productive country when he heard the hoarse notes of a steamer s siren geddie laid down his pen and gathered his panama hat and umbrella by the sound he knew it to be the valhalla one of the line of fruit vessels plying for the vesuvius company down to ninos of five years every one in coralio could name you each incoming steamer by the note of her siren the consul sauntered by a roundabout shaded way to the beach by reason of long practice he gauged his stroll so accurately that by the time he arrived on the sandy shore the boat of the customs officials was rowing back from the steamer which had been boarded and inspected according to the laws of anchuria there is no harbor at coralio vessels of the draught of the valhalla must ride at anchor a mile from shore when they take on fruit it is conveyed on lighters and freighter sloops at solitas where there was a fine harbor ships of many kinds were to be seen but in the roadstead off coralio scarcely any save the fruiters paused now and then a tramp coaster or a mysterious brig from spain and then a tramp coaster or a mysterious brig from spain or a saucy french barque would hang innocently for a few days in the offing then the custom house crew would become doubly vigilant and wary at night a sloop or two would be making strange trips in and out along the shore and in the morning the stock of three star hennessey wines and drygoods in coralio would be found vastly increased it has also been said that the customs officials jingled more silver in the pockets of their red striped trousers and that the record books showed no increase in import duties received the custom s boat and the valhalla gig reached the shore at the same time when they grounded in the shallow water there was still five yards of rolling surf between them and dry sand then half clothed caribs dashed into the water and brought in on their backs the valhalla s purser and the little native officials in their cotton undershirts blue trousers with red stripes and flapping straw hats at college geddie had been a treasure as a first baseman he now closed his umbrella stuck it upright in the sand and stooped with his hands resting upon his knees the purser burlesquing the pitcher s contortions hurled at the consul the heavy roll of newspapers tied with a string that the steamer always brought for him geddie leaped high and caught the roll with a sounding thwack the loungers on the beach about a third of the population of the town laughed and applauded delightedly every week they expected to see that roll of papers delivered and received in that same manner and they were never disappointed innovations did not flourish in coralio the consul re hoisted his umbrella and walked back to the consulate this home of a great nation s representative was a wooden structure of two rooms with a native built gallery of poles bamboo and nipa palm running on three sides of it one room was the official apartment furnished chastely with a flat top desk a hammock and three uncomfortable cane seated chairs engravings of the first and latest president of the country represented hung against the wall the other room was the consul s living apartment it was eleven o clock when he returned from the beach and therefore breakfast time chanca the carib woman who cooked for him was just serving the meal on the side of the gallery facing the sea a spot famous as the coolest in coralio the breakfast consisted of shark s fin soup stew of land crabs breadfruit a boiled iguana steak aquacates a freshly cut pineapple claret and coffee geddie took his seat and unrolled with luxurious laziness his bundle of newspapers here in coralio for two days or longer he would read the goings on in the world very much as we of the world read those whimsical contributions to inexact science that assume to portray the doings of the martians after he had finished with the papers they would be sent on the rounds of the other english speaking residents of the town the paper that came first to his hand was one of those bulky mattresses of printed stuff upon which the readers of certain new york journals are supposed to take their sabbath literary nap opening this the consul rested it upon the table supporting its weight with the aid of the back of a chair then he partook of his meal deliberately turning the leaves from time to time and glancing half idly at the contents presently he was struck by something familiar to him in a picture a half page badly printed reproduction of a photograph of a vessel languidly interested he leaned for a nearer scrutiny and a view of the florid headlines of the column next to the picture yes he was not mistaken the engraving was of the eight hundred ton yacht idalia belonging to that prince of good fellows midas of the money market and society s pink of perfection j ward tolliver slowly sipping his black coffee geddie read the column of print following a listed statement of mr tolliver s real estate and bonds came a description of the yacht s furnishings and then the grain of news no bigger than a mustard seed mr tolliver with a party of favored guests would sail the next day on a six weeks cruise along the central american and south american coasts and among the bahama islands among the guests were mrs cumberland payne and miss ida payne of norfolk the writer with the fatuous presumption that was demanded of him by his readers had concocted a romance suited to their palates he bracketed the names of miss payne and mr tolliver until he had well nigh read the marriage ceremony over them he played coyly and insinuatingly upon the strings of on dit and madame rumor and a little bird and no one would be surprised and ended with congratulations geddie having finished his breakfast took his papers to the edge of the gallery and sat there in his favorite steamer chair with his feet on the bamboo railing he lighted a cigar and looked out upon the sea he felt a glow of satisfaction at finding he was so little disturbed by what he had read he told himself that he had conquered the distress that had sent him a voluntary exile to this far land of the lotus he could never forget ida of course but there was no longer any pain in thinking about her when they had had that misunderstanding and quarrel he had impulsively sought this consulship with the desire to retaliate upon her by detaching himself from her world and presence he had succeeded thoroughly in that during the twelve months of his life in coralio no word had passed between them though he had sometimes heard of her through the dilatory correspondence with the few friends to whom he still wrote still he could not repress a little thrill of satisfaction at knowing that she had not yet married tolliver or any one else but evidently tolliver had not yet abandoned hope well it made no difference to him now he had eaten of the lotus he was happy and content in this land of perpetual afternoon those old days of life in the states seemed like an irritating dream he hoped ida would be as happy as he was the climate as balmy as that of distant avalon the fetterless idyllic round of enchanted days the life among this indolent romantic people a life full of music flowers and low laughter the influence of the imminent sea and mountains and the many shapes of love and magic and beauty that bloomed in the white tropic nights with all he was more than content also there was paula brannigan geddie intended to marry paula if of course she would consent but he felt rather sure that she would do that somehow he kept postponing his proposal several times he had been quite near to it but a mysterious something always held him back perhaps it was only the unconscious instinctive conviction that the act would sever the last tie that bound him to his old world he could be very happy with paula few of the native girls could be compared with her she had attended a convent school in new orleans for two years and when she chose to display her accomplishments no one could detect any difference between her and the girls of norfolk and manhattan but it was delicious to see her at home dressed as she sometimes was in the native costume with bare shoulders and flowing sleeves bernard brannigan was the great merchant of coralio besides his store he maintained a train of pack mules and carried on a lively trade with the interior towns and villages he had married a native lady of high castilian descent but with a tinge of indian brown showing through her olive cheek the union of the irish and the spanish had produced as it so often has an offshoot of rare beauty and variety they were very excellent people indeed and the upper story of the house was ready to be placed at the service of geddie and paula as soon as he should make up his mind to speak about it by the time two hours were whiled away the consul tired of reading the papers lay scattered about him on the gallery reclining there he gazed dreamily out upon an eden a clump of banana plants interposed their broad shields between him and the sun the gentle slope from the consulate to the sea was covered with the dark green foliage of lemon trees and orange trees just bursting into bloom a lagoon pierced the land like a dark jagged crystal and above it a pale ceiba tree rose almost to the clouds the waving coconut palms on the beach flared their decorative green leaves against the slate of an almost quiescent sea his senses were cognizant of brilliant scarlet and ochres and the vert of the coppice of odors of fruit and bloom and the smoke from chanca s clay oven under the calabash tree of the treble laughter of the native women in their huts the song of the robin the salt taste of the breeze the diminuendo of the faint surf running along the shore and gradually of a white speck growing to a blur that intruded itself upon the drab prospect of the sea lazily interested he watched this blur increase until it became the idalia steaming at full speed coming down the coast without changing his position he kept his eyes upon the beautiful white yacht as she drew swiftly near and came opposite to coralio then sitting upright he saw her float steadily past and on he had seen the frequent splash of her polished brass work and the stripes of her deck awnings so much and no more like a ship on a magic lantern slide the idalia had crossed the illuminated circle of the consul s little world and was gone save for the tiny cloud of smoke that was left hanging over the brim of the sea she might have been an immaterial thing a chimera of his idle brain geddie went into his office and sat down to dawdle over his report if the reading of the article in the paper had left him unshaken this silent passing of the idalia had done for him still more it had brought the calm and peace of a situation from which all uncertainty had been erased he knew that men sometimes hope without being aware of it now since she had come two thousand miles and had passed without a sign not even his unconscious self need cling to the past any longer after dinner when the sun was low behind the mountains geddie walked on the little strip of beach under the coconuts the wind was blowing mildly landward and the surface of the sea was rippled by tiny wavelets a miniature breaker spreading with a soft swish upon the sand brought with its something round and shiny that rolled back again as the wave receded the next influx beached it clear and geddie picked it up the thing was a long necked wine bottle of colorless glass the cork had been driven in tightly to the level of the mouth and the end covered with dark red sealing wax the bottle contained only what seemed to be a sheet of paper much curled from the manipulation it had undergone while being inserted in the sealing wax was the impression of a seal probably of a signet ring bearing the initials of a monogram but the impression had been hastily made and the letters were past anything more certain than a shrewd conjecture ida payne had always worn a signet ring in preference to any other finger decoration geddie thought he could make out the familiar i p and a queer sensation of disquietude went over him more personal and intimate was this reminder of her than had been the sight of the vessel she was doubtless on he walked back to his house and set the bottle on his desk throwing off his hat and coat and lighting a lamp for the night had crowded precipitately upon the brief twilight he began to examine his piece of sea salvage by holding the bottle near the light and turning it judiciously he made out that it contained a double sheet of note paper filled with close writing further that the paper was of the same size and shade as that always used by ida and that to the best of his belief the handwriting was hers the imperfect glass of the bottle so distorted the rays of light that he could read no word of the writing but certain capital letters of which he caught comprehensive glimpses were ida s he felt sure there was a little smile both of perplexity and amusement in geddie s eyes as he set the bottle down and laid three cigars side by side on his desk he fetched his steamer chair from the gallery and stretched himself comfortably he would smoke those three cigars while considering the problem for it amounted to a problem he almost wished that he had not found the bottle but the bottle was there why should it have drifted in from the sea whence come so many disquieting things to disturb his peace in this dreamy land where time seemed so redundant he had fallen into the habit of bestowing much thought upon even trifling matters he bagan to speculate upon many fanciful theories concerning the story of the bottle rejecting each in turn ships in danger of wreck or disablement sometimes cast forth such precarious messengers calling for aid but he had seen the idalia not three hours before safe and speeding suppose the crew had mutinied and imprisoned the passengers below and the message was one begging for succor but premising such an improbable outrage would the agitated captives have taken the pains to fill four pages of note paper with carefully penned arguments to their rescue thus by elimination he soon rid the matter of the more unlikely theories and was reduced though aversely to the less assailable ones that the bottle contained a message to himself ida knew he was in coralio she must have launched the bottle while the yacht was passing and the wind blowing fairly toward the shore as soon as geddie reached this conclusion a wrinkle came between his brows and a stubborn look settled around his mouth he sat looking out through the doorway at the gigantic fire flies traversing the quiet streets if this was a message to him from ida what could it mean save an overture at reconciliation and if that why had she not used the same methods of the post instead of this uncertain and even flippant means of communication a note in an empty bottle cast into the sea there was something light and frivolous about it if not actually contemptuous the thought stirred his pride and subdued whatever emotions had been resurrected by the finding of the bottle geddie put on his coat and hat and walked out he followed a street that led him along the border of the little plaza where a band was playing and people were rambling care free and indolent some timorous senoritas scurrying past with fire flies tangled in the jetty braids of their hair glanced at him with shy flattering eyes the air was languorous with the scent of jasmin and orange blossoms the consul stayed his steps at the house of bernard brannigan paula was swinging in a hammock on the gallery she rose from it like a bird from its nest the color came to her cheeck at the sound of geddie s voice he was charmed at the sight of her costume a flounced muslin dress with a little jacket of white flannel all made with neatness and style he suggested a stroll and they walked out to the old indian well on the hill road they sat on the curb and there geddie made the expected but long deferred speech certain though he had been that she would not say him nay he was still thrilled at the completeness and sweetness of her surrender here was surely a heart made for love and steadfastness here was no caprice or questionings or captious standards of convention when geddie kissed paula at her door that night he was happier than he had ever been before here in this hollow lotus land ever to live and lie reclined seemed to him as it has seemed to many mariners the best as well as the easiest his future would be an ideal one he had attained a paradise without a serpent his eve would be indeed a part of him unbeguiled and therefore more beguiling he had made his decision tonight and his heart was full of serene assured content geddie went back to his house whistling that finest and saddest love song la golondrina at the door his tame monkey leaped down from his shelf chattering briskly the consul turned to his desk to get him some nuts he usually kept there reaching in the half darkness his hand struck against the bottle he started as if he had touched the cold rotundity of a serpent he had forgotten that the bottle was there he lighted the lamp and fed the monkey then very deliberately he lighted a cigar and took the bottle in his hand and walked down the path to the beach there was a moon and the sea was glorious the breeze had shifted as it did each evening and was now rushing steadily seaward stepping to the water s edge geddie hurled the unopened bottle far out into the sea it disappeared for a moment and then shot upward twice its length geddie stood still watching it the moonlight was so bright that he could see it bobbing up and down with the little waves slowly it receded from the shore flashing and turning as it went the wind was carrying it out to sea soon it became a mere speck doubtfully discerned at irregular intervals and then the mystery of it was swallowed up by the greater mystery of the ocean geddie stood still upon the beach smoking and looking out upon the water simon oh simon wake up there simon bawled a sonorous voice at the edge of the water old simon cruz was a half breed fisherman and smuggler who lived in a hut on the beach out of his earliest nap simon was thus awakened he slipped on his shoes and went outside just landing from one of the valhalla s boats was the third mate of that vessel who was an acquaintance of simon s and three sailors from the fruiter go up simon called the mate and find doctor gregg or mr goodwin or anybody that s a friend to mr geddie and bring em here at once saints of the skies said simon sleepily nothing has happened to mr geddie he s under that tarpauling said the mate pointing to the boat and he s rather more than half drowned we seen him from the steamer nearly a mile out from shore swimmin like mad after a bottle that was floatin in the water outward bound we lowered the gig and started for him he nearly had his hand on the bottle when he gave out and went under we pulled him out in time to save him maybe but the doctor is the one to decide that a bottle said the old man rubbing his eyes he was not yet fully awake where is the bottle driftin along out there some eres said the mate jerking his thumb toward the sea get on with you simon iii smith goodwin and the ardent patriot zavalla took all the precautions that their foresight could contrive to prevent the escape of president miraflores and his companion the sent trusted messengers up the coast to solitas and alazan to warn the local leaders of the flight and to instruct them to patrol the water line and arrest the fugitives at all hazards should they reveal themselves in that territory after this was done there remained only to cover the district about coralio and await the coming of the quarry the nets were well spread the roads were so few the opportunities for embarkation so limited and the two or three probable points of exit so well guarded that it would be strange indeed if there should slip through the meshes so much of the country s dignity romance and collateral the president would without doubt move as secretly as possible and endeavor to board a vessel by stealth from some secluded point along the shore on the fourth day after the receipt of englehart s telegram the karlsefin a norwegian steamer chartered by the new orleans fruit trade anchored off coralio with three horse toots of her siren the karlesfin ws not one of the line operated by the vesuvius fruit company she was something of a dilettante doing odd jobs for a company that was scarcely important enough to figure as a rival to the vesuvius the movements of the karlesfin were dependent upon the state of the market sometimes she would ply steadily between the spanish main and new orleans in the regular transport of fruit next she would be maing erratic trips to mobile or charleston or even as far north as new york according to the distribution of the fruit supply goodwin lounged upon the beach with the susual crowd of idlers that had gathered to view the steamer now that president miraflores might be expected to reach the borders of his abjured country at any time the orders were to keep a strict and unrelenting watch every vessel that approached the shores might now be considered a possible means of escape for the fugitives and an eye was kept even on the slopes and dories that belonged to the sea going contingent of coralio goodwin and zavalla moved everywhere but without ostentation watching the loopholes of escape the customs official crowded importantly into their boat and rowed out to the karlesfin a boat from the steamer landed her purser with his papers and took out the quarantine doctor with his green umbrella and clinical thermometer next a swarm of caribs began to load upon lighters the thousands of bunches of bananas heaped upon the shore and row them out to the steamer the karlesfin had no passenger list and was soon done with the attention of the authorities the purser declared that the steamer would remain at anchor until morning taking on her fruit during the night the karlesfin had come he said from new york to which port her latest load of oranges and coconuts had been conveyed two or three of the freighter sloops were engaged to assist in the work for the captain was anxious to make a quick return in order to reap the advantage offered by a certain dearth of fruit in the states about four o clock in the afternoon another of those marine monsters not very familiar in those waters hove in sight following the fateful idalia a graceful steam yacht painted a light buff clean cut as a steel engraving the beautiful vessel hovered off shore see sawing the waves as lightly as a duck in a rain barrel a swift boat manned by a crew in uniform came ashore and a stocky built man leaped to the sands the newcomer seemed to turn a disapproving eye upon the rather motley congregation of native anchurians and made his way at once toward goodwin who was the most conspicuously anglo saxon figure present goodwin greeted him with courtesy conversation developed that the newly landed one was named smith and that he had come in a yacht a meagre biography truly for the yacht was most apparent and the smith not beyond a reasonable guess before the revelation yet to the eye of goodwin who has seen several things there was a discrepancy between smith and his yacht a bullet headed man smith was with an oblique dead eye and the moustache of a cocktail mixer and unless he had shifted costumes before putting off for shore he had affronted the deck of his correct vessel clad in a pearl gray derby a gay plaid suit and vaudeville neckwear men owning pleasure yachts generally harmonize better with them smith looked business but he was no advertiser he commented upon the scenery remarking upon its fidelity to the pictures in the geography and then inquired for the united states consul goodwin pointed out the starred and striped bunting hanging from above the little consulate which was concealed behind the orange trees mr geddie the consul will be sure to be there said goodwin he was very nearly drowned a few days ago while taking a swim in the sea and the doctor has ordered him to remain indoors for some time smith ploughed his way through the sand to the consulate his haberdashery creating violent discord against the smooth tropical blues and greens geddie was lounging in his hammock somewhat pale of face and languid in pose on that night when the valhalla s boat had brought him ashore apparently drenched to death by the sea doctor gregg and his other friends had toiled for hours to preserve the little spark of life that remained to him the bottle with its impotent message was gone out to sea and the problem that it had provoked was reduced to a simple sum in addition one and one make two by the rule of arithmetic one by the rule of romance there is a quaint old theory that man may have two souls a peripheral one which serves ordinarily and a central one which is stirred only at certain times but then with activity and vigor while under the domination of the former a man will shave vote pay taxes give money to his family buy subscription books and comport himself on the average plan but let the central soul suddenly become dominant and he may in the twinkling of an eye turn upon the partner of his joys with furious execration he may change his politics while you could snap your fingers he may deal out deadly insult to his dearest friend he may get him instanter to a monastery or a dance hall he may elope or hang himself or he may write a song or poem or kiss his wife unasked or give his funds to the search of a microbe then the peripheral soul will return and we have our safe sane citizen again it is but the revolt of the ego against order and its effect is to shake up the atoms only that they may settle where they belong geddie s revulsion had been a mild one no more than a swim in a summer sea after so inglorious an object as a drifting bottle and now he was himself again upon his desk ready for the post was a letter to his government tendering his resignation as consul to be effective as soon as another could be appointed in his place for bernard brannigan who never did things in a half way manner was to take geddie at once for a partner in his very profitable and various enterprises and paula was happily engaged in plans for refurnishing and decorating the upper story of the brannigan house the consul rose from his hammock when he saw the conspicuous stranger at this door keep your seat old man said the visitor with an airy wave of his large hand my name s smith and i ve come in a yacht you are the consul is that right a big cool guy on the beach directed me here thought i d pay my respects to the flag sit down said geddie i ve been admiring your craft ever since it came in sight looks like a fast sailer what s her tonnage search me said smith i don t know what she weighs in at but she s got a tidy gait the rambler that s her name don t take the dust of anything afloat this is my first trip on her i m taking a squint along this coast just to get an idea of the countries where the rubber and red pepper and revolutions come from i had no idea there was so much scenery down here why central park ain t in it with this neck of the woods i m from new york they get monkeys and coconuts and parrots down here is that right we have them all said geddie i m quite sure that our fauna and flora would take a prize over central park maybe they would admitted smith cheerfully i haven t seen them yet but i guess you ve got us skinned on the animal and vegetation question you don t have much travel here do you travel queried the consul i suppose you mean passengers on steamers no very few people land in coralio an investor now and then tourists and sightseers generally go further down the coast to one of the larger towns where there is a harbor i see a ship out there loading up with bananas said smith any passengers come on her that s the karlesfin said the consul she s a tramp fruiter made her last trip to new york i believe no she brought no passengers i saw her boat come ashore and there was no one about the only exciting recreation we have here is watching steamers when they arrive and a passenger on one of them generally causes the whole town to turn out if you are going to remain in coralio a while mr smith i ll be glad to take you around to meet some people there are four or five american chaps that are good to know besides the native high fliers thanks said the yachtsman but i wouldn t put you the trouble i d like to meet the guys you speak of but i won t be here long enough to do much knocking around that cool gent on the beach spoke of a doctor can you tell me where to find him the rambler ain t quite as steady on her feet as a broadway hotel and a fellow gets a touch of seasickness now and then thought i d strike the croaker for a handful of the little sugar pills in case i need em you will be apt to find doctor gregg at the hotel said the consul you can see it from the door it s that two story building with the balcony where the orange trees are the hotel de los extranjeros was a dreary hostelry in great disuse both by strangers and friends it stood at a corner of the street of the holy sepulchre a grove of small orange trees crowded against one side of it enclosed by a low rock wall over which a tall man might easily step the house was of plastered adobe stained a hundred shades of color by the salt breeze and the sun upon its upper balcony opened a central door and two windows containing broad jalousies instead of sashes the lower floor communicated by two doorways with the narrow rock paved sidewalk the pulperia or drinking shop of the proprietess madama timotea ortiz occupied the ground floor on the bottles of brandy anisada scotch smoke and inexpensive wines behind the little counter the dust lay thick save where the fingers of infrequent customers had left irregular prints the upper story contained four or five guest rooms which were rarely put to their destined use sometimes a fruitgrower riding in from his plantation to confer with his agent would pass a melancholy night in the dismal upper story sometimes a minor native official on some trifling government quest would have his pomp and majesty awed by madama s sepulchral hospitality but madama sat behind her bar content not desiring to quarrel with fate if any one required meat drink or lodging at the hotel de los extranjeros they had but to come and be served esta bueno if they came not why then they came not esta bueno as the exceptional yachtsman was making his way down the precarious sidewalk of the street of the holy sepulchre the solitary permanent guest of that decaying hotel sat at its door enjoying the breeze from the sea doctor gregg the quarantine physician was a man of fifty or sixty with a florid face and the longest beard between topeka and terra del fuego he held his position by virtue of an appointment by the board of health of a seaport city in one of the southern states that city feared the ancient enemy of every southern seaport the yellow fever and it was the duty of doctor gregg to examine crew and passengers of every vessel leaving coralio for preliminary symptoms the duties were light and the salary for one who lived in coralio ample surplus time there was in plenty and the good doctor added to his gains by a large private practice among the residents of the coast the fact that he did not know ten words of spanish was no obstacle a pulse could be felt and a fee collected without one being a linguist add to the description the facts that the doctor had a story to tell concerning the operation of trepanning which no listener had ever allowed him to conclude and that he believed in brandy as a prophylactic and the special points of interest possessed by doctor gregg will have become exhausted the doctor had dragged a chair to the sidewalk he was coatless and he leaned back against the wall and smoked while he stroked his beard surprise came into his pale blue eyes when he caught sight of smith in his unusual and prismatic clothes you re doctor gregg is that right said smith feeling the dog s head pin in his tie the constable i mean the consul told me you hung out at this caravansary my name s smith and i came in a yacht taking a cruise around looking at the monkeys and pineapple trees come inside and have a drink doc this cafe looks on the blink but i guess it can set out something wet i will join you sir in just a taste of brandy said doctor gregg rising quickly i find that as a prophylactic a little brandy is almost a necessity in this climate as they turned to enter the pulperia a native man barefoot glided noiselessly up and addressed the doctor in spanish he was yellowish brown like an over ripe lemon he wore a cotton shirt and ragged linen trousers girded by a leather belt his face was like an animal s live and wary but without promise of much intelligence this man jabbered with animation and so much seriousness that it seemed a pity that his words were to be wasted doctor gregg felt his pulse you sick he inquired mi mujer es enferma en la casa said the man thus endeavoring to convey the news in the only language open to him that his wife lay ill in her palm thatched hut the doctor drew a handful of capsules filled with a white powder from his trousers pocket he counted out ten of them into the native s hand and held up his forefinger impressively take one said the doctor every two hours he then held up two fingers shaking them emphatically before the native s face next he pulled out his watch and ran his finger round the dial twice again the two fingers confronted the patient s nose two two two hours repeated the doctor si senor said the native sadly he pulled a cheap silver watch from his own pocket and laid it in the doctor s hand me bring said he struggling painfully with his scant english other watchy tomorrow then he departed downheartedly with his capsules a very ignorant race of people sir said the doctor as he slipped the watch into his pocket he seems to have mistaken my directions for taking the physic for the fee however it is all right he owes me an account anyway the chances are that he won t bring the other watch you can t depend on anything they promise you about that drink now how did you come to coralio mr smith i was not aware that any boats except the karlesfin had arrived for some days the two leaned against the deserted bar and madama set out a bottle without waiting for the doctor s order there was no dust on it after they had drank twice smith said you say there were no passengers on the karlesfin doc are you sure about that it seems to me i heard somebody down on the beach say that there was one or two aboard they were mistaken sir i myself went out and put all hands through a medical examination as usual the karlesfin sails as soon as she gets her bananas loaded which will be about daylight in the morning and she got everything ready this afternoon no sir there was no passenger list like that three star a french schooner landed two slooploads of it a month ago if any customs duties on it went to the distinguished republic of anchuria you may have my hat if you won t have another come out and let s sit in the cool a while it isn t often we exiles get a chance to talk with somebody from the outside world the doctor brought out another chair to the sidewalk for his new acquaintance the two seated themselves you are a man of the world said doctor gregg a man of travel and experience your decision in a matter of ethics and no doubt on the points of equity ability and professional probity should be of value i would be glad if you will listen to the history of a case that i think stands unique in medical annals about nine years ago while i was engaged in the practice of medicine in my native city i was called to treat a case of contusion of the skull i made the diagnosis that a splinter of bone was pressing upon the brain and that the surgical operation known as trepanning was required however as the patient was a gentleman of wealth and position i called in for consultation doctor smith rose from his chair and laid a hand soft with apology upon the doctor s shirt sleeve say doc he said solemnly i want to hear that story you ve got me interrested and i don t want to miss the rest of it i know it s a loola by the way it begins and i want to tell it at the next meeting of the barney o flynn association if you don t mind but i ve got one or two matters to attend to first if i get em attended to in time i ll come right back and hear you spiel the rest before bedtime is that right by all means said the doctor get your business attended to and then return i shall wait up for you you see one of the most prominent physicians at the consultation diagnosed the trouble as a blood clot another said it was an abscess but i don t tell me now doc don t spoil the story wait till i come back i want to hear it as it runs off the reel is that right the mountains reached up their bulky shoulders to receive the level gallop of apollo s homing steeds the day died in the lagoons and in the shadowed banana groves and in the mangrove swamps where the great blue crabs were beginning to crawl to land for their nightly ramble and it died at last upon the highest peaks then the brief twilight ephemeral as the flight of a moth came and went the southern cross peeped with its topmost eye above a row of palms and the fire flies heralded with their torches and approach of soft footed night in the offing the karlesfin swayed at anchor her lights seeming to penetrate the water to countless fathoms with their shimmering lanceolate reflections the caribs were busy loading her by means of the great lighters heaped full from the piles of fruit ranged upon the shore on the sandy beach with his back against a coconut tree and the stubs of many cigars lying around him smith sat waiting never relaxing his sharp gaze in the direction of the steamer the incongruous yachtsman had concentrated his interest upon the innocent fruiter twice had he been assured that no passengers had come to coralio on board of her and yet with a persistence not to be attributed to an idling voyager he had appealed the case to the higher court of his own eyesight surprisingly like some gay coated lizard he crouched at the foot of the coconut palm and with the beady shifting eyes of the selfsame reptile sustained his espionage on the karlesfin on the white sands a whiter gig belonging to the yacht was drawn up guarded by one of the white ducked crew not far away in a pulperia on the shore following calle grande three other sailors swaggerred with their cues around coralio s solitary billiard table the boat lay there as if under orders to be ready for use at any moment there was in the atmosphere a hint of expectation of waiting for something to occur which was foreign to the air of coralio like some passing bird of brilliant plumage smith alights on this palmy shore but to preen his wings for an instant and then to fly away upon silent pinions when morning dawned there was no smith no waiting gig no yacht in the offing smith left no intimation of his mission there no footprints to show where he had followed the trail of his mystery on the sands of coralio that night he came he spake his strange jargon of the asphalt and the cafes he sat under the coconut tree and vanished the next morning coralio smithless ate its fried plantain and said the man of pictured clothing went himself away with the siesta the incident passed yawning into history so for a time must smith pass behind the scenes of the play he comes no more to coralio nor to doctor gregg who sits in vain wagging his redundant beard waiting to enrich his derelict audience with his moving tale of trepanning and jealousy but prosperously to the lucidity of these loose pages smith shall flutter among them again in the nick of time he shall come to tell us why he strewed so many anxious cigar stumps around the coconut palm that night this he must do for when he sailed away before the dawn in his yacht rambler he carried with him the answer to a riddle so big and preposterous that few in anchuria had ventured even to propound it iv caught the plans for the detention of the flying president miraflores and his companion at the coast line seemed hardly likely to fail doctor zavalla himself had gone to the port of alazan to establish a guard at that point at solitas the liberal patriot varras could be depended upon to keep close watch goodwin held himself responsible for the district about coralio the news of the president s flight had been disclosed to no one in the coast towns save trusted members of the ambitious political party that was desirous of succeeding to power the telegraph wire running from san mateo to the coast had been cut far up on the mountain trail by an emissary of zavalla s long before this could be repaired and word received along it from the capital the fugitives would have reached the coast and the question of escape or capture been solved goodwin had stationed armed sentinels at frequent intervals along the shore for a mile in each direction from coralio they were instructed to keep a vigilant lookout during the night to prevent miraflores from attempting to embark stealthily by means of some boat or sloop found by chance at the water s edge a dozen patrols walked the streets of coralio unsuspected ready to intercept the truant official should he show himself there goodwin was very well convinced that no precautions had been overlooked he strolled about the streets that bore such high sounding names and were but narrow grass covered lanes lending his own aid to the vigil that had been intrusted to him by bob englehart the town had begun the tepid round of its nightly diversions a few leisurely dandies cald in white duck with flowing neckties and swinging slim bamboo canes threaded the grassy by ways toward the houses of their favored senoritas those who wooed the art of music dragged tirelessly at whining concertinas or fingered lugubrious guitars at doors and windows an occasional soldier from the cuartel with flapping straw hat without coat or shoes hurried by balancing his long gun like a lance in one hand from every density of the foliage the giant tree frogs sounded their loud and irritating clatter further out the guttural cries of marauding baboons and the coughing of the alligators in the black estuaries fractured the vain silence of the wood by ten o clock the streets were deserted the oil lamps that had burned a sickly yellow at random corners had been extinguished by some economical civic agent coralio lay sleeping calmly between toppling mountains and encroaching sea like a stolen babe in the arms of its abductors somewhere over in that tropical darkness perhaps already threading the profundities of the alluvial lowlands the high adventurer and his mate were moving toward land s end the game of fox in the morning should be coming soon to its close goodwin at his deliberate gait passed the long low cuartel where coralio s contingent of anchuria s military force slumbered with its bare toes pointed heavenward there was a law that no civilian might come so near the headquarters of that citadel of war after nine o clock but goodwin was always forgetting the minor statutes quien vive shrieked the sentinel wrestling prodigiously with his lengthy musket americano growled goodwin without turning his head and passed on unhalted to the right he turned and to the left up the street that ultimately reached the plaza nacional when within the toss of a cigar stump from the intersecting street of the holy sepulchre he stopped suddenly in the pathway he saw the form of a tall man clothed in black and carrying a large valise hurry down the cross street in the direction of the beach and goodwin s second glance made him aware of a woman at the man s elbow on the farther side who seemed to urge forward if not even to assist her companion in their swift but silent progress they were no coralians those two goodwin followed at increased speed but without any of the artful tactics that are so dear to the heart of the sleuth the american was too broad to feel the instinct of the detective he stood as an agent for the people of anchuria and but for political reasons he would have demanded then and there the money it was the design of his party to secure the imperilled fund to restore it to the treasury of the country and to declare itself in power without bloodshed or resistance the couple halted at the door of the hotel de los extranjeros and the man struck upon the wood with the impatience of one unused to his entry being stayed madama was long in response but after a time her light showed the door was opened and the guests housed goodwin stoodin the quiet street lighting another cigar in two minutes a faint gleam began to show between the slats of the jalousies in the upper story of the hotel they have engaged rooms said goodwin to himself so then their arrangements for sailing have yet to be made at the moment there came along one esteban delgado a barber an enemy to existing government a jovial plotter against stagnation in any form this barber was one of coralio s saddest dogs often remaining out of doors as late as eleven post meridian he was a partisan liberal and he greeted goodwin with flatulent importance as a brother in the cause but he had something important to tell what think you don frank he cried in the universal tone of the conspirator i have tonight shaved la barba what you call the weeskers of the presidente himself of this countree consider he sent for me to come in the poor casita of an old woman he awaited me in a verree leetle house in a dark place carramba el senor presidente to make himself thus secret and obscured i shave a man and not see his face this gold piece he gave me and said it was to be all quite still i think don frank there is what you call a chip over the bug have you ever seen president miraflores before asked goodwin but once answered esteban he is tall and he had weeskers verree black and sufficient was any one else present when you shaved him an old indian woman senor that belonged with the casa and one senorita a ladee of so much beautee ah dios all right esteban said goodwin it s very lucky that you happened along with your tonsorial information the new administration will be likely to remember you for this then in a few words he made the barber acquainted with the crisis into which the affairs of the nation had culminated and instructed him to remain outside keeping watch upon the two sides of the hotel that looked upon the street and observing whether any one should attempt to leave the house by any door or window goodwin himself went to the door through which the guests had entered opened it and stepped inside madama had returned downstairs from her journey above to see after the comfort of her lodgers her candle stood upon the bar she was about to take a thimbleful of rum as a solace for having her rest disturbed she looked up without surprise or alarm as her third caller entered ah it is the senor goodwin not often does he honor my poor house with his presence i must come oftener said goodwin with a goodwin smile i hear that your cognac is the best between belize to the north and rio to the south set out the bottle madama and let us have the proof in un vasito for each of us my aguardiente said madama with pride is the best it grows in beautiful bottles in the dark places among the banana trees si senor only at midnight can they be picked by sailor men who bring them before daylight comes to your back door good aguardiente is a verree difficult fruit to handle senor goodwin smuggling in coralio was much nearer than competition to being the life of trade one spoke of it slyly yet with a certain conceit when it had been well accomplished you have guests in the house tonight said goodwin laying a silver dollar upon the counter why not said madama counting the change two but the smallest while finished to arrive one senor not quite old and one senorita of sufficient hadsomeness to their rooms they have ascended not desiring the to eat nor the to drink two rooms numero and numero i was expecting that gentleman and that lady said goodwin i have important negocios that must be transacted will you allow me to see them why not sighed madama placidly why should not senor goodwin ascend and speak to his friends esta bueno romm numero and romm numero goodwin loosened in his coat pocket the american revolver that he carried and ascended the steep dark stairway in the hallway above the saffron light from a hanging lamp allowed him to select the gaudy numbers on the doors he turned the knob on number entered and closed the door behind him if that was isabel guilbert seated by the table in that poorly furnished room report had failed to do her charms justice she rested her head upon one hand extreme fatigue was signified in every line of her figure and upon her countenance a deep perplexity was written her eyes were gray irised and of that mold that seems to have belonged to the orbs of all the famous queens of hearts their whites were singularly clear and brilliant concealed above the irises by heavy horizontal lids and showing a snowy line between them such eyes denote great nobility vigor and if you can conceive of it a most generous selfishness she looked up when the american entered with an expression of surprised inquiry but without alarm goodwin took off his hat and seated himself with his characteristic deliberate ease upon a corner of the table he held a lighted cigar between his fingers he took this familiar course because he was sure that preliminaries would be wasted upon miss guilbert he knew her history and the small part that the conventions had played in it good evening he said now madame let us come to business at once you will observe that i mention no names but i know who is in the next room and what he carries in that valise that is the point which brings me here i have come to dictate terms of surrender the lady neither moved nor replied but steadily regarded the cigar in goodwin s hand we continued the dictator thoughtfully regarding the neat buckskin shoe on his gently swinging foot i speak for a considerable majority of the people demand the return of the stolen funds belonging to them our terms go very little further than that they are very simple as an accredited spokesman i promise that our interference will cease if they are accepted give up the money and you and your companion will be permitted to proceed wherever you will in fact assistance will be given you in the matter of securing a passage by any outgoing vessel you may choose it is on my personal responsibility that i add congratulations to the gentleman in number upon his taste in feminine charms returning his cigar to his mouth goodwin observed her and saw that her eyes followed it and rested upon it with icy and significant concentration apparently she had not heard a word he had said he understood tossed the cigar out the window and with an amused laugh slid from the table to his feet that is better said the lady it makes it possible for me to listen to you for a second lesson in good manners you might now tell me by whom i am being insulted i am sorry said goodwin leaning one hand on the table that my time is too brief for devoting much of it to a course of etiquette come now i appeal to you good sense you have shown yourself in more than one instance to be well aware of what is to your advantage this is an occasion that demands the exercise of your undoubted intelligence there is no mystery here i am frank goodwin and i have come for the money i entered this room at a venture had i entered the other i would have had it before me now do you want it in words the gentleman in number has betrayed a great trust he has robbed his people of a large sum and it is i who will prevent their losing it i do not say who that gentleman is but if i should be forced to see him and he should prove to be a certain high official of the republic it will be my duty to arrest him the house is guarded i am offering you liberal terms it is not absolutely necessary that i confer personally with the gentleman in the next room bring me the valise containing the money and we will call the affair ended the lady arose from her chair and stood for a moment thinking deeply do you live here mr goodwin she asked presently yes what is your authority for this intrusion i am an instrument of the republic i was advised by wire of the movements of the gentleman in number may i ask you two or three questions i believe you to be a man more apt to be truthful than timid what sort of town is this coralio i think they call it not much of a town said goodwin smiling a banana town as they run grass huts dobes five or six two story houses accomodations limited population half breed spanish and indian caribs and blackamoors no sidewalks to speak of no amusements rather unmoral that a an offhand sketch of course are there any inducements say in a social or in a business way for people to reside here oh yes answered goodwin smiling broadly there are no afternoon teas no hand organs no department stores and there is no extradition treaty he told me went on the lady speaking as if to herself and with a slight frown that there were towns on this coast of beauty and importance that there was a pleasing social order especially an american colony of cultured residents there is an american colony said goodwin gazing at her in some wonder some of the members are all right some are fugitives from justice from the states i recall two exiled bank presidents one army paymaster under a cloud a couple of manslayers and a widow arsenic i believe was the suspicion in her case i myself complete the colony but as yet i have not distinguished myself by any particular crime do not lose hope said the lady dryly i see nothing in your actions tonight to guarantee you further obscurity some mistake has been made i do not know just where but him you shall not disturb tonight the journey has fatigued him so that he has fallen asleep i think in his clothes you talk of stolen money i do not understand you some mistake has been made i will convince you remain where you are and i will bring you the valise that you seem to covet so and show it to you she moved toward the closed door that connected the two rooms but stopped and half turned and bestowed upon goodwin a grave searching look that ended in a quizzical smile you force my door she said and you follow your ruffianly behavior with the basest accusations and yet she hesitated as if to reconsider what she was about to say and yet it is a puzzling thing i am sure there has been some mistake she took a step toward the door but goodwin stayed her by a light touch upon her arm i have said before that women turned to look at him in the streets he was the viking sort of man big good looking and with an air of kindly truculence she was dark and proud glowing or pale as her mood moved her i do not know if eve were light or dark but if such a woman had stood in the garden i know that the apple would have been eaten this woman was to be goodwin s fate and he did not know it but he must have felt the first throes of destiny for as he faced her the knowledge of what report named her turned bitter in her throat if there has been any mistake he said hotly it was yours i do not blame the man who has lost his country his honor and is about to lose the poor consolation of his stolen riches as much as i blame you for by heaven i can very well see how he was brought to it i can understand and pity him it is such women as you that strew this degraded coast with wretched exiles that make men forget their trusts that drag the lady interrupted him with a weary gesture there is no need to continue your insults she said coldly i do not understand what you are saying nor do i know what mad blunder you are making but if the inspection of the contents of a gentleman s portmanteau will rid me of you let us delay it no longer she passed quickly and noiselessly into the other room and returned with the heavy leather valise which she handed to the american with an air of patient contempt goodwin set the valise quickly upon the table and began to unfasten the straps the lady stood by with an expression of infinite scorn and weariness upon her face the valise opened wide to a powerful sidelong wrench goodwin dragged out two or three articles of clothing exposing the bulk of its contents package after package of tightly packed united states bank and treasury notes of large denomination reckoning from the high figures written upon the paper bands that bound them the total must have come closely upon the hundred thousand mark goodwin glanced swiftly at the woman and saw with surprise and a thrill of pleasure that he wondered at that she had experienced an unmistakeable shock her eyes grew wide she gasped and leaned heavily against the table she had been ignorant then he inferred that her companion had looted the government treasury but why he angrily asked himself should he be so well pleased to think this wandering and unscrupulous singer not so black as report had painted her a noise in the other room startled them both the door swung open and a tall elderly dark complexioned man recently shaven hurried into the room all the pictures of president miraflores represent him as the possessor of a luxuriant supply of dark and carefully tended whiskers but the story of the barber esteban had prepared goodwin for the change the man stumbled in from the dark room his eyes blinking at the lamplight and heavy from sleep what does this mean he demanded in excellent english with a keen and perturbed look at the american robbery very near it answered goodwin but i rather think i m in time to prevent it i represent the people to whom this money belongs and i have come to convey it back to them he thrust his hand into a pocket of his loose linen coat the other man s hand went quickly behind him don t draw called goodwin sharply i ve got you covered from my pocket the lady stepped forward and laid one hand upon the shoulder of her hesitating companion she pointed to the table tell me the truth the truth she said in a low voice whose money is that the man did not answer he gave a deep long drawn sigh leaned and kissed her on the forehead stepped back into the other room and closed the door goodwin foresaw his purpose and jumped for the door but the report of the pistol echoed as his hand touched the knob a heavy fall followed and some one swept him aside and struggled into the room of the fallen man a desolation thought goodwin greater than that derived from the loss of cavalier and gold must have been in the heart of the enchantress to have wrung from her in that moment the cry of one turning to the all forgiving all comforting earthly consoler to have made her call out from that bloody and dishonored room oh mother mother mother but there was an alarm outside the barber esteban at the sound of the shot had raised his voice and the shot itself had aroused half the town a pattering of feet came up the street and official orders rang out on the still air goodwin had a duty to perform circumstances had made him the custodian of his adopted country s treasure swiftly cramming the money into the valise he closed it leaned far out of the window and dropped it into a thick orange tree in the little inclosure below they will tell you in coralio as they delight in telling the stranger of the conclusion of that tragic flight they will tell you how the upholders of the law came apace when the alarm was sounded the comandante in red slippers and a jacket like a head waiter s and girded sword the soldiers with their interminable guns followed by outnumbering officers struggling into their gold and lace epaulettes the bare footed policemen the only capables in the lot and ruffled citizens of every hue and description they say that the countenance of the dead man was marred sadly by the effects of the shot but he was identified as the fallen president by both goodwin and the barber esteban on the next morning messages began to come over the mended telegraph wire and the story of the flight from the capital was given out to the public in san mateo the revolutionary party had seized the sceptre of government without opposition and the vivas of the mercurial populace quickly effaced the interest belonging to the unfortunate miraflores they will relate to you how the new government sifted the towns and raked the roads to find the valise containing anchuria s surplus capital which the president was known to have carried with him but all in vain in coralio senor goodwin himself led the searching party which combed that town as carefully as a woman combs her hair but the money was not found so they buried the dead man without honors back of the town near the little bridge that spans the mangrove swamp and for a real a boy will show you his grave they say that the old woman in whose hut the barber shaved the president placed the wooden slab at his head and burned the inscription upon it with a hot iron you will hear also that senor goodwin like a tower of strength shielded dona isabel guilbert through those subsequent distressful days and that his scruples as to her past career if he had any vanished and her adventuresome waywardness if she had any left her and they were wedded and were happy the american built a home on a little foothill near the town it is a conglomerate structure of native woods that exported would be worth a fortune and of brick palm glass bamboo and adobe there is a paradise of nature about it and something of the same sort within the natives speak of its interior with hands uplifted in admiration there are floors polished like mirrors and covered with hand woven indian rugs of silk fibre tall ornaments and pictures musical instruments and papered walls figure it to yourself they exclaim but they cannot tell you in coralio as you shall learn what became of the money that frank goodwin dropped into the orange tree but that shall come later for the palms are fluttering in the breeze bidding us to sport and gaiety v cupid s exile number two the united states of america after looking over its stock of consular timber selected mr john de graffenreid atwood of dalesburg alabama for a successor to willard geddie resigned without prejudice to mr atwood it will have to be acknowledged that in this instance it was the man who sought the office as with the self banished geddie it was nothing less than the artful smiles of lovely woman that had driven johnny atwood to the desperate expedient of accepting office under a despised federal government so that he might go far far away and never see again the false fair face that had wrecked his young life the consulship at coralio seemed to offer a retreat sufficiently removed and romantic enough to inject the necessary drama into the pastoral scenes of dalesburg life it was while playing the part of cupid s exile that johnny added his handiwork to the long list of casualties along the spanish main by his famous manipulation of the shoe market and his unparalleled feat of elevating the most despised and useless weed in his own country from obscurity to be a valuable product in international commerce the trouble began as trouble often begins instead of ending with a romance in dalesburg there was a man named elijah hemstetter who kept a general store his family consisted of one daughter called rosine a name that atoned much for hemstetter this young woman was possessed of plentiful attractions so that the young men of the community were agitated in their bosoms among the more agitated was johnny the son of judge atwood who lived in the big colonial mansion on the edge of dalesburg it would seem that the desirable rosine should have been pleased to return the affection of an atwood a name honored all over the state long before and since the war it does seem that she should have gladly consented to have been led into that stately but rather empty colonial mansion but not so there was a cloud on the horizon a threatening cumulus cloud in the shape of a lively and shrewd young farmer in the neighborhood who dared to enter the lists as a rival to the high born atwood one night johnny propounded to rosine a question that is considered of much importance by the young of the human species the accessories were all there moonlight oleanders magnolias the mockingbird s song whether or no the shadow of pinkney dawson that prosperous young farmer came between them on that occasion is not known but rosine s answer was unfavorable mr john de graffenreid atwood bowed till his hat touched the lawn grass and went away with his head high but with a sore wound in his pedigree and heart a hemstetter refuse an atwood zounds among other accidents of that year was a democratic president judge atwood was a warhorse of democracy johnny persuaded him to set the wheels moving for some foreign appointment he would go away away perhaps in years to come rosine would think how true how faithful his love had been and would drop a tear maybe in the cream she would be skimming for pink dawson s breakfast the wheels of politics revolved and johnny was appointed consul to coralio just before leaving he dropped in at hemstetter s to say good bye there was a queer pinkish look about rosine s eyes and had the two been alone the united states might have had to cast about for another consul but pink dawson was there of course talking about his acre orchard and the three mile alfalfa tract and the acre pasture so johnny shook hands with rosine as coolly as if he were only going to run up to montgomery for a couple of days they had the royal manner when they chose those atwoods if you happen to strike anything in the way of a good investment down there johnny said pink dawson just let me know will you i reckon i could lay my hands on a few extra thousands most any time for a profitable deal certainly pink said johnny pleasantly if i strike anything of that sort i ll let you in with pleasure so johnny went down to mobile and took a fruit steamer for the coast of anchuria when the new consul arrived in coralio the strangeness of the scenes diverted him much he was only twenty two and the grief of youth was not worn like a garment as it is by older men it has its seasons when it reigns and then it is unseated for time by the assertion of the keen senses billy keogh and johnny seemed to conceive a mutual friendship at once keogh took the new consul about town and presented him to the handful of americans and the smaller number of french and germans who made up the foreign contingent and then of course he had to be more formally introduced to the native officials and have his credentials transmitted through an interpreter there was something about the young southerner that the sophisticated keogh liked his manner was simple almost to boyishness but he possessed the cool carelessness of a man of far greater age and experience neither uniforms nor titles red tape nor foreign languages mountains nor sea weighed upon his spirits he was heir to all ages an atwood of dalesburg and you might know every thought conceived to his bosom geddie came down to the consulate to explain the duties and workings of the office he and keogh tried to interest the new consul in their description of the work that his government expected him to perform it s all right said johnnie from the hammock that he had set up as the official reclining place if anything turns up that has to be done i ll let you fellows do it you can t expect a democrat to work during his first term of holding office you might look over these headings suggested geddie of the different lines of exports you will have to keep account of the fruit is classified and there are the valuable woods coffee rubber that last account sounds all right interrupted mr atwood sounds as if it could be stretched i want to buy a new flag a monkey a guitar and a barrel of pineapples will the rubber account stretch over em that s merely statistics said geddie smiling the expense account is what you want it is supposed to have a slight elasticity the stationery items are sometimes carelessly audited by the state department we re wasting our time said keogh this man was born to hold office he penetrates to the root of the art at one step of his eagle eye the true genius of government shows its hand in every word of his speech i didn t take this job with any intention of working explained johnny lazily i wanted to go somewhere in the world where they didn t talk about farms there are none here are there not the kind you are acquainted with answered the ex consul there is no such art here as agriculture there never was a plow or a reaper within the boundaries of anchuria this is the country for me murmured the consul and immediately he fell asleep the cheerful tintypist pursued his intimacy with johnny in spite of open charges that he did so to obtain a preemption on a seat in that coveted spot the rear gallery of the consulate but whether his designs were selfish or purely friendly keogh achieved that desirable privilege few were the nights on which the two could not be found reposing there in the sea breeze with their heels on the railing and the cigars and brandy conveniently near one evening they sat thus mainly silent for their talk had dwindled before the stilling influence of an unusual night there was a great full moon and the sea mother of pearl almost every sound was hushed for the air was but faintly stirring and the town lay panting waiting for the night to cool offshore lay the fruit steamer andador of the vesuvius line full laden and scheduled to sail at six in the morning there were no loiterers on the beach so bright was the moonlight that the two men could see the small pebbles shining on the beach where the gentle surf wetted them then down the coast tacking close to shore slowly swam a little sloop white winged like some snowy sea fowl its course lay within twenty points of the wind s eye so it veered in and out again in long slow strokes like the movements of a graceful skater again the tactics of its crew brought it close in shore this time nearly opposite the consulate and then there blew from the sloop clear and surprising notes as if from a horn of elfland a fairy bugle it might have been sweet and silvery and unexpected playing with spirit the familiar air of home sweet home it was a scene set for the land of the lotus the authority of the sea and the tropics the mystery that attends unknown sails and the prestige of drifting music on moonlit waters gave it an anodynous charm johnny atwood felt it and thought of dalesburg but as soon as keogh s mind had arrived at a theory concerning the peripatetic solo he sprang to the railing and his ear rending yawp fractured the silence of coralio like a cannon shot mel lin ger a hoy the sloop was now on its outward tack but from it came a clear answering hail good bye billy go ing home bye the andador was the sloop s destination no doubt some passenger with a sailing permit from some up the coast point had come down in this sloop to catch the regular fruit steamer on its return trip like a coquettish pigeon the little boat tacked on its eccentric way until at last its white sail was lost to sight against the larger bulk of the fruiter s side that s old h p mellinger explained keogh dropping back into his chair he s going back to new york he was a private secretary of the late hot foot president of this grocery and fruit stand that they call a country his job s over now and i guess old mellinger is glad why does he disappear to music like zo zo the magic queen asked johnny just to show em that he doesn t care that noise you heard is a phonograph said keogh i sold him that mellinger had a graft in this country that was the only thing of its kind in the world the tooting machine saved it for him once and he always carried it around with him afterward tell me about it demanded johnny betraying interest i m no disseminator of narratives said keogh i can use language for purposes of speech but when i attempt a discourse the words come out as they will and they may make sense when they strike the atmosphere or they may not i want to hear about the graft persisted johnny you ve got no right to refuse i ve told you all about every man woman and hitching post in dalesburg you shall hear it said keogh i said my instincts of narrative were perplexed don t you believe it it s an art i ve acquired along with many other of the graces and sciences vi the phonograph and the graft what was this this graft asked johnny with the impatience of the great public to whom tales are told tis contrary to art and philosophy to give you the information said keogh calmly the art of narrative consists in concealing from your audience everything it wants to know until after you expose your favorite opinions on topics foreign to the subject a good story is like a bitter pill with the sugar coating inside of it i will begin if you please with a horoscope located in the cherokee nation and end with a moral tune on the phonograph me and henry horsecollar brought the first phonograph to this country henry was a quarter breed quarter back cherokee educated east in the idioms of football and west in contraband whiskey and a gentleman the same as you and me he was easy and romping in his ways a man about six foot with a kind of rubber tire movement yes he was a little man about five foot five or five foot eleven he was what you would call a medium tall man of average smallness henry had quit college once and the muscogee jail three times the last named institution on account of introducing and selling whisky in the territories henry horsecollar never let any cigar stores come up and stand behind him he didn t belong to that tribe of indians henry and me met at texarkana and figured out this phonograph scheme he had which came to him out of a land allotment in the reservation i had run down from little rock on account of a distressful scene i had witnessed on the street there a man stood on a box and passed around some gold watches screw case stem winders elgin movement very elegant twenty bucks they cost you over the counter at three dollars the crowd fought for the tickers the man happened to find a valise full of them handy and he passed them out like putting hot biscuits on a plate the backs were hard to unscrew but the crowd put its ear to the case and they ticked mollifying and agreeable three of these watches were genuine tickers the rest were only kickers hey why empty cases with one of them horny black bugs that fly around electric lights in em them bugs kick off minutes and seconds industrious and beautiful so this man i was speaking of cleaned up and then he went away because he knew that when it came time to wind watches in little rock an entomologist would be needed and he wasn t one so as i say henry had and i had the idea of introducing the phonograph to south america was henry s but i took to it freely being fond of machinery of all kinds the latin races says henry explaining easy in the idioms he learned at college are peculiarly adapted to be victims of the phonograph they yearn for music and color and gaiety they give wampum to the hand organ man and the four legged chicken in the tent when they re three months behind with the grocery and the bread fruit tree then says i we ll export canned music to the latins but i m mindful of mr julius caesar s account of em where he says omnia gallia in tres partes divisa est which is the same as to say we will need all of our gall in devising means to tree them parties i hated to make a show of education but i was disinclined to be overdone in syntax by a mere indian a member of a race to which we owe nothing except the land on which the united states is situated we bought a fine phonograph in texarkana one of the best make and half a trunkful of records we packed up and took the t and p for new orleans from that celebrated center of molasses and disfranchised coon songs we took a steamer for south america we landed at solitas forty miles up the coast from here twas a palatable enough place to look at the houses were clean and white and to look at em stuck around among the scenery they reminded you of hard boiled eggs served with lettuce there was a block of skyscraper mountains in the suburbs and they kept pretty quiet like they had crept up there and were watching the town and the sea was remarking sh sh sh on the beach and now and then a ripe coconut would drop kerblip in the sand and that was all there was doing yes i judge that town was considerably on the quiet i judge that after gabriel quits blowing his horn and the car starts with philadelphia swinging to the last strap and pine gully arkansas hanging onto the rear step this town of solitas will wake up and ask if anybody spoke the captain went ashore with us and offered to conduct what he seemed to like to call the obsequies he introduced henry and me to the united states consul and a roan man the head of the department of mercenary and licentious dispostions the way it read upon his sign i thouch here again a week from today says the captain by that time we told him we ll be amassing wealth in the interior towns with our galvanized prima donna and correct imitations of sousa s band excavating a march from a tin mine ye ll not says the captain ye ll be hypnotized any gentleman in the audience who kindly steps upon the stage and looks this country in the eye will be converted to the hypothesis that he s but a fly in the elgin creamery ye ll be standing knee deep in the surf waiting for me and your machine for making hamburger steak out of the hitherto respected art of music will be playing there s no place like home henry skinned a twenty off his roll and received from the bureau of mercenary dispositions a paper bearing a red seal and a dialect story and no change then we got the consul full of red wine and struck him for a horoscope he was a thin youngish kind of man i should say past fifty sort of french irish in his affections and puffed up with disconsolation yes he was a flattened kind of man in whom drink lay stagnant inclined to corpulence and misery yes i think he was a kind of dutchman being very sad and genial in his ways the marvelous invention he says entitled the phonograph has never invaded these shores the people have never heard it they would not believe it if they should simple hearted children of nature progress has never condemned them to accept the work of a can opener as an overture and rag time might incite them to a bloody revolution but you can try the experiment the best chance you have is that the populace may not wake up when you play there s two ways says the consul they may take it they may become inebriated with attention like an atlanta colonel listening to marching through georgia or they will get excited and transpose the key of the music with an axe and yourselves into a dungeon in the latter case says the consul i ll do my duty by cabling to the state department and i ll wrap the stars and stripes around you when you come to be shot and threaten them with the vengeance of the greatest gold export and financial reserve nation on earth the flag is full of bullet holes now says the consul made in that way twice before says the consul i have cabled our government for a couple of gunboats to protect american citizens the first time the department sent me a pair of gum boots the other time was when a man named pease was going to be executed here they referred that appeal to the secretary of agriculture let us now disturb the senor behind the bar for a subsequence of the red wine thus soliloquized the consul of solitas to me and henry horsecollar but notwithstanding we hired a room that afternoon in the calle de los angeles the main street that runs along the shore and put our trunks there twas a good sized room dark and cheerful but small twas on a various street diversified by houses and conservatory plants the peasantry of the city passed to and fro on the fine pasturage between the sidewalks twas for the world like an opera chorus when the royal kafoozlum is about to enter we were rubbing the dust off the machine and getting fixed to start business the next day when a big fine looking white man in white clothes stopped at the door and looked in we extended the invitations and he walked inside and sized us up he was chewing a long cigar and wrinkling his eyes meditative like a girl trying to decide which dress to wear to the party new york he says to me finally originally and from time to time i says hasn t it rubbed off yet it s simple says he when you know how it s the fit of the vest they don t cut vests right anywhere else coats maybe but not vests the white man looks at henry horsecollar and hesitates injun says henry tame injun mellinger says the man homer p mellinger boys you re confiscated you re babes in the wood without a chaperon or referee and it s my duty to start you going i ll knock out the props and launch you proper in the pellucid waters of this tropical mud puddle you ll have to be christened and if you ll come with me i ll break a bottle of wine across your bows according to hoyle well for two days homer p mellinger did the honors that man cut ice in anchuria he was it he was the royal kafoozlum if me and henry was babes in the wood he was a robin redbreast from the topmost bough him and me and henry horsecollar locked arms and toted that phonograph around and had wassail and diversions everywhere we found doors open we went inside and set the machine going and mellinger called upon the people to observe the artful music and his two lifelong friends the senores americanos the opera chorus was agitated with esteem and followed us from house to house there was a different kind of drink to be had with every tune the natives had acquirements of a pleasant thing in the way of a drink that gums itself to the recollection they chop off the end of a green coconut and pour in on the juice of it french brandy and other adjuvants we had them and other things mine and henry s money was counterfeit everything was on homer p mellinger that man could find rolls of bills concealed in places on his person where hermann the wizard couldn t have conjured out a rabbit or an omelette he could have founded universities and made orchid collections and then had enough left to purchase the colored vote of his country henry and me wondered what his graft was one evening he told us boys said he i ve deceived you you think i m a painted butterfly but in fact i m the hardest worked man in this country ten years ago i landed on its shores and two years ago on the point of its jaw yes i guess i can get the decision over this ginger cake commonwealth at the end of any round i choose i ll confide in you because you are my countrymen and guests even if you have assaulted my adopted shores with the worst system of noises ever set to music my job is private secretary to the president of this republic and my duties are running it i m not headlined in the bills but i m the mustard in the salad dressing just the same there isn t a law goes before congress there isn t a concession granted there isn t an import duty levied but what h p mellinger he cooks and seasons it in the front office i fill the president s inkstand and search visiting statesmen for dirks and dynamite but in the back room i dictate the policy of the government you d never guess in the world how i got my pull it s the only graft of its kind on earth i ll put you wise you remember the old top liner in the copy book honesty is the best policy that s it i m working honestly for a graft i m the only honest man in the republic the government knows it the people know it the boodlers know it the foreign investors know it i make the government keep its faith if a man is promised a job he gets it if outside capital buys a concession it gets the goods i run the monopoly of square dealing here there s no competition if colonel diogenes were to flash his lantern in this precinct he d have my address inside of two minutes there isn t big money in it but it s a sure thing and lets a man sleep of nights thus homer p mellinger made oration to me and henry horsecollar and later he divested himself of this remark boys i m to hold a soiree this evening with a gang of leading citizens and i want your assistance you bring the musical corn sheller and give the affair the outside appearance of a function there s important business on hand but it mustn t show i can talk to you people i ve been pained for years on account of not having anybody to blow off and brag to i get homesick sometimes and i d swap the entire perquisites of office for just one hour to have a stein and a caviar sandwich somewhere on thirty fourth street and stand and watch the street cars go by and smell the peanut roaster at old giuseppe s fruit stand yes said i there s fine caviar at billy renfrew s cafe corner of thirty fourth and god knows it interrupts mellinger and if you d told me you knew billy renfrew i d have invented tons of ways of making you happy billy was my side kicker in new york there is a man who never knew what crooked was here i am working honesty for a graft but that man loses money on it carrambos i get sick at times of this country everything s rotten from the executive down to the coffee pickers they re plotting to down each other and skin their friends if a mule driver takes off his hat to an official that man figures it out that he s a popular idol and set his pegs to stir up a revolution and upset the administration it s one of my little chores as private secretary to smell out these revolutions and affix the kibosh before they break out and scratch the paint off the government property that s why i m down here now in this mildewed coast town the governor of the district and his crew are plotting to uprise i ve got every one of their names and they re invited to listen to the phonograph tonight compliments of h p m that s the way i ll get them in a bunch and things are on the program to happen to them we three were sitting at table in the cantina of the purified saints mellinger poured out wine and was looking some worried i was thinking they re a sharp crowd he says kind of fretful they re capitalized by a foreign syndicate after rubber and they re loaded to the muzzle for bribing i m sick goes on mellinger of comic opera i want to smell east river and wear suspenders again at times i feel loke throwing up my job but i m d n fool enough to be sort of proud of it there s mellinger they say here por dios you can t touch him with a million i d like to take that record back and show it to billy renfrow some day and that tightens my grip whenever i see a fat thing that i could corral just by winking one eye and losing my graft by they can t monkey with me they know it what money i get i make honest and spend it some day i ll make a pile and go back and eat caviar with billy tonight i ll show you how to handle a bunch of corruptionists i ll show them what mellinger private secretary means when you spell it with the cotton and tissue paper off mellinger appears shaky and breaks his glass against the neck of the bottle i says to myself white man if i m not mistaken there s been a bait laid out where the tail of your eye could see it that night according to arrangements me and henry took the phonograph to a room in a dobe house in a dirty side street where the grass was knee high twas a long room lit with smoky oil lamps there was plenty of chairs and a table at the back end we set the phonograph on the table mellinger was there walking up and down disturbed in his predicaments he chewed cigars and spat em out and he bit the thumb nail of his left hand by and by the invitations to the musicale come sliding in by pairs and threes and spade flushes their color was of a diversity running from a three day s smoked meerschaum to a patent leather polish they were as polite as wax being devastated with enjoyments to give senor mellinger the good evenings i understood their spanish talk i ran a pumping engine two years in a mexican silver mine and had it pat but i never let on maybe fifty of em had come and was seated when in slid the king bee the governor of the district mellinger met him at the door and escorted him to the grand stand when i saw that latin man i knew that mellinger private secretary had all the dances on his card taken that was a big squashy man the color of a rubber overshoe and he had an eye like a head waiter s mellinger explained fluent in the castilian idioms that his soul was disconcerted with joy at introducing to his respected friends america s greatest invention the wonder of the age henry got the cue and run on an elegant brass band record and the festivities became initiated the governor man had a bit of english under his hat and when the music was choked off he says ver r ree fine gr r r r racias the american gentlemen the so esplendeed moosic as to playee the table was a long one and henry and me sat at the end of it next the wall the governor sat at the other end homer p mellinger stood at the side of it i was just wondering how mellinger was going to handle his crowd when the home talent suddenly opened the services that governor man was suitable for uprisings and policies i judge he was a ready kind of man who took his own time yes he was full of attention and immediateness he leaned his hands on the table and imposed his face toward the secretary man do the american senors understand spanish he asks in his native accents they do not says mellinger then listen goes on the latin man prompt the musics are of sufficient prettiness but not of necessity let us speak of business i well know why we are here since i observe my compatriots you had a whisper yesterday senor mellinger of our proposals tonight we will speak out we know that you stand in the president s favor and we know your influence the government will be changed we know the worth of your services we esteem your friendship and aid so much that mellinger praises his hand but the governor man bottles him up do not speak until i have done the governor man then draws a package wrapped in paper from his pocket and lays it on the table by mellinger s hand in that you will find fifty thousand dollars in money of your country you can do nothing against us but you can be worth that for us go back to the capital and obey our instructions take that money now we trust you you will find with it a paper giving in detail the work you will be expected to do for us do not have the unwiseness to refuse the governor man paused with his eyes fixed on mellinger full of expressions and observances i looked at mellinger and was glad billy renfrew couldn t see him then the sweat was popping out on his forehead and he stood dumb tapping the little package with the ends of his fingers the colorado maduro gang was after his graft he had only to change his politics and stuff five fingers in his inside pocket henry whispers to me and wants the pause in the program interpreted i whisper back h p is up against a bribe senator s size and the coons have got him going i saw mellinger s hand moving closer to the package he s weakening i whispered to henry we ll remind him says henry of the peanut roaster on thirty fourth street new york henry stooped down and got a record from the basketful we d brought slid it in the phonograph and started her off it was a cornet solo very neat and beautiful and the name of it was home sweet home not one of them fifty odd men in the room moved while it was playing and the governor man kept his eyes steady on mellinger i saw mellinger s head go up little by little and his hand came creeping away from the package not until the last note sounded did anybody stir and there homer p mellinger takes up the bundle of boodle and slams it in the governor man s face that s my answer says mellinger private secretary and there ll be another in the morning i have proofs of conspiracy against every man of you the show is over gentlemen there s one more act puts in the governor man you are a servant i believe employed by the president to copy letters and answer raps at the door i am governor here senores i call upon you in the name of the cause to seize this man that brindled gang of conspirators shoved back their chairs and advanced in force i could see where mellinger had made a mistake in massing his enemy so as to make a grand stand play i think he made another one too but we can pass that mellinger s idea of a graft and mine being different according to estimations and points of view there was only one window and door in that room and they were in the front end here was fifty odd latin men coming in a bunch to obstruct the legislation of mellinger you may say there were three of us for me and henry simultaneous declared new york city and the cherokee nation in sympathy with the weaker party then it was that henry horsecollar rose to a point of disorder and intervened showing admirable the advantages of education as applied to the american indian s natural intellect and native refinement he stood up and smoothed back his hair on each side with his hands as you have seen little girls do when they play get behind me both of you says henry what s it to be chief i asked i m going to buck center says henry in his football idioms there isn t a tackle in the lot of them follow me close and rush the game then that cultured red man exhaled an arrangement of sounds with his mouth that made the latin aggregation pause with thoughtfulness and hesitations the matter of his proclamation seemed to be a cooperation of the carlisle war whoop with the cherokee college yell he went at the chocolate team like a bean out of a little boy s nigger shooter his right elbow laid out the governor man on the gridiron and he made a lane the length of the crowd so wide that a woman could have carried a stepladder through it without striking against anything all mellinger and me had to do was to follow it took us just three minutes to get out of that street around to military headquarters where mellinger had things his own way a colonel and a battalion of bare toed infantry turned out and went back to the scene of the musicale with us but the conspirator gang was gone but we recaptured the phonograph with honors of war and marched back to the cuartel with it playing all coons look alike to me the next day mellinger takes me and henry to one side and begins to shed tens and twenties i want to buy that phonograph says he i liked that last tune it played at the soiree this is more money than the machine is worth says i tis government expense money says mellinger the government pays for it and it s getting the tune grinder cheap me and henry knew that pretty well we knew that it had saved homer p mellinger s graft when he was on the point of losing it but we never let him know we knew it now you boys better slide off further down the coast for a while says mellinger till i get the screws put on these fellows here if you don t they ll give you trouble and if you ever happen to see billy renfrew again before i do tell him i m coming back to new york as soon as i can make a stake honest me and henry laid low until the day the steamer came back when we saw the captain s boat on the beach we went down and stood in the edge of the water the captain grinned when he saw us i told you you d be waiting he says where s the hamburger machine it stays behind i says to play home sweet home i told you so says the captain again climb in the boat and that said keogh is the way me and henry horsecollar introduced the phonograph into this country henry went back to the states but i ve been rummaging around in the tropics ever since they say mellinger never travelled a mile after that without his phonograph i guess it kept him reminded about his graft whenever he saw the siren voice of the boodler tip him the wink with a bribe in his hand i suppose he s taking it home with him as a souvenir remarked the consul not as a souvenir said keogh he ll need two of em in new york running day and night vii money maze the new administration of anchuria entered upon its duties and privileges with enthusiasm its first act was to send an agent to coralio with imperative orders to recover if possible the sum of money ravished from the treasury by the ill fated miraflores colonel emilio falcon the private secretary of losada the new president was despatched from the capital upon this important mission the position of private secretary to a tropical president is a responsible one he must be a diplomat a spy a ruler of men a body guard to his chief and a smeller out of plots and nascent revolutions often he is the power behind the throne the dictator of policy and a president chooses him with a dozen times the care with which he selects a matrimonial mate colonel falcon a handsome and urbane gentleman of castilian courtesy and debonnaire manners came to coralio with the task before him of striking upon the cold trail of the lost money there he conferred with the military authorities who had received instructions to cooperate with him in the search colonel falcon established his headquarters in one of the rooms of the casa morena here for a week he held informal sittings much as if he were a kind of unified grand jury and summoned before him all those whose testimony might illumine the financial tragedy that had accompanied the less momentous one of the late president s death two or three who were thus examined among whom was the barber esteban declared that they had identified the body of the president before its burial of a truth testified esteban before the mighty secretary it was he the president consider how could i shave a man and not see his face he sent for me to shave him in a small house he had a beard very black and thick had i ever seen the president before why not i saw him once ride forth in a carriage from the vapor in solitas when i shaved him he gave me a gold piece and said there was to be no talk but i am a liberal i am devoted to my country and i spake of these things to senor goodwin it is known said colonel falcon smoothly that the late president took with him an american leather valise containing a large amount of money did you see that de veras no esteban answered the light in the little house was but a small lamp by which i could scarcely see to shave the president such a thing there may have been but i did not see it no also in the room was a young lady a senorita of much beauty that i could see even in so small a light but the money senor or the thing in which it was carried that i did not see the comandante and other officers gave testimony that they had been awakened and alarmed by the noise of a pistol shot in the hotel de los extranjeros hurrying thither to protect the peace and dignity of the republic they found a man lying dead with a pistol clutched in his hand beside him was a young woman weeping sorely senor goodwin was also in the room when they entered it but of the valise of money they saw nothing madame timotea ortiz the proprietress of the hotel in which the game of fox in the morning had been played out told of the coming of the two guests to her house to my house they came said she one senor not quite old and one senorita of sufficient handsomeness they desired not to eat or to drink not even of my aguardiente which is the best to their rooms they ascended numero nueve and numero diez later came senor goodwin who ascended to speak with them then i heard a great noise like that of a canon and they said that the pobre presidente had shot himself esta bueno i saw nothing of money or of the thing you call veliz that you say he carried it in colonel falcon soon came to the reasonable conclusion that if any one in coralio could furnish a clue to the vanished money frank goodwin must be the man but the wise secretary pursued a different course in seeking information from the american goodwin was a powerful friend to the new administration and one who was not to be carelessly dealt with in respect to either his honesty or his courage even the private secretary of his excellency hesitated to have this rubber prince and mahogany baron haled before him as a common citizen of anchuria so he sent goodwin a flowery epistle each word petal dripping with honey requesting the favor of an interview goodwin replied with an invitation to dinner at his own house before the hour named the american walked over to the casa morena and greeted his guest frankly and friendly then the two strolled in the cool of the afternoon to goodwin s home in the environs the american left colonel falcon in a big cool shadowed room with a floor of inlaid and polished woods that any millionaire in the states would have envied excusing himself for a few minutes he crossed a patio shaded with deftly arranged awnings and plants and entered a long room looking upon the sea in the opposite wing of the house the broad jalousies were opened wide and the ocean breeze flowed in through the room an invisible current of coolness and health goodwin s wife sat near one of the windows making a water color sketch of the afternoon seascape here was a woman who looked to be happy and more she looked to be content had a poet been inspired to pen just similes concerning her favor he would have likened her full clear eyes with their white encircled gray irises to moonflowers with none of the goddesses whose traditional charms have become coldly classic would the discerning rhymester have compared her she was purely paradisaic not olympian if you can imagine eve after the eviction beguiling the flaming warriors and serenely reentering the garden you will have her just so human and still so harmonious with eden seemed mrs goodwin when her husband entered she looked up and her lips curved and parted her eyelids fluttered twice or thrice a movement remindful proesy forgive us of the tail wagging of a faithful dog and a little ripple went through her like the commotion set up in a weeping willow by a puff of wind thus she ever acknowledged his coming were it twenty times a day if they who sometimes sat over their wine in coralio reshaping old diverting stories of the madcap career of isabel guilbert could have seen the wife of frank goodwin that afternoon in the estimable aura of her happy wifehood they might have disbelieved or have agreed to forget those graphic annals of the life of the one for whom their president gave up his country and his honor i have brought a guest to dinner said goodwin one colonel falcon from san mateo he is come on government business i do not think you will care to see him so i prescribe for you one of those convenient and indisputable feminine headaches he has come to inquire about the lost money has he not asked mrs goodwin going on with her sketch a good guess acknowledged goodwin he has been holding an inquisition among the natives for three days i am next on his list of witnesses but as he feels shy about dragging one of uncle sam s subjects before him he consents to give it the outward appearance of a social function he will apply the torture over my own wine and provender has he found any one who saw the valise of money not a soul even madama ortiz whose eyes are so sharp for the sight of a revenue official does not remember that there was any baggage mrs goodwin laid down her brush and sighed i am so sorry frank she said that they are giving you so much trouble about the money but we can t let them know about it can we not without doing our intelligence a great injustice said goodwin with a smile and a shrug that he had picked up from the natives americano though i am they would have me in the calaboza in half an hour if they knew we had appropriated that valise no we must appear as ignorant about the money as the other ignoramuses in coralio do you think that this man they have sent suspects you she asked with a little pucker of her brows he d better not said the american carelessly it s lucky that no one caught a sight of the valise except myself as i was in the rooms when the shot was fired it is not surprising that they should want to investigate my part in the affair rather closely but there s no cause for alarm this colonel is down on the list of events for a good dinner with a dessert of american bluff that will end the matter i think mrs goodwin rose and walked to the window goodwin followed and stood by her side she leaned to him and rested in the protection of his strength as she had always rested since that dark night on which he had first made himself her tower of refuge thus they stood for a little while straight through the lavish growth of tropical branch and leaf and vine that confronted them had been cunningly trimmed a vista that ended at the cleared environs of coralio on the banks of the mangrove swamp at the other end of the aerial tunnel they could see the grave and wooden headpiece that bore the name of the unhappy president miraflores from this window when the rains forbade the open and from the green and shady slopes of goodwin s fruitful lands when the skies were smiling his wife was wont to look upon that grave with a gentle sadness that was now scarcely a mar to her happiness i loved him so frank she said even after that terrible flight and its awful ending and you have been so good to me and have made me so happy it has all grown into such a strange puzzle if they were to find out that we got the money do you think they would force you to make the amount good to the government they would undoubtedly try answered goodwin you are right about its being a puzzle and it must remain a puzzle to falcon and all his countrymen until it solves itself you and i who know more than any one else only know half of the solution we must not let even a hint about this money get abroad let them come to the theory that the president concealed it in the mountains during his journey or that he found means to ship it out of the country before he reached coralio i don t think that falcon suspects me he is making a closer investigation according to his orders but he will find out nothing thus they spake together had any one overheard or overseen them as they discussed the lost funds of anchuria there would have been a second puzzle presented for upon the faces and in the bearing of each of them was visible if countenances are to be believed saxon honesty and pride and honorable thoughts in goodwin s steady eye and firm lineaments molded into material shape by the inward spirit of kindness and generosity and courage there was nothing reconcilable with his words as for his wife physiognomy championed her even in the face of their accusive talk nobility was in her guise purity was in her glance the devotion that she manifested had not even the appearance of that feeling that now and then inspires a woman to share the guilt of her partner out of the pathetic greatness other love no there was a discrepancy here between what the eye would have seen and the ear have heard dinner was served to goodwin and his guest in the patio under cool foliage and flowers the american begged the illustrious secretary to excuse the absence of mrs goodwin who was suffering he said from a headache brought on by a slight calentura after the meal they lingered according to the custom over their coffee and cigars colonel falcon with true castilian delicacy waited for his host to open the question that they had met to discuss he had not long to wait as soon as the cigars were lighted the american cleared the way by inquiring whether the secretary s investigations in the town had furnished him with any clue to the lost funds i have found no one yet admitted colonel falcon who even had sight of the valise or the money yet i have persisted it has been proven in the capital that president miraflores set out from san mateo with one hundred thousand dollars belonging to the government accompanied by senorita isabel guilbert the opera singer the government officially and personally is loathe to believe concluded colonel falcon with a smile that our late president s tastes would have permitted him to abandon on the route as excess baggage either of the desirable articles with which his flight was burdened i suppose you would like to hear what i have to say about the affair said goodwin coming directly to the point it will not require many words on that night with others of our friends here i was keeping a lookout for the president having been notified of his flight by a telegram in our national cipher from englehart one of our leaders in the capital about ten o clock that night i saw a man and a woman hurrying along the streets they went to the hotel de los extranjeros and engaged rooms i followed them upstairs leaving esteban who had come up to watch outside the barber had told me that he had shaved the beard from the president s face that night therefore i was prepared when i entered the rooms to find him with a smooth face when i apprehended him in the name of the people he drew a pistol and shot himself instantly in a few minutes many officers and citizens were on the spot i suppose you have been informed of the subsequent facts goodwin paused losada s agent maintained an attitude of waiting as if he expected a continuance and now went on the american looking steadily into the eyes of the other man and giving each word a deliberate emphasis you will oblige me by attending carefully to what i have to add i saw no valise or receptacle of any kind or any money belonging to the republic of anchuria if president miraflores decamped with any funds belonging to the treasury of this country or to himself or to any one else i saw no trace of it in the house or elsewhere at that time or at any other does that statement cover the ground of the inquiry you wished to make of me colonel falcon bowed and described a fluent curve with his cigar his duty was performed goodwin was not to be disputed he was a loyal supporter of the government and enjoyed the full confidence of the new president his rectitude had been the capital that had brought him fortune in anchuria just as it had formed the lucrative graft of mellinger the secretary of miraflores i thank you senor goodwin said falcon for speaking plainly but senor goodwin i am instructed to pursue every clue that presents itself in this matter there is one that i have not yet touched upon our friends in france senor have a saying cherchez la femme when there is a mystery without a clue but here we do not have to search the woman who accompanied the late president in his flight must surely i must interrupt you there interposed goodwin it is true that when i entered the hotel for the purpose of intercepting president miraflores i found a lady there i must beg of you to remember that that lady is now my wife i speak for her as i do for myself she knows nothing of the fate of the valise or of the money that you are seeking you will say to his excellency that i guarantee her innocence i do not need to add to you colonel falcon that i do not care to have her questioned or disturbed colonel falcon bowed again por supuesto no he cried and to indicate that the inquiry was ended he added and now senor let me beg of you to show me that sea view from your galeria of which you spoke i am a lover of the sea in the early evening goodwin walked back to the town with his guest leaving him at the corner of the calle grande as he was returning homeward one beelzebub blythe with the air of a courtier and the outward aspect of a scarecrow pounced upon him hopefully from the door of a pulperia blythe had been re christened beelzebub as an acknowledgement of the greatness of his fall once in some distant paradise lost he had foregathered with the angels of the earth but fate had hurled him headlong down to the tropics where flamed in his bosom a fire that was seldom quenched in coralio they called him a beach comber but he was in reality a categorical idealist who strove to anamorphosize the dull verities of life by the means of brandy and rum as beelzebub himself might have held in his clutch with unwitting tenacity his harp or crown during his tremendous fall so his namesake had clung to his gold rimmed eyeglasses as the only souvenir of his lost estate these he wore with impressiveness and distinction while he combed beaches and extracted toll from his friends by some mysterious means he kept his drink reddened face always smoothly shaven for the rest he sponged gracefully upon whomsoever he could for enough to keep him pretty drunk and sheltered from the rains and night dews hallo goodwin called the derelict airily i was hoping i d strike you i wanted to see you particularly suppose we go where we can talk of course you know there s a chap down here looking up the money old miraflores lost yes said goodwin i ve been talking with him let s go into espada s place i can spare you ten minutes they went into the pulperia and sat at a little table upon stools with rawhide tops have a drink said goodwin they can t bring it too quickly said blythe i ve been in a drought ever since morning hi muchacho el aguardiente por aca now what do you want to see me about asked goodwin when the drinks were before them confound it old man drawled blythe why do you spoil a golden moment like this with business i wanted to see you well this has the preference he gulped down his brandy and gazed longingly into the empty glass have another suggested goodwin between gentlemen said the fallen angel i don t quite like your use of that word another it isn t quite delicate but the concrete idea that the word represents is not displeasing the glasses were refilled blythe sipped blissfully from his as he began to enter the state of a true idealist i must trot along in a minute or two hinted goodwin was there anything in particular blythe did not reply at once old losada would make it a hot country he remarked at length for the man who swiped that gripsack of treasury boodle don t you think undoubtedly he would agreed goodwin calmly as he rose leisurely to his feet i ll be running over to the house now old man mrs goodwin is alone there was nothing important you had to say was there that s all said blythe unless you wouldn t mind sending in another drink from the bar as you go out old espada has closed my account to profit and loss and pay for the lot will you like a good fellow all right said goodwin buenas noches beezlebub blythe lingered over his cups polishing his eyeglasses with a disreputable handkerchief i thought i could do it but i couldn t he muttered to himself after a time a gentleman can t blackmail the man that he drinks with viii the admiral spilled milk draws few tears from an anchurian administration many are its lacteal sources and the clocks hands point forever to milking time even the rich cream skimmed from the treasury by the bewitched miraflores did not cause the newly installed patriots to waste time in unprofitable regrets the government philosophically set about supplying the deficiency by increasing the import duties and by suggesting to wealthy private citizens that contributions according to their means would be considered patriotic and in order prosperity was expected to attend the reign of losada the new president the ousted office holders and military favorites organized a new liberal party and began to lay their plans for a re succession thus the game of anchurian politics began like a chinese comedy to unwind slowly its serial length here and there mirth peeps for an instant from the wings and illumines the florid lines a dozen quarts of champagne in conjunction with an informal sitting of the president and his cabinet led to the establishment of the navy and the appointment of felipe carrera as its admiral next to the champagne the credit of the appointment belongs to don sabas placido the newly confirmed minister of war the president had requested a convention of his cabinet for the discussion of questions politic and for the transaction of certain routine matters of state the session had been signally tedious the business and the wine prodigiously dry a sudden prankish humor of don sabas impelling him to the deed spiced the grave affairs of state with a whiff of agreeable playfulness in the dilatory order of business had come a bulletin from the coast department of orilla del mar reporting the seizure by the custom house officers at the town of coralio of the sloop estrella del noche and her cargo of drygoods patent medicines granulated sugar and three star brandy also six martini rifles and a barrel of american whiskey caught in the act of smuggling the sloop with its cargo was now according to law the property of the republic the collector of customs in making his report departed from the conventional forms so far as to suggest that the confiscated vessel be converted to the use of the government the prize was the first capture to the credit of the department in ten years the collector took opportunity to pat his department on the back it often happened that government officers required transportation from point to point along the coast and means were usually lacking furthermore the sloop could be manned by a loyal crew and employed as a coast guard to discourage the pernicious art of smuggling the collector also ventured to nominate one to whom the charge of the boat could be safely intrusted a young man of coralio felipe carrera not be it understood one of extreme wisdom but loyal and the best sailor along the coast it was upon this hint that the minister of war acted executing a rare piece of drollery that so enlivened the tedium of the executive session in the consultation of this small maritime banana republic was a forgotten section that provided for the maintenance of a navy this provision with many other wiser ones had lain inert since the establishment of the republic anchuria had no navy and had no use for one it was characteristic of don sabas a man at once merry learned whimsical and audacious that he should have disturbed the dust of this musty and sleeping statute to increase the humor of the world by so much as a smile from his indulgent colleagues with delightful mock seriousness the minister of war proposed the creation of a navy he argued its need and the glories it might achieve with such gay and witty zeal that the travesty overcame with its humor even the swart dignity of president losada himself the champagne was bubbling trickily in the veins of the mercurial statesmen it was not the custom of the grave governors of anchuria to enliven their sessions with a beverage so apt to cast a veil of disparagement over sober affairs the wine had been a thoughtful compliment tendered by the agent of the vesuvius fruit company as a token of amicable relations and certain consummated deals between that company and the republic of anchuria the jest was carried to its end a formidable official document was prepared encrusted with chromatic seals and jaunty with fluttering ribbons bearing the florid signatures of state this commission conferred upon el senor don felipe carrera the title of flag admiral of the republic of anchuria thus within the space of a few minutes and the dominion of a dozen extra dry the country took its place among the naval powers of the world and felipe carrera became entitled to a salute of nineteen guns whenever he might enter port the southern races are lacking in that particular kind of humor that finds entertainment in the defects and misfortunes bestowed by nature owing to this defect in their constitution they are not moved to laughter as are their northern brothers by the spectacle of the deformed the feeble minded or the insane felipe carrera was sent upon earth with but half his wits therefore the people of coralio called him el pobrecito loco the poor little crazed one saying that god had sent but half of him to earth retaining the other half a sombre youth glowering and speaking only at the rarest times felipe was but negatively loco on shore he generally refused all conversation he seemed to know that he was badly handicapped on land where so many kinds of understanding are needed but on the water his one talent set him equal with most men few sailors whom god had carefully and completely made could handle a sailboat as well five points nearer the wind than the best of them he could sail his sloop when the elements raged and set other men to cowering the deficiencies of felipe seemed of little importance he was a perfect sailor if an imperfect man he owned no boat but worked among the crews of the schooners and sloops that skimmed the coast trading and freighting fruit out to the steamers where there was no harbor it was through his famous skill and boldness on the sea as well as for the pity felt for his mental imperfections that he was recommended by the collector as a suitable custodian of the captured sloop when the outcome of don sabas little pleasantry arrived in the form of the imposing and preposterous commission the collector smiled he had not expected such prompt and overwhelming response to his recommendation he despatched a muchacho at once to fetch the future admiral the collector waited in his official quarters his office was in the calle grande and the sea breezes hummed through its windows all day the collector in white linen and canvas shoes philandered with papers on an antique desk a parrot perched on a pen rack seasoned the official tedium with a fire of choice castilian imprecations two rooms opened into the collector s in one the clerical force of young men of variegated complexions transacted with glitter and parade their several duties through the open door of the other room could be seen a bronze babe guiltless of clothing that rollicked upon the floor in a grass hammock a thin woman tinted a pale lemon played a guitar and swung contentedly in the breeze thus surrounded by the routine of his high duties and the visible tokens of agreeable domesticity the collector s heart was further made happy by the power placed in his hands to brighten the fortunes of the innocent felipe felipe came and stood before the collector he was a lad of twenty not ill favored in looks but with an expression of distant and pondering vacuity he wore white cotton trousers down the seams of which he had sewed red stripes with some vague aim at military decoration a flimsy blue shirt fell open at his throat his feet were bare he held in his hand the cheapest of straw hats from the states senor carrera said the collector gravely producing the showy commission i have sent for you at the president s bidding this document that i present to you confers upon you the title of admiral of this great republic and gives you absolute command of the naval forces and fleet of our country you may think friend felipe that we have no navy but yes the sloop the estrella del noche that my brave men captured from the coast smugglers is to be placed under your command the boat is to be devoted to the services of your country you will be ready at all times to convey officials of the government to points along the coast where they may be obliged to visit you will also act as a coast guard to prevent as far as you may be able the crime of smuggling you will uphold the honor and prestige of your country at sea and endeavor to place anchuria among the proudest naval powers of the world these are your instructions as the minister of war desires me to convey them to you por dios i do not know how all this is to be accomplished for not one word did his letter contain in respect to a crew or to the expenses of this navy perhaps you are to provide a crew yourself senor admiral i do not know but it is a very high honor that has descended upon you i now hand you your commission when you are ready for the boat i will give orders that she shall be made over into your charge that is as far as my instructions go felipe took the commission that the collector handed to him he gazed through the open window at the sea for a moment with his customary expression of deep but vain pondering then he turned without having spoken a word and walked swiftly away through the hot sand of the street pobrecito loco sighed the collector and the parrot on the pen racks screeched loco loco loco the next morning a strange procession filed through the streets to the collector s office at its head was the admiral of the navy somewhere felipe had raked together a pitiful semblance of a military uniform a pair of red trousers a dingy blue short jacket heavily ornamented with gold braid and an old fatigue cap that must have been cast away by one of the british soldiers in belize and brought away by felipe on one of his coasting voyages buckled around his waist was an ancient ship s cutlass contributed to his equipment by pedro lafitte the baker who proudly asserted its inheritance from his ancestor the illustrious buccaneer at the admiral s heels tagged his newly shipped crew three grinning glossy black caribs bare to the waist the sand spurting in showers from the spring of their naked feet briefly and with dignity felipe demanded his vessel of the collector and now a fresh honor awaited him the collector s wife who played the guitar and read novels in the hammock all day had more than a little romance in her placid yellow bosom she had found in an old book an engraving of a flag that purported to be the naval flag of anchuria perhaps it had so been designed by the founders of the nation but as no navy had ever been established oblivion had claimed the flag laboriously with her own hands she had made a flag after the pattern a red cross upon a blue and white ground he presented it to felipe with these words brave sailor this flag is of your country be true and defend it with your life go you with god for the first time since his appointment the admiral showed a flicker of emotion he took the silken emblem and passed his hand reverently over its surface i am the admiral he said to the collector s lady being on land he could bring himself to no more exuberant expression of sentiment at sea with the flag at the masthead of his navy some more eloquent exposition of feelings might be forthcoming abruptly the admiral departed with his crew for the next three days they were busy giving the estrella del noche a new coat of white paint trimmed with blue and then felipe further adorned himself by fastening a handful of brilliant parrot s plumes in his cap again he tramped with his faithful crew to the collector s office and formally notified him that the sloop s name had been changed to el nacional during the next few months the navy had its troubles even an admiral is perplexed to know what to do without any orders but none came neither did any salaries el nacional swung idly at anchor when felipe s little store of money was exhausted he went to the collector and raised the question of finances salaries exclaimed the collector with hands raised valgame dios not one centavo of my own pay have i received for the last seven months the pay of an admiral do you ask quien sabe should it be less than three thousand pesos mira you will see a revolution in this country very soon a good sign of it is when the government calls all the time for pesos pesos pesos and pays none out felipe left the collector s office with a look almost of content on his sombre face a revolution would mean fighting and then the government would need his services it was rather humiliating to be an admiral without anything to do and have a hungry crew at your heels begging for reales to buy plantains and tobacco with when he returned to where his happy go lucky caribs were waiting they sprang up and saluted as he had drilled them to do come muchachos said the admiral it seems that the government is poor it has no money to give us we will earn what we need to live upon thus will we serve our country soon his heavy eyes almost lighted up it may gladly call upon us for help thereafter el nacional turned out with the other coast craft and became a wage earner she worked with the lighters freighting bananas and oranges out to the fruit steamers that could not approach nearer than a mile from the shore surely a self supporting navy deserves red letters in the budget of any nation after earning enough at freighting to keep himself and his crew in provisions for a week felipe would anchor the navy and hang about the little telegraph office looking like one of the chorus of an insolvent comic opera troupe besieging the manager s den a hope for orders from the capital was always in his heart that his services as admiral had never been called into requirement hurt his pride and patriotism at every call he would inquire gravely and expectantly for despatches the operator would pretend to make a search and then reply not yet it seems senor el almirante poco tiempo outside in the shade of the lime trees the crew chewed sugar cane or slumbered well content to serve a country that was contented with so little service one day in the early summer the revolution predicted by the collector flamed out suddenly it had long been smoldering at the first note of alarm the admiral of the navy force and fleet made all sail for a larger port on the coast of a neighboring republic where he traded a hastily collected cargo of fruit for its value in cartridges for the five martini rifles the only guns that the navy could boast then to the telegraph office sped the admiral sprawling in his favorite corner in his fast decaying uniform with his prodigious sabre distributed between his red legs he waited for the long delayed but now soon expected orders not yet senor el almirante the telegraph clerk would call to him poco tiempo at the answer the admiral would plump himself down with a great rattling of scabbard to await the infrequent tick of the little instrument on the table they will come would be his unshaken reply i am the admiral ix the flag paramount at the head of the insurgent party appeared that hector and learned theban of the southern republics don sabas placido a traveller a soldier a poet a scientist a statesman and a connoisseur the wonder was that he could content himself with the petty remote life of his native country it is a whim of placido s said a friend who knew him well to take up political intrigue it is not otherwise than as if he had come upon a new tempo in music a new bacillus in the air a new scent or rhyme or explosive he will squeeze this revolution dry of sensations and a week afterward will forget it skimming the seas of the world in his brigantine to add to his already world famous collections collections of what por dios of everything from postage stamps to prehistoric stone idols but for a mere dilettante the aesthetic placido seemed to be creating a lively row the people admired him they were fascinated by his brilliancy and flattered by his taking an interest in so small a thing as his native country they rallied to the call of his lieutenants in the capital where somewhat contrary to arrangements the army remained faithful to the government there was also lively skirmishing in the coast towns it was rumored that the revolution was aided by the vesuvius fruit company the power that forever stood with chiding smile and uplifted finger to keep anchuria in the class of good children two of its steamers the traveler and the salvador were known to have conveyed insurgent troops from point to point along the coast as yet there had been no actual uprising in coralio military law prevailed and the ferment was bottled for the time and then came the word that everywhere the revolutionists were encountering defeat in the capital the president s forces triumphed and there was a rumor that the leaders of the revolt had been forced to fly hotly pursued in the little telegraph office at coralio there was always a gathering of officials and loyal citizens awaiting news from the seat of government one morning the telegraph key began clicking and presently the operator called loudly one telegram for el almirante don senor felipe carrera there was a shuffling sound a great rattling of tin scabbard and the admiral prompt at his spot of waiting leaped across the room to receive it the message was handed to him slowly spelling it out he found it to be his first official order thus running proceed immediately with your vessel to mouth of rio ruiz transport beef and provisions to barracks at alforan martinez general small glory to be sure in this his country s first call but it had called and joy surged in the admiral s breast he drew his cutlass belt to another buckle hole roused his dozing crew and in a quarter of an hour el nacional was tacking swiftly down coast in a stiff landward breeze the rio ruiz is a small river emptying into the sea ten miles below coralio that portion of the coast is wild and solitary through a gorge in the cordilleras rushes the rio ruiz cold and bubbling to glide at last with breadth and leisure through an alluvial morass into the sea in two hours el nacional entered the river s mouth the banks were crowded with a disposition of formidable trees the sumptuous undergrowth of the tropics overflowed the land and drowned itself in the fallow waters silently the sloop entered there and met a deeper silence brilliant with greens and ochres and floral scarlets the umbrageous mouth of the rio ruiz furnished no sound or movement save of the sea going water as it purled against the prow of the vessel small chance there seemed of wresting beef or provisions from that empty solitude the admiral decided to cast anchor and at the chain s rattle the forest was stimulated to instant and resounding uproar the mouth of the rio ruiz had only been taking a morning nap parrots and baboons screeched and barked in the trees a whirring and a hissing and a booming marked the awakening of animal life a dark blue bulk was visible for an instant as a startled tapir fought his way through the vines the navy under orders hung in the mouth of the little river for hours the crew served the dinner of shark s fin soup plantains crab gumbo and sour wine the admiral with a three foot telescope closely scanned the impervious foliage fifty yards away it was nearly sunset when a reverberating hal lo o o came from the forest to their left it was answered and three men mounted upon mules crashed through the tropic tangle to within a dozen yards of the river s bank there they dismounted and one unbuckling his belt struck each mule a violent blow with his sword scabbard so that they with a fling of heels dashed back again into the forest those were strange looking men to be conveying beef and provisions one was a large and exceedingly active man of striking presence he was of the purest spanish type with curling gray besprinkled dark hair blue sparkling eyes and the pronounced air of a caballero grande the other two were small brown faced men wearing white military uniforms high riding boots and swords the clothes of all were drenched bespattered and rent by the thicket some stress of circumstance must have driven them diable a quatre through flood mire and jungle o he senor almirante called the large man send to us your boat the dory was lowered and felipe with one of the caribs rowed toward the left bank the large man stood near the water s brink waist deep in the curling vines as he gazed upon the scarecrow figure in the stern of the dory a sprightly interest beamed upon his mobile face months of wageless and thankless service had dimmed the admiral s splendor his red trousers were patched and ragged most of the bright buttons and yellow braid were gone from his jacket the visor of his cap was torn and depended almost to his eyes the admiral s feet were bare dear admiral cried the large man and his voice was like a blast from a horn i kiss your hands i knew we could build upon your fidelity you had our despatch from general martinez a little nearer with your boat dear admiral upon these devils of shifting vines we stand with the smallest security felipe regarded him with a stolid face provisions and beef for the barracks at alforan he quoted no fault of the butchers almirante mio that the beef awaits you not but you are come in time to save the cattle get us aboard your vessel senor at once you first caballeros a priesa come back for me the boat is too small the dory conveyed the two officers to the sloop and returned for the large man have you so gross a thing as food good admiral he cried when aboard and perhaps coffee beef and provisions nombre de dios a little longer and we could have eaten one of those mules that you colonel rafael saluted so feelingly with your sword scabbard at parting let us have food and then we will sail for the barracks at alforan no the caribs prepared a meal to which the three passengers of el nacional set themselves with famished delight about sunset as was its custom the breeze veered and swept back from the mountains cool and steady bringing a taste of the stagnant lagoons and mangrove swamps that guttered the lowlands the mainsail of the sloop was hoisted and swelled to it and at that moment they heard shouts and a waxing clamor from the bosky profundities of the shore the butchers my dear admiral said the large man smiling too late for the slaughter further than his orders to his crew the admiral was saying nothing the topsail and jib were spread and the sloop elided out of the estuary the large man and his companions had bestowed themselves with what comfort they could about the bare deck belike the thing big in their minds had been their departure from that critical shore and now that the hazard was so far reduced their thoughts were loosed to the consideration of further deliverance but when they saw the sloop turn and fly up coast again they relaxed satisfied with the course the admiral had taken the large man sat at ease his spirited blue eye engaged in the contemplation of the navy s commander he was trying to estimate this sombre and fantastic lad whose impenetrable stolidity puzzled him himself a fugitive his life sought and chafing under the smart of defeat and failure it was characteristic of him to transfer instantly his interest to the study of a thing new to him it was like him too to have conceived and risked all upon this last desperate and madcap scheme this message to a poor crazed fanatico cruising about with his grotesque uniform and his farcical title but his companions had been at their wits end escape had seemed incredible and now he was pleased with the success of the plan they had called crack brained and precarious the brief tropic twilight seemed to slide swiftly into the pearly splendor of a moonlit night and now the lights of coralio appeared distributed against the darkening shore to their right the admiral stood silent at the tiller the caribs like black panthers held the sheets leaping noiselessly at his short commands the three passengers were watching intently the sea before them and when at length they came in sight of the bulk of a steamer lying a mile out from the town with her lights radiating deep into the water they held a sudden voluble and close headed converse the sloop was speeding as if to strike midway between ship and shore the large man suddenly separated from his companions and approached the scarecrow at the helm my dear admiral he said the government has been exceedingly remiss i feel all the shame for it that only its ignorance of your devoted service has prevented it from sustaining an inexcusable oversight has been made a vessel a uniform and a crew worthy of your fidelity shall be furnished you but just now dear admiral there is business of moment afoot the steamer lying there is the salvador i and my friends desire to be conveyed to her where we are sent on the government s business do us the favor to shape your course accordingly without replying the admiral gave a sharp command and put the tiller hard to port el nacional swerved and headed straight as an arrow s course for the shore do me the favor said the large man a trifle restively to acknowledge at least that you catch the sound of my words it was possible that the fellow might be lacking in senses as well as intellect the admiral emitted a croaking harsh laugh and spake they will stand you he said with your face to a wall and shoot you dead that is the way they kill traitors i knew you when you stepped into my boat i have seen your picture in a book you are sabas placido traitor to your country with your face to a wall so you will die i am the admiral and i will take you to them with your face to a wall yes don sabas half turned and waved his hand with a ringing laugh toward his fellow fugitives to you caballeros i have related the history of that session when we issued that so ridiculous commission of a truth our jest has been turned against us behold the frankenstein s monster we have created don sabas glanced toward the shore the lights of coralio were drawing near he could see the beach the warehouse of the bodega nacional the long low cuartel occupied by the soldiers and behind that gleaming in the moonlight a stretch of high adobe wall he had seen men stood with their faces to that wall and shot dead again he addressed the extravagant figure at the helm it is true he said that i am fleeing the country but receive the assurance that i care very little for that courts and camps everywhere are open to sabas placido vaya what is this molehill of a republic this pig s head of a country to a man like me i am a paisano of everywhere in rome in london in paris in vienna you will hear them say welcome back don sabas come tonto baboon of a boy admiral whatever you call yourself turn your boat put us on board the salvador and here is your pay five hundred pesos in money of the estados unidos more than your lying government will pay you in twenty years don sabas pressed a plump purse against the youth s hand the admiral gave no heed to the words or the movement braced against the helm he was holding the sloop dead on her shoreward course his dull face was lit almost to intelligence by some inward conceit that seemed to afford him joy and found utterance in another parrot like cackle that is why they do it he said so that you will not see the guns they fire boom and you fall dead with your face to the wall yes the admiral called a sudden order to his crew the lithe silent caribs made fast the sheets they held and slipped down the hatchway into the hold of the sloop when the last one had disappeared don sabas like a big brown leopard leaped forward closed and fastened the hatch and stood smiling no rifles if you please dear admiral he said it was a whimsey of mine once to compile a dictionary of the carib lengua so i understood your order perhaps now you will he cut short his words for he heard the dull swish of iron scraping along tin the admiral had drawn the cutlass of pedro lafitte and was darting upon him the blade descended and it was only by a display of surprising agility that the large man escaped with only a bruised shoulder the glancing weapon he was drawing his pistol as he sprang and the next instant he shot the admiral down don sabas stooped over him and rose again in the heart he said briefly senores the navy is abolished colonel rafael sprang to the helm and the other officer hastened to loose the mainsail sheets the boom swung round el nacional veered and began to tack industriously for the salvador strike that flag senor called colonel rafael our friends on the steamer will wonder why we are sailing under it well said cried don sabas advancing to the mast he lowered the flag to the deck where lay its too loyal supporter thus ended the minister of war s little piece of after dinner drollery and by the same hand that began it suddenly don sabas gave a great cry of joy and ran down the slanting deck to the side of colonel rafael across his arm he carried the flag of the extinguished navy mire mire senor ah dios already can i hear that great bear of an oestreicher shout du hast mein herz gebrochen mire of my friend herr grunitz of vienna you have heard me relate that man has travelled to ceylon for an orchid to patagonia for a headdress to benares for a slipper to mozambique for a spearhead to add to his famous collections thou knowest also amigo rafael that i have been a gatherer of curios my collection of battle flags of the world s navies was the most complete in existence until last year then herr grunitz secured two such rare specimens one of a barberry state and one of the makarooroos a tribe on the west coast of africa i have not those but they can be procured but this flag senor do you know what it is name of god do you know see that red cross upon the blue and white ground you never saw it before seguramente no it is the naval flag of your country mire this rotten tub we stand upon is its navy that dead cockatoo lying there was its commander that stroke of cutlass and single pistol shot a sea battle all a piece of absurd foolery i grant you but authentic there has never been another flag like this and there never will be another no it is unique in the whole world yes think of what that means to a collector of flags do you know coronel mio how many golden crowns herr grunitz would give for this flag ten thousand likely well a hundred thousand would not buy it beautiful flag only flag little devil of a most heaven born flag o he old grumbler beyond the ocean wait till don sabas comes again to the konigin strasse he will let you kneel and touch the folds of it with one finger o he old spectacled ransacker of the world forgotten was the impotent revolution the danger the loss the gall of defeat possessed solely by the inordinate and unparalleled passion of the collector he strode up and down the little deck clasping to his breast with one hand the paragon of a flag he snapped his fingers triumphantly toward the east he shouted the paean to his prize in trumpet tones as though he would make old grunitz hear in his musty den beyond the sea they were waiting on the salvador to welcome them the sloop came close alongside the steamer where her sides were sliced almost to the lower deck for the loading of fruit the sailors of the salvador grappled and held her there captain mcleod leaned over the side well senor the jig is up i m told the jig is up don sabas looked perplexed for a moment that revolution ah yes with a shrug of his shoulders he dismissed the matter the captain learned of the escape and the imprisoned crew caribs he said no harm in them he slipped down into the sloop and kicked loose the hasp of the hatch the black fellows came tumbling up sweating but grinning hey black boys said the captain in a dialect of his own you sabe catchy boat and vamos back same place quick they saw him point to themselves the sloop and coralio yas yas they cried with broader grins and many nods the four don sabas the two officers and the captain moved to quit the sloop don sabas lagged a little behind looking at the still form of the late admiral sprawled in his paltry trappings pobrecito loco he said softly he was a brilliant cosmopolite and a cognoscente of high rank but after all he was of the same race and blood and instinct as this people even as the simple paisanos of coralio had said it so said don sabas without a smile he looked and said the poor little crazed one stooping he raised the limp shoulders drew the priceless and induplicable flag under them and over the breast pinning it there with the diamond star of the order of san carlos that he took from the collar of his own coat he followed after the others and stood with them upon the deck of the salvador the sailors that steadied el nacional shoved her off the jabbering caribs hauled away at the rigging the sloop headed for the shore and herr grunitz s collection of naval flags was still the finest in the world x the shamrock and the palm one night when there was no breeze and coralio seemed closer than ever to the gratings of avernus five men were grouped about the door of the photograph establishment of keogh and clancy thus in all the scorched and exotic places of the earth caucasians meet when the day s work is done to preserve the fulness of their heritage by the aspersion of alien things johnny atwood lay stretched upon the grass in the undress uniform of a carib and prated feebly of cool water to be had in the cucumber wood pumps of dalesburg doctor gregg through the prestige of his whiskers and as a bribe against the relation of his imminent professional tales was conceded the hammock that was swung between the door jamb and a calabash tree keogh had moved out upon the grass a little table that held the instrument for burnishing completed photographs he was the only busy one of the group industriously from between the cylinders of the burnisher rolled the finished depictments of coralio s citizens blanchard the french mining engineer in his cool linen viewed the smoke of his cigarette through his calm glasses impervious to the heat clancy sat on the steps smoking his short pipe his mood was the gossip s the others were reduced by the humidity to the state of disability desirable in an audience clancy was an american with an irish diathesis and cosmopolitan proclivities many businesses had claimed him but not for long the roadster s blood was in his veins the voice of the tintype was but one of the many callings that had wooed him upon so many roads sometimes he could be persuaded to oral construction of his voyages into the informal and egregious tonight there were symptoms of divulgement in him tis elegant weather for filibustering he volunteered it reminds me of the time i struggled to liberate a nation from the poisonous breath of a tyrant s clutch twas hard work tis straining to the back and makes corns on the hands i didn t know you had ever lent your sword to an oppressed people murmured atwood from the grass i did said clancy and they turned it into a plowshare what country was so fortunate as to secure your aid airily inquired blanchard where s kamchatka asked clancy with seeming irrelevance why off siberia somewhere in the arctic regions somebody answered doubtfully i thought that was the cold one said clancy with a satisfied nod i m always gettin the two names mixed twas guatemala then the hot one i ve been filibusterin with ye ll find that country on the map tis in the district known as the tropics by the foresight of providence it lies on the coast so the geography men could run the names of the towns off into the water they re an inch long small type composed of spanish dialects and tis my opinion of the same system of syntax that blew up the maine yes twas that country i sailed against single handed and endeavored to liberate it from a tyrannical government with a single barrelled pickaxe unloaded at that ye don t understand of course tis a statement demandin elucidation and apologies twas in new orleans one morning about the first ofjune i was standing down on the wharf looking about at the ships in the river there was a little steamer moored right opposite me that seemed about ready to sail the funnels of it were throwing out smoke and a gang of roustabouts were carrying aboard a pile of boxes that was stacked up on the wharf the boxes were about two feet square and something like four feet long and they seemed to be pretty heavy i walked over careless to the stack of boxes i saw one of them had been broken in handlin twas curiosity made me pull up the loose top and look inside the box was packed full of winchester rifles so so says i to myself somebody s gettin a twist on the neutrality laws somebody s aidin with munitions of war i wonder where the popguns are goin i heard somebody cough and i turned around there stood a little round fat man with a brown face and white clothes a first class looking little man with a four karat diamond on his finger and his eye full of interrogations and respects i judged he was a kind of foreigner may be from russia or japan or the archipelagoes hist says the round man full of concealments and confidences will the senor respect the discoveryments he has made that the mans on the ship shall not be acquaint the senor will be a gentleman that shall not expose one thing that by accident occur monseer says i for i judged him to be a kind of frenchman receive my most exasperated assurances that your secret is safe with james clancy furthermore i will go so far as to remark veev la liberty veev it good and strong whenever you hear of a clancy obstructin the abolishment of existin governments you may notify me by return mail the senor is good says the dark fat man smilin under his black mustache wish you to come aboard my ship and drink of wine a glass bein a clancy in two minutes me and the foreigner man were seated at a table in the cabin of the steamer with a bottle between us i could hear the heavy boxes bein dumped into the hold i judged that cargo must consist of at least winchesters me and the brown man drank the bottle of stuff and he called the steward to bring another when you amalgamate a clancy with the contents of a bottle you practically instigate secession i had heard a good deal about these revolutions in them tropical localities and i begun to want a hand in it you goin to stir things up in your country ain t you monseer says i with a wink to let him know i was on yes yes said the little man pounding his fist on the table a change of the greatest will occur too long have the people been oppressed with the promises and the never to happen things to become the great work it shall be carry on yes our forces shall in the capital city strike of the soonest carrambos carrambos is the word says i beginning to invest myself with enthusiasm and more wine likewise veeva as i said before may the shamrock of old i mean the banana vine or the pie plant or whatever the imperial emblem may be of your down trodden country wave forever a thousand thank yous says the round man for your emission of amicable utterances what our cause needs of the very most is mans who will the work do to lift it along oh for one thousands strong good mans to aid the general de vega that he shall to his country bring those success and glory it is hard oh so hard to find good mans to help in the work monseer says i leanin over the table and graspin his hand i don t know where your country is but me heart bleeds for it the heart of a clancy was never deaf to the sight of an oppressed people the family is filibusterers by birth and foreigners by trade if you can use james clancy s arms and his blood in denuding your shores of the tyrant s yoke they re yours to command general de vega was overcome with joy to confiscate my condolence of his conspiracies and predicaments he tried to embrace me across the table but his fatness and the wine that had been in the bottles prevented thus was i welcomed into the ranks of filibustery then the general man told me his country had the name of guatemala and was the greatest nation laved by any ocean whatever anywhere he looked at me with tears in his eyes and from time to time he would emit the remark ah big strong brave mans that is what my country need general de vega as was the name by which he denounced himself brought out a document for me to sign which i did makin a fine flourish and curlycue with the tail of the y your passage money says the general business like shall from your pay be deduct twill not says i haughty i ll pay my own passage a hundred and eighty dollars i had in my inside pocket and twas no common filibuster i was goin to be filibusterin for me board and clothes the steamer was to sail in two hours and i went ashore to get some things together i d need when i came aboard i showed the general with pride the outfit twas a fine chinchilla overcoat arctic overshoes fur cap and earmuffs with elegant fleece lined gloves and woollen muffler carrambos says the little general what clothes are these that shall go to the tropic and then the little spalpeen laughs and he calls the captain and the captain calls the purser and they pipe up the chief engineer and the whole gang leans against the cabin and laughs at clancy s wardrobe for guatemala i reflects a bit serious and asks the general again to denominate the terms by which his country is called he tells me and i see then that twas the t other one kamchatka i had in mind since then i ve had difficulty in separatin the two nations in name climate and geographic disposition i paid my passage twenty four dollars first cabin and ate at table with the officer crowd down on the lower deck was a gang of second class passengers about forty of them seemin to be dagoes and the like i wondered what so many of them were goin along for well then in three days we sailed alongside that guatemala twas a blue country and not yellow as tis miscolored on the map we landed at a town on the coast where a train of cars was waitin for us on a dinky little railroad the boxes on the steamer were brought ashore and loaded on the cars the gang of dagoes got aboard too the general and me in the front car yes me and general de vega headed the revolution as it pulled out of the seaport town that train travelled about as fast as a policeman goin to a riot it penetrated the most conspicuous lot of fuzzy scenery ever seen outside a geography we run some forty miles in seven hours and the train stopped there was no more railroad twas a sort of camp in a damp gorge full of wildness and melancholies they was grading and choppin out the forests ahead to continue the road here says i to myself is the romantic haunt of the revolutionists here will clancy by the virtue that is in a superior race and the inculcation of fenian tactics strike a tremendous blow for liberty they unloaded the boxes from the train and begun to knock the tops off from the first one that was open i saw general de vega take the winchester rifles and pass them around to a squad of morbid soldiery the other boxes was opened next and believe me or not divil another gun was to be seen every other box in the load was full of pickaxes and spades and then sorrow be upon them tropics the proud clancy and the dishonored dagoes each one of them had to shoulder a pick or a spade and march away to work on that dirty little railroad yes twas that the dagoes shipped for and twas that the filibusterin clancy signed for though unbeknownst to himself at the time in after days i found out about it it seems twas hard to get hands to work on that road the intelligent natives of the country was too lazy to work indeed the saints know twas unnecessary by stretchin out one hand they could seize the most delicate and costly fruits of the earth and by stretchin out the other they could sleep for days at a time without hearin a seven o clock whistle or the footsteps of the rent man upon the stairs so regular the steamers travelled to the united states to seduce labor usually the imported spade slingers died in two or three months from eatin the over ripe water and breathing the violent tropical scenery wherefore they made them sign contracts for a year when they hired them and put an armed guard over the poor devils to keep them from runnin away twas thus i was double crossed by the tropics through a family failing of goin out of the way to hunt disturbances they gave me a pick and i took it meditating an insurrection on the spot but there was the guards handling the winchesters careless and i come to the conclusion that discretion was the best part of filibusterin there was about a hundred of us in the gang starting out to work and the word was given to move i steps out of the ranks and goes up to that general de vega man who was smokin a cigar and gazin upon the scene with satisfactions and glory he smiles at me polite and devilish plenty work says he for big strong mans in guatemala yes thirty dollars in the month good pay ah yes you strong brave man bimeby we push those railroad in the capital very quick they want you go work now adios strong mans monseer says i lingerin will you tell a poor little irishman this when i set foot on your cockroachy steamer and breathed liberal and revolutionary sentiments into your sour wine did you think i was conspirin to sling a pick on your contemptuous little railroad and when you answered me with patriotic recitations humping up the star spangled cause of liberty did you have meditations of reducin me to the ranks of the stump grubbin dagoes in the chain gangs of your vile and grovelin country the general man expanded his rotundity and laughed considerable yes he laughed very long and loud and i clancy stood and waited comical mans he shouts at last so you will kill me from the laughing yes it is hard to find the brave strong mans to aid my country revolutions did i speak of r r revolutions not one word i say big strong man is need in guatemala so the mistake is of you you have looked in those one box containing those gun for the guard you think all boxes is contain gun no there is not war in guatemala but work yes good thirty dollar in the month you shall shoulder one pickaxe senor and dig for the liberty and prosperity of guatemala off to your work the guard waits for you little fat poodle dog of a brown man says i quiet but full of indignations and discomforts things shall happen to you maybe not right away but as soon as j clancy can formulate somethin in the way of repartee the boss of the gang orders us to work i tramps off with the dagoes and i hears the distinguished patriot and kidnapper laughin hearty as we go tis a sorrowful fact for eight weeks i built railroads for that misbehavin country i filibustered twelve hours a day with a heavy pick and a spade choppin away the luxurious landscape that grew upon the right of way we worked in swamps that smelled like there was a leak in the gas mains trampin down a fine assortment of the most expensive hothouse plants and vegetables the scene was tropical beyond the wildest imagination of the geography man the trees was all sky scrapers the underbrush was full of needles and pins there was monkeys jumpin around and crocodiles and pink tailed mockin birds and ye stood knee deep in the rotten water and grabbled roots for the liberation of guatemala of nights we would build smudges in camp to discourage the mosquitoes and sit in the smoke with the guards pacin all around us there was two hundred men working on the road mostly dagoes nigger men spanish men and swedes three or four were irish one old man named halloran a man of hibernian entitlements and discretions explained it to me he had been working on the road a year most of them died in less than six months he was dried up to gristle and bone and shook with chills every third night when you first come says he ye think ye ll leave right away but they hold out your first month s pay for your passage over and by that time the tropics has its grip on ye ye re surrounded by a ragin forest full of disreputable beasts lions and baboons and anacondas waiting to devour ye the sun strikes ye hard and melts the marrow in your bones ye get similar to the lettuce eaters the poetry books speaks about ye forget the elevated sintiments of life such as patriotism revenge disturbances of the peace and the dacint love of a clane shirt ye do your work and ye swallow the kerosene ile and rubber pipestems dished up to ye by the dago cook for food ye light your pipeful and say to yourself nixt week i ll break away and ye go to sleep and call yersilf a liar for ye know yell never do it who is this general man asks i that calls himself de vega tis the man says halloran who is tryin to complete the finishin of the railroad twas the project of a private corporation but it busted and then the government took it up de vegy is a big politician and wants to be president the people want the railroad completed as they re taxed mighty on account of it the de vegy man is pushing it along as a campaign move tis not my way says i to make threats against any man but there s an account to be settled between the railroad man and james o dowd clancy twas that way i thought mesilf at first halloran says with a big sigh until i got to be a lettuce eater the fault s wid these tropics they rejuices a man s system tis a land as the poet says where it always seems to be after dinner i does me work and smokes me pipe and sleeps there s little else in life anyway ye ll get that way yersilf mighty soon don t be harborin any sentiments at all clancy i can t help it says i i m full of em i enlisted in the revolutionary army of this dark country in good faith to fight for its liberty honors and silver candlesticks instead of which i am set to amputatin its scenery and grubbin its roots tis the general man will have to pay for it two months i worked on that railroad before i found a chance to get away one day a gang of us was sent back to the end of the completed line to fetch some picks that had been sent down to port barrios to be sharpened they were brought on a hand car and i noticed when i started away that the car was left there on the track that night about twelve i woke up halloran and told him my scheme run away says halloran good lord clancy do ye mean it why i ain t got the nerve it s too chilly and i ain t slept enough run away i told you clancy i ve eat the lettuce i ve lost my grip tis the tropics that s done it tis like the poet says forgotten are our friends that we have left behind in the hollow lettuce land we will live and lay reclined you better go on clancy i ll stay i guess it s too early and cold and i m sleepy so i had to leave halloran i dressed quiet and slipped out of the tent we were in when the guard came along i knocked him over like a ninepin with a green coconut i had and made for the railroad i got on that hand car and made it fly twas yet a while before daybreak when i saw the lights of port barrios about a mile away i stopped the hand car there and walked to the town i stepped inside the corporations of that town with care and hesitations i was not afraid of the army of guatemala but me soul quaked at the prospect of a hand to hand struggle with its employment bureau tis a country that hires its help easy and keeps em long sure i can fancy missis america and missis guatemala passin a bit of gossip some fine still night across the mountains oh dear says missis america and it s a lot of trouble i m havin ag in with the help senora ma am laws now says missis guatemala you don t say so ma am now mine never

with smoke emergin from her stacks i turned down a little grass street that run down to the water on the beach i found a little brown nigger man just about to shove off in a skiff hold on sambo says i savve english heap plenty yes says he with a pleasant grin what steamer is that i asks him and where is it going and what s the news and the good word and the time of day that steamer the conchita

gradin the tropics with a pick and shovel but tis not so much a question of insurrections now me little man as tis of the hired man problem tis anxious i am to resign a situation of responsibility and trust with the white wings department of your great and degraded country row me in your little boat out to that steamer and i ll give ye five dollars sinker pacers sinker pacers says i reducing the offer to the language and denomination of the tropic dialects cinco pesos repeats the little man five dollee you give twas not such a bad little man he had hesitations at first sayin that passengers leavin the country had to have papers and passports but at last he took me out alongside the steamer day was just breakin as we struck her and there wasn t a soul to be seen on board the water was very still and the nigger man gave me a lift from the boat and i climbed onto the steamer where her side was sliced to the deck for loadin fruit the hatches was open and i looked down and saw the cargo of bananas that filled the hold to within six feet of the top i thinks to myself clancy you better go as a stowaway it s safer the steamer men might hand you back to the employment bureau the tropic ll get you clancy if you don t watch out so i jumps down easy among the bananas and digs out a hole to hide in among the bunches in an hour or so i could hear the engines goin and feel the steamer rockin and i knew we were off to sea they left the hatches open for ventilation and pretty soon it was light enough in the hold to see fairly well i got to feelin a bit hungry and thought i d have a light fruit lunch by way of refreshment i creeped out of the hole i d made and stood up straight just then i saw another man crawl up about ten feet away and reach out and skin a banana and stuff it into his mouth twas a dirty man black faced and ragged and disgraceful of aspect yes the man was a ringer for the pictures of the fat weary willie in the funny papers i looked again and saw it was my general man de vega the great revolutionist mule rider and pickaxe importer when he saw me the general hesitated with his mouth filled with banana and his eyes the size of coconuts hist i says not a word or they ll put us off and make us walk veev la liberty i adds copperin the sentiment by shovin a banana into the source of it i was certain the general wouldn t recognize me the nefarious work of the tropics had left me lookin different there was half an inch of roan whiskers coverin me face and me costume was a pair of blue overalls and a red shirt how you come in the ship senor asked the general as soon as he could speak by the back door whist says i twas a glorious blow for liberty we struck i continues but we was overpowered by numbers let us accept our defeat like brave men and eat another banana were you in the cause of liberty fightin senor says the general sheddin tears on the cargo to the last says i twas i led the last desperate charge against the minions of the tyrant but it made them mad and we was forced to retreat twas i general procured the mule upon which you escaped could you give that ripe bunch a little boost this way general it s a bit out of my reach thanks say you so brave patriot said the general again weepin ah dios and i have not the means to reward your devotion barely did i my life bring away carrambos what a devil s animal was that mule senor like ships in one storm was i dashed about the skin on myself was ripped away with the thorns and vines upon the bark of a hundred trees did that beast of the infernal bump and cause outrage to the legs of mine in the night to port barrios i came i dispossess myself of that mountain of mule and hasten along the water shore i find a little boat to be tied i launch myself and row to the steamer i cannot see any mans on board so i climbed one rope which hang at the side i then myself hide in the bananas surely i say if the ship captains view me they shall throw me again to those guatemala those things are not good guatemala will shoot general de vega therefore i am hide and remain silent life itself is glorious liberty it is pretty good but so good as life i do not think three days as i said was the trip to new orleans the general man and me got to be cronies of the deepest dye bananas we ate until they were distasteful to the sight and an eyesore to the palate but to bananas alone was the bill of fare reduced at night i crawls out careful on the lower deck and gets a bucketful of fresh water that general de vega was a man inhabited by an engorgement of words and sentences he added to the monotony of the voyage by divestin himself of conversation he believed i was a revolutionist of his own party there bein as he told me a good many americans and other foreigners in its ranks twas a braggart and a conceited little gabbler it was though he considered himself a hero twas on himself he wasted all his regrets at the failing of his plot not a word did the little balloon have to say about the other misbehaving idiots that had been shot or run themselves to death in his revolution the second day out he was feelin pretty braggy and uppish for a stowed away conspirator that owed his existence to a mule and stolen bananas he was tellin me about the great railroad he had been buildin and he relates what he calls a comic incident about a fool irishman he inveigled from new orleans to sling a pick on his little morgue of a narrow gauge line twas sorrowful to hear the little dirty general tell the opprobrious story of how he put salt upon the tail of that reckless and silly bird clancy laugh he did hearty and long he shook with laughin the black faced rebel and outcast standing neck deep in bananas without friends or country ah senor he snickers to death you would have laughed at that drollest irish i say to him strong big mans is need very much in guatemala i will blows strike for your down pressed country he say that shall you do i tell him ah it was an irish so comic he sees one box break upon the wharf that contain for the guard a few gun he think there is gun in all the box but that is all pickaxe yes ah senor could you the face of that irish have seen when they set him to the work twas thus the ex boss of the employment bureau contributed to the tedium of the trip with merry jests and anecdote but now and then he would weep upon the bananas and make oration about the lost cause of liberty and the mule twas a pleasant sound when the steamer bumped against the pier in new orleans pretty soon we heard the pat a pat of hundreds of bare feet and the dago gang that unloads the fruit jumped on the deck and down into the hold me and the general worked a while at passing up the bunches and they thought we were part of the gang after about an hour we managed to slip off the steamer onto the wharf twas a great honor on the hands of an obscure clancy havin the entertainment of the representative of a great foreign filibustering power i first bought for the general and myself many long drinks and things to eat that were not bananas the general man trotted along at my side leaving all the arrangements to me i led him up to lafayette square and set him on a bench in the little park cigarettes i had bought for him and he humped himself down on the seat like a little fat contented hobo i look him over as he sets there and what i see pleases me brown by nature and instinct he is now brindled with dirt and dust praise to the mule his clothes is mostly strings and flaps yes the looks of the general man is agreeable to clancy i asks him delicate if by any chance he brought away anybody s money with him from guatemala he sighs and humps his shoulders against the bench not a cent all right maybe he tells me some of his friends in the tropic outfit will send him funds later the general was as clear a case of no visible means as i ever saw i told him not to move from the bench and then i went up to the corner of poydras and carondelet along there is o hara s beat in five minutes along comes o hara a big fine man red faced with shinin buttons swinging his club twould be a fine thing for guatemala to move into o hara s precinct twould be a fine bit of recreation for danny to suppress revolutions and uprisins once or twice a week with his club is workin yet danny says i walking up to him overtime says o hara looking over me suspicious want some of it fifty forty six is the celebrated city ordinance authorizing arrest conviction and imprisonment of persons that succeed in concealing their crimes from the police don t ye know jimmy clancy says i ye pink gilled monster so when o hara recognized me beneath the scandalous exterior bestowed upon me by the tropics i backed him into a doorway and told him what i wanted and why i wanted it all right jimmy says o hara go back and hold the bench i ll be along in ten minutes in that time o hara strolled through lafayette square and spied two weary willies disgracin one of the benches in ten minutes more j clancy and general de vega late candidate for the presidency of guatemala was in the station house the general is badly frightened and calls upon me to proclaim his distinguishments and rank the man says i to the police used to be a railroad man he s on the bum now tis a little bughouse he is on account of losin his job carrambos says the general fizzin like a little soda fountain you fought senor with my forces in my native country why do you say the lies you shall say i am the general de vega one soldier one caballero railroader says i again on the hog no good been livin for three days on stolen bananas look at him ain t that enough twenty five dollars or sixty days was what the recorder gave the general he didn t have a cent so he took the time they let me go as i knew they would for i had money to show and o hara spoke for me yes sixty days he got twas just so long as i slung a pick for the great country of kam guatemala clancy paused the bright starlight showed a reminiscent look of happy content on his seasoned features keogh leaned in his chair and gave his partner a slap on his thinly clad back that sounded like the crack of the surf on the sands tell em ye divil he chuckled how you got even with the tropical general in the way of agricultural maneuverings having no money concluded clancy with unction they set him to work his fine out with a gang from the parish prison clearing ursulines street around the corner was a saloon decorated genially with electric fans and cool merchandise i made that me headquarters and every fifteen minutes i d walk around and take a look at the little man filibusterin with a rake and shovel twas just such a hot broth of a day as this has been and i d call at him hey monseer and he d look at me black with the damp showin through his shirt in places fat strong mans says i to general de vega is needed in new orleans yes to carry on the good work carrambos erin go bragh xi the remnants of the code breakfast in coralio was at eleven therefore the people did not go to market early the little wooden market house stood on a patch of short trimmed grass under the vivid green foliage of a bread fruit tree thither one morning the venders leisurely convened bringing their wares with them a porch or platform six feet wide encircled the building shaded from the mid morning sun by the projecting grass thatched roof upon this platform the venders were wont to display their goods newly killed beef fish crabs fruit of the country cassava eggs dulces and high tottering stacks of native tortillas as large around as the sombrero of a spanish grandee but on this morning they whose stations lay on the seaward side of the market house instead of spreading their merchandise formed themselves into a softly jabbering and gesticulating group for there upon their space of the platform was sprawled asleep the unbeautiful figure of beelzebub blythe he lay upon a ragged strip of cocoa matting more than ever a fallen angel in appearance his suit of coarse flax soiled bursting at the seams crumpled into a thousand diversified wrinkles and creases inclosed him absurdly like the garb of some effigy that had been stuffed in sport and thrown there after indignity had been wrought upon it but firmly upon the high bridge of his nose reposed his gold rimmed glasses the surviving badge of his ancient glory the sun s rays reflecting quiveringly from the rippling sea upon his face and the voices of the market men woke beelzebub blythe he sat up blinking and leaned his back against the wall of the market drawing a blighted silk handkerchief from his pocket he assiduously rubbed and burnished his glasses and while doing this he became aware that his bedroom had been invaded and that polite brown and yellow men were beseeching him to vacate in favor of their market stuff if the senor would have the goodness a thousand pardons for bringing to him molestation but soon would come the compradores for the day s provisions surely they had ten thousand regrets at disturbing him in this manner they expanded to him the intimation that he must clear out and cease to clog the wheels of trade blythe stepped from the platform with the air of a prince leaving his canopied couch he never quite lost that air even at the lowest point of his fall it is clear that the college of good breeding does not necessarily maintain a chair of morals within its walls blythe shook out his wry clothing and moved slowly up the calle grande through the hot sand he moved without a destination in his mind the little town was languidly stirring to its daily life golden skinned babies tumbled over one another in the grass the sea breeze brought him appetite but nothing to satisfy it throughout coralio were its morning odors those from the heavily fragrant tropical flowers and from the bread baking in the outdoor ovens of clay and the pervading smoke of their fires where the smoke cleared the crystal air with some of the efficacy of faith seemed to remove the mountains almost to the sea bringing them so near that one might count the scarred glades on their wooded sides the light footed caribs were swiftly gliding to their tasks at the waterside already along the bosky trails from the banana groves files of horses were slowly moving concealed except for their nodding heads and plodding legs by the bunches of green golden fruit heaped upon their backs on doorsills sat women combing their long black hair and calling one to another across the narrow thoroughfares peace reigned in coralio arid and bald peace but still peace on that bright morning when nature seemed to be offering the lotus on the dawn s golden platter beelzebub blythe had reached rock bottom further descent seemed impossible that last night s slumber in a public place had done for him as long as he had had a roof to cover him there had remained unbridged the space that separates a gentleman from the beasts of the jungle and the fowls of the air but now he was little more than a whimpering oyster led to be devoured on the sands of a southern sea by the artful walrus circumstance and the implacable carpenter fate to blythe money was now but a memory he had drained his friends of all that their good fellowship had to offer then he had squeezed them to the last drop of their generosity and at last aaron like he had smitten the rock of their hardening bosoms for the scattering ignoble drops of charity itself he had exhausted his credit to the last real with the minute keenness of the shameless sponger he was aware of every source in coralio from which a glass of rum a meal or a piece of silver could be wheedled marshalling each such source in his mind he considered it with all the thoroughness and penetration that hunger and thirst lent him for the task all his optimism failed to thresh a grain of hope from the chaff of his postulations he had played out the game that one night in the open had shaken his nerves until then there had been left to him at least a few grounds upon which he could base his unblushing demands upon his neighbors stores now he must beg instead of borrowing the most brazen sophistry could not dignify by the name of loan the coin contemptuously flung to a beachcomber who slept on the bare boards of the public market but on this morning no beggar would have more thankfully received a charitable coin for the demon thirst had him by the throat the drunkard s matutinal thirst that requires to be slaked at each morning station on the road to tophet blythe walked slowly up the street keeping a watchful eye for any miracle that might drop manna upon him in his wilderness as he passed the popular eating house of madama vasquez madama s boarders were just sitting down to freshly baked bread aguacates pines and delicious coffee that sent forth odorous guarantee of its quality upon the breeze madama was serving she turned her shy stolid melancholy gaze for a moment out the window she saw blythe and her expression turned more shy and embarrassed beelzebub owed her twenty pesos he bowed as he had once bowed to less embarrassed dames to whom he owed nothing and passed on merchants and their clerks were throwing open the solid wooden doors of their shops polite but cool were the glances they cast upon blythe as he lounged tentatively by with the remains of his old jaunty air for they were his creditors almost without exception at the little fountain in the plaza he made an apology for a toilet with his wetted handkerchief across the open square filed the dolorous line of friends to the prisoners in the calaboza bearing the morning meal of the immured the food in their hands roused small longing in blythe it was drink that his soul craved or money to buy it in the streets he met many with whom he had been friends and equals and whose patience and liberality he had gradually exhausted willard geddie and paula cantered past him with the coolest of nods returning from their daily horseback ride along the old indian road keogh passed him at another corner whistling cheerfully and bearing a prize of newly laid eggs for the breakfast of himself and clancy the jovial scout of fortune was one of blythe s victims who had plunged his hand oftenest into his pocket to aid him but now it seemed that keogh too had fortified himself against further invasions his curt greeting and the ominous light in his full gray eye quickened the steps of beelzebub whom desperation had almost incited to attempt an additional loan three drinking shops the forlorn one next visited in succession in all of these his money his credit and his welcome had long since been spent but blythe felt that he would have fawned in the dust at the feet of an enemy that morning for one draught of aguardiente in two of the pulperias his courageous petition for drink was met with a refusal so polite that it stung worse than abuse the third establishment had acquired something of american methods and here he was seized bodily and cast out upon his hands and knees this physical indignity caused a singular change in the man as he picked himself up and walked away an expression of absolute relief came upon his features the specious and conciliatory smile that had been graven there was succeeded by a look of calm and sinister resolve beelzebub had been floundering in the sea of improbability holding by a slender life line to the respectable world that had cast him overboard he must have felt that with this ultimate shock the line had snapped and have experienced the welcome ease of the drowning swimmer who has ceased to struggle blythe walked to the next corner and stood there while he brushed the sand from his garments and repolished his glasses i ve got to do it oh i ve got to do it he told himself aloud if i had a quart of rum i believe i could stave it off yet for a little while but there s no more rum for beelzebub as they call me by the flames of tartarus if i m to sit at the right hand of satan somebody has got to pay the court expenses you ll have to pony up mr frank goodwin you re a good fellow but a gentleman must draw the line at being kicked into the gutter blackmail isn t a pretty word but it s the next station on the road i m travelling with purpose in his steps blythe now moved rapidly through the town by way of its landward environs he passed through the squalid quarters of the improvident negroes and on beyond the picturesque shacks of the poorer mestizos from many points along his course he could see through the umbrageous glades the house of frank goodwin on its wooded hill and as he crossed the little bridge over the lagoon he saw the old indian galvez scrubbing at the wooden slab that bore the name of miraflores beyond the lagoon the lands of goodwin began to slope gently upward a grassy road shaded by a munificent and diverse array of tropical flora wound from the edge of an outlying banana grove to the dwelling blythe took this road with long and purposeful strides goodwin was seated on his coolest gallery dictating letters to his secretary a sallow and capable native youth the household adhered to the american plan of breakfast and that meal had been a thing of the past for the better part of an hour the castaway walked to the steps and flourished a hand good morning blythe said goodwin looking up come in and have a chair anything i can do for you i want to speak to you in private goodwin nodded at his secretary who strolled out under a mango tree and lit a cigarette blythe took the chair that he had left vacant i want some money he began doggedly i m sorry said goodwin with equal directness but you can t have any you re drinking yourself to death blythe your friends have done all they could to help you to brace up you won t help yourself there s no use furnishing you with money to ruin yourself with any longer dear man said blythe tilting back his chair it isn t a question of social economy now it s past that i like you goodwin and i ve come to stick a knife between your ribs i was kicked out of espada s saloon this morning and society owes me reparation for my wounded feelings i didn t kick you out no but in a general way you represent society and in a particular way you represent my last chance i ve had to come down to it old man i tried to do it a month ago when losada s man was here turning things over but i couldn t do it then now it s different i want a thousand dollars goodwin and you ll have to give it to me only last week said goodwin with a smile a silver dollar was all you were asking for an evidence said blythe flippantly that i was still virtuous though under heavy pressure the wages of sin should be something higher than a peso worth forty eight cents let s talk business i am the villain in the third act and i must have my merited if only temporary triumph i saw you collar the late president s valiseful of boodle oh i know it s blackmail but i m liberal about the price i know i m a cheap villain one of the regular sawmill drama kind but you re one of my particular friends and i don t want to stick you hard suppose you go into the details suggested goodwin calmly arranging his letters on the table all right said beelzebub i like the way you take it i despise histrionics so you will please prepare yourself for the facts without any red fire calcium or grace notes on the saxophone on the night that his fly by night excellency arrived in town i was very drunk you will excuse the pride with which i state that fact but it was quite a feat for me to attain that desirable state somebody had left a cot out under the orange trees in the yard of madama ortiz s hotel i stepped over the wall laid down upon it and fell asleep i was awakened by an orange that dropped from the tree upon my nose and i laid there for a while cursing sir isaac newton or whoever it was that invented gravitation for not confining his theory to apples and then along came mr miraflores and his true love with the treasury in a valise and went into the hotel next you hove in sight and held a pow wow with the tonsorial artist who insisted upon talking shop after hours i tried to slumber again but once more my rest was disturbed this time by the noise of the popgun that went off upstairs then that valise came crashing down into an orange tree just above my head and i arose from my couch not knowing when it might begin to rain saratoga trunks when the army and the constabulary began to arrive with their medals and decorations hastily pinned to their pajamas and their snickersnees drawn i crawled into the welcome shadow of a banana plant i remained there for an hour by which time the excitement and the people had cleared away and then my dear goodwin excuse me i saw you sneak back and pluck that ripe and juicy valise from the orange tree i followed you and saw you take it to your own house a hundred thousand dollar crop from one orange tree in a season about breaks the record of the fruit growing industry being a gentleman at that time of course i never mentioned the incident to any one but this morning i was kicked out of a saloon my code of honor is all out at the elbows and i d sell my mother s prayer book for three fingers of aguardiente i m not putting on the screws hard it ought to be worth a thousand to you for me to have slept on that cot through the whole business without waking up and seeing anything goodwin opened two more letters and made memoranda in pencil on them then he called manuel to his secretary who came spryly the ariel when does she sail asked goodwin senor answered the youth at three this afternoon she drops down coast to punta soledad to complete her cargo of fruit from there she sails for new orleans without delay bueno said goodwin these letters may wait yet awhile the secretary returned to his cigarette under the mango tree in round numbers said goodwin facing blythe squarely how much money do you owe in this town not including the sums you have borrowed from me five hundred at a rough guess answered blythe lightly go somewhere in the town and draw up a schedule of your debts said goodwin come back here in two hours and i will send manuel with the money to pay them i will also have a decent outfit of clothing ready for you you will sail on the ariel at three manuel will accompany you as far as the deck of the steamer there he will hand you one thousand dollars in cash i suppose that we needn t discuss what you will be expected to do in return oh i understand piped blythe cheerily i was asleep all the time on the cot under madama ortiz s orange trees and i shake off the dust of coralio forever i ll play fair no more of the lotus for me your proposition is k youre a good fellow goodwin and i let you off light i ll agree to everything but in the meantime i ve a devil of a thirst on old man not a centavo said goodwin firmly until you are on board the ariel you would be drunk in thirty minutes if you had money now but he noticed the blood streaked eyeballs the relaxed form and the shaking hands of beelzebub and he stepped into the dining room through the low window and brought out a glass and a decanter of brandy take a bracer anyway before you go he proposed even as a man to the friend whom he entertains beelzebub blythe s eyes glistened at the sight of the solace for which his soul burned today for the first time his poisoned nerves had been denied their steadying dose and their retort was a mounting torment he grasped the decanter and rattled its crystal mouth against the glass in his trembling hand he flushed the glass and then stood erect holding it aloft for an instant for one fleeting moment he held his head above the drowning waves of his abyss he nodded easily at goodwin raised his brimming glass and murmured a health that men had used in his ancient paradise lost and then so suddenly that he spilled the brandy over his hand he set down his glass untasted in two hours his dry lips muttered to goodwin as he marched down the steps and turned his face toward the town in the edge of the cool banana grove beelzebub halted and snapped the tongue of his belt buckle into another hole i couldn t do it he explained feverishly to the waving banana fronds i wanted to but i couldn t a gentleman can t drink with the man that he blackmails xii shoes john de graffenreid atwood ate of the lotus root stem and flower the tropics gobbled him up he plunged enthusiastically into his work which was to try to forget rosine now they who dine on the lotus rarely consume it plain there is a sauce au diable that goes with it and the distillers are the chefs who prepare it and on johnny s menu card it read brandy with a bottle between them he and billy keogh would sit on the porch of the little consulate at night and roar out great indecorous songs until the natives slipping hastily past would shrug a shoulder and mutter things to themselves about the americanos diablos one day johnny s mozo brought the mail and dumped it on the table johnny leaned from his hammock and fingered the four or five letters dejectedly keogh was sitting on the edge of the table chopping lazily with a paper knife at the legs of a centipede that was crawling among the stationery johnny was in that phase of lotus eating when all the world tastes bitter in one s mouth same old thing he complained fool people writing for information about the country they want to know all about raising fruit and how to make a fortune without work half of em don t even send stamps for a reply they think a consul hasn t anything to do but write letters slit those envelopes for me old man and see what they want i m feeling too rocky to move keogh acclimated beyond all possibility of ill humor drew his chair to the table with smiling compliance on his rose pink countenance and began to slit open the letters four of them were from citizens in various parts of the united states who seemed to regard the consul at coralio as a cyclopedia of information they asked long lists of questions numerically arranged about the climate products possibilities laws business chances and statistics of the country in which the consul had the honor of representing his own government write em please billy said that inert official just a line referring them to the latest consular report tell em the state department will be delighted to furnish the literary gems sign my name don t let your pen scratch billy it ll keep me awake don t snore said keogh amiably and i ll do your work for you you need a corps of assistants anyhow don t see how you ever get out a report wake up a minute here s one more letter it s from your own town too dalesburg that so murmured johnny showing a mild and obligatory interest what s it about postmaster writes explained keogh says a citizen of the town wants some facts and advice from you says the citizen has an idea in his head of coming down where you are and opening a shoe store wants to know if you think the business would pay says he s heard of the boom along this coast and wants to get in on the ground floor in spite of the heat and his bad temper johnny s hammock swayed with his laughter keogh laughed too and the pet monkey on the top shelf of the bookcase chattered in shrill sympathy with the ironical reception of the letter from dalesburg great bunions exclaimed the consul shoe store what ll they ask about next i wonder overcoat factory i reckon say billy of our citizens how many do you suppose ever had on a pair of shoes keogh reflected judicially let s see there s you and me and not me said johnny promptly and incorrectly holding up a foot encased in a disreputable deerskin zapato i haven t been a victim to shoes in months but you ve got em though went on keogh and there s goodwin and blanchard and geddie and old lutz and doc gregg and that italian that s agent for the banana company and there s old delgado no he wears sandals and oh yes there s madama ortiz what kapes the hotel she had on a pair of red kid slippers at the baile the other night and miss pasa her daughter that went to school in the states she brought back some civilized notions in the way of footgear and there s the comandante s sister that dresses up her feet on feast days and mrs geddie who wears a two with a castilian instep and that s about all the ladies let s see don t some of the soldiers at the cuartel no that s so they re allowed shoes only when on the march in barracks they turn their little toeses out to grass bout right agreed the consul not over twenty out of the three thousand ever felt leather on their walking arrangements oh yes coralio is just the town for an enterprising shoe store that doesn t want to part with its goods wonder if old patterson is trying to jolly me he always was full of things he called jokes write him a letter billy i ll dictate it we ll jolly him back a few keogh dipped his pen and wrote at johnny s dictation with many pauses filled in with smoke and sundry travellings of the bottle and glasses the following reply to the dalesburg communication was perpetrated mr obadiah patterson dalesburg ala dear sir in reply to your favor of july d i have the honor to inform you that according to my opinion there is no place on the habitable globe that presents to the eye stronger evidence of the need of a first class shoe store than does the town of coralio there are inhabitants in the place and not a single shoe store the situation speaks for itself this coast is rapidly becoming the goal of enterprising business men but the shoe business is one that has been sadly overlooked or neglected in fact there are a considerable number of our citizens actually without shoes at present besides the want above mentioned there is also a crying need for a brewery a college of higher mathematics a coal yard and a clean and intellectual punch and judy show i have the honor to be your obt servant john de graffenreid atwood u s consul at coralio p s hello uncle obadiah how s the old burg racking along what would the government do without you and me look out for a green headed parrot and a bunch of bananas soon from your old friend johnny i throw in that postscript explained the consul so uncle obadiah won t take offense at the official tone of the letter now billy you get that correspondence fixed up and send pancho to the post office with it the ariadne takes the mail out tomorrow if they make up that load of fruit today the night programme in coralio never varied the recreations of the people were soporific and flat they wandered about barefoot and aimless speaking lowly and smoking cigar or cigarette looking down on the dimly lighted ways one seemed to see a threading maze of brunette ghosts tangled with a procession of insane fireflies in some houses the thrumming of lugubrious guitars added to the depression of the triste night giant tree frogs rattled in the foliage as loudly as the end man s bones in a minstrel troupe by nine o clock the streets were almost deserted not at the consulate was there often a change of bill keogh would come there nightly for coralio s one cool place was the little porch of that official residence the brandy would be kept moving and before midnight sentiment would begin to stir in the heart of the self exiled consul then he would relate to keogh the story of his ended romance each night keogh would listen patiently to the tale and be ready with untiring sympathy but don t you think for a minute thus johnny would always conclude his woeful narrative that i m grieving about that girl billy i ve forgotten her she never enters my mind if she were to enter that door right now my pulse wouldn t gain a beat that s all over long ago don t i know it keogh would answer of course you ve forgotten her proper thing to do wasn t quite k of her to listen to the knocks that er dink pawson kept giving you pink dawson a word of contempt would be in johnny s tones poor white trash that s what he was had five hundred acres of farming land though and that counted maybe i ll have a chance to get back at him some day the dawsons weren t anybody everybody in alabama knows the atwoods say billy did you know my mother was a de graffenreid why no keogh would say is that so he had heard it some three hundred times fact the de graffenreids of hancock county but i never think of that girl any more do i billy not for a minute my boy would be the last sounds heard by the conqueror of cupid at this point johnny would fall into a gentle slumber and keogh would saunter out to his own shack under the calabash tree at the edge of the plaza in a day or two the letter from the dalesburg postmaster and its answer had been forgotten by the coralio exiles but on the th day of july the fruit of the reply appeared upon the tree of events the andador a fruit steamer that visited coralio regularly drew into the offing and anchored the beach was lined with spectators while the quarantine doctor and the custom house crew rowed out to attend to their duties an hour later billy keogh lounged into the consulate clean and cool in his linen clothes and grinning like a pleased shark guess what he said to johnny lounging in his hammock too hot to guess said johnny lazily your shoe store man s come said keogh rolling the sweet morsel on his tongue with a stock of goods big enough to supply the continent as far down as tierra del fuego they re carting his cases over to the custom house now six barges full they brought ashore and have paddled back for the rest oh ye saints in glory won t there be regalements in the air when he gets onto the joke and has an interview with mr consul it ll be worth nine years in the tropics just to witness that one joyful moment keogh loved to take his mirth easily he selected a clean place on the matting and lay upon the floor the walls shook with his enjoyment johnny turned half over and blinked didn t tell me he said that anybody was fool enough to take that letter seriously four thousand dollar stock of goods gasped keogh in ecstasy talk about coals to newcastle why didn t he take a ship load of palm leaf fans to spitzenbergen while he was about it saw the old codger on the beach you ought to have been there when he put on his specs and squinted at the five hundred or so barefooted citizens standing around are you telling the truth billy asked the consul weakly am i you ought to see the buncoed gentleman s daughter he brought along looks she makes the brick dust senoritas here look like tar babies go on said johnny if you can stop that asinine giggling i hate to see a grown man make a laughing hyena of himself name is hemstetter went on keogh he s a hello what s the matter now johnny s moccasined feet struck the floor with a thud as he wriggled out of his hammock get up you idiot he said sternly or i ll brain you with this inkstand that s rosine and her father gad what a drivelling idiot old patterson is get up here billy keogh and help me what the devil are we going to do has all the world gone crazy keogh rose and dusted himself he managed to regain a decorous demeanor situation has got to be met johnny he said with some success at seriousness i didn t think about its being your girl until you spoke first thing to do is to get them comfortable quarters you go down and face the music and i ll trot out to goodwin s and see if mrs goodwin won t take them in they ve got the decentest house in town bless you billy said the consul i knew you wouldn t desert me the world s bound to come to an end but maybe we can stave it off for a day or two keogh hoisted his umbrella and set out for goodwin s house johnny put on his coat and hat he picked up the brandy bottle but set it down again without drinking and marched bravely down to the beach in the shade of the custom house walls he found mr hemstetter and rosine surrounded by a mass of gaping citizens the customs officers were ducking and scraping while the captain of the andador interpreted the business of the new arrivals rosine looked healthy and very much alive she was gazing at the strange scenes around her with amused interest there was a faint blush upon her round cheek as she greeted her old admirer mr hemstetter shook hands with johnny in a very friendly way he was an oldish impractical man one of that numerous class of erratic business men who are forever dissatisfied and seeking a change i am very glad to see you john may i call you john he said let me thank you for your prompt answer to our postmaster s letter of inquiry he volunteered to write to you on my behalf i was looking about for something different in the way of a business in which the profits would be greater i had noticed in the papers that this coast was receiving much attention from investors i am extremely grateful for your advice to come i sold out everything that i possess and invested the proceeds in as fine a stock of shoes as could be bought in the north you have a picturesque town here john i hope business will be as good as your letter justifies me in expecting johnny s agony was abbreviated by the arrival of keogh who hurried up with the news that mrs goodwin would be much pleased to place rooms at the disposal of mr hemstetter and his daughter so there mr hemstetter and rosine were at once conducted and left to recuperate from the fatigue of the voyage while johnny went down to see that the cases of shoes were safely stored in the customs warehouse pending their examination by the officials keogh grinning like a shark skirmished about to find goodwin to instruct him not to expose to mr hemstetter the true state of coralio as a shoe market until johnny had been given a chance to redeem the situation if such a thing were possible that night the consul and keogh held a desperate consultation on the breezy porch of the consulate send em back home began keogh reading johnny s thoughts i would said johnny after a little silence but i ve been lying to you billy all right about that said keogh affably i ve told you hundreds of times said johnny slowly that i had forgotten that girl haven t i about three hundred and seventy five admitted the monument of patience i lied repeated the consul every time i never forgot her for one moment i was an obstinate ass for running away just because she said no once and i was too proud a fool to go back i talked with rosine a few minutes this evening up at goodwin s i found out one thing you remember that farmer fellow who was always after her dink pawson asked keogh pink dawson well he wasn t a hill of beans to her she says she didn t believe a word of the things be told her about me but i m sewed up now billy that tomfool letter we sent ruined whatever chance i had left she ll despise me when she finds out that her old father has been made the victim of a joke that a decent schoolboy wouldn t have been guilty of shoes why he couldn t sell twenty pairs of shoes in coralio if he kept store here for twenty years you put a pair of shoes on one of these caribs or spanish brown boys and what d he do stand on his head and squeal until he d kicked em off none of em ever wore shoes and they never will if i send em back home i ll have to tell the whole story and what ll she think of me i want that girl worse than ever billy and now when she s in reach i ve lost her forever because i tried to be funny when the thermometer was at keep cheerful said the optimistic keogh and let em open the store i ve been busy myself this afternoon we can stir up a temporary boom in foot gear anyhow i ll buy six pairs when the doors open i ve been around and seen all the fellows and explained the catastrophe they ll all buy shoes like they was centipedes frank goodwin will take cases of em the geddies want about eleven pairs between em clancy is going to invest the savings of weeks and even old doc gregg wants three pairs of alligator hide slippers if they ve got any tens blanchard got a look at miss hemstetter and as he s a frenchman no less than a dozen pairs will do for him a dozen customers said johnny for a stock of shoes it won t work there s a big problem here to figure out you go home billy and leave me alone i ve got to work at it all by myself take that bottle of three star along with you no sir not another ounce of booze for the united states consul i ll sit here tonight and pull out the think stop if there s a soft place on this proposition anywhere i ll land on it if there isn t there ll be another wreck to the credit of the gorgeous tropics keogh left feeling that he could be of no use johnny laid a handful of cigars on a table and stretched himself in a steamer chair when the sudden daylight broke silvering the harbor ripples he was still sitting there then he got up whistling a little tune and took his bath at nine o clock he walked down to the dingy little cable office and hung for half an hour over a blank the result of his application was the following message which he signed and had transmitted at a cost of to pinkney dawson dalesburg ala draft for comes to you next mail ship me immediately pounds stiff dry cockleburrs new use here in arts market price twenty cents pound further orders likely rush xiii ships within a week a suitable building had been secured in the calle grande and mr hemstetter s stock of shoes arranged upon their shelves the rent of the store was moderate and the stock made a fine showing of neat white boxes attractively displayed johnny s friends stood by him loyally on the first day keogh strolled into the store in a casual kind of way about once every hour and bought shoes after he had purchased a pair each of extension soles congress gaiters button kids low quartered calfs dancing pumps rubber boots tans of various hues tennis shoes and flowered slippers he sought out johnny to be prompted as to the names of other kinds that he might inquire for the other english speaking residents also played their parts nobly by buying often and liberally keogh was grand marshal and made them distribute their patronage thus keeping up a fair run of custom for several days mr hemstetter was gratified by the amount of business done thus far but expressed surprise that the natives were so backward with their custom oh they re awfully shy explained johnny as he wiped his forehead nervously they ll get the habit pretty soon they ll come with a rush when they do come one afternoon keogh dropped into the consul s office chewing an unlighted cigar thoughtfully got anything up your sleeve he inquired of johnny if you have it s about time to show it if you can borrow some gent s hat in the audience and make a lot of customers for an idle stock of shoes come out of it you d better spiel the boys have all laid in enough footwear to last em ten years and there s nothing doing in the shoe store but dolcy far nienty i just came by there your venerable victim was standing in the door gazing through his specs at the bare toes passing by his emporium the natives here have got the true artistic temperament me and clancy took eighteen tintypes this morning in two hours there s been but one pair of shoes sold all day blanchard went in and bought a pair of furlined house slippers because he thought he saw miss hemstetter go into the store i saw him throw the slippers into the lagoon afterwards there s a mobile fruit steamer coming in tomorrow or next day said johnny we can t do anything until then what are you going to do try to create a demand political economy isn t your strong point said the consul impudently you can t create a demand but you can create a necessity for a demand that s what i am going to do two weeks after the consul sent his cable a fruit steamer brought him a huge mysterious brown bale of some unknown commodity johnny s influence with the custom house people was sufficiently strong for him to get the goods turned over to him without the usual inspection he had the bale taken to the consulate and snugly stowed in the back room that night he ripped open a corner of it and took out a handful of the cockleburrs he examined them with the care with which a warrior examines his arms before he goes forth to battle for his lady love and life the burrs were the ripe august product as hard as filberts and bristling with spines as tough and sharp as needles johnny whistled softly a little tune and went out to find billy keogh later in the night when coralio was steeped in slumber he and billy went forth into the deserted streets with their coats bulging like balloons all up and down the calle grande they went sowing the sharp burrs carefully in the sand along the narrow sidewalks in every foot of grass between the silent houses and then they took the side streets and byways missing none no place where the foot of man woman or child might fall was slighted many trips they made to and from the prickly hoard and then nearly at the dawn they laid themselves down to rest calmly as great generals do after planning a victory according to the revised tactics and slept knowing that they had sowed with the accuracy of satan sowing tares and the perseverance of paul planting with the rising sun came the purveyors of fruits and meats and arranged their wares in and around the little market house at one end of the town near the seashore the market house stood and the sowing of the burrs had not been carried that far the dealers waited long past the hour when their sales usually began none came to buy que hay they began to exclaim one to another at their accustomed time from every dobe and palm hut and grass thatched shack and dim patio glided women black women brown women lemon colored women women dun and yellow and tawny they were the marketers starting to purchase the family supply of cassava plantains meat fowls and tortillas decollete they were and bare armed and bare footed with a single skirt reaching below the knee stolid and ox eyed they stepped from their doorways into the narrow paths or upon the soft grass of the streets the first to emerge uttered ambiguous squeals and raised one foot quickly another step and they sat down with shrill cries of alarm to pick at the new and painful insects that had stung them upon the feet que picadores diablos they screeched to one another across the narrow ways some tried the grass instead of the paths but there they were also stung and bitten by the strange little prickly balls they plumped down in the grass and added their lamentations to those of their sisters in the sandy paths all through the town was heard the plaint of the feminine jabber the venders in the market still wondered why no customers came then men lords of the earth came forth they too began to hop to dance to limp and to curse they stood stranded and foolish or stopped to pluck at the scourge that attacked their feet and ankles some loudly proclaimed the pest to be poisonous spiders of an unknown species and then the children ran out for their morning romp and now to the uproar was added the howls of limping infants and cockleburred childhood every minute the advancing day brought forth fresh victims dona maria castillas y buenventura de las casas stepped from her honored doorway as was her daily custom to procure fresh bread from the panaderia across the street she was clad in a skirt of flowered yellow satin a chemise of ruffled linen and wore a purple mantilla from the looms of spain her lemon tinted feet alas were bare her progress was majestic for were not her ancestors hidalgos of aragon three steps she made across the velvety grass and set her aristocratic sole upon a bunch of johnny s burrs dona maria castillas y buenventura de las casas emitted a yowl even as a wild cat turning about she fell upon hands and knees and crawled ay like a beast of the field she crawled back to her honorable door sill don senor ildefonso federico valdazar juez de la paz weighing twenty stone attempted to convey his bulk to the pulperia at the corner of the plaza in order to assuage his matutinal thirst the first plunge of his unshod foot into the cool grass struck a concealed mine don ildefonso fell like a crumpled cathedral crying out that he had been fatally bitten by a deadly scorpion everywhere were the shoeless citizens hopping stumbling limping and picking from their feet the venomous insects that had come in a single night to harass them the first to perceive the remedy was esteban delgado the barber a man of travel and education sitting upon a stone he plucked burrs from his toes and made oration behold my friends these bugs of the devil i know them well they soar through the skies in swarms like pigeons these are dead ones that fell during the night in yucatan i have seen them as large as oranges yes there they hiss like serpents and have wings like bats it is the shoes the shoes that one needs zapatos zapatos para mi esteban hobbled to mr hemstetter s store and bought shoes coming out he swaggered down the street with impunity reviling loudly the bugs of the devil the suffering ones sat up or stood upon one foot and beheld the immune barber men women and children took up the cry zapatos zapatos the necessity for the demand had been created the demand followed that day mr hemstetter sold three hundred pairs of shoes it is really surprising he said to johnny who came up in the evening to help him straighten out the stock how trade is picking up yesterday i made but three sales i told you they d whoop things up when they got started said the consul i think i shall order a dozen more cases of goods to keep the stock up said mr hemstetter beaming through his spectacles i wouldn t send in any orders yet advised johnny wait till you see how the trade holds up each night johnny and keogh sowed the crop that grew dollars by day at the end of ten days two thirds of the stock of shoes had been sold and the stock of cockleburrs was exhausted johnny cabled to pink dawson for another pounds paying twenty cents per pound as before mr hemstetter carefully made up an order for worth of shoes from northern firms johnny hung about the store until this order was ready for the mail and succeeded in destroying it before it reached the postoffice that night he took rosine under the mango tree by godwin s porch and confessed everything she looked him in the eye and said you are a very wicked man father and i will go back home you say it was a joke i think it is a very serious matter but at the end of half an hour s argument the conversation had been turned upon a different subject the two were considering the respective merits of pale blue and pink wall paper with which the old colonial mansion of the atwoods in dalesburg was to be decorated after the wedding on the next morning johnny confessed to mr hemstetter the shoe merchant put on his spectacles and said through them you strike me as being a most extraordinary young scamp if i had not managed this enterprise with good business judgment my entire stock of goods might have been a complete loss now how do you propose to dispose of the rest of it when the second invoice of cockleburrs arrived johnny loaded them and the remainder of the shoes into schooner and sailed down the coast to alazan there in the same dark and diabolical manner he repeated his success and came back with a bag of money and not so much as a shoestring and then he besought his great uncle of the waving goatee and starred vest to accept his resignation for the lotus no longer lured him he hankered for the spinach and cress of dalesburg the services of mr william terence keogh as acting consul pro term were suggested and accepted and johnny sailed with the hemstetters back to his native shores keogh slipped into the sinecure of the american consulship with the ease that never left him even in such high places the tintype establishment was soon to become a thing of the past although its deadly work along the peaceful and helpless spanish main was never effaced the restless partners were about to be off again scouting ahead of the slow ranks of fortune but now they would take different ways there were rumors of a promising uprising in peru and thither the martial clancy would turn his adventurous steps as for keogh he was figuring in his mind and on quires of government letter heads a scheme that dwarfed the art of misrepresenting the human countenance upon tin what suits me keogh used to say in the way of a business proposition is something diversified that looks like a longer shot than it is something in the way of a genteel graft that isn t worked enough for the correspondence schools to be teaching it by mail i take the long end but i like to have at least as good a chance to win as a man learning to play poker on an ocean steamer or running for governor of texas on the republican ticket and when i cash in my winnings i don t want to find any widows and orphans chips in my stack the grass grown globe was the green table on which keogh gambled the games he played were of his own invention he was no grubber after the diffident dollar nor did he care to follow it with horn and hounds rather he loved to coax it with egregious and brilliant flies from its habitat in the waters of strange streams yet keogh was a business man and his schemes in spite of their singularity were as solidly set as the plans of a building contractor in arthur s time sir william keogh would have been a knight of the round table in these modern days he rides abroad seeking the graft instead of the grail three days after johnny s departure two small schooners appeared off coralio after some delay a boat put off from one of them and brought a sunburned young man ashore this young man had a shrewd and calculating eye and he gazed with amazement at the strange things that he saw he found on the beach some one who directed him to the consul s office and thither he made his way at a nervous gait keogh was sprawled in the official chair drawing caricatures of his uncle s head on an official pad of paper he looked up at his visitor where s johnny atwood inquired the sunburned young man in a business tone gone said keogh working carefully at uncle sam s necktie that s just like him remarked the nut brown one leaning against the table he always was a fellow to gallivant around instead of tending to business will he be in soon don t think so said keogh after a fair amount of deliberation i s pose he s out at some of his tomfoolery conjectured the visitor in a tone of virtuous conviction johnny never would stick to anything long enough to succeed i wonder how he manages to run his business here and never be round to look after it i m looking after the business just now admitted the pro term consul are you then say where s the factory what factory asked keogh with a mildly polite interest why the factory where they use them cockleburrs lord knows what they use em for anyway i ve got the basements of both them ships out there loaded with em i ll give you a bargain in this lot i ve had every man woman and child around dalesburg that wasn t busy pickin em for a month i hired these ships to bring em over everybody thought i was crazy now you can have this lot for fifteen cents a pound delivered on land and if you want more i guess old alabam can come up to the demand johnny told me when he left home that if he struck anything down here that there was any money in he d let me in on it shall i drive the ships in and hitch a look of supreme almost incredulous delight dawned in keogh s ruddy countenance he dropped his pencil his eyes turned upon the sunburned young man with joy in them mingled with fear lest his ecstasy should prove a dream for god s sake tell me said keogh earnestly are you dink pawson my name is pinkney dawson said the cornerer of the cockleburr market billy keogh slid rapturously and gently from his chair to his favorite strip of matting on the floor there were not many sounds in coralio on that sultry afternoon among those that were may be mentioned a noise of enraptured and unrighteous laughter from a prostrate irish american while a sunburned young man with a shrewd eye looked on him with wonder and amazement also the tramp tramp tramp of many well shod feet in the streets outside also the lonesome wash of the waves that beat along the historic shores of the spanish main xiv masters of arts a two inch stub of a blue pencil was the wand with which keogh performed the preliminary acts of his magic so with this he covered paper with diagrams and figures while he waited for the united states of america to send down to coralio a successor to atwood resigned the new scheme that his mind had conceived his stout heart indorsed and his blue pencil corroborated was laid around the characteristics and human frailties of the new president ofanchuria these characteristics and the situation out of which keogh hoped to wrest a golden tribute deserve chronicling contributive to the clear order of events president losada many called him dictator was a man whose genius would have made him conspicuous even among anglo saxons had not that genius been intermixed with other traits that were petty and subversive he had some of the lofty patriotism of washington the man he most admired the force of napoleon and much of the wisdom of the sages these characteristics might have justified him the assumption of the title of the illustrious liberator had they not been accompanied by a stupendous and amazing vanity that kept him in the less worthy ranks of the dictators yet he did his country great service with a mighty grasp he shook it nearly free from the shackles of ignorance and sloth and the vermin that fed upon it and all but made it a power in the council of nations he established schools and hospitals built roads bridges railroads and palaces and bestowed generous subsidies upon the arts and sciences he was the absolute despot and the idol of his people the wealth of the country poured into his hands other presidents had been rapacious without reason losada amassed enormous wealth but his people had their share of the benefits the joint in his armor was his insatiate passion for monuments and tokens commemorating his glory in every town he caused to be erected statues of himself bearing legends in praise of his greatness in the walls of every public edifice tablets were fixed reciting his splendor and the gratitude of his subjects his statuettes and portraits were scattered throughout the land in every house and hut one of the sycophants in his court painted him as st john with a halo and a train of attendants in full uniform losada saw nothing incongruous in this picture and had it hung in a church in the capital he ordered from a french sculptor a marble group including himself with napoleon alexander the great and one or two others whom he deemed worthy of the honor he ransacked europe for decorations employing policy money and intrigue to cajole the orders he coveted from kings and rulers on state occasions his breast was covered from shoulder to shoulder with crosses stars golden roses medals and ribbons it was said that the man who could contrive for him a new decoration or invent some new method of extolling his greatness might plunge a hand deep into the treasury this was the man upon whom billy keogh had his eye the gentle buccaneer had observed the rain of favors that fell upon those who ministered to the president s vanities and he did not deem it his duty to hoist his umbrella against the scattering drops of liquid fortune in a few weeks the new consul arrived releasing keogh from his temporary duties he was a young man fresh from college who lived for botany alone the consulate at coralio gave him the opportunity to study tropical flora he wore smoked glasses and carried a green umbrella he filled the cool back porch of the consulate with plants and specimens so that space for a bottle and chair was not to be found keogh gazed on him sadly but without rancor and began to pack his gripsack for his new plot against stagnation along the spanish main required of him a voyage overseas soon came the karlsefin again she of the trampish habits gleaning a cargo of coconuts for a speculative descent upon the new york market keogh was booked for a passage on the return trip yes i m going to new york he explained to the group of his countrymen that had gathered on the beach to see him off but i ll be back before you miss me i ve undertaken the art education of this piebald country and i m not the man to desert it while it s in the early throes of tintypes with this mysterious declaration of his intentions keogh boarded the karlsefin ten days later shivering with the collar of his thin coat turned high he burst into the studio of carolus white at the top of a tall building in tenth street new york city carolus white was smoking a cigarette and frying sausages over an oil stove he was only twenty three and had noble theories about art billy knight exclaimed white extending the hand that was not busy with the frying pan from what part of the uncivilized world i wonder hello carry said keogh dragging forward a stool and holding his fingers close to the stove i m glad i found you so soon i ve been looking for you all day in the directories and art galleries the free lunch man on the corner told me where you were quick i was sure you d be painting pictures yet keogh glanced about the studio with the shrewd eye of a connoisseur in business yes you can do it he declared with many gentle nods of his head that big one in the corner with the angels and greeh clouds and band wagon is just the sort of thing we want what would you call that carry scene from coney island ain t it that said white i had intended to call the translation of elijah but you may be nearer right than i am name doesn t matter said keogh largely it s the frame and the varieties of paint that does the trick now i can tell you in a minute what i want i ve come on a little voyage of two thousand miles to take you in with me on a scheme i thought of you as soon as the scheme showed itself to me how would you like to go back with me and paint a picture ninety days for the trip and five thousand dollars for the job cereal food or hair tonic posters asked white it isn t an ad what kind of a picture is it to be it s a long story said keogh go ahead with it if you don t mind while you talk i ll just keep my eye on these sausages let em get one shade deeper than a vandyke brown and you spoil em keogh explained his project they were to return to coralio where white was to pose as a distinguished american portrait painter who was touring in the tropics as a relaxation from his arduous and remunerative professional labors it was not an unreasonable hope even to those who trod in the beaten paths of business that an artist with so much prestige might secure a commission to perpetuate upon canvas the lineaments of the president and secure a share of the pesos that were raining upon the caterers to his weaknesses keogh had set his price at ten thousand dollars artists had been paid more for portraits he and white were to share the expenses of the trip and divide the possible profits thus he laid the scheme before white whom he had known in the west before one declared for art and the other became a bedouin before long the two machinators abandoned the rigor of the bare studio for a snug corner of a cafe there they sat far into the night with old envelopes and keogh s stub of blue pencil between them at twelve o clock white doubled up in his chair with his chin on his fist and shut his eyes at the unbeautiful wall paper i ll go you billy he said in the quiet tones of decision i ve got two or three hundred saved up for sausages and rent and i ll take the chance with you five thousand it will give me two years in paris and one in italy i ll begin to pack tomorrow you ll begin in ten minutes said keogh it s to morrow now the karlsefin starts back at four p m come on to your painting shop and i ll help you for five months in the year coralio is the newport of anchuria then only does the town possess life from november to march it is practically the seat of government the president with his official family sojourns there and society follows him the pleasure loving people make the season one long holiday of amusement and rejoicing fiestas balls games sea bathing processions and small theatres contribute to their enjoyment the famous swiss band from the capital plays in the little plaza every evening while the fourteen carriages and vehicles in the town circle in funereal but complacent procession indians from the interior mountains looking like pre historic stone idols come down to peddle their handiwork in the streets the people throng the narrow ways a chattering happy careless stream of buoyant humanity preposterous children rigged out with the shortest of ballet skirts and gilt wings howl underfoot among the effervescent crowds especially is the arrival of the presidential party at the opening of the season attended with pomp show and patriotic demonstrations of enthusiasm and delight when keogh and white reached their destination on the return trip of the karlsefin the gay winter season was well begun as they stepped upon the beach they could hear the band playing in the plaza the village maidens with fireflies already fixed in their dark locks were gliding barefoot and coy eyed along the paths dandies in white linen swinging their canes were beginning their seductive strolls the air was full of human essence of artificial enticement of coquetry indolence pleasure the man made sense of existence the first two or three days after their arrival were spent in preliminaries keogh escorted the artist about town introducing him to the little circle of english speaking residents and pulling whatever wires he could to effect the spreading of white s fame as a painter and then keogh planned a more spectacular demonstration of the idea he wished to keep before the public he and white engaged rooms in the hotel de los extranjeros the two were clad in new suits of immaculate duck with american straw hats and carried canes of remarkable uniqueness and inutility few caballeros in coralio even the gorgeously uniformed officers of the anchurian army were as conspicuous for ease and elegance of demeanor as keogh and his friend the great american painter senor white white set up his easel on the beach and made striking sketches of the mountain and sea views the native population formed at his rear in a vast chattering semicircle to watch his work keogh with his care for details had arranged for himself a pose which he carried out with fidelity his ro e was that of friend to the great artist a man of affairs and leisure the visible emblem of his position was a pocket camera for branding the man who owns it said he a genteel dilettante with a bank account and an easy conscience a steam yacht ain t in it with a camera you see a man doing nothing but loafing around making snap shots and you know right away he reads up well in bradstreet you notice these old millionaire boys soon as they get through taking everything else in sight they go to taking photographs people are more impressed by a kodak than they are by a title or a four karat scarf pin so keogh strolled blandly about coralio snapping the scenery and the shrinking senoritas while white posed conspicuously in the higher regions of art two weeks after their arrival the scheme began to bear fruit an aide de camp of the president drove to the hotel in a dashing victoria the president desired that senor white come to the casa morena for an informal interview keogh gripped his pipe tightly between his teeth not a cent less than ten thousand he said to the artist remember the price and in gold or its equivalent don t let him stick you with this bargain counter stuff they call money here perhaps it isn t that he wants said white get out said keogh with splendid confidence i know what he wants he wants his picture painted by the celebrated young american painter and filibuster now sojourning in his down trodden country off you go the victoria sped away with the artist keogh walked up and down puffing great clouds of smoke from his pipe and waited in an hour the victoria swept again to the door of the hotel deposited white and vanished the artist dashed up the stairs three at a step keogh stopped smoking and became a silent interrogation point landed exclaimed white with his boyish face flushed with elation billy you are a wonder he wants a picture i ll tell you all about it by heavens that dictator chap is a corker he s a dictator clear down to his finger ends he s a kind of combination of julius caesar lucifer and chauncey depew done in sepia polite and grim that s his way the room i saw him in was about ten acres big and looked like a mississippi steamboat with its gilding and mirrors and white paint he talks english better than i can ever hope to the matter of the price came up i mentioned ten thousand i expected him to call the guard and have me taken out and shot he didn t move an eyelash he just waved one of his chestnut hands in a careless way and said whatever you say i am to go back tomorrow and discuss with him the details of the picture keogh hung his head self abasement was easy to read in his downcast countenance i m failing carry he said sorrowfully i m not fit to handle these man s size schemes any longer peddling oranges in a push cart is about the suitable graft for me when i said ten thousand i swear i thought i had sized up that brown man s limit to within two cents he d have melted down for fifteen thousand just as easy say carry you ll see old man keogh safe in some nice quiet idiot asylum won t you if he makes a break like that again the casa morena although only one story in height was a building of brown stone luxurious as a palace in its interior it stood on a low hill in a walled garden of splendid tropical flora at the upper edge of coralio the next day the president s carriage came again for the artist keogh went out for a walk along the beach where he and his picture box were now familiar sights when he returned to the hotel white was sitting in a steamer chair on the balcony well said keogh did you and his nibs decide on the kind of a chromo he wants white got up and walked back and forth on the balcony a few times then he stopped and laughed strangely his face was flushed and his eyes were bright with a kind of angry amusement look here billy he said somewhat roughly when you first came to me in my studio and mentioned a picture i thought you wanted a smashed oats or a hair tonic poster painted on a range of mountains or the side of a continent well either of those jobs would have been art in its highest form compared to the one you ve steered me against i can t paint that picture billy you ve got to let me out let me try to tell you what that barbarian wants he had it all planned out and even a sketch made of his idea the old boy doesn t draw badly at all but ye goddesses of art listen to the monstrosity he expects me to paint he wants himself in the center of the canvas of course he is to be painted as jupiter sitting on olympus with the clouds at his feet at one side of him stands george washington in full regimentals with his hand on the president s shoulder an angel with outstretched wings hovers overhead and is placing a laurel wreath on the president s head crowning him queen of the may i suppose in the background is to be cannon more angels and soldiers the man who would paint that picture would have to have the soul of a dog and would deserve to go down into oblivion without even a tin can tied to his tail to sound his memory little beads of moisture crept out all over billy keogh s brow the stub of his blue pencil had not figured out a contingency like this the machinery of his plan had run with flattering smoothness until now he dragged another chair upon the balcony and got white back to his seat he lit his pipe with apparent calm now sonny he said with gentle grimness you and me will have an art to art talk you ve got your art and i ve got mine yours is the real pierian stuff that turns up its nose at bock beer signs and oleographs of the old mill mine s the art of business this was my scheme and it worked out like two and two paint that president man as old king cole or venus or a landscape or a fresco or a bunch of lilies or anything he thinks he looks like but get the paint on the canvas and collect the spoils you wouldn t throw me down carry at this stage of the game think of that ten thousand i can t help thinking of it said white and that s what hurts i m tempted to throw every ideal i ever had down in the mire and steep my soul in infamy by painting that picture that five thousand meant three years of foreign study to me and i d almost sell my soul for that now it ain t as bad as that said keogh soothingly it s a business proposition it s so much paint and time against money i don t fall in with your idea that that picture would so everlastingly jolt the art side of the question george washington was all right you know and nobody could say a word against the angel i don t think so bad of that group if you was to give jupiter a pair of epaulets and a sword and kind of work the clouds around to look like a blackberry patch it wouldn t make such a bad battle scene why if we hadn t already settled on the price he ought to pay an extra thousand for washington and the angel ought to raise it five hundred you don t understand billy said white with an uneasy laugh some of us fellows who try to paint have big notions about art i wanted to paint a picture some day that people would stand before and forget that it was made of paint i wanted it to creep into them like a bar of music and mushroom there like a soft bullet and i wanted em to go away and ask what else has he done and i didn t want em to find a thing not a portrait nor a magazine cover nor an illustration nor a drawing of a girl nothing but the picture that s why i ve lived on fried sausages and tried to keep true to myself i persuaded myself to do this portrait for the chance it might give me to study abroad but this howling screaming caricature good lord can t you see how it is sure said keogh as tenderly as he would have spoken to a child and he laid a long forefinger on white s knee i see it s bad to have your art all slugged up like that i know you wanted to paint a big thing like the panorama of the battle of gettysburg but let me kalsomine you a little mental sketch to consider up to date we re out on this scheme our capital took every cent both of us could raise we ve got about enough left to get back to new york on i need my share of that ten thousand i want to work a copper deal in idaho and make a hundred thousand that s the business end of the thing come down off your art perch carry and let s land that hatful of dollars billy said white with an effort i ll try i won t say i ll do it but i ll try i ll go at it and put it through if i can that s business said keogh heartily good boy now here s another thing rush that picture crowd it through as quick as you can get a couple of boys to help you mix the paint if necessary i ve picked up some pointers around town the people here are beginning to get sick of mr president they say he s been too free with concessions and they accuse him of trying to make a dicker with england to sell out the country we want that picture done and paid for before there s any row in the great patio of casa morena the president caused to be stretched a huge canvas under this white set up his temporary studio for two hours each day the great man sat to him white worked faithfully but as the work progressed he had seasons of bitter scorn of infinite self contempt of sullen gloom and sardonic gaiety keogh with the patience of a great general soothed coaxed argued kept him at the picture at the end of a month white announced that the picture was completed jupiter washington angels clouds cannon and all his face was pale and his mouth drawn straight when he told keogh he said the president was much pleased with it it was to be hung in the national gallery of statesmen and heroes the artist had been requested to return to casa morena on the following day to receive payment at the appointed time he left the hotel silent under his friend s joyful talk of their success an hour later he walked into the room where keogh was waiting threw his hat on the floor and sat upon the table billy he said in strained and laboring tones i ve a little money out west in a small business that my brother is running it s what i ve been living on while i ve been studying art i ll draw out my share and pay you back what you ve lost on this scheme lost exclaimed keogh jumping up didn t you get paid for the picture yes i got paid said white but just now there isn t any picture and there isn t any pay if you care to hear about it here are the edifying details the president and i were looking at the painting his secretary brought a bank draft on new york for ten thousand dollars and handed it to me the moment i touched it i went wild i tore it into little pieces and threw them on the floor a workman was repainting the pillars inside the patio a bucket of his paint happened to be convenient i picked up his brush and slapped a quart of blue paint all over that ten thousand dollar nightmare i bowed and walked out the president didn t move or speak that was one time he was taken by surprise it s tough on you billy but i couldn t help it there seemed to be excitement in coralio outside there was a confused rising murmur pierced by high pitched cries bajo el traidor muerte el traidor were the words they seemed to form listen to that exclaimed white bitterly i know that much spanish they re shouting down with the traitor i heard them before i felt that they meant me i was a traitor to art the picture had to go down with the blank fool would have suited your case better said keogh with fiery emphasis you tear up ten thousand dollars like an old rag because the way you ve spread on five dollars worth of paint hurts your conscience next time i pick a side partner in a scheme the man has got to go before a notary and swear he never even heard the word ideal mentioned keogh strode from the room white hot white paid little attention to his resentment the scorn of billy keogh seemed a trifling thing beside the greater self scorn he had escaped in coralio the excitement waxed an outburst was imminent the cause of this demonstration of displeasure was the presence in the town of a big pink cheeked englishman who it was said was an agent of his government come to clinch the bargain by which the president placed his people in the hands of a foreign power it was charged that not only had he given away priceless concessions but that the public debt was to be transferred into the hands of the english and the custom houses turned over to them as a guarantee the long enduring people had determined to make their protest felt on that night in coralio and in other towns their ire found vent veiling mobs mercurial but dangerous roamed the streets they overthrew the great bronze statue of the president that stood in the center of the plaza and hacked it to shapeless pieces they tore from public buildings the tablets set there proclaiming the glory of the illustrious liberator his pictures in the government offices were demolished the mobs even attacked the casa morena but were driven away by the military which remained faithful to the executive all the night terror reigned the greatness of losada was shown by the fact that by noon the next day order was restored and he was still absolute he issued proclamations denying positively that any negotiation of any kind had been entered into with england sir stafford vaughn the pink cheeked englishman also declared in placards and in public print that his presence there had no international significance he was a traveller without guile in fact so he stated he had not even spoken with the president or been in his presence since his arrival during this disturbance white was preparing for his homeward voyage in the steamship that was to sail within two or three days about noon keogh the restless took his camera out with the hope of speeding the lagging hours the town was now as quiet as if peace had never departed from her perch on the red tiled roofs about the middle of the afternoon keogh hurried back to the hotel with something decidedly special in his air he retired to the little room where he developed his pictures later on he came out to white on the balcony with a luminous grim predatory smile on his face do you know what that is he asked holding up a x photograph mounted on cardboard snap shot of a senorita sitting in the sand alliteration unintentional guessed white lazily wrong saidkeogh with shining eyes it s a slung shot it s a can of dynamite it s a gold mine it s a sight draft on your president man for twenty thousand dollars yes sir twenty thousand this time and no spoiling the picture no ethics of art in the way art you with your smelly little tubes i ve got you skinned to death with a kodak take a look at that white took the picture in his hand and gave a long whistle jove he exclaimed but wouldn t that stir up a row in town if you let it be seen how in the world did you get it billy you know that high wall around the president man s back garden i was up there trying to get a bird s eye of the town i happened to notice a chink in the wall where a stone and a lot of plaster had slid out thinks i i ll take a peep through to see how mr president s cabbages are growing the first thing i saw was him and this sir englishman sitting at a little table about twenty feet away they had the table all spread over with documents and they were hobnobbing over them as thick as two pirates twas a nice corner of the garden all private and shady with palms and orange trees and they had a pail of champagne set by handy in the grass i knew then was the time for me to make my big hit in art so i raised the machine up to the crack and pressed the button just as i did so them old boys shook hands on the deal you see they took that way in the picture keogh put on his coat and hat what are you going to do with it asked white me said keogh in a hurt tone why i m going to tie a pink ribbon to it and hang it on the what not of course i m surprised at you but while i m out you just try to figure out what ginger cake potentate would be most likely to want to buy this work of art for his private collection just to keep it out of circulation the sunset was reddening the tops of the coconut palms when billy keogh came back from casa morena he nodded to the artist s questioning gaze and lay down on a cot with his hands under the back of his head i saw him he paid the money like a little man they didn t want to let me in at first i told em it was important yes that president man is on the plenty able list he s got a beautiful business system about the way he uses his brains all i had to do was to hold up the photograph so he could see it and name the price he just smiled and walked over to a safe and got the cash twenty one thousand dollar brand new united states treasury notes he laid on the table like i d pay out a dollar and a quarter fine notes too they crackled with a sound like burning the brush off a ten acre lot let s try the feel of one said white curiously i never saw a thousand dollar bill keogh did not immediately respond carry he said in an absent minded way you think a heap of your art don t you more said white frankly than has been for the financial good of my self and my friends i thought you were a fool the other day went on keogh quietly and i m not sure now that you wasn t but if you was so am i i ve been in some funny deals carry but i ve always managed to scramble fair and match my brains and capital against the other fellow s but when it comes to well when you ve got the other fellow cinched and the screws on him and he s got to put up why it don t strike me as being a man s game they ve got a name for it you know it s confound you don t you understand a fellow feels it s some thing like that blamed art of yours he well i tore that photograph up and laid the pieces on that stack of money and shoved the whole business back across the table excuse me mr losada i said but i guess i ve made a mistake in the price you get the photo for nothing now carry you get out the pencil and we ll do some more figuring i d like to save enough out of our capital for you to have some fried sausages in your joint when you get back to new york xv dickey there is little consecutiveness along the spanish main things happen there intermittently even time seems hang his scythe daily on the branch of an orange tree while he takes a siesta and a cigarette after the ineffectual revolt against the administration of president losada the country settled again into quiet toleration of the abuses with which he had been charged in coralio old political enemies went arm in arm lightly eschewing for the time all differences of opinion the failure of the art expedition did not stretch the cat footed keogh upon his back the ups and downs of fortune made smooth travelling for his nimble steps his blue pencil stub was at work again before the smoke of the steamer on which white sailed had cleared away from the horizon he had but to speak a word to geddie to find his credit negotiable for whatever goods he wanted from the store of brannigan company on the same day on which white arrived in new york keogh at the rear of a train of five pack mules loaded with hardware and cutlery set his face toward the grim interior mountains there the indian tribes wash gold dust from the auriferous streams and when a market is brought to them trading is brisk and muy bueno in the cordilleras in coralio time folded his wings and paced wearily along his drowsy path they who had most cheered the torpid hours were gone clancy had sailed on a spanish barque for colon contemplating a cut across the isthmus and then a further voyage to end at callao where the fighting was said to be on geddie whose quiet and genial nature had once served to mitigate the frequent dull reaction of lotus eating was now a home man happy with his bright orchid paula and never even dreaming of or regretting the unsolved sealed and monogramed bottle whose contents now inconsiderable were held safely in the keeping of the sea well may the walrus most discerning and eclectic of beasts place sealing wax midway on his program of topics that fall pertinent and diverting upon the ear atwood was gone he of the hospitable back porch and ingenuous cunning doctor gregg with his trepanning story smoldering within him was a whiskered volcano always showing signs of imminent eruption and was not to be considered in the ranks of those who might contribute to the amelioration of ennui the new consul s note chimed with the sad sea waves and the violent tropical greens he had not a bar of scheherezade or of the round table in his lute goodwin was employed with large projects what time he was loosed from them found him at his home where he loved to be therefore it will be seen that there was a dearth of fellowship and entertainment among the foreign contingent of coralio and then dicky maloney dropped down from the clouds upon the town and amused it nobody knew where dicky maloney hailed from or how he reached coralio he appeared there one day and that was all he afterward said that he came on the fruit steamer thor but an inspection of the thor s passenger list of that date was found to be maloneyless curiosity however soon perished and dicky took his place among the odd fish cast up by the caribbean he was an active devil may care rollicking fellow with an engaging gray eye the most irresistible grin a rather dark or much sunburned complexion and a head of the fieriest red hair ever seen in that country speaking the spanish language as well as he spoke english and seeming always to have plenty of silver in his pockets it was not long before he was a welcome companion whithersoever he went he had an extreme fondness for vino blanco and gained the reputation of being able to drink more of it than any three men in town everybody called him dicky everybody cheered up at the sight of him especially the natives to whom his marvellous red hair and his free and easy style were a constant delight and envy wherever you went in the town you would soon see dicky or hear his genial laugh and find around him a group of admirers who appreciated him both for his good nature and the white wine he was always so ready to buy a considerable amount of speculation was had concerning the object of his sojourn there until one day he silenced this by opening a small shop for the sale of tobacco dulces and the handiwork of the interior indians fibre and silk woven goods deerskin zapatos and basketwork of tule reeds even then he did not change his habits for he was drinking and playing cards half the day and night with the comandante the collector of customs the jefe politico and other gay dogs among the native officials one day dicky saw pasa the daughter of madama ortiz sitting in the side door of the hotel de los extranjeros he stopped in his tracks still for the first time in coralio and then he sped swift as a deer to find vasquez a gilded native youth to present him the young men had named pasa la santita naranjadita naranjadita is a spanish word for a certain color that you must go to more trouble to describe in english by saying the little saint tinted the most beautiful delicate slightly orange golden you will approximate the description of madama ortiz s daughter la madama ortiz sold rum in addition to other liquors now you must know that the rum expiates whatever opprobrium attends upon the other commodities for rum making mind you is a government monopoly and to keep a government dispensary assures respectability if not preeminence moreover the saddest of precisians could find no fault with the conduct of the shop customers drank there in the lowest of spirits and fearsomely as in the shadow of the dead for madama s ancient and vaunted lineage counteracted even the rum s behest to be merry for was she not of the iglesias who landed with pizarro and had not her deceased husband been comisionado de caminos y puentes for the district in the evenings pasa sat by the window in the room next to the one where they drank and strummed dreamily upon her guitar and then by twos and threes would come visiting young caballeros and occupy the prim line of chairs set against the wall of this room they were there to besiege the heart of la santita their method which is not proof against intelligent competition consisted of expanding the chest looking valorous and consuming a gross or two of cigarettes even saints delicately oranged prefer to be wooed differently dona pasa would tide over the vast chasms of nicotinized silence with music from her guitar while she wondered if the romances she had read about gallant and more more contiguous cavaliers were all lies at somewhat regular intervals madama would glide in from the dispensary with a sort of drought suggesting gleam in her eye and there would be a rustling of stiffly starched white trousers as one of the caballeros would propose an adjournment to the bar that dicky maloney would sooner or later explore this field was a thing to be foreseen there were few doors in coralio into which his red head had not been poked in an incredibly short space of time after his first sight of her he was there seated close beside her rocking chair there was no back against the wall poses in dicky s theory of wooing his plan of subjection was an attack at close range to carry the fortress with one concentrated ardent eloquent irresistible escalade that was dicky s way pasa was descended from the proudest spanish families in the country moreover she had had unusual advantages two years in a new orleans school had elevated her ambitions and fitted her for a fate above the ordinary maidens of her native land and yet here she succumbed to the first red haired scamp with a glib tongue and a charming smile that came along and courted her properly very soon dicky took her to the little church on the corner of the plaza and mrs maloney was added to her string of distinguished names and it was her fate to sit with her patient saintly eyes and figure like a bisque psyche behind the sequestered counter of the little shop while dicky drank and philandered with is frivolous acquaintances the women with their naturally fine instinct saw a chance for vivisection and delicately taunted her with his habits she turned upon them in a beautiful steady blaze of sorrowful contempt you meat cows she said in her level crystal clear tones you know nothing of a man your men are maromeros they are fit only to roll cigarettes in the shade until the sun strikes and shrivels them up they drone in your hammocks and you comb their hair and feed them with fresh fruit my man is of no such blood let him drink of the wine when he has taken sufficient of it to drown one of your flaccitos he will come home to me more of a man than one thousand of your pobrecitos my hair he smooths and braids to me he sings he himself removes my zapatos and there there upon each instep leaves a kiss he holds oh you will never understand blind ones who have never known a man sometimes mysterious things happened at night about dicky s shop while the front of it was dark in the little room back of it dicky and a few of his friends would sit about a table carrying on some kind of very quiet negocios until quite late finally he would let them out the front door very carefully and go upstairs to his little saint these visitors were generally conspirator like men with dark clothes and hats of course these dark things were noticed after a while and talked about dicky seemed to care nothing at all for the society of the alien residents of the town he avoided goodwin and his skilful escape from the trepanning story of doctor gregg is still referred to in coralio as a masterpiece of lightning diplomacy many letters arrived addressed to mr dicky maloney or senor dickee maloney to the considerable pride of pasa that so many people should desire to write to him only confirmed her own suspicion that the light from his red head shone around the world as to their contents she never felt curiosity there was a wife to you the one mistake dicky made in coralio was to run out of money at the wrong time where his money came from was a puzzle for the sales of his shop were next to nothing but that source failed and at a peculiarly unfortunate time it was when the comandante don senor el coronel encarnacion rios looked upon the little saint seated in the shop and felt his heart go pitapat the comandante who was versed in all the intricate art of gallantry first delicately hinted at his sentiments by donning his dress uniform and strutting up and down fiercely before her window pasa glancing demurely with her saintly eyes instantly perceived his resemblance to her parrot chichi and was diverted to the extent of smile the comandante saw the smile which was not intended for him convinced of an impression made he entered the shop confidently and advanced to open compliment pasa froze he pranced she flamed royally he was charmed to injudicious persistence she commanded him to leave the shop he tried to capture her hand and dicky entered smiling broadly full of white wine and the devil he spent five minutes in punishing the comandante scientifically and carefully so that the pain might be prolonged as far as possible at the end of that time he pitched the rash wooer out the door upon the stones of the street senseless a barefooted policeman who had been watching the affair from across the street blew a whistle a squad of four soldiers came running from the cuartel around the corner when they saw that the offender was dicky they stopped and blew more whistles which brought out reinforcements of eight deeming the odds against them sufficiently reduced the military advanced upon the disturber dicky being thoroughly imbued with the martial spirit stooped and drew the comandante s sword which was girded about him and charged his foe he chased the standing army four squares playfully prodding its squealing rear and hacking at its ginger colored heels but he was not so successful with the civic authorities six muscular nimble policemen overpowered him and conveyed him triumphantly but warily to jail el diablo colorado they dubbed him and derided the military for its defeat dicky with the rest of the prisoners could look out through the barred door at the grass of the little plaza at a row of orange trees and the red tile roofs and dobe walls of a line of insignificant stores at sunset along a path across this plaza came a melancholy procession of sad faced women bearing plantains cassava bread and fruit each coming with food to some wretch behind those bars to whom she still clung and furnished the means of life twice a day morning and evening they were permitted to come water was furnished to her compulsory guests by the republic but no food that evening dicky s name was called by the sentry and he stepped before the bars of the door there stood his little saint a black mantilla draped about her head and shoulders her face like glorified melancholy her clear eyes gazing longingly at him as if they might draw him between the bars to her she brought a chicken some oranges dulces and a loaf of white bread a soldier inspected the food and passed it in to dicky pasa spoke calmly as she always did briefly in her thrilling flute like tones angel of my life she said let it not be long that thou art away from me thou knowest that life is not a thing to be endured with thou not at my side tell me if i can do aught in this matter if not i will wait a little while i come again in the morning dicky with his shoes removed so as not to disturb his fellow prisoners tramped the floor of the jail half the night condemning his lack of money and the cause of it whatever that might have been he knew very well that money would have brought his release at once for two days succeeding pasa came at the appointed times and brought him food he eagerly inquired each time if a letter or package had come for him and she mournfully shook her head on the morning of the third day she brought only a small loaf of bread there were dark circles under her eyes she seemed as calm as ever by jingo said dicky who seemed to speak in english or spanish as the whim seized him this is dry provender muchachita is this the best you can dig up for a fellow pasa looked at him as a mother looks at a beloved but capricious babe think better of it she said in a low voice since for the next meal there will be nothing the last centavo is spent she pressed closer against the grating sell the goods in the shop take anything for them have i not tried did i not offer them for one tenth their cost not even one peso would any one give there is not one real in this town to assist dickee malonee dick clenched his teeth grimly that s the comandante he growled he s responsible for that sentiment wait oh wait till the cards are all out pasa lowered her voice to almost a whisper and listen heart of my heart she said i have endeavored to be brave but i cannot live without thee three days now dicky caught a faint gleam of steel from the folds of her mantilla for once she looked in his face and saw it without a smile stern menacing and purposeful then he suddenly raised his hand and his smile came back like a gleam of sunshine the hoarse signal of an incoming steamer s siren sounded in the harbor dicky called to the sentry who was pacing before the door what steamer comes the catarina of the vesuvius line without doubt of that line go you picarilla said dicky joyously to pasa to the american consul tell him i wish to speak with him see that he comes at once and look you let me see a different look in those eyes for i promise your head shall rest upon this arm tonight it was an hour before the consul came he held his green umbrella under his arm and mopped his forehead impatiently now see here maloney he began captiously you fellows seem to think you can cut up any kind of row and expect me to pull you out of it i m neither the war department nor a gold mine this country has its laws you know and there s one against pounding the senses out of the regular army you irish are forever getting into trouble i don t see what i can do anything like tobacco now to make you comfortable or newspapers son of eli interrupted dicky gravely you haven t changed an iota that is almost a duplicate of the speech you made when old koen s donkeys and geese got into the chapel loft and the culprits wanted to hide in your room oh heavens exclaimed the consul hurriedly adjusting his spectacles are you a yale man too were you in that crowd i don t seem to remember any one with red any one named maloney such a lot of college men seem to have misused their advantages one of the best mathematicians of the class of is selling lottery tickets in belize a cornell man dropped off here last month he was second steward on a guano boat i ll write to the department if you like maloney or if there s any tobacco or newspa there s nothing interrupted dicky shortly but this you go tell the captain of the catarina that dicky maloney wants to see him as soon as he can conveniently come tell him where i am hurry that s all the consul glad to be let off so easily hurried away the captain of the catarina a stout man sicilian born soon appeared shoving with little ceremony through the guards to the jail door the vesuvius fruit company had a habit of doing things that way in anchuria i am exceeding sorry exceeding sorry said the captain to see this occur i place myself at your service mr maloney what you need shall be furnished whatever you say shall be done dicky looked at him unsmilingly his red hair could not detract from his attitude of severe dignity as he stood tall and calm with his now grim mouth forming a horizontal line captain de lucco i believe i still have funds in the hands of your company ample and personal funds i ordered a remittance last week the money has not arrived you know what is needed in this game money and money and more money why has it not been sent by the cristobal replied de lucco gesticulating it was despatched where is the cristobal off cape antonio i spoke her with a broken shaft a tramp coaster was towing her back to new orleans i brought money ashore thinking your need for it might not withstand delay in this envelope is one thousand dollars there is more if you need it mr maloney for the present it will suffice said dicky softening as he crinkled the envelope and looked down at the half inch thickness of smooth dingy bills the long green he said gently with a new reverence in his gaze is there anything it will not buy captain i had three friends replied de lucco who was a bit of a philosopher who had money one of them speculated in stocks and made ten million another is in heaven and the third married a poor girl whom he loved the answer then said dicky is held by the almighty wall street and cupid so the question remains this queried the captain including dicky s surroundings in a significant gesture of his hand is it it is notiit is not connected with the business of your little shop there is no failure in your plans no no said dicky this is merely the result of a little private affair of mine a digression from the regular line of business they say for a complete life a man must know poverty love and war but they don t go well together capitan mio no there is no failure in my business the little shop is doing very well when the captain had departed dicky called the sergeant of the jail squad and asked am i preso by the military or by the civil authority surely there is no martial law in effect now senor bueno now go or send to the alcalde the juez de la paz and the jefe de los policios tell them i am prepared at once to satisfy the demands of justice a folded bill of the long green slid into the sergeant s hand then dicky s smile came back again for he knew that the hours of his captivity were numbered and he hummed in time with the sentry s tread they re hanging men and women now for lacking of the green so that night dicky sat by the window of the room over his shop an his little saint sat close by working at something silken and dainty dicky was thoughtful and grave his red hair was in an unusual state of disorder pasa s fingers often ached to smooth and arrange it but dicky would never allow it he was poring tonight over a great litter of maps and books and papers on his table until that perpendicular line came between his brows that always distressed pasa presently she went and brought his hat and stood with it until he looked up inquiringly it is sad for you here she explained go out and drink vino blanco come back when you get that smile you used to wear that is what i wish to see dicky laughed and threw down his papers the vino blanco stage is past it has served its turn perhaps after all there was less entered my mouth and more my ears than people thought but there will be no more maps or frowns tonight i promise you that come they sat upon a reed silleta at the window and watched the quivering gleams from the lights of the catarina reflected in the harbor presently pasa rippled out one of her infrequent chirrups of audible laughter i was thinking she began anticipating dicky s question of the foolish things girls have in their minds because i went to school in the states i used to have ambitions nothing less than to be the president s wife would satisfy me and look thou red picaroon to what obscure fate thou hast stolen me don t give up hope said dicky smiling more than one irishman has been the ruler of a south american country there was a dictator of chili named o higgins why not a president maloney of anchuria say the word santita mia and we ll make the race no no no thou red haired reckless one sighed pasa i am content she laid her head against his arm here xvi rouge et noir it has been indicated that disaffection followed the elevation of losada to the presidency this feeling continued to grow throughout the entire republic there seemed to be a spirit of silent sullen discontent even the old liberal party to which goodwin zavalla and other patriots had lent their aid was disappointed losada had failed to become a popular idol fresh taxes fresh import duties and more than all his tolerance of the outrageous oppression of citizens by the military had rendered him the most obnoxious president since the despicable alforan the majority of his own cabinet were out of sympathy with him the army which he had courted by giving it license to tyrannize had been his main and thus far adequate support but the most impolitic of the administration s moves had been when it antagonized the vesuvius fruit company an organization plying twelve steamers with a cash capital somewhat larger than anchuria s surplus and debt combined reasonably an established concern like the vesuvius would become irritated at having a small retail republic with no rating at all attempt to squeeze it so when the government proxies applied for a subsidy they encountered a polite refusal the president at once retaliated by clapping an export duty of one real per bunch on bananas a thing unprecedented in fruit growing countries the vesuvius company had invested large sums in wharves and plantations along the anchurian coast their agents had erected fine homes in the towns where they had their headquarters and heretofore had worked with the republic in good will and with advantage to both it would lose an immense sum if compelled to move out the selling price of bananas from vera cruz to trinidad was three reales per bunch this new duty of one real would have ruined the fruit growers in anchuria and have seriously discommoded the vesuvius company had it declined to pay it but for some reason the vesuvius continued to buy anchurian fruit paying four reals for it and not suffering the growers to bear the loss this apparent victory deceived his excellency and he began to hunger for more of it he sent an emissary to request a conference with a representative of the fruit company the vesuvius sent mr franzoni a little stout cheerful man always cool and whistling airs from verdi s operas senor espirition of the office of the minister of finance attempted the sandbagging in behalf of anchuria the meeting took place in the cabin of the salvador of the vesuvius line senor espirition opened negotiations by announcing that the government contemplated the building of a railroad to skirt the alluvial coast lands after touching upon the benefits such a road would confer upon the interests of the vesuvius he reached the definite suggestion that a contribution to the road s expenses of say fifty thousand pesos would not be more than an equivalent to benefits received mr franzoni denied that his company would receive any benefits from a contemplated road as its representative he must decline to contribute fifty thousand pesos but he would assume the responsibility of offering twenty five did senor espirition understand senor franzoni to mean twenty five thousand pesos by no means twenty five pesos and in silver not in gold your offer insults my government cried senor espirition rising with indignation then said mr franzoni in warning tone we will change it the offer was never changed could mr franzoni have meant the government this was the state of affairs in anchuria when the winter season opened at coralio at the end of the second year of losada s administration so when the government and society made its annual exodus to the seashore it was evident that the presidential advent would not be celebrated by unlimited rejoicing the tenth of november was the day set for the entrance into coralio of the gay company from the capital a narrow gauge railroad runs twenty miles into the interior from solitas the government party travels by carriage from san mateo to this road s terminal point and proceeds by train to solitas from here they march in grand procession to coralio where on the day of their coming festivities and ceremonies abound but this season saw an ominous dawning of the tenth of november although the rainy season was over the day seemed to hark back to reeking june a fine drizzle of rain fell all during the forenoon the procession entered coralio amid a strange silence president losada was an elderly man grizzly bearded with a considerable ratio of indian blood revealed in his cinnamon complexion his carriage headed the procession surrounded and guarded by captain cruz and his famous troop of one hundred light horse el ciento huilando colonel rocas followed with a regiment of the regular army the president s sharp beady eyes glanced about him for the expected demonstration of welcome but he faced a stolid indifferent array of citizens sightseers the anchurians are by birth and habit and they turned out to their last able bodied unit to witness the scene but they maintained an accusive silence they crowded the streets to the very wheel ruts they covered the red tile roofs to the eaves but there was never a viva from them no wreaths of palm and lemon branches or gorgeous strings of paper roses hung from the windows and balconies as was the custom there was an apathy a dull dissenting disapprobation that was the more ominous because it puzzled no one feared an outburst a revolt of the discontents for they had no leader the president and those loyal to him had never even heard whispered a name among them capable of crystallizing the dissatisfaction into opposition no there could be no danger the people always procured a new idol before they destroyed an old one at length after a prodigious galloping and curvetting of red sashed majors gold laced colonels and epauletted generals the procession formed for its annual progress down the calle grande to the casa morena where the ceremony of welcome to the visiting president always took place the swiss band led the line of march after it pranced the local comandante mounted and a detachment of his troops next came a carriage with four members of the cabinet conspicuous among them the minister of war old general pilar with his white moustache and his soldierly bearing then the president s vehicle containing also the ministers of finance and state and surrounded by captain cruz s light horse formed in a close double file of fours following them the rest of the officials of state the judges and distinguished military and social ornaments of public and private life as the band struck up and the movement began like a bird of ill omen the valhalla the swiftest steamship of the vesuvius line glided into the harbor in plain view of the president and his train of course there was nothing menacing about its arrival a business firm does not go to war with a nation but it reminded senor espirition and others in those carriages that the vesuvius fruit company was undoubtedly carrying something up its sleeve for them by the time the van of the procession had reached the government building captain cronin of the valhalla and mr vincenti member of the vesuvius company had landed and were pushing their way bluff hearty and nonchalant through the crowd on the narrow sidewalk clad in white linen big debonair with an air of good humored authority they made conspicuous figures among the dark mass of unimposing anchurians as they penetrated to within a few yards of the steps of the casa morena looking easily above the heads of the crowd they perceived another that towered above the undersized natives it was the fiery poll of dicky maloney against the wall close by the lower step and his broad seductive grin showed that he recognized their presence dicky had attired himself becomingly for the festive occasion in a well fitting black suit pasa was close by his side her head covered with the ubiquitous black mantilla mr vincenti looked at her attentively botticelli s madonna he remarked gravely i wonder when she got into the game i don t like his getting tangled with the women i hoped he would keep away from them captain cronin s laugh almost drew attention from the parade with that head of hair keep away from the women and a maloney hasn t he got a license but nonsense aside what do you think of the prospects it s a species of filibustering out of my line vincenti glanced again at dicky s head and smiled rouge et noir he said there you have it make your play gentlemen our money is on the red the lad s game said cronin with a commending look at the tall easy figure by the steps but tis all like fly by night theatricals to me the talk s bigger than the stage there s a smell of gasoline in the air and they re their own audience and scene shifters they ceased talking for general pilar had descended from the first carriage and had taken his stand upon the top step of casa morena as the oldest member of the cabinet custom had decreed that he should make the address of welcome presenting the keys of the official residence to the president at its close general pilar was one of the most distinguished citizens of the republic hero of three wars and innumerable revolutions he was an honored guest at european courts and camps an eloquent speaker and a friend to the people he represented the highest type of the anchurians holding in his hand the gilt keys of casa morena he began his address in a historical form touching upon each administration and the advance of civilization and prosperity from the first dim striving after liberty down to present times arriving at the regime of president losada at which point according to precedent he should have delivered a eulogy upon its wise conduct and the happiness of the people general pilar paused then he silently held up the bunch of keys high above his head with his eyes closely regarding it the ribbon with which they were bound fluttered in the breeze it still blows cried the speaker exultantly citizens of anchuria give thanks to the saints this night that our air is still free thus disposing of losada s administration he abruptly reverted to that of olivarra anchuria s most popular ruler olivarra had been assassinated nine years before while in the prime of life and usefulness a faction of the liberal party led by losada himself had been accused of the deed whether guilty or not it was eight years before the ambitious and scheming losada had gained his goal upon this theme general pilar s eloquence was loosed he drew the picture of the beneficent olivarra with a loving hand he reminded the people of the peace the security and the happiness they had enjoyed during that period he recalled in vivid detail and with significant contrast the last winter sojourn of president olivarra in coralio when his appearance at their fiestas was the signal for thundering vivas of love and approbation the first public expression of sentiment from the people that day followed a low sustained murmur went among them like the surf rolling along the shore ten dollars to a dinner at the saint charles remarked mr vincenti that rouge wins i never bet against my own interests said captain cronin lighting a cigar long winded old boy for his age what s he talking about my spanish replied vincenti runs about ten words to the minute his is something around two hundred whatever he s saying he s getting them warmed up friends and brothers general pilar was saying could i reach out my hand this day across the lamentable silence of the grave to olivarra the good to the ruler who was one of you whose tears fell when you sorrowed and whose smile followed your joy i would bring him back to you but olivarra is dead dead at the hands of a craven assassin the speaker turned and gazed boldly into the carriage of the president his arm remained extended aloft as if to sustain his peroration the president was listening aghast at this remarkable address of welcome he was sunk back upon his seat trembling with rage and dumb surprise his dark hands tightly gripping the carriage cushions half rising he extended one arm toward the speaker and shouted a harsh command at captain cruz the leader of the flying hundred sat his horse immovable with folded arms giving no sign of having heard losada sank back again his dark features distinctly paling who says that olivarra is dead suddenly cried the speaker his voice old as he was sounding like a battle trumpet his body lies in the grave but to the people he loved he has bequeathed his spirit yes more his learning his courage his kindness yes more his youth his image people of anchuria have you forgotten ramon the son of olivarra cronin and vincenti watching closely saw dicky maloney suddenly raise his hat tear off his shock of red hair leap up the steps and stand at the side of general pilar the minister of war laid his arm across the young man s shoulders all who had known president olivarra saw again his same lion like pose the same frank undaunted expression the same high forehead with the peculiar line of the clustering crisp black hair general pilar was an experienced orator he seized the moment of breathless silence that preceded the storm citizens of anchuria he trumpeted holding aloft the keys of casa morena i am here to deliver these keys the keys to your homes and liberty to your chosen president shall i deliver them to enrico olivarra s assassin or to his son olivarra olivarra the crowd shrieked and howled all vociferated the magic name men women children and the parrots and the enthusiasm was not confined to the blood of the plebs colonel rocas ascended the steps and laid his sword theatrically at young ramon olivarra s feet four members of the cabinet embraced him captain cruz gave a command and twenty of el ciento huilando dismounted and arranged themselves in a cordon about the steps of casa morena but ramon olivarra seized that moment to prove himself a born genius and politician he waved those soldiers aside and descended the steps to the street there without losing his dignity or the distinguished elegance that the loss of his red hair brought him betook the proletariat to his bosom the barefooted the dirty indians caribs babies beggars old young saints soldiers and sinners he missed none of them while this act of the drama was being presented the scene shifters had been busy at the duties that had been assigned to them two of cruz s dragoons had seized the bridle reins of losada s horses others formed a close guard around the carriage and they galloped off with the tyrant and his two unpopular ministers no doubt a place had been prepared for them there are a number of well barred stone apartments in coralio rouge wins said mr vincenti calmly lighting another cigar captain cronin had been intently watching the vicinity of the stone steps for some time good boy he exclaimed suddenly as if relieved i wondered if he was going to forget his kathleen mavourneen young olivarra had reascended the steps and spoken a few words to general pilar then that distinguished veteran descended to the ground and approached pasa who still stood wonder eyed where dicky had left her with his plumed hat in his hand and his medals and decorations shining on his breast the general spoke to her and gave her his arm and they went up the stone steps of the casa morena together and then ramon olivarra stepped forward and took both her hands before all the people and while the cheering was breaking out afresh everywhere captain cronin and mr vincenti turned and walked back toward the shore where the gig was waiting for them there ll be another presidente proclamada in the morning said mr vincenti musingly as a rule they are not as reliable as the elected ones but this youngster seems to have some good stuff in him he planned and maneuvered the entire campaign olivarra s widow you know was wealthy after her husband was assassinated she went to the states and educated her son at yale the vesuvius company hunted him up and backed him in the little game it s a glorious thing said cronin half jestingly to be able to discharge a government and insert one of your own choosing in these days oh it is only amatter of business said vincenti stopping and offering the stump of his cigar to a monkey that swung down from a lime tree and that is what moves the world of today that extra real on the price of bananas had to go we took the shortest way of removing it xvii two recalls there remains three duties to be performed before the curtain falls upon the patched comedy two have been promised the third is no less obligatory it was set forth in the program of this tropic vaudeville that it would be made known why shorty day of the columbia detective agency lost his position also that smith should come again to tell us what mystery he followed that night on the shores of anchuria when he strewed so many cigar stumps around the coconut palm during his lonely night vigil on the beach these things were promised but a bigger thing yet remains to be accomplished the clearing up of a seeming wrong that has been done according to the array of chronicled facts truthfully set forth that have been presented and one voice speaking shall do these three things two men sat on a stringer of a north river pier in the city of new york a steamer from the tropics had begun to unload bananas and oranges on the pier now and then a banana or two would fall from an overripe bunch and one of the two men would shamble forward seize the fruit and return to share it with his companion one of the men was in the ultimate stage of deterioration as far as rain and wind and sun could wreck the garments he wore it had been done in his person the ravages of drink were as plainly visible and yet upon his high bridged rubicund nose was jauntily perched a pair of shining and flawless gold rimmed glasses the other man was not so far gone upon the descending highway of the incompetents truly the flower of his manhood had gone to seed seed that perhaps no soil might sprout but there were still cross cuts along where he travelled through which he might yet regain the pathway of usefulness without disturbing the slumbering miracles this man was short and compactly built he had an oblique dead eye like that of a sting ray and the moustache of a cocktail mixer we know the eye and the moustache we know that smith of the luxurious yacht the gorgeous raiment the mysterious mission the magic disappearance has come again though shorn of the accessories of his former state at his third banana the man with the nose glasses spat it from him with a shudder deuce take all fruit he remarked in a patrician tone of disgust i lived for two years where these things grow the memory of their taste lingers with you the oranges are not so bad just see if you can gather a couple of them o day when the next broken crate comes up did you live down with the monkeys asked the other made tepidly garrulous by the sunshine and the alleviating meal of juicy fruit i was down there once myself but only for a few hours that was when i was with the columbia detective agency the monkey people did me up i d have my job yet if it hadn t been for them i ll tell you about it one day the chief sent a note around to the office that read send o day here at once for a big piece of business i was the crack detective of the agency at that time they always handed me the big jobs the address the chief wrote from was down in the wall street district when i got there i found him in a private office with a lot of directors who were looking pretty fuzzy they stated the case the president of the republic insurance company had skipped with about a tenth of a million dollars in cash the directors wanted him back pretty bad but they wanted the money worse they said they needed it they had traced the old gent s movements to where he boarded a tramp fruit steamer bound for south america that same morning with his daughter and a big gripsack all the family he had one of the directors had his steam yacht coaled and with steam up ready for a trip and he turned her over to me cart blongsh in four hours i was on board of her and hot on the trail of the fruit tub i had a pretty good idea where old wahrfield that was his name j churchill wahrfield would head for at that time we had a treaty with about every foreign country except belgium and that banana republic anchuria there wasn t a photo of old wahrfield to be had in new york he had been foxy there but i had his description and besides the lady with him would be a dead give away anywhere she was one of the high flyers in society not the kind that have their pictures in the sunday papers but the real sort that open chrysanthemum shows and christen battleships well sir we never got a sight of that fruit tub on the road the ocean is a pretty big place and i guess we took different paths across it but we kept going toward this anchuria where the fruiter was bound for we struck the monkey coast one afternoon about four there was a ratty looking steamer off shore taking on bananas the monkeys were loading her up with big barges it might be the one the old man had taken and it might not i went ashore to look around the scenery was pretty good i never saw any finer on the new york stage i struck an american on shore a big cool chap standing around with the monkeys he showed me the consul s office the consul was a nice young fellow he said the fruiter was the karlsefin running generally to new orleans but took her last cargo to new york then i was sure my people were on board although everybody told me that no passengers had landed i didn t think they would land until after dark for they might have been shy about it on account of seeing that yacht of mine hanging around so all i had to do was to wait and nab em when they came ashore i couldn t arrest old wahrfield without extradition papers but my play was to get the cash they generally give up if you strike em when they re tired and rattled and short on nerve after dark i sat under a coconut tree on the beach for a while and then i walked around and investigated that town some and it was enough to give you the lions if a man could stay in new york and be honest he d better do it than to hit that monkey town with a million dinky little mud houses grass over your shoe tops in the streets ladies in low neck and short sleeves walking around smoking cigars tree frogs rattling like a hose cart going to a ten blow big mountains dropping gravel in the back yards and the sea licking the paint off in front no sir a man had better be in god s country living on free lunch than there the main street ran along the beach and i walked down it and then turned up a kind of lane where the houses were made of poles and straw i wanted to see what the monkeys did when they weren t climbing coconut trees the very first shack i looked in i saw my people they must have come ashore while i was promenading a man about fifty smooth face heavy eyebrows dressed in black broadcloth looking like he was just about to say can any little boy in the sunday school answer that he was freezing on to a grip that weighed like a dozen gold bricks and a swell girl a regular peach with a fifth avenue cut was sitting on a wooden chair an old black woman was fixing some coffee and beans on a table the light they had come from a lantern hung on a nail i went and stood in the door and they looked at me and i said mr wahrfield you are my prisoner i hope for the lady s sake you will take the matter sensibly you know why i want you who are you says the old gent o day says i of the columbia detective agency and now sir let me give you a piece of good advice you go back and take your medicine like a man hand em back the boodle and maybe they ll let you off light go back easy and i ll put in a word for you i ll give you five minutes to decide i pulled out my watch and waited then the young lady chipped in she was one of the genuine high steppers you could tell by the way her clothes fit and the style she had that fifth avenue was made for her come inside she says don t stand in the door and disturb the whole street with that suit of clothes now what is it you want three minutes gone i said i ll tell you again while the other two tick off you ll admit being the president of the republic won t you i am says he well then says i it ought to be plain to you wanted in new york j churchill wahrfield president of the republic insurance company also the funds belonging to said company now in that grip in the unlawful possession of said j churchill wahrfield oh h h h says the young lady as if she was thinking you want to take us back to new york to take mr wahrfield there s no charge against you miss there ll be no objection of course to your returning with your father of a sudden the girl gave a tiny scream and grabbed the old boy around the neck oh father father she says kind of contralto can this be true have you taken money that is not yours speak father it made you shiver to hear the tremolo stop she put on her voice the old boy looked pretty bughouse when she first grappled him but she went on whispering in his ear and patting his offshoulder till he stood still but sweating a little she got him to one side and they talked together a minute and then he put on some gold eyeglasses and walked up and handed me the grip mr detective he says talking a little broken i conclude to return with you i have finished to discover that life on this desolate and displeased coast would be worse than to die itself i will go back and hurl myself upon the mercy of the republic company have you brought a sheep sheep says i i haven t a single ship cut in the young lady don t get funny father is of german birth and doesn t speak perfect english how did you come up the girl was all broke up she had a handkerchief to her face and kept saying every little bit h father father she walked up to me and laid her lily white hand on the clothes that had pained her at first i smelt a million violets she was a lulu i told her i came in a private yacht mr o day she says oh take us away from this horrid country at once can you will you say you will i ll try i said concealing the fact that i was dying to get them on salt water before they could change their mind one thing they both kicked against was going through the town to the boat landing said they dreaded publicity and now that they were going to return they had a hope that the thing might yet be kept out of the papers they swore they wouldn t go unless i got them out to the yacht without any one knowing it so i agreed to humor them the sailors who rowed me ashore were playing billiards in a bar room near the water waiting for orders and i proposed to have them take the boat down the beach half a mile or so and take us up there how to get them word was the question for i couldn t leave the grip with the prisoner and i couldn t take it with me not knowing but what the monkeys might stick me up the young lady says the old colored woman would take them a note i sat down and wrote it and gave it to the dame with plain directions what to do and she grins like a baboon and shakes her head then mr wahrfield handed her a string of foreign dialect and she nods her head and says see senor maybe fifty times and lights out with the note ld augusta only understands german said miss wahrfield smiling at me we stopped in her house to ask where we could find lodging and she insisted upon our having coffee she tells us she was raised in a german family in san domingo very likely i said but you can search me for german words except nix verstay and noch einst i would have called that see senor french though on a gamble well we three made a sneak around the edge of town so as not to be seen we got tangled in vines and ferns and the banana bushes and tropical scenery a good deal the monkey suburbs was as wild as places in central park we came out on the beach a good half mile below a brown chap was lying asleep under a coconut tree with a ten foot musket beside him mr wahrfield takes up the gun and pitches it into the sea the coast is guarded he says rebellion and plots ripen like fruit he pointed to the sleeping man who never stirred thus he says they perform trusts children i saw our boat coming and i struck a match and lit a piece of newspaper to show them where we were in thirty minutes we were on board the yacht the first thing mr wahrfield and his daughter and i took the grip into the owner s cabin opened it up and took an inventory there was one hundred and five thousand dollars united states treasury notes in it besides a lot of diamond jewelry and a couple of hundred havana cigars i gave the old man the cigars and a receipt for the rest of the lot as agent for the company and locked the stuff up in my private quarters i never had a pleasanter trip than that one after we got to sea the young lady turned out to be the jolliest ever the very first time we sat down to dinner and the steward filled her glass with champagne that director s yacht was a regular floating waldorf astoria she winks at me and says what s the use to borrow trouble mr fly cop here s hoping you may live to eat the hen that scratches on your grave there was a piano on board and she sat down to it and sung better than you give up two cases to hear plenty times she knew about nine operas clean through she was sure enough bon ton and swell she wasn t one of the among others present kind she belonged on the special mention list the old man too perked up amazingly on the way he passed the cigars and says to me once quite chipper out of a cloud of smoke mr o day somehow i think the republic company will not give me the much trouble guard well the gripvalise of the money mr o day for that it must be returned to them that it belongs when we finish to arrive when we landed in new york i phoned to the chief to meet us in that director s office we got in a cab and went there i carried the grip and we walked in and i was pleased to see that the chief had got together that same old crowd of moneybugs with pink faces and white vests to see us march in i set the grip on the table there s the money i said and your prisoner said the chief i pointed to mr wahrfield and he stepped forward and says the honor of a word with you sir to explain he and the chief went into another room and stayed ten minutes when they came back the chief looked as black as a ton of coal did this gentleman he says to me have this valise in his possession when you first saw him he did said i the chief took up the grip and handed it to the prisoner with a bow and says to the director crowd do any of you recognize this gentleman they all shook their pink faces allow me to present he goes on senor miraflores president of the republic of anchuria the senor has generously consented to overlook this outrageous blunder on condition that we undertake to secure him against the annoyance of public comment it is a concession on his part to overlook an insult for which he might claim international redress i think we can gratefully promise him secrecy in the matter they gave him a pink nod all round o day he says to me as a private detective you re wasted in a war where kidnapping governments is in the rules you d be invaluable come down to the office at eleven i knew what that meant so that s the president of the monkeys says i well why couldn t he have said so wouldn t it jar you xviii the vitagraphoscope vaudeville is intrinsically episodic and discontinuous its audiences do not demand denouements sufficient unto each turn is the evil thereof no one cares how many romances the singing comedienne may have had if she can capably sustain the limelight and a high note or two the audiences reck not if the performing dogs get to the pound the moment they have jumped through their last hoop they do not desire bulletins about the possible injuries received by the comic cyclist who retires head first from the stage in a crash of

appearance sits in a dejected attitude amid a litter of sketches with his head resting upon his hand an oil stove stands on a pine box in the center of the studio the artist rises tightens his waist belt to another hole and lights the stove he goes to a tin bread box half hidden by a screen takes out a solitary link of sausage turns the box upside down to show that there is no more and chucks the sausage into a frying pan which he sets upon the stove the flame of the stove goes out showing that there is no more oil the artist in evident despair seizes the sausage in a sudden access of rage and hurls it violently from him at the same time a door opens and a man who enters receives the sausage forcibly against his nose he seems to cry out and is observed to make a dance step or two vigorously the newcomer is a ruddy faced active keen looking man apparently of irish ancestry next he is observed to laugh immoderately he kicks over the stove he claps the artist who is vainly striving to grasp his hand vehemently upon the back then he goes through a pantomime which to the sufficiently intelligent spectator reveals that he has acquired large sums of money by trading pot metal hatchets and razors to the indians of the cordillera mountains for gold dust he draws a roll of money as large as a small loaf of bread from his pocket and waves it above his head while at the same time he makes pantomime of drinking from a glass the artist hurriedly secures his hat and the two leave the studio together the writing on the sands scene the beach at nice a woman beautiful still young exquisitely

was four dollars between us and tobin had need of distractions for there was katie mahorner his sweetheart of county sligo lost since she started for america three months before with two hundred dollars her own savings and one hundred dollars from the sale of tobin s inherited estate a fine cottage and pig on the bog shannaugh and since the letter that tobin got saying that she had started to come to him not a bit of news had he heard or seen of katie mahorner tobin advertised in the papers but nothing could be found of the colleen so to coney me and tobin went thinking that a turn at the chutes and the smell of the popcorn might raise the heart in his bosom but tobin was a hardheaded man and the sadness stuck in his skin he ground his teeth at the crying balloons he cursed the moving pictures and though he would drink whenever asked he scorned punch and judy and was for licking the tintype men as they came so i gets him down a side way on a board walk where the attractions were some less violent at a little six by eight stall tobin halts with a more human look in his eye tis here says he i will be diverted i ll have the palm of me hand investigated by the wonderful palmist of the nile and see if what is to be will be tobin was a believer in signs and the unnatural in nature he possessed illegal convictions in his mind along the subjects of black cats lucky numbers and the weather predictions in the papers we went into the enchanted chicken coop which was fixed mysterious with red cloth and pictures of hands with lines crossing em like a railroad centre the sign over the door says it is madame zozo the egyptian palmist there was a fat woman inside in a red jumper with pothooks and beasties embroidered upon it tobin gives her ten cents and extends one of his hands she lifts tohin s hand which is own brother to the hoof of a drayhorse and examines it to see whether tis a stone in the frog or a cast shoe he has come for man says this madame zozo the line of your fate shows tis not me foot at all says tobin interrupting sure tis no beauty but ye hold the palm of me hand the line shows says the madame that ye ve not arrived at your time of life without bad luck and there s more to come the mound of venus or is that a stone bruise shows that ye ve been in love there s been trouble in your life on account of your sweetheart tis katie mahorner she has references with whispers tobin to me in a loud voice to one side i see says the palmist a great deal of sorrow and tribulation with one whom ye cannot forget i see the lines of designation point to the letter k and the letter m in her name whist says tobin to me do ye hear that look out goes on the palmist for a dark man and a light woman for they ll both bring ye trouble ye ll make a voyage upon the water very soon and have a financial loss i see one line that brings good luck there s a man coming into your life who will fetch ye good fortune ye ll know him when ye see him by his crooked nose is his name set down asks tobin twill be convenient in the way of greeting when he backs up to dump off the good luck his name says the palmist thoughtful looking is not spelled out by the lines but they indicate tis a long one and the letter o should be in it there s no more to tell good evening don t block up the door tis wonderful how she knows says tobin as we walk to the pier as we squeezed through the gates a nigger man sticks his lighted segar against tobin s ear and there is trouble tobin hammers his neck and the women squeal and by presence of mind i drag the little man out of the way before the police comes tobin is always in an ugly mood when enjoying himself on the boat going back when the man calls who wants the good looking waiter tobin tried to plead guilty feeling the desire to blow the foam off a crock of suds but when he felt in his pocket he found himself discharged for lack of evidence somebody had disturbed his change during the commotion so we sat dry upon the stools listening to the dagoes fiddling on deck if anything tobin was lower in spirits and less congenial with his misfortunes than when we started on a seat against the railing was a young woman dressed suitable for red automobiles with hair the colour of an unsmoked meerschaum in passing by tobin kicks her foot without intentions and being polite to ladies when in drink he tries to give his hat a twist while apologising but he knocks it off and the wind carries it overboard tobin came back and sat down and i began to look out for him for the man s adversities were becoming frequent he was apt when pushed so close by hard luck to kick the best dressed man he could see and try to take command of the boat presently tobin grabs my arm and says excited jawn says he do ye know what we re doing we re taking a voyage upon the water there now says i subdue yeself the boat l land in ten minutes more look says he at the light lady upon the bench and have ye forgotten the nigger man that burned me ear and isn t the money i had gone a dollar sixty five it was i thought he was no more than summing up his catastrophes so as to get violent with good excuse as men will do and i tried to make him understand such things was trifles listen says tobin ye ve no ear for the gift of prophecy or the miracles of the inspired what did the palmist lady tell ye out of me hand tis coming true before your eyes look out says she for a dark man and a light woman they ll bring ye trouble have ye forgot the nigger man though be got some of it back from me fist can ye show me a lighter woman than the blonde lady that was the cause of me hat falling in the water and where s the dollar sixty five i had in me vest when we left the shooting gallery the way tobin put it it did seem to corroborate the art of prediction though it looked to me that these accidents could happen to any one at coney without the implication of palmistry tobin got up and walked around on deck looking close at the passengers out of his little red eyes i asked him the interpretation of his movements ye never know what tobin has in his mind until he begins to carry it out ye should know says he i m working out the salvation promised by the lines in me palm i m looking for the crooked nose man that s to bring the good luck tis all that will save us jawn did ye ever see a straighter nosed gang of hellions in the days of your life twas the nine thirty boat and we landed and walked up town through twenty second street tobin being without his hat on a street corner standing under a gas light and looking over the elevated road at the moon was a man a long man he was dressed decent with a segar between his teeth and i saw that his nose made two twists from bridge to end like the wriggle of a snake tobin saw it at the same time and i heard him breathe hard like a horse when you take the saddle off he went straight up to the man and i went with him good night to ye tobin says to the man the man takes out his segar and passes the compliments sociable would ye hand us your name asks tobin and let us look at the size of it it may be our duty to become acquainted with ye my name says the man polite is friedenhausman maximus g friedenhausman tis the right length says tobin do you spell it with an o anywhere down the stretch of it i do not says the man can ye spell it with an o inquires tobin turning anxious if your conscience says the man with the nose is indisposed toward foreign idioms ye might to please yourself smuggle the letter into the penultimate syllable tis well says tobin ye re in the presence of jawn malone and daniel tobin tis highly appreciated says the man with a bow and now since i cannot conceive that ye would hold a spelling bee upon the street corner will ye name some reasonable excuse for being at large by the two signs answers tobin trying to explain which ye display according to the reading of the egyptian palmist from the sole of me hand ye ve been nominated to offset with good luck the lines of trouble leading to the nigger man and the blonde lady with her feet crossed in the boat besides the financial loss of a dollar sixty five all so far fulfilled according to hoyle the man stopped smoking and looked at me have ye any amendments he asks to offer to that statement or are ye one too i thought by the looks of ye ye might have him in charge none says i to him except that as one horseshoe resembles another so are ye the picture of good luck as predicted by the hand of me friend if not then the lines of danny s hand may have been crossed i don t know there s two of ye says the man with the nose looking up and down for the sight of a policeman i ve enjoyed your company immense good night with that he shoves his segar in his mouth and moves across the street stepping fast but tobin sticks close to one side of him and me at the other what says he stopping on the opposite sidewalk and pushing back his hat do ye follow me i tell ye he says very loud i m proud to have met ye but it is my desire to be rid of ye i am off to me home do says tobin leaning against his sleeve do be off to your home and i will sit at the door of it till ye come out in the morning for the dependence is upon ye to obviate the curse of the nigger man and the blonde lady and the financial loss of the one sixty five tis a strange hallucination says the man turning to me as a more reasonable lunatic hadn t ye better get him home listen man says i to him daniel tobin is as sensible as he ever was maybe he is a bit deranged on account of having drink enough to disturb but not enough to settle his wits but he is no more than following out the legitimate path of his superstitions and predicaments which i will explain to you with that i relates the facts about the palmist lady and how the finger of suspicion points to him as an instrument of good fortune now understand i concludes my position in this riot i am the friend of me friend tobin according to me interpretations tis easy to be a friend to the prosperous for it pays tis not hard to be a friend to the poor for ye get puffed up by gratitude and have your picture printed standing in front of a tenement with a scuttle of coal and an orphan in each hand but it strains the art of friendship to be true friend to a born fool and that s what i m doing says i for in my opinion there s no fortune to be read from the palm of me hand that wasn t printed there with the handle of a pick and though ye ve got the crookedest nose in new york city i misdoubt that all the fortune tellers doing business could milk good luck from ye but the lines of danny s hand pointed to ye fair and i ll assist him to experiment with ye until he s convinced ye re dry after that the man turns sudden to laughing he leans against a corner and laughs considerable then he claps me and tobin on the backs of us and takes us by an arm apiece tis my mistake says he how could i be expecting anything so fine and wonderful to be turning the corner upon me i came near being found unworthy hard by says he is a cafe snug and suitable for the entertainment of idiosyncrasies let us go there and have drink while we discuss the unavailability of the categorical so saying he marched me and tobin to the back room of a saloon and ordered the drinks and laid the money on the table he looks at me and tobin like brothers of his and we have the segars ye must know says the man of destiny that me walk in life is one that is called the literary i wander abroad be night seeking idiosyncrasies in the masses and truth in the heavens above when ye came upon me i was in contemplation of the elevated road in conjunction with the chief luminary of night the rapid transit is poetry and art the moon but a tedious dry body moving by rote but these are private opinions for in the business of literature the conditions are reversed tis me hope to be writing a book to explain the strange things i have discovered in life ye will put me in a book says tobin disgusted will ye put me in a book i will not says the man for the covers will not hold ye not yet the best i can do is to enjoy ye meself for the time is not ripe for destroying the limitations of print ye would look fantastic in type all alone by meself must i drink this cup of joy but i thank ye boys i am truly grateful the talk of ye says tobin blowing through his moustache and pounding the table with his fist is an eyesore to me patience there was good luck promised out of the crook of your nose but ye bear fruit like the bang of a drum ye resemble with your noise of books the wind blowing through a crack sure now i would be thinking the palm of me hand lied but for the coming true of the nigger man and the blonde lady and whist says the long man would ye be led astray by physiognomy me nose will do what it can within bounds let us have these glasses filled again for tis good to keep idiosyncrasies well moistened they being subject to deterioration in a dry moral atmosphere so the man of literature makes good to my notion for he pays cheerful for everything the capital of me and tobin being exhausted by prediction but tobin is sore and drinks quiet with the red showing in his eye by and by we moved out for twas eleven o clock and stands a bit upon the sidewalk and then the man says he must be going home and invites me and tobin to walk that way we arrives on a side street two blocks away where there is a stretch of brick houses with high stoops and iron fences the man stops at one of them and looks up at the top windows which he finds dark tis me humble dwelling says he and i begin to perceive by the signs that me wife has retired to slumber therefore i will venture a bit in the way of hospitality tis me wish that ye enter the basement room where we dine and partake of a reasonable refreshment there will be some fine cold fowl and cheese and a bottle or two of ale ye will be welcome to enter and eat for i am indebted to ye for diversions the appetite and conscience of me and tobin was congenial to the proposition though twas sticking hard in danny s superstitions to think that a few drinks and a cold lunch should represent the good fortune promised by the palm of his hand step down the steps says the man with the crooked nose and i will enter by the door above and let ye in i will ask the new girl we have in the kitchen says he to make ye a pot of coffee to drink before ye go tis fine coffee katie mahorner makes for a green girl just landed three months step in says the man and i ll send her down to ye the gift of the magi one dollar and eighty seven cents that was all and sixty cents of it was in pennies pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied three times della counted it one dollar and eighty seven cents and the next day would be christmas there was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl so della did it which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs sniffles and smiles with sniffles predominating while the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second take a look at the home a furnished flat at per week it did not exactly beggar description but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad in the vestibule below was a letter box into which no letter would go and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name mr james dillingham young the dillingham had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid per week now when the income was shrunk to the letters of dillingham looked blurred as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming d but whenever mr james dillingham young came home and reached his flat above he was called jim and greatly hugged by mrs james dillingham young already introduced to you as della which is all very good della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag she stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard tomorrow would be christmas day and she had only with which to buy jim a present she had been saving every penny she could for months with this result twenty dollars a week doesn t go far expenses had been greater than she had calculated they always are only to buy a present for jim her jim many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him something fine and rare and sterling something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by jim there was a pier glass between the windows of the room perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an flat a very thin and very agile person may by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks della being slender had mastered the art suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass her eyes were shining brilliantly but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length now there were two possessions of the james dillingham youngs in which they both took a mighty pride one was jim s gold watch that had been his father s and his grandfather s the other was della s hair had the queen of sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate her majesty s jewels and gifts had king solomon been the janitor with all his treasures piled up in the basement jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed just to see him pluck at his beard from envy so now della s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters it reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her and then she did it up again nervously and quickly once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet on went her old brown jacket on went her old brown hat with a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street where she stopped the sign read mme sofronie hair goods of all kinds one flight up della ran and collected herself panting madame large too white chilly hardly looked the sofronie will you buy my hair asked della i buy hair said madame take yer hat off and let s have a sight at the looks of it down rippled the brown cascade twenty dollars said madame lifting the mass with a practised hand give it to me quick said della oh and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings forget the hashed metaphor she was ransacking the stores for jim s present she found it at last it surely had been made for jim and no one else there was no other like it in any of the stores and she had turned all of them inside out it was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation as all good things should do it was even worthy of the watch as soon as she saw it she that it must be jim s it was like him quietness and value the description applied to both twenty one dollars they took from her for it and she hurried home with the cents with that chain on his watch jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company grand as the watch was he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain when della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason she got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love which is always a tremendous task dear friends a mammoth task within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny close lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy she looked at her reflection in the mirror long carefully and critically if jim doesn t kill me she said to herself before he takes a second look at me he ll say i look like a coney island chorus girl but what could i do oh what could i do with a dollar and eighty seven cents at o clock the coffee was made and the frying pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops jim was never late della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight and she turned white for just a moment she had a habit for saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things and now she whispered please god make him think i am still pretty the door opened and jim stepped in and closed it he looked thin and very serious poor fellow he was only twenty two and to be burdened with a family he needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves jim stopped inside the door as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail his eyes were fixed upon della and there was an expression in them that she could not read and it terrified her it was not anger nor surprise nor disapproval nor horror nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for he simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face della wriggled off the table and went for him jim darling she cried don t look at me that way i had my hair cut off and sold because i couldn t have lived through christmas without giving you a present it ll grow out again you won t mind will you i just had to do it my hair grows awfully fast say merry christmas jim and let s be happy you don t know what a nice what a beautiful nice gift i ve got for you you ve cut off your hair asked jim laboriously as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor cut it off and sold it said della don t you like me just as well anyhow i m me without my hair ain t i jim looked about the room curiously you say your hair is gone he said with an air almost of idiocy you needn t look for it said della it s sold i tell you sold and gone too it s christmas eve boy be good to me for it went for you maybe the hairs of my head were numbered she went on with sudden serious sweetness but nobody could ever count my love for you shall i put the chops on jim out of his trance jim seemed quickly to wake he enfolded his della for ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction eight dollars a week or a million a year what is the difference a mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer the magi brought valuable gifts but that was not among them this dark assertion will be illuminated later on jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table don t make any mistake dell he said about me i don t think there s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less but if you ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first white fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper and then an ecstatic scream of joy and then alas a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat for there lay the combs the set of combs side and back that della had worshipped long in a broadway window beautiful combs pure tortoise shell with jewelled rims just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair they were expensive combs she knew and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession and now they were hers but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone but she hugged them to her bosom and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say my hair grows so fast jim and them della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried oh oh jim had not yet seen his beautiful present she held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm the dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit isn t it a dandy jim i hunted all over town to find it you ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now give me your watch i want to see how it looks on it instead of obeying jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled dell said he let s put our christmas presents away and keep em a while they re too nice to use just at present i sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs and now suppose you put the chops on the magi as you know were wise men wonderfully wise men who brought gifts to the babe in the manger they invented the art of giving christmas presents being wise their gifts were no doubt wise ones possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication and here i have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house but in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest of all who give and receive gifts such as they are wisest everywhere they are wisest they are the magi a cosmopolite in a cafe at midnight the cafe was crowded by some chance the little table at which i sat had escaped the eye of incomers and two vacant chairs at it extended their arms with venal hospitality to the influx of patrons and then a cosmopolite sat in one of them and i was glad for i held a theory that since adam no true citizen of the world has existed we hear of them and we see foreign labels on much luggage but we find travellers instead of cosmopolites i invoke your consideration of the scene the marble topped tables the range of leather upholstered wall seats the gay company the ladies dressed in demi state toilets speaking in an exquisite visible chorus of taste economy opulence or art the sedulous and largess loving garcons the music wisely catering to all with its raids upon the composers the melange of talk and laughter and if you will the wurzburger in the tall glass cones that bend to your lips as a ripe cherry sways on its branch to the beak of a robber jay i was told by a sculptor from mauch chunk that the scene was truly parisian my cosmopolite was named e rushmore coglan and he will be heard from next summer at coney island he is to establish a new attraction there he informed me offering kingly diversion and then his conversation rang along parallels of latitude and longitude he took the great round world in his hand so to speak familiarly contemptuously and it seemed no larger than the seed of a maraschino cherry in a table d hote grape fruit he spoke disrespectfully of the equator he skipped from continent to continent he derided the zones he mopped up the high seas with his napkin with a wave of his hand he would speak of a certain bazaar in hyderabad whiff he would have you on skis in lapland zip now you rode the breakers with the kanakas at kealaikahiki presto he dragged you through an arkansas post oak swamp let you dry for a moment on the alkali plains of his idaho ranch then whirled you into the society of viennese archdukes anon he would be telling you of a cold he acquired in a chicago lake breeze and how old escamila cured it in buenos ayres with a hot infusion of the chuchula weed you would have addressed a letter to e rushmore coglan esq the earth solar system the universe and have mailed it feeling confident that it would be delivered to him i was sure that i had found at last the one true cosmopolite since adam and i listened to his worldwide discourse fearful lest i should discover in it the local note of the mere globe trotter but his opinions never fluttered or drooped he was as impartial to cities countries and continents as the winds or gravitation and as e rushmore coglan prattled of this little planet i thought with glee of a great almost cosmopolite who wrote for the whole world and dedicated himself to bombay in a poem he has to say that there is pride and rivalry between the cities of the earth and that the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their cities hem as a child to the mother s gown and whenever they walk by roaring streets unknown they remember their native city most faithful foolish fond making her mere breathed name their bond upon their bond and my glee was roused because i had caught mr kipling napping here i had found a man not made from dust one who had no narrow boasts of birthplace or country one who if he bragged at all would brag of his whole round globe against the martians and the inhabitants of the moon expression on these subjects was precipitated from e rushmore coglan by the third corner to our table while coglan was describing to me the topography along the siberian railway the orchestra glided into a medley the concluding air was dixie and as the exhilarating notes tumbled forth they were almost overpowered by a great clapping of hands from almost every table it is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be witnessed every evening in numerous cafes in the city of new york tons of brew have been consumed over theories to account for it some have conjectured hastily that all southerners in town hie themselves to cafes at nightfall this applause of the rebel air in a northern city does puzzle a little but it is not insolvable the war with spain many years generous mint and watermelon crops a few long shot winners at the new orleans race track and the brilliant banquets given by the indiana and kansas citizens who compose the north carolina society have made the south rather a fad in manhattan your manicure will lisp softly that your left forefinger reminds her so much of a gentleman s in richmond va oh certainly but many a lady has to work now the war you know when dixie was being played a dark haired young man sprang up from somewhere with a mosby guerrilla yell and waved frantically his soft brimmed hat then he strayed through the smoke dropped into the vacant chair at our table and pulled out cigarettes the evening was at the period when reserve is thawed one of us mentioned three wurzburgers to the waiter the dark haired young man acknowledged his inclusion in the order by a smile and a nod i hastened to ask him a question because i wanted to try out a theory i had would you mind telling me i began whether you are from the fist of e rushmore coglan banged the table and i was jarred into silence excuse me said he but that s a question i never like to hear asked what does it matter where a man is from is it fair to judge a man by his post office address why i ve seen kentuckians who hated whiskey virginians who weren t descended from pocahontas indianians who hadn t written a novel mexicans who didn t wear velvet trousers with silver dollars sewed along the seams funny englishmen spendthrift yankees cold blooded southerners narrow minded westerners and new yorkers who were too busy to stop for an hour on the street to watch a one armed grocer s clerk do up cranberries in paper bags let a man be a man and don t handicap him with the label of any section pardon me i said but my curiosity was not altogether an idle one i know the south and when the band plays dixie i like to observe i have formed the belief that the man who applauds that air with special violence and ostensible sectional loyalty is invariably a native of either secaucus n j or the district between murray hill lyceum and the harlem river this city i was about to put my opinion to the test by inquiring of this gentleman when you interrupted with your own larger theory i must confess and now the dark haired young man spoke to me and it became evident that his mind also moved along its own set of grooves i should like to be a periwinkle said he mysteriously on the top of a valley and sing tooralloo ralloo this was clearly too obscure so i turned again to coglan i ve been around the world twelve times said he i know an esquimau in upernavik who sends to cincinnati for his neckties and i saw a goatherder in uruguay who won a prize in a battle creek breakfast food puzzle competition i pay rent on a room in cairo egypt and another in yokohama all the year around i ve got slippers waiting for me in a tea house in shanghai and i don t have to tell em how to cook my eggs in rio de janeiro or seattle it s a mighty little old world what s the use of bragging about being from the north or the south or the old manor house in the dale or euclid avenue cleveland or pike s peak or fairfax county va or hooligan s flats or any place it ll be a better world when we quit being fools about some mildewed town or ten acres of swampland just because we happened to be born there you seem to be a genuine cosmopolite i said admiringly but it also seems that you would decry patriotism a relic of the stone age declared coglan warmly we are all brothers chinamen englishmen zulus patagonians and the people in the bend of the kaw river some day all this petty pride in one s city or state or section or country will be wiped out and we ll all be citizens of the world as we ought to be but while you are wandering in foreign lands i persisted do not your thoughts revert to some spo some dear and nary a spot interrupted e r coglan flippantly the terrestrial globular planetary hunk of matter slightly flattened at the poles and known as the earth is my abode i ve met a good many object bound citizens of this country abroad i ve seen men from chicago sit in a gondola in venice on a moonlight night and brag about their drainage canal i ve seen a southerner on being introduced to the king of england hand that monarch without batting his eyes the information that his grandaunt on his mother s side was related by marriage to the perkinses of charleston i knew a new yorker who was kidnapped for ransom by some afghanistan bandits his people sent over the money and he came back to kabul with the agent afghanistan the natives said to him through an interpreter well not so slow do you think oh i don t know says he and he begins to tell them about a cab driver at sixth avenue and broadway those ideas don t suit me i m not tied down to anything that isn t miles in diameter just put me down as e rushmore coglan citizen of the terrestrial sphere my cosmopolite made a large adieu and left me for he thought he saw some one through the chatter and smoke whom he knew so i was left with the would be periwinkle who was reduced to wurzburger without further ability to voice his aspirations to perch melodious upon the summit of a valley i sat reflecting upon my evident cosmopolite and wondering how the poet had managed to miss him he was my discovery and i believed in him how was it the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their cities hem as a child to the mother s gown not so e rushmore coglan with the whole world for his my meditations were interrupted by a tremendous noise and conflict in another part of the cafe i saw above the heads of the seated patrons e rushmore coglan and a stranger to me engaged in terrific battle they fought between the tables like titans and glasses crashed and men caught their hats up and were knocked down and a brunette screamed and a blonde began to sing teasing my cosmopolite was sustaining the pride and reputation of the earth when the waiters closed in on both combatants with their famous flying wedge formation and bore them outside still resisting i called mccarthy one of the french garcons and asked him the cause of the conflict the man with the red tie that was my cosmopolite said he got hot on account of things said about the bum sidewalks and water supply of the place he come from by the other guy why said i bewildered that man is a citizen of the world a cosmopolite he originally from mattawamkeag maine he said continued mccarthy and he wouldn t stand for no knockin the place between rounds the may moon shone bright upon the private boarding house of mrs murphy by reference to the almanac a large amount of territory will be discovered upon which its rays also fell spring was in its heydey with hay fever soon to follow the parks were green with new leaves and buyers for the western and southern trade flowers and summer resort agents were blowing the air and answers to lawson were growing milder handorgans fountains and pinochle were playing everywhere the windows of mrs murphy s boarding house were open a group of boarders were seated on the high stoop upon round flat mats like german pancakes in one of the second floor front windows mrs mccaskey awaited her husband supper was cooling on the table its heat went into mrs mccaskey at nine mr mccaskey came he carried his coat on his arm and his pipe in his teeth and he apologised for disturbing the boarders on the steps as he selected spots of stone between them on which to set his size width ds as he opened the door of his room he received a surprise instead of the usual stove lid or potato masher for him to dodge came only words mr mccaskey reckoned that the benign may moon had softened the breast of his spouse i heard ye came the oral substitutes for kitchenware ye can apollygise to riff raff of the streets for settin yer unhandy feet on the tails of their frocks but ye d walk on the neck of yer wife the length of a clothes line without so much as a kiss me fut and i m sure it s that long from rubberin out the windy for ye and the victuals cold such as there s money to buy after drinkin up yer wages at gallegher s every saturday evenin and the gas man here twice to day for his woman said mr mccaskey dashing his coat and hat upon a chair the noise of ye is an insult to me appetite when ye run down politeness ye take the mortar from between the bricks of the foundations of society tis no more than exercisin the acrimony of a gentleman when ye ask the dissent of ladies blockin the way for steppin between them will ye bring the pig s face of ye out of the windy and see to the food mrs mccaskey arose heavily and went to the stove there was something in her manner that warned mr mccaskey when the corners of her mouth went down suddenly like a barometer it usually foretold a fall of crockery and tinware pig s face is it said mrs mecaskey and hurled a stewpan full of bacon and turnips at her lord mr mccaskey was no novice at repartee he knew what should follow the entree on the table was a roast sirloin of pork garnished with shamrocks he retorted with this and drew the appropriate return of a bread pudding in an earthen dish a hunk of swiss cheese accurately thrown by her husband struck mrs mccaskey below one eye when she replied with a well aimed coffee pot full of a hot black semi fragrant liquid the battle according to courses should have ended but mr mccaskey was no cent table d hoter let cheap bohemians consider coffee the end if they would let them make that faux pas he was foxier still finger bowls were not beyond the compass of his experience they were not to be had in the pension murphy but their equivalent was at hand triumphantly he sent the granite ware wash basin at the head of his matrimonial adversary mrs mccaskey dodged in time she reached for a flatiron with which as a sort of cordial she hoped to bring the gastronomical duel to a close but a loud wailing scream downstairs caused both her and mr mccaskey to pause in a sort of involuntary armistice on the sidewalk at the corner of the house policeman cleary was standing with one ear upturned listening to the crash of household utensils tis jawn mccaskey and his missis at it again meditated the policeman i wonder shall i go up and stop the row i will not married folks they are and few pleasures they have twill not last long sure they ll have to borrow more dishes to keep it up with and just then came the loud scream below stairs betokening fear or dire extremity tis probably the cat said policeman cleary and walked hastily in the other direction the boarders on the steps were fluttered mr toomey an insurance solicitor by birth and an investigator by profession went inside to analyse the scream he returned with the news that mrs murphy s little boy mike was lost following the messenger out bounced mrs murphy two hundred pounds in tears and hysterics clutching the air and howling to the sky for the loss of thirty pounds of freckles and mischief bathos truly but mr toomey sat down at the side of miss purdy millinery and their hands came together in sympathy the two old maids misses walsh who complained every day about the noise in the halls inquired immediately if anybody had looked behind the clock major grigg who sat by his fat wife on the top step arose and buttoned his coat the little one lost he exclaimed i will scour the city his wife never allowed him out after dark but now she said go ludovic in a baritone voice whoever can look upon that mother s grief without springing to her relief has a heart of stone give me some thirty or sixty cents my love said the major lost children sometimes stray far i may need carfares old man denny hall room fourth floor back who sat on the lowest step trying to read a paper by the street lamp turned over a page to follow up the article about the carpenters strike mrs murphy shrieked to the moon oh ar r mike f r gawd s sake where is me little bit av a boy when d ye see him last asked old man denny with one eye on the report of the building trades league oh wailed mrs murphy twas yisterday or maybe four hours ago i dunno but it s lost he is me little boy mike he was playin on the sidewalk only this mornin or was it wednesday i m that busy with work tis hard to keep up with dates but i ve looked the house over from top to cellar and it s gone he is oh for the love av hiven silent grim colossal the big city has ever stood against its revilers they call it hard as iron they say that no pulse of pity beats in its bosom they compare its streets with lonely forests and deserts of lava but beneath the hard crust of the lobster is found a delectable and luscious food perhaps a different simile would have been wiser still nobody should take offence we would call no one a lobster without good and sufficient claws no calamity so touches the common heart of humanity as does the straying of a little child their feet are so uncertain and feeble the ways are so steep and strange major griggs hurried down to the corner and up the avenue into billy s place gimme a rye high he said to the servitor haven t seen a bow legged dirty faced little devil of a six year old loot kid around here anywhere have you mr toomey retained miss purdy s hand on the steps think of that dear little babe said miss purdy lost from his mother s side perhaps already fallen beneath the iron hoofs of galloping steeds oh isn t it dreadful ain t that right agreed mr toomey squeezing her hand say i start out and help look for um perhaps said miss purdy you should but oh mr toomey you are so dashing so reckless suppose in your enthusiasm some accident should befall you then what old man denny read on about the arbitration agreement with one finger on the lines in the second floor front mr and mrs mccaskey came to the window to recover their second wind mr mccaskey was scooping turnips out of his vest with a crooked forefinger and his lady was wiping an eye that the salt of the roast pork had not benefited they heard the outcry below and thrust their heads out of the window tis little mike is lost said mrs mccaskey in a hushed voice the beautiful little trouble making angel of a gossoon the bit of a boy mislaid said mr mccaskey leaning out of the window why now that s bad enough entirely the childer they be different if twas a woman i d be willin for they leave peace behind em when they go disregarding the thrust mrs mccaskey caught her husband s arm jawn she said sentimentally missis murphy s little bye is lost tis a great city for losing little boys six years old he was jawn tis the same age our little bye would have been if we had had one six years ago we never did said mr mccaskey lingering with the fact but if we had jawn think what sorrow would be in our hearts this night with our little phelan run away and stolen in the city nowheres at all ye talk foolishness said mr mccaskey tis pat he would be named after me old father in cantrim ye lie said mrs mccaskey without anger me brother was worth tin dozen bog trotting mccaskeys after him would the bye be named she leaned over the window sill and looked down at the hurrying and bustle below jawn said mrs mccaskey softly i m sorry i was hasty wid ye twas hasty puddin as ye say said her husband and hurry up turnips and get a move on ye coffee twas what ye could call a quick lunch all right and tell no lie mrs mccaskey slipped her arm inside her husband s and took his rough hand in hers listen at the cryin of poor mrs murphy she said tis an awful thing for a bit of a bye to be lost in this great big city if twas our little phelan jawn i d be breakin me heart awkwardly mr mccaskey withdrew his hand but he laid it around the nearing shoulders of his wife tis foolishness of course said he roughly but i d be cut up some meself if our little pat was kidnapped or anything but there never was any childer for us sometimes i ve been ugly and hard with ye judy forget it they leaned together and looked down at the heart drama being acted below long they sat thus people surged along the sidewalk crowding questioning filling the air with rumours and inconsequent surmises mrs murphy ploughed back and forth in their midst like a soft mountain down which plunged an audible cataract of tears couriers came and went loud voices and a renewed uproar were raised in front of the boarding house what s up now judy asked mr mccaskey tis missis murphy s voice said mrs mccaskey harking she says she s after finding little mike asleep behind the roll of old linoleum under the bed in her room mr mccaskey laughed loudly that s yer phelan he shouted sardonically divil a bit would a pat have done that trick if the bye we never had is strayed and stole by the powers call him phelan and see him hide out under the bed like a mangy pup mrs mccaskey arose heavily and went toward the dish closet with the corners of her mouth drawn down policeman cleary came back around the corner as the crowd dispersed surprised he upturned an ear toward the mccaskey apartment where the crash of irons and chinaware and the ring of hurled kitchen utensils seemed as loud as before policeman cleary took out his timepiece by the deported snakes he exclaimed jawn mccaskey and his lady have been fightin for an hour and a quarter by the watch the missis could give him forty pounds weight strength to his arm policeman cleary strolled back around the corner old man denny folded his paper and hurried up the steps just as mrs murphy was about to lock the door for the night the skylight room first mrs parker would show you the double parlours you would not dare to interrupt her description of their advantages and of the merits of the gentleman who had occupied them for eight years then you would manage to stammer forth the confession that you were neither a doctor nor a dentist mrs parker s manner of receiving the admission was such that you could never afterward entertain the same feeling toward your parents who had neglected to train you up in one of the professions that fitted mrs parker s parlours next you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the second floor back at convinced by her second floor manner that it was worth the that mr toosenberry always paid for it until he left to take charge of his brother s orange plantation in florida near palm beach where mrs mcintyre always spent the winters that had the double front room with private bath you managed to babble that you wanted something still cheaper if you survived mrs parker s scorn you were taken to look at mr skidder s large hall room on the third floor mr skidder s room was not vacant he wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long but every room hunter was made to visit his room to admire the lambrequins after each visit mr skidder from the fright caused by possible eviction would pay something on his rent then oh then if you still stood on one foot with your hot hand clutching the three moist dollars in your pocket and hoarsely proclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty nevermore would mrs parker be cicerone of yours she would honk loudly the word clara she would show you her back and march downstairs then clara the coloured maid would escort you up the carpeted ladder that served for the fourth flight and show you the skylight room it occupied x feet of floor space at the middle of the hall on each side of it was a dark lumber closet or storeroom in it was an iron cot a washstand and a chair a shelf was the dresser its four bare walls seemed to close in upon you like the sides of a coffin your hand crept to your throat you gasped you looked up as from a well and breathed once more through the glass of the little skylight you saw a square of blue infinity two dollars suh clara would say in her half contemptuous half tuskegeenial tones one day miss leeson came hunting for a room she carried a typewriter made to be lugged around by a much larger lady she was a very little girl with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying goodness me why didn t you keep up with us mrs parker showed her the double parlours in this closet she said one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal but i am neither a doctor nor a dentist said miss leeson with a shiver mrs parker gave her the incredulous pitying sneering icy stare that she kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists and led the way to the second floor back eight dollars said miss leeson dear me i m not hetty if i do look green i m just a poor little working girl show me something higher and lower mr skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the rap on his door excuse me mr skidder said mrs parker with her demon s smile at his pale looks i didn t know you were in i asked the lady to have a look at your lambrequins they re too lovely for anything said miss leeson smiling in exactly the way the angels do after they had gone mr skidder got very busy erasing the tall black haired heroine from his latest unproduced play and inserting a small roguish one with heavy bright hair and vivacious features anna held ll jump at it said mr skidder to himself putting his feet up against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke like an aerial cuttlefish presently the tocsin call of clara sounded to the world the state of miss leeson s purse a dark goblin seized her mounted a stygian stairway thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words two dollars i ll take it sighed miss leeson sinking down upon the squeaky iron bed every day miss leeson went out to work at night she brought home papers with handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter sometimes she had no work at night and then she would sit on the steps of the high stoop with the other roomers miss leeson was not intended for a sky light room when the plans were drawn for her creation she was gay hearted and full of tender whimsical fancies once she let mr skidder read to her three acts of his great unpublished comedy it s no kid or the heir of the subway there was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever miss leeson had time to sit on the steps for an hour or two but miss longnecker the tall blonde who taught in a public school and said well really to everything you said sat on the top step and sniffed and miss dorn who shot at the moving ducks at coney every sunday and worked in a department store sat on the bottom step and sniffed miss leeson sat on the middle step and the men would quickly group around her especially mr skidder who had cast her in his mind for the star part in a private romantic unspoken drama in real life and especially mr hoover who was forty five fat flush and foolish and especially very young mr evans who set up a hollow cough to induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes the men voted her the funniest and jolliest ever but the sniffs on the top step and the lower step were implacable i pray you let the drama halt while chorus stalks to the footlights and drops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of mr hoover tune the pipes to the tragedy of tallow the bane of bulk the calamity of corpulence tried out falstaff might have rendered more romance to the ton than would have romeo s rickety ribs to the ounce a lover may sigh but he must not puff to the train of momus are the fat men remanded in vain beats the faithfullest heart above a inch belt avaunt hoover hoover forty five flush and foolish might carry off helen herself hoover forty five flush foolish and fat is meat for perdition there was never a chance for you hoover as mrs parker s roomers sat thus one summer s evening miss leeson looked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh why there s billy jackson i can see him from down here too all looked up some at the windows of skyscrapers some casting about for an airship jackson guided it s that star explained miss leeson pointing with a tiny finger not the big one that twinkles the steady blue one near it i can see it every night through my skylight i named it billy jackson well really said miss longnecker i didn t know you were an astronomer miss leeson oh yes said the small star gazer i know as much as any of them about the style of sleeves they re going to wear next fall in mars well really said miss longnecker the star you refer to is gamma of the constellation cassiopeia it is nearly of the second magnitude and its meridian passage is oh said the very young mr evans i think billy jackson is a much better name for it same here said mr hoover loudly breathing defiance to miss longnecker i think miss leeson has just as much right to name stars as any of those old astrologers had well really said miss longnecker i wonder whether it s a shooting star remarked miss dorn i hit nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at coney sunday he doesn t show up very well from down here said miss leeson you ought to see him from my room you know you can see stars even in the daytime from the bottom of a well at night my room is like the shaft of a coal mine and it makes billy jackson look like the big diamond pin that night fastens her kimono with there came a time after that when miss leeson brought no formidable papers home to copy and when she went out in the morning instead of working she went from office to office and let her heart melt away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office boys this went on there came an evening when she wearily climbed mrs parker s stoop at the hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant but she had had no dinner as she stepped into the hall mr hoover met her and seized his chance he asked her to marry him and his fatness hovered above her like an avalanche she dodged and caught the balustrade he tried for her hand and she raised it and smote him weakly in the face step by step she went up dragging herself by the railing she passed mr skidder s door as he was red inking a stage direction for myrtle delorme miss leeson in his unaccepted comedy to pirouette across stage from l to the side of the count up the carpeted ladder she crawled at last and opened the door of the skylight room she was too weak to light the lamp or to undress she fell upon the iron cot her fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs and in that erebus of the skylight room she slowly raised her heavy eyelids and smiled for billy jackson was shining down on her calm and bright and constant through the skylight there was no world about her she was sunk in a pit of blackness with but that small square of pallid light framing the star that she had so whimsically and oh so ineffectually named miss longnecker must be right it was gamma of the constellation cassiopeia and not billy jackson and yet she could not let it be gamma as she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm the third time she got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit to billy jackson her arm fell back limply good bye billy she murmured faintly you re millions of miles away and you won t even twinkle once but you kept where i could see you most of the time up there when there wasn t anything else but darkness to look at didn t you millions of miles good bye billy jackson clara the coloured maid found the door locked at the next day and they forced it open vinegar and the slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail some one ran to phone for an ambulance in due time it backed up to the door with much gong clanging and the capable young medico in his white linen coat ready active confident with his smooth face half debonair half grim danced up the steps ambulance call to he said briefly what s the trouble oh yes doctor sniffed mrs parker as though her trouble that there should be trouble in the house was the greater i can t think what can be the matter with her nothing we could do would bring her to it s a young woman a miss elsie yes a miss elsie leeson never before in my house what room cried the doctor in a terrible voice to which mrs parker was a stranger the skylight room it evidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of skylight rooms he was gone up the stairs four at a time mrs parker followed slowly as her dignity demanded on the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in his arms he stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue not loudly gradually mrs parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail ever afterward there remained crumples in her mind and body sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the doctor said to her let that be she would answer if i can get forgiveness for having heard it i will be satisfied the ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of hounds that follow the curiosity chase and even they fell back along the sidewalk abashed for his face was that of one who bears his own dead they noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in the ambulance the form that he carried and all that he said was drive like h l wilson to the driver that is all is it a story in the next morning s paper i saw a little news item and the last sentence of it may help you as it helped me to weld the incidents together it recounted the reception into bellevue hospital of a young woman who had been removed from no east street suffering from debility induced by starvation it concluded with these words dr william jackson the ambulance physician who attended the case says the patient will recover a service of love when one loves one s art no service seems too hard that is our premise this story shall draw a conclusion from it and show at the same time that the premise is incorrect that will be a new thing in logic and a feat in story telling somewhat older than the great wall of china joe larrabee came out of the post oak flats of the middle west pulsing with a genius for pictorial art at six he drew a picture of the town pump with a prominent citizen passing it hastily this effort was framed and hung in the drug store window by the side of the ear of corn with an uneven number of rows at twenty he left for new york with a flowing necktie and a capital tied up somewhat closer delia caruthers did things in six octaves so promisingly in a pine tree village in the south that her relatives chipped in enough in her chip hat for her to go north and finish they could not see her f but that is our story joe and delia met in an atelier where a number of art and music students had gathered to discuss chiaroscuro wagner music rembrandt s works pictures waldteufel wall paper chopin and oolong joe and delia became enamoured one of the other or each of the other as you please and in a short time were married for see above when one loves one s art no service seems too hard mr and mrs larrabee began housekeeping in a flat it was a lonesome flat something like the a sharp way down at the left hand end of the keyboard and they were happy for they had their art and they had each other and my advice to the rich young man would be sell all thou hast and give it to the poor janitor for the privilege of living in a flat with your art and your delia flat dwellers shall indorse my dictum that theirs is the only true happiness if a home is happy it cannot fit too close let the dresser collapse and become a billiard table let the mantel turn to a rowing machine the escritoire to a spare bedchamber the washstand to an upright piano let the four walls come together if they will so you and your delia are between but if home be the other kind let it be wide and long enter you at the golden gate hang your hat on hatteras your cape on cape horn and go out by the labrador joe was painting in the class of the great magister you know his fame his fees are high his lessons are light his high lights have brought him renown delia was studying under rosenstock you know his repute as a disturber of the piano keys they were mighty happy as long as their money lasted so is every but i will not be cynical their aims were very clear and defined joe was to become capable very soon of turning out pictures that old gentlemen with thin side whiskers and thick pocketbooks would sandbag one another in his studio for the privilege of buying delia was to become familiar and then contemptuous with music so that when she saw the orchestra seats and boxes unsold she could have sore throat and lobster in a private dining room and refuse to go on the stage but the best in my opinion was the home life in the little flat the ardent voluble chats after the day s study the cozy dinners and fresh light breakfasts the interchange of ambitions ambitions interwoven each with the other s or else inconsiderable the mutual help and inspiration and overlook my artlessness stuffed olives and cheese sandwiches at p m but after a while art flagged it sometimes does even if some switchman doesn t flag it everything going out and nothing coming in as the vulgarians say money was lacking to pay mr magister and herr rosenstock their prices when one loves one s art no service seems too hard so delia said she must give music lessons to keep the chafing dish bubbling for two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils one evening she came home elated joe dear she said gleefully i ve a pupil and oh the loveliest people general general a b pinkney s daughter on seventy first street such a splendid house joe you ought to see the front door byzantine i think you would call it and inside oh joe i never saw anything like it before my pupil is his daughter clementina i dearly love her already she s a delicate thing dresses always in white and the sweetest simplest manners only eighteen years old i m to give three lessons a week and just think joe a lesson i don t mind it a bit for when i get two or three more pupils i can resume my lessons with herr rosenstock now smooth out that wrinkle between your brows dear and let s have a nice supper that s all right for you dele said joe attacking a can of peas with a carving knife and a hatchet but how about me do you think i m going to let you hustle for wages while i philander in the regions of high art not by the bones of benvenuto cellini i guess i can sell papers or lay cobblestones and bring in a dollar or two delia came and hung about his neck joe dear you are silly you must keep on at your studies it is not as if i had quit my music and gone to work at something else while i teach i learn i am always with my music and we can live as happily as millionaires on a week you mustn t think of leaving mr magister all right said joe reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable dish but i hate for you to be giving lessons it isn t art but you re a trump and a dear to do it when one loves one s art no service seems too hard said delia magister praised the sky in that sketch i made in the park said joe and tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his window i may sell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees them i m sure you will said delia sweetly and now let s be thankful for gen pinkney and this veal roast during all of the next week the larrabees had an early breakfast joe was enthusiastic about some morning effect sketches he was doing in central park and delia packed him off breakfasted coddled praised and kissed at o clock art is an engaging mistress it was most times o clock when he returned in the evening at the end of the week delia sweetly proud but languid triumphantly tossed three five dollar bills on the x inches centre table of the x feet flat parlour sometimes she said a little wearily clementina tries me i m afraid she doesn t practise enough and i have to tell her the same things so often and then she always dresses entirely in white and that does get monotonous but gen pinkney is the dearest old man i wish you could know him joe he comes in sometimes when i am with clementina at the piano he is a widower you know and stands there pulling his white goatee and how are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers progressing he always asks i wish you could see the wainscoting in that drawing room joe and those astrakhan rug portieres and clementina has such a funny little cough i hope she is stronger than she looks oh i really am getting attached to her she is so gentle and high bred gen pinkney s brother was once minister to bolivia and then joe with the air of a monte cristo drew forth a ten a five a two and a one all legal tender notes and laid them beside delia s earnings sold that watercolour of the obelisk to a man from peoria he announced overwhelmingly don t joke with me said delia not from peoria all the way i wish you could see him dele fat man with a woollen muffler and a quill toothpick he saw the sketch in tinkle s window and thought it was a windmill at first he was game though and bought it anyhow he ordered another an oil sketch of the lackawanna freight depot to take back with him music lessons oh i guess art is still in it i m so glad you ve kept on said delia heartily you re bound to win dear thirty three dollars we never had so much to spend before we ll have oysters to night and filet mignon with champignons said joe were is the olive fork on the next saturday evening joe reached home first he spread his on the parlour table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his hands half an hour later delia arrived her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle of wraps and bandages how is this asked joe after the usual greetings delia laughed but not very joyously clementina she explained insisted upon a welsh rabbit after her lesson she is such a queer girl welsh rabbits at in the afternoon the general was there you should have seen him run for the chafing dish joe just as if there wasn t a servant in the house i know clementina isn t in good health she is so nervous in serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot of it boiling hot over my hand and wrist it hurt awfully joe and the dear girl was so sorry but gen pinkney joe that old man nearly went distracted he rushed downstairs and sent somebody they said the furnace man or somebody in the basement out to a drug store for some oil and things to bind it up with it doesn t hurt so much now what s this asked joe taking the hand tenderly and pulling at some white strands beneath the bandages it s something soft said delia that had oil on it oh joe did you sell another sketch she had seen the money on the table did i said joe just ask the man from peoria he got his depot to day and he isn t sure but he thinks he wants another parkscape and a view on the hudson what time this afternoon did you burn your hand dele five o clock i think said dele plaintively the iron i mean the rabbit came off the fire about that time you ought to have seen gen pinkney joe when sit down here a moment dele said joe he drew her to the couch sat beside her and put his arm across her shoulders what have you been doing for the last two weeks dele he asked she braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness and murmured a phrase or two vaguely of gen pinkney but at length down went her head and out came the truth and tears i couldn t get any pupils she confessed and i couldn t bear to have you give up your lessons and i got a place ironing shirts in that big twentyfourth street laundry and i think i did very well to make up both general pinkney and clementina don t you joe and when a girl in the laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this afternoon i was all the way home making up that story about the welsh rabbit you re not angry are you joe and if i hadn t got the work you mightn t have sold your sketches to that man from peoria he wasn t from peoria said joe slowly well it doesn t matter where he was from how clever you are joe and kiss me joe and what made you ever suspect that i wasn t giving music lessons to clementina i didn t said joe until to night and i wouldn t have then only i sent up this cotton waste and oil from the engine room this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a smoothing iron i ve been firing the engine in that laundry for the last two weeks and then you didn t my purchaser from peoria said joe and gen pinkney are both creations of the same art but you wouldn t call it either painting or music and then they both laughed and joe began when one loves one s art no service seems but delia stopped him with her hand on his lips no she said just when one loves the coming out of maggie eevery saturday night the clover leaf social club gave a hop in the hall of the give and take athletic association on the east side in order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the give and take or if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing you must work in rhinegold s paper box factory still any clover leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance but mostly each give and take brought the paper box girl that he affected and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops maggie toole on account of her dull eyes broad mouth and left handed style of footwork in the twostep went to the dances with anna mccarty and her fellow anna and maggie worked side by side in the factory and were the greatest chums ever so anna always made jimmy burns take her by maggie s house every saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them the give and take athletic association lived up to its name the hall of the association in orchard street was fitted out with muscle making inventions with the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat between these more serious occupations the saturday night hop with the paper box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen for sometimes the tip went round and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes on saturdays rhinegold s paper box factory closed at p m on one such afternoon anna and maggie walked homeward together at maggie s door anna said as usual be ready at seven sharp mag and jimmy and me ll come by for you but what was this instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non escorted one there was to be perceived a high poised head a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye thanks anna said maggie but you and jimmy needn t bother to night i ve a gentleman friend that s coming round to escort me to the hop the comely anna pounced upon her friend shook her chided and beseeched her maggie toole catch a fellow plain dear loyal unattractive maggie so sweet as a chum so unsought for a two step or a moonlit bench in the little park how was it when did it happen who was it you ll see to night said maggie flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in cupid s vineyard he s swell all right he s two inches taller than jimmy and an up to date dresser i ll introduce him anna just as soon as we get to the hall anna and jimmy were among the first clover leafs to arrive that evening anna s eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend s catch at miss toole swept into the hall with her escort quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful jimmy oh gee cried anna mag ain t made a hit oh no swell fellow well i guess style look at um go as far as you like said jimmy with sandpaper in his voice cop him out if you want him these new guys always win out with the push don t mind me he don t squeeze all the limes i guess huh shut up jimmy you know what i mean i m glad for mag first fellow she ever had oh here they come across the floor maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser and truly her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum he stood two inches taller than the average give and take athlete his dark hair curled his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles the young men of the clover leaf club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess its achievements in hand to hand conflicts and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it the member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ beau brummel airs they were not considered honourable methods of warfare the swelling biceps the coat straining at its buttons over the chest the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of cupid these were the approved arms and ammunition of the clover leaf gallants they viewed then genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle a friend of mine mr terry o sullivan was maggie s formula of introduction she led him around the room presenting him to each new arriving clover leaf almost was she pretty now with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse maggie toole s got a fellow at last was the word that went round among the paper box girls pipe mag s floor walker thus the give and takes expressed their indifferent contempt usually at the weekly hops maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back she felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished she had even grown used to noticing anna joggle the reluctant jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two step but to night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six terry o sullivan was a victorious prince charming and maggie toole winged her first butterfly flight and though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose crowned melody of maggie s one perfect night the girls besieged her for introductions to her fellow the clover leaf young men after two years of blindness suddenly perceived charms in miss toole they flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance thus she scored but to terry o sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast he shook his curls he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day he danced like a faun he introduced manner and style and atmosphere his words came trippingly upon his tongue and he waltzed twice in succession with the paper box girl that dempsey donovan brought dempsey was the leader of the association he wore a dress suit and could chin the bar twice with one hand he was one of big mike o sullivan s lieutenants and was never troubled by trouble no cop dared to arrest him whenever be broke a pushcart man s head or shot a member of the heinrick b sweeney outing and literary association in the kneecap an officer would drop around and say the cap n d like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time dempsey me boy but there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars and somebody would tell a funny story and then dempsey would go back and work half an hour with the sixpound dumbbells so doing a tight rope act on a wire stretched across niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with dempsey donovan s paper box girl at o clock the jolly round face of big mike o sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene he always looked in for five minutes smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys dempsey donovan was at his elbow instantly talking rapidly big mike looked carefully at the dancers smiled shook his head and departed the music stopped the dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls terry o sullivan with his entrancing bow relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find maggie dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor some fine instinct that rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena two or three give and takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer one moment mr o sullivan said dempsey i hope you re enjoying yourself where did you say you live the two gladiators were well matched dempsey had perhaps ten pounds of weight to give away the o sullivan had breadth with quickness dempsey had a glacial eye a dominating slit of a mouth an indestructible jaw a complexion like a belle s and the coolness of a champion the visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer they were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten they were each too splendid too mighty too incomparable to divide pre eminence one only must survive i live on grand said o sullivan insolently and no trouble to find me at home where do you live dempsey ignored the question you say your name s o sullivan he went on well big mike says he never saw you before lots of things he never saw said the favourite of the hop as a rule went on dempsey huskily sweet o sullivans in this district know one another you escorted one of our lady members here and we want chance to make good if you ve got a family tree let s see a few historical o sullivan buds come out on it or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots suppose you mind your own business suggested o sullivan blandly dempsey s eye brightened he held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him i ve got it now he said cordially it was just a little mistake you ain t no o sullivan you are a ring tailed monkey excuse us for not recognising you at first o sullivan s eye flashed he made a quick movement but andy geoghan was ready and caught his arm dempsey nodded at andy and william mcmahan the secretary of the club and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall two other members of the give and take association swiftly joined the little group terry o sullivan was now in the hands of the board of rules and social referees they spoke to him briefly and softly and conducted him out through the same door at the rear this movement on the part of the clover leaf members requires a word of elucidation back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club in this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled man to man with the weapons of nature under the supervision of the board no lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a clover leaf hop in several years its gentlemen members guaranteed that so easily and smoothly had dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating o sullivan s social triumph among these was maggie she looked about for her escort smoke up said rose cassidy wasn t you on demps donovan picked a scrap with your lizzie boy and they ve waltzed out to the slaughter room with him how s my hair look done up this way mag maggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist gone to fight with dempsey she said breathlessly they ve got to be stopped dempsey donovan can t fight him why he ll he ll kill him ah what do you care said rosa don t some of em fight every hop but maggie was off darting her zig zag way through the maze of dancers she burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat it gave way and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene the board standing about with open watches dempsey donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing light footed with the wary grace of the modern pugilist within easy reach of his adversary terry o sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes and without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of o sullivan that was suddenly uplifted and to whisk from it the long bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom the knife fell and rang upon the floor cold steel drawn in the rooms of the give and take association such a thing had never happened before every one stood motionless for a minute andy geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning and then o sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth dempsey and the board exchanged looks and then dempsey looked at o sullivan without anger as one looks at a stray dog and nodded his head in the direction of the door the back stairs giuseppi he said briefly somebody pitch your hat down after you maggie walked up to dempsey donovan there was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks down which slow tears were running but she looked him bravely in the eye i knew it dempsey she said as her eyes grew dull even in their tears i knew he was a guinea his name s tony spinelli i hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin them guineas always carries knives but you don t understand dempsey i never had a fellow in my life i got tired of comin with anna and jimmy every night so i fixed it with him to call himself o sullivan and brought him along i knew there d be nothin doin for him if he came as a dago i guess i ll resign from the club now dempsey turned to andy geoghan chuck that cheese slicer out of the window he said and tell em inside that mr o sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to tammany hall and then he turned back to maggie say mag he said i ll see you home and how about next saturday night will you come to the hop with me if i call around for you it was remarkable how quickly maggie s eyes could change from dull to a shining brown with you dempsey she stammered say will a duck swim man about town there were two or three things that i wanted to know i do not care about a mystery so i began to inquire it took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases and then i began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces this serious query was at first received with suspicion because it sounded like a conundrum i was at last assured that its double form of construction was designed to make lighter the burden of woman who makes up beds i was so foolish as to persist begging to know why then they were not made in two equal pieces whereupon i was shunned the third draught that i craved from the fount of knowledge was enlightenment concerning the character known as a man about town he was more vague in my mind than a type should be we must have a concrete idea of anything even if it be an imaginary idea before we can comprehend it now i have a mental picture of john doe that is as clear as a steel engraving his eyes are weak blue he wears a brown vest and a shiny black serge coat he stands always in the sunshine chewing something and he keeps half shutting his pocket knife and opening it again with his thumb and if the man higher up is ever found take my assurance for it he will be a large pale man with blue wristlets showing under his cuffs and he will be sitting to have his shoes polisbed within sound of a bowling alley and there will be somewhere about him turquoises but the canvas of my imagination when it came to limning the man about town was blank i fancied that he bad a detachable sneer like the smile of the cheshire cat and attached cuffs and that was all whereupon i asked a newspaper reporter about him why said he a man about town something between a rounder and a clubman he isn t exactly well he fits in between mrs fish s receptions and private boxing bouts he doesn t well he doesn t belong either to the lotos club or to the jerry mcgeogheghan galvanised iron workers apprentices left hook chowder association i don t exactly know how to describe him to you you ll see him everywhere there s anything doing yes i suppose he s a type dress clothes every evening knows the ropes calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first names no he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives you generally see him alone or with another man my friend the reporter left me and i wandered further afield by this time the electric lights on the rialto were alight people passed but they held me not paphian eyes rayed upon me and left me unscathed diners heimgangers shop girls confidence men panhandlers actors highwaymen millionaires and outlanders hurried skipped strolled sneaked swaggered and scurried by me but i took no note of them i knew them all i had read their hearts they had served i wanted my man about town he was a type and to drop him would be an error a typograph but no let us continue let us continue with a moral digression to see a family reading the sunday paper gratifies the sections have been separated papa is earnestly scanning the page that pictures the young lady exercising before an open window and bending but there there mamma is interested in trying to guess the missing letters in the word nw yok the oldest girls are eagerly perusing the financial reports for a certain young man remarked last sunday night that he had taken a flyer in q x z willie the eighteen year old son who attends the new york public school is absorbed in the weekly article describing how to make over an old skirt for he hopes to take a prize in sewing on graduation day grandma is holding to the comic supplement with a two hours grip and little tottie the baby is rocking along the best she can with the real estatc transfers this view is intended to be reassuring for it is desirable that a few lines of this story be skipped for it introduces strong drink i went into a cafe to and while it was being mixed i asked the man who grabs up your hot scotch spoon as soon as you lay it down what he undcrstood by the term epithet description designation characterisation or appellation viz a man about town why said he carefully it means a fly guy that s wise to the all night push see it s a hot sport that you can t bump to the rail anywhere between the flatirons see i guess that s about what it means i thanked him and departed on the sidewalk a salvation lassie shook her contribution receptacle gently against my waistcoat pocket would you mind telling me i asked her if you ever meet with the character commonly denominated as a man about town during your daily wanderings i think i know whom you mean she answered with a gentle smile we see them in the same places night after night they are the devil s body guard and if the soldiers of any army are as faithful as they are their commanders are well served we go among them diverting a few pennies from their wickedness to the lord s service she shook the box again and i dropped a dime into it in front of a glittering hotel a friend of mine a critic was climbing from a cab he seemed at leisure and i put my question to him he answered me conscientiously as i was sure he would there is a type of man about town in new york he answered the term is quite familiar to me but i don t think i was ever called upon to define the character before it would be difficult to point you out an exact specimen i would say offhand that it is a man who had a hopeless case of the peculiar new york disease of wanting to see and know at o clock each day life begins with him he follows rigidly the conventions of dress and manners but in the business of poking his nose into places where he does not belong he could give pointers to a civet cat or a jackdaw he is the man who has chased bohemia about the town from rathskeller to roof garden and from hester street to harlem until you can t find a place in the city where they don t cut their spaghetti with a knife your man about town has done that he is always on the scent of something new he is curiosity impudence and omnipresence hansoms were made for him and gold banded cigars and the curse of music at dinner there are not so many of him but his minority report is adopted everywhere i m glad you brought up the subject i ve felt the influence of this nocturnal blight upon our city but i never thought to analyse it before i can see now that your man about town should havc been classified long ago in his wake spring up wine agents and cloak models and the orchestra p ays let s all go up to maud s for him by request instead of handel he makes his rounds every evening while you and i see the elephant once a week when the cigar store is raided he winks at the officer familiar with his ground and walks away immune while you and i search among the presidents for names and among the stars for addresses to give the desk sergeant my friend the critic paused to acquire breath for fresh eloquence i seized my advantage you have classified him i cried with joy you have painted his portrait in the gallery of city types but i must meet one face to face i must study the man about town at first hand where shall i find him how shall i know him without seeming to hear me the critic went on and his cab driver was waiting for his fare too he is the sublimated essence of butt in the refined intrinsic extract of rubber the concentrated purified irrefutable unavoidable spirit of curiosity and inquisitiveness a new sensation is the breath in his nostrils when his experience is exhausted he explores new fields with the indefatigability of a excuse me i interrupted but can you produce one of this type it is a new thing to me i must study it i will search the town over until i find one its habitat must be here on broadway i am about to dine here said my friend come inside and if there is a man about town present i will point him out to you i know most of the regular patrons here i am not dining yet i said to him you will excuse me i am going to find my man about town this night if i have to rake new york from the battery to little coney island i left the hotel and walked down broadway the pursuit of my type gave a pleasant savour of life and interest to the air i breathed i was glad to be in a city so great so complex and diversified leisurely and with something of an air i strolled along with my heart expanding at the thought that i was a citizen of great gotham a sharer in its magnificence and pleasures a partaker in its glory and prestige i turned to cross the street i heard something buzz like a bee and then i took a long pleasant ride with santos dumont when i opened my eyes i remembered a smell of gasoline and i said aloud hasn t it passed yet a hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow that was not at all fevered a young doctor came along grinned and handed me a morning newspaper want to see how it happened he asked cheerily i read the article its headlines began where i heard the buzzing leave off the night before it closed with these lines bellevue hospital where it was said that his injuries were not serious he appeared to be a typica man about town the cop and the anthem on his bench in madison square soapy moved uneasily when wild geese honk high of nights and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands and when soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park you may know that winter is near at hand a dead leaf fell in soapy s lap that was jack frost s card jack is kind to the regular denizens of madison square and gives fair warning of his annual call at the corners of four streets he hands his pasteboard to the north wind footman of the mansion of all outdoors so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready soapy s mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him to resolve himself into a singular committee of ways and means to provide against the coming rigour and therefore he moved uneasily on his bench the hibernatorial ambitions of soapy were not of the highest in them there were no considerations of mediterranean cruises of soporific southern skies drifting in the vesuvian bay three months on the island was what his soul craved three months of assured board and bed and congenial company safe from boreas and bluecoats seemed to soapy the essence of things desirable for years the hospitable blackwell s had been his winter quarters just as his more fortunate fellow new yorkers had bought their tickets to palm beach and the riviera each winter so soapy had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the island and now the time was come on the previous night three sabbath newspapers distributed beneath his coat about his ankles and over his lap had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square so the island loomed big and timely in soapy s mind he scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the city s dependents in soapy s opinion the law was more benign than philanthropy there was an endless round of institutions municipal and eleemosynary on which he might set out and receive lodging and food accordant with the simple life but to one of soapy s proud spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered if not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy as caesar had his brutus every bed of charity must have its toll of a bath every loaf of bread its compensation of a private and personal inquisition wherefore it is better to be a guest of the law which though conducted by rules does not meddle unduly with a gentleman s private affairs soapy having decided to go to the island at once set about accomplishing his desire there were many easy ways of doing this the pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive restaurant and then after declaring insolvency be handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman an accommodating magistrate would do the rest soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of asphalt where broadway and fifth avenue flow together up broadway he turned and halted at a glittering cafe where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the grape the silkworm and the protoplasm soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest upward he was shaven and his coat was decent and his neat black ready tied four in hand had been presented to him by a lady missionary on thanksgiving day if he could reach a table in the restaurant unsuspected success would be his the portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter s mind a roasted mallard duck thought soapy would be about the thing with a bottle of chablis and then camembert a demi tasse and a cigar one dollar for the cigar would be enough the total would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the cafe management and yet the meat would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge but as soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter s eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of the menaced mallard soapy turned off broadway it seemed that his route to the coveted island was not to be an epicurean one some other way of entering limbo must be thought of at a corner of sixth avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed wares behind plate glass made a shop window conspicuous soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass people came running around the corner a policeman in the lead soapy stood still with his hands in his pockets and smiled at the sight of brass buttons where s the man that done that inquired the officer excitedly don t you figure out that i might have had something to do with it said soapy not without sarcasm but friendly as one greets good fortune the policeman s mind refused to accept soapy even as a clue men who smash windows do not remain to parley with the law s minions they take to their heels the policeman saw a man half way down the block running to catch a car with drawn club he joined in the pursuit soapy with disgust in his heart loafed along twice unsuccessful on the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great pretensions it catered to large appetites and modest purses its crockery and atmosphere were thick its soup and napery thin into this place soapy took his accusive shoes and telltale trousers without challenge at a table he sat and consumed beefsteak flapjacks doughnuts and pie and then to the waiter be betrayed the fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers now get busy and call a cop said soapy and don t keep a gentleman waiting no cop for youse said the waiter with a voice like butter cakes and an eye like the cherry in a manhattan cocktail hey con neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched soapy he arose joint by joint as a carpenter s rule opens and beat the dust from his clothes arrest seemed but a rosy dream the island seemed very far away a policeman who stood before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the street five blocks soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo capture again this time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself a cinch a young woman of a modest and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands and two yards from the window a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water plug it was soapy s design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated masher the refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm that would insure his winter quarters on the right little tight little isle soapy straightened the lady missionary s readymade tie dragged his shrinking cuffs into the open set his hat at a killing cant and sidled toward the young woman he made eyes at her was taken with sudden coughs and hems smiled smirked and went brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of the masher with half an eye soapy saw that the policeman was watching him fixedly the young woman moved away a few steps and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving mugs soapy followed boldly stepping to her side raised his hat and said ah there bedelia don t you want to come and play in my yard the policeman was still looking the persecuted young woman had but to beckon a finger and soapy would be practically en route for his insular haven already he imagined he could feel the cozy warmth of the station house the young woman faced him and stretching out a hand caught soapy s coat sleeve sure mike she said joyfully if you ll blow me to a pail of suds i d have spoke to you sooner but the cop was watching with the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak soapy walked past the policeman overcome with gloom he seemed doomed to liberty at the next corner he shook off his companion and ran he halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets hearts vows and librettos women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air a sudden fear seized soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest the thought brought a little of panic upon it and when he came upon another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of disorderly conduct on the sidewalk soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice he danced howled raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin the policeman twirled his club turned his back to soapy and remarked to a citizen tis one of them yale lads celebratin the goose egg they give to the hartford college noisy but no harm we ve instructions to lave them be disconsolate soapy ceased his unavailing racket would never a policeman lay hands on him in his fancy the island seemed an unattainable arcadia he buttoned his thin coat against the chilling wind in a cigar store he saw a well dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light his silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering soapy stepped inside secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it slowly the man at the cigar light followed hastily my umbrella he said sternly oh is it sneered soapy adding insult to petit larceny well why don t you call a policeman i took it your umbrella why don t you call a cop there stands one on the corner the umbrella owner slowed his steps soapy did likewise with a presentiment that luck would again run against him the policeman looked at the two curiously of course said the umbrella man that is well you know how these mistakes occur i if it s your umbrella i hope you ll excuse me i picked it up this morning in a restaurant if you recognise it as yours why i hope you ll of course it s mine said soapy viciously the ex umbrella man retreated the policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements he hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation he muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs because he wanted to fall into their clutches they seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong at length soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil was but faint he set his face down this toward madison square for the homing instinct survives even when the home is a park bench but on an unusually quiet corner soapy came to a standstill here was an old church quaint and rambling and gabled through one violet stained window a soft light glowed where no doubt the organist loitered over the keys making sure of his mastery of the coming sabbath anthem for there drifted out to soapy s ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence the moon was above lustrous and serene vehicles and pedestrians were few sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves for a little while the scene might have been a country churchyard and the anthem that the organist played cemented soapy to the iron fence for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars the conjunction of soapy s receptive state of mind and the influences about the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul he viewed with swift horror the pit into which he had tumbled the degraded days unworthy desires dead hopes wrecked faculties and base motives that made up his existence and also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood an instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate he would pull himself out of the mire he would make a man of himself again he would conquer the evil that had taken possession of him there was time he was comparatively young yet he would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him to morrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and find work a fur importer had once offered him a place as driver he would find him to morrow and ask for the position he would be somebody in the world he would soapy felt a hand laid on his arm he looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman what are you doin here asked the officer nothin said soapy then come along said the policeman three months on the island said the magistrate in the police court the next morning an adjustment of nature in an art exhibition the other day i saw a painting that had been sold for the painter was a young scrub out of the west named kraft who had a favourite food and a pet theory his pabulum was an unquenchable belief in the unerring artistic adjustment of nature his theory was fixed around corned beef hash with poached egg there was a story behind the picture so i went home and let it drip out of a fountain pen the idea of kraft but that is not the beginning of the story three years ago kraft bill judkins a poet and i took our meals at cypher s on eighth avenue i say took when we had money cypher got it off of us as he expressed it we had no credit we went in called for food and ate it we paid or we did not pay we had confidence in cypher s sullenness end smouldering ferocity deep down in his sunless soul he was either a prince a fool or an artist he sat at a worm eaten desk covered with files of waiters checks so old that i was sure the bottomest one was for clams that hendrik hudson had eaten and paid for cypher had the power in common with napoleon iii and the goggle eyed perch of throwing a film over his eyes rendering opaque the windows of his soul once when we left him unpaid with egregious excuses i looked back and saw him shaking with inaudible laughter behind his film now and then we paid up back scores but the chief thing at cypher s was milly milly was a waitress she was a grand example of kraft s theory of the artistic adjustment of nature she belonged largely to waiting as minerva did to the art of scrapping or venus to the science of serious flirtation pedestalled and in bronze she might have stood with the noblest of her heroic sisters as liver and bacon enlivening the world she belonged to cypher s you expected to see her colossal figure loom through that reeking blue cloud of smoke from frying fat just as you expect the palisades to appear through a drifting hudson river fog there amid the steam of vegetables and the vapours of acres of ham and the crash of crockery the clatter of steel the screaming of short orders the cries of the hungering and all the horrid tumult of feeding man surrounded by swarms of the buzzing winged beasts bequeathed us by pharaoh milly steered her magnificent way like some great liner cleaving among the canoes of howling savages our goddess of grub was built on lines so majestic that they could be followed only with awe her sleeves were always rolled above her elbows she could have taken us three musketeers in her two hands and dropped us out of the window she had seen fewer years than any of us but she was of such superb evehood and simplicity that she mothered us from the beginning cypher s store of eatables she poured out upon us with royal indifference to price and quantity as from a cornucopia that knew no exhaustion her voice rang like a great silver bell her smile was many toothed and frequent she seemed like a yellow sunrise on mountain tops i never saw her but i thought of the yosemite and yet somehow i could never think of her as existing outside of cypher s there nature had placed her and she had taken root and grown mightily she seemed happy and took her few poor dollars on saturday nights with the flushed pleasure of a child that receives an unexpected donation it was kraft who first voiced the fear that each of us must have held latently it came up apropos of course of certain questions of art at which we were hammering one of us compared the harmony existing between a haydn symphony and pistache ice cream to the exquisite congruity between milly and cypher s there is a certain fate hanging over milly said kraft and if it overtakes her she is lost to cypher s and to us she will grow fat asked judkins fearsomely she will go to night school and become refined i ventured anxiously it is this said kraft punctuating in a puddle of spilled coffee with a stiff forefinger caesar had his brutus the cotton has its boliworm the chorus girl has her pittsburger the summer boarder has his poison ivy the hero has his carnegie medal art has its morgan the rose has its speak i interrupted much perturbed you do not think that milly will begin to lace one day concluded kraft solemnly there will come to cypher s for a plate of beans a millionaire lumberman from wisconsin and he will marry milly never exclaimed judkins and t in horror a lumberman repeated kraft hoarsely and a millionaire lumberman i sighed despairingly from wisconsin groaned judkins we agreed that the awful fate seemed to menace her few things were less improbable milly like some vast virgin stretch of pine woods was made to catch the lumberman s eye and well we knew the habits of the badgers once fortune smiled upon them straight to new york they hie and lay their goods at the feet of the girl who serves them beans in a beanery why the alphabet itself connives the sunday newspaper s headliner s work is cut for him winsome waitress wins wealthy wisconsin woodsman for a while we felt that milly was on the verge of being lost to us it was our love of the unerring artistic adjustment of nature that inspired us we could not give her over to a lumberman doubly accursed by wealth and provincialism we shuddered to think of milly with her voice modulated and her elbows covered pouring tea in the marble teepee of a tree murderer no in cypher s she belonged in the bacon smoke the cabbage perfume the grand wagnerian chorus of hurled ironstone china and rattling casters our fears must have been prophetic for on that same evening the wildwood discharged upon us milly s preordained confiscator our fee to adjustment and order but alaska and not wisconsin bore the burden of the visitation we were at our supper of beef stew and dried apples when he trotted in as if on the heels of a dog team and made one of the mess at our table with the freedom of the camps he assaulted our ears and claimed the fellowship of men lost in the wilds of a hash house we embraced him as a specimen and in three minutes we had all but died for one another as friends he was rugged and bearded and wind dried he had just come off the trail he said at one of the north river ferries i fancied i could see the snow dust of chilcoot yet powdering his shoulders and then he strewed the table with the nuggets stuffed ptarmigans bead work and seal pelts of the returned kiondiker and began to prate to us of his millions bank drafts for two millions was his summing up and a thousand a day piling up from my claims and now i want some beef stew and canned peaches i never got off the train since i mushed out of seattle and i m hungry the stuff the niggers feed you on pullmans don t count you gentlemen order what you want and then milly loomed up with a thousand dishes on her bare arm loomed up big and white and pink and awful as mount saint elias with a smile like day breaking in a gulch and the kiondiker threw down his pelts and nuggets as dross and let his jaw fall half way and stared at her you could almost see the diamond tiaras on milly s brow and the hand embroidered silk paris gowns that he meant to buy for her at last the bollworm had attacked the cotton the poison ivy was reaching out its tendrils to entwine the summer boarder the millionaire lumberman thinly disguised as the alaskan miner was about to engulf our milly and upset nature s adjustment kraft was the first to act he leaped up and pounded the klondiker s back come out and drink he shouted drink first and eat afterward judkins seized one arm and i the other gaily roaringly irresistibly in jolly good fellow style we dragged him from the restaurant to a cafe stuffing his pockets with his embalmed birds and indigestible nuggets there he rumbled a roughly good humoured protest that s the girl for my money he declared she can eat out of my skillet the rest of her life why i never see such a fine girl i m going back there and ask her to marry me i guess she won t want to sling hash any more when she sees the pile of dust i ve got you ll take another whiskey and milk now kraft persuaded with satan s smile i thought you up country fellows were better sports kraft spent his puny store of coin at the bar and then gave judkins and me such an appealing look that we went down to the last dime we had in toasting our guest then when our ammunition was gone and the klondiker still somewhat sober began to babble again of milly kraft whispered into his ear such a polite barbed insult relating to people who were miserly with their funds that the miner crashed down handful after handful of silver and notes calling for all the fluids in the world to drown the imputation thus the work was accomplished with his own guns we drove him from the field and then we had him carted to a distant small hotel and put to bed with his nuggets and baby seal skins stuffed around him he will never find cypher s again said kraft he will propose to the first white apron he sees in a dairy restaurant to morrow and milly i mean the natural adjustment is saved and back to cypher s went we three and finding customers scarce we joined hands and did an indian dance with milly in the centre this i say happened three years ago and about that time a little luck descended upon us three and we were enabled to buy costlier and less wholesome food than cypher s our paths separated and i saw kraft no more and judkins seldom but as i said i saw a painting the other day that was sold for the title was boadicea and the figure seemed to fill all out of doors but of all the picture s admirers who stood before it i believe i was the only one who longed for boadicea to stalk from her frame bringing me corned beef hash with poached egg i hurried away to see kraft his satanic eyes were the same his hair was worse tangled but his clothes had been made by a tailor i didn t know i said to him we ve bought a cottage in the bronx with the money said he any evening at then said i when you led us against the lumberman the klondiker it wasn t altogether on account of the unerring artistic adjustment of nature well not altogether said kraft with a grin memoirs of a yellow dog i don t suppose it will knock any of you people off your perch to read a contribution from an animal mr kipling and a good many others have demonstrated the fact that animals can express themselves in remunerative english and no magazine goes to press nowadays without an animal story in it except the old style monthlies that are still running pictures of bryan and the mont pelee horror but you needn t look for any stuck up literature in my piece such as bearoo the bear and snakoo the snake and tammanoo the tiger talk in the jungle books a yellow dog that s spent most of his life in a cheap new york flat sleeping in a corner on an old sateen underskirt the one she spilled port wine on at the lady longshoremen s banquet mustn t be expcctcd to perform any tricks with the art of speech i was born a yellow pup date locality pedigree and weight unknown the first thing i can recollect an old woman had me in a basket at broadway and twenty third trying to sell me to a fat lady old mother hubbard was boosting me to beat the band as a genuine pomeranian hambletonian red irish cochin china stoke pogis fox terrier the fat lady chased a v around among the samples of gros grain flannelette in her shopping bag till she cornered it and gave up from that moment i was a pet a mamma s own wootsey squidlums say gentle reader did you ever have a pound woman breathing a flavour of camembert cheese and peau d espagne pick you up and wallop her nose all over you remarking all the time in an emma eames tone of voice oh oo s um oodlum doodlum woodlum toodlum bitsy witsy skoodlums from a pedigreed yellow pup i grew up to be an anonymous yellow cur looking like a cross between an angora cat and a box of lemons but my mistress never tumbled she thought that the two primeval pups that noah chased into the ark were but a collateral branch of my ancestors it took two policemen to keep her from entering me at the madison square garden for the siberian bloodhound prize i ll tell you about that flat the house was the ordinary thing in new york paved with parian marble in the entrance hall and cobblestones above the first floor our fiat was three well not flights climbs up my mistress rented it unfurnished and put in the regular things antique unholstered parlour set oil chromo of geishas in a harlem tea house rubber plant and husband by sirius there was a biped i felt sorry for he was a little man with sandy hair and whiskers a good deal like mine henpecked well toucans and flamingoes and pelicans all had their bills in him he wiped the dishes and listened to my mistress tell about the cheap ragged things the lady with the squirrel skin coat on the second floor hung out on her line to dry and every evening while she was getting supper she made him take me out on the end of a string for a walk if men knew how women pass the time when they are alone they d never marry laura lean jibbey peanut brittle a little almond cream on the neck muscles dishes unwashed half an hour s talk with the iceman reading a package of old letters a couple of pickles and two bottles of malt extract one hour peeking through a hole in the window shade into the flat across the air shaft that s about all there is to it twenty minutes before time for him to come home from work she straightens up the house fixes her rat so it won t show and gets out a lot of sewing for a ten minute bluff i led a dog s life in that flat most all day i lay there in my corner watching that fat woman kill time i slept sometimes and had pipe dreams about being out chasing cats into basements and growling at old ladies with black mittens as a dog was intended to do then she would pounce upon me with a lot of that drivelling poodle palaver and kiss me on the nose but what could i do a dog can t chew cloves i began to feel sorry for hubby dog my cats if i didn t we looked so much alike that people noticed it when we went out so we shook the streets that morgan s cab drives down and took to climbing the piles of last december s snow on the streets where cheap people live one evening when we were thus promenading and i was trying to look like a prize st bernard and the old man was trying to look like he wouldn t have murdered the first organ grinder he heard play mendelssohn s wedding march i looked up at him and said in my way what are you looking so sour about you oakum trimmed lobster she don t kiss you you don t have to sit on her lap and listen to talk that would make the book of a musical comedy sound like the maxims of epictetus you ought to be thankful you re not a dog brace up benedick and bid the blues begone the matrimonial mishap looked down at me with almost canine intelligence in his face why doggie says he good doggie you almost look like you could speak what is it doggie cats cats could speak but of course he couldn t understand humans were denied the speech of animals the only common ground of communication upon which dogs and men can get together is in fiction in the flat across the hall from us lived a lady with a black and tan terrier her husband strung it and took it out every evening but he always came home cheerful and whistling one day i touched noses with the black and tan in the hall and i struck him for an elucidation see here wiggle and skip i says you know that it ain t the nature of a real man to play dry nurse to a dog in public i never saw one leashed to a bow wow yet that didn t look like he d like to lick every other man that looked at him but your boss comes in every day as perky and set up as an amateur prestidigitator doing the egg trick how does he do it don t tell me he likes it him says the black and tan why he uses nature s own remedy he gets spifflicated at first when we go out he s as shy as the man on the steamer who would rather play pedro when they make em all jackpots by the time we ve been in eight saloons he don t care whether the thing on the end of his line is a dog or a catfish i ve lost two inches of my tail trying to sidestep those swinging doors the pointer i got from that terrier vaudeville please copy set me to thinking one evening about o clock my mistress ordered him to get busy and do the ozone act for lovey i have concealed it until now but that is what she called me the black and tan was called tweetness i consider that i have the bulge on him as far as you could chase a rabbit still lovey is something of a nomenclatural tin can on the tail of one s self respect at a quiet place on a safe street i tightened the line of my custodian in front of an attractive refined saloon i made a dead ahead scramble for the doors whining like a dog in the press despatches that lets the family know that little alice is bogged while gathering lilies in the brook why darn my eyes says the old man with a grin darn my eyes if the saffron coloured son of a seltzer lemonade ain t asking me in to take a drink lemme see how long s it been since i saved shoe leather by keeping one foot on the foot rest i believe i ll i knew i had him hot scotches he took sitting at a table for an hour he kept the campbells coming i sat by his side rapping for the waiter with my tail and eating free lunch such as mamma in her flat never equalled with her homemade truck bought at a delicatessen store eight minutes before papa comes home when the products of scotland were all exhausted except the rye bread the old man unwound me from the table leg and played me outside like a fisherman plays a salmon out there he took off my collar and threw it into the street poor doggie says he good doggie she shan t kiss you any more s a darned shame good doggie go away and get run over by a street car and be happy i refused to leave i leaped and frisked around the old man s legs happy as a pug on a rug you old flea headed woodchuck chaser i said to him you moon baying rabbit pointing eggstealing old beagle can t you see that i don t want to leave you can t you see that we re both pups in the wood and the missis is the cruel uncle after you with the dish towel and me with the flea liniment and a pink bow to tie on my tail why not cut that all out and be pards forever more maybe you ll say he didn t understand maybe he didn t but he kind of got a grip on the hot scotches and stood still for a minute thinking doggie says he finally we don t live more than a dozen lives on this earth and very few of us live to be more than if i ever see that flat any more i m a flat and if you do you re flatter and that s no flattery i m offering to that westward ho wins out by the length of a dachshund there was no string but i frolicked along with my master to the twenty third street ferry and the cats on the route saw reason to give thanks that prehensile claws had been given them on the jersey side my master said to a stranger who stood eating a currant bun me and my doggie we are bound for the rocky mountains but what pleased me most was when my old man pulled both of my ears until i howled and said you common monkey headed rat tailed sulphur coloured son of a door mat do you know what i m going to call you i thought of lovey and i whined dolefully i m going to call you pete says my master and if i d had five tails i couldn t have done enough wagging to do justice to the occasion the love philtre of ikey schoenstein the blue light drug store is downtown between the bowery and first avenue where the distance between the two streets is the shortest the blue light does not consider that pharmacy is a thing of bric a brac scent and ice cream soda if you ask it for pain killer it will not give you a bonbon the blue light scorns the labour saving arts of modern pharmacy it macerates its opium and percolates its own laudanum and paregoric to this day pills are made behind its tall prcscription desk pills rolled out on its own pill tile divided with a spatula rolled with the finger and thumb dusted with calcined magnesia and delivered in little round pasteboard pill boxes the store is on a corner about which coveys of ragged plumed hilarious children play and become candidates for the cough drops and soothing syrups that wait for them inside ikey schoenstein was the night clerk of the blue light and the friend of his customers thus it is on the east side where the heart of pharmacy is not g ace there as it should be the druggist is a counsellor a confessor an adviser an able and willing missionary and mentor whose learning is respected whose occult wisdom is venerated and whose medicine is often poured untasted into the gutter therefore ikey s corniform be spectacled nose and narrow knowledge bowed figure was well known in the vicinity of the blue light and his advice and notice were much desired ikey roomed and breakfasted at mrs riddle s two squares away mrs riddle had a daughter named rosy the circumlocution has been in vain you must have guessed it ikey adored rosy she tinctured all his thoughts she was the compound extract of all that was chemically pure and officinal the dispensatory contained nothing equal to her but ikey was timid and his hopes remained insoluble in the menstruum of his backwardness and fears behind his counter he was a superior being calmly conscious of special knowledge and worth outside he was a weak kneed purblind motorman cursed rambler with ill fitting clothes stained with chemicals and smelling of socotrine aloes and valerianate of ammonia the fly in ikey s ointment thrice welcome pat trope was chunk mcgowan mr mcgowan was also striving to catch the bright smiles tossed about by rosy but he was no outfielder as ikey was he picked them off the bat at the same time he was ikey s friend and customer and often dropped in at the blue light drug store to have a bruise painted with iodine or get a cut rubber plastered after a pleasant evening spent along the bowery one afternoon mcgowan drifted in in his silent easy way and sat comely smooth faced hard indomitable good natured upon a stool ikey said he when his friend had fetched his mortar and sat opposite grinding gum benzoin to a powder get busy with your ear it s drugs for me if you ve got the line i need ikey scanned the countenance of mr mcgowan for the usual evidences of conflict but found none take your coat off he ordered i guess already that you have been stuck in the ribs with a knife i have many times told you those dagoes would do you up mr mcgowan smiled not them he said not any dagoes but you ve located the diagnosis all right enough it s under my coat near the ribs say ikey rosy and me are goin to run away and get married to night ikey s left forefinger was doubled over the edge of the mortar holding it steady he gave it a wild rap with the pestle but felt it not meanwhile mr mcgowan s smile faded to a look of perplexed gloom that is he continued if she keeps in the notion until the time comes we ve been layin pipes for the getaway for two weeks one day she says she will the same evenin she says nixy we ve agreed on to night and rosy s stuck to the affirmative this time for two whole days but it s five hours yet till the time and i m afraid she ll stand me up when it comes to the scratch you said you wanted drugs remarked ikey mr mcgowan looked ill at ease and harassed a condition opposed to his usual line of demeanour he made a patent medicine almanac into a roll and fitted it with unprofitable carefulness about his finger i wouldn t have this double handicap make a false start to night for a million he said i ve got a little flat up in harlem all ready with chrysanthemums on the table and a kettle ready to boil and i ve engaged a pulpit pounder to be ready at his house for us at it s got to come off and if rosy don t change her mind again mr mcgowan ceased a prey to his doubts i don t see then yet said ikey shortly what makes it that you talk of drugs or what i can be doing about it old man riddle don t like me a little bit went on the uneasy suitor bent upon marshalling his arguments for a week he hasn t let rosy step outside the door with me if it wasn t for losin a boarder they d have bounced me long ago i m makin a week and she ll never regret flyin the coop with chunk mcgowan you will excuse me chunk said ikey i must make a prescription that is to be called for soon say said mcgowan looking up suddenly say ikey ain t there a drug of some kind some kind of powders that ll make a girl like you better if you give em to her ikey s lip beneath his nose curled with the scorn of superior enlightenment but before he could answer mcgowan continued tim lacy told me he got some once from a croaker uptown and fed em to his girl in soda water from the very first dose he was ace high and everybody else looked like thirty cents to her they was married in less than two weeks strong and simple was chunk mcgowan a better reader of men than ikey was could have seen that his tough frame was strung upon fine wires like a good general who was about to invade the enemy s territory he was seeking to guard every point against possible failure i thought went on chunk hopefully that if i had one of them powders to give rosy when i see her at supper to night it might brace her up and keep her from reneging on the proposition to skip i guess she don t need a mule team to drag her away but women are better at coaching than they are at running bases if the stuff ll work just for a couple of hours it ll do the trick when is this foolishness of running away to be happening asked ikey nine o clock said mr mcgowan supper s at seven at eight rosy goes to bed with a headache at nine old parvenzano lets me through to his back yard where there s a board off riddle s fence next door i go under her window and help her down the fire escape we ve got to make it early on the preacher s account it s all dead easy if rosy don t balk when the flag drops can you fix me one of them powders ikey ikey schoenstein rubbed his nose slowly chunk said he it is of drugs of that nature that pharmaceutists must have much carefulness to you alone of my acquaintance would i intrust a powder like that but for you i shall make it and you shall see how it makes rosy to think of you ikey went behind the prescription desk there he crushed to a powder two soluble tablets each containing a quarter of a grain of morphia to them he added a little sugar of milk to increase the bulk and folded the mixture neatly in a white paper taken by an adult this powder would insure several hours of heavy slumber without danger to the sleeper this he handed to chunk mcgowan telling him to administer it in a liquid if possible and received the hearty thanks of the backyard lochinvar the subtlety of ikey s action becomes apparent upon recital of his subsequent move he sent a messenger for mr riddle and disclosed the plans of mr mcgowan for eloping with rosy mr riddle was a stout man brick dusty of complexion and sudden in action much obliged he said briefly to ikey the lazy irish loafer my own room s just above rosy s i ll just go up there myself after supper and load the shot gun and wait if he comes in my back yard he ll go away in a ambulance instead of a bridal chaise with rosy held in the clutches of morpheus for a many hours deep slumber and the bloodthirsty parent waiting armed and forewarned ikey felt that his rival was close indeed upon discomfiture all night in the blue light drug store he waited at his duties for chance news of the tragedy but none came at eight o clock in the morning the day clerk arrived and ikey started hurriedly for mrs riddle s to learn the outcome and lo as he stepped out of the store who but chunk mcgowan sprang from a passing street car and grasped his hand chunk mcgowan with a victor s smile and flushed with joy pulled it off said chunk with elysium in his grin rosy bit the fire escape on time to a second and we was under the wire at the reverend s at o she s up at the flat she cooked eggs this mornin in a blue kimono lord how lucky i am you must pace up some day ikey and feed with us i ve got a job down near the bridge and that s where i m heading for now the the powder stammered ikey oh that stuff you gave me said chunk broadening his grin well it was this way i sat down at the supper table last night at riddle s and i looked at rosy and i says to myself chunk if you get the girl get her on the square don t try any hocus pocus with a thoroughbred like her and i keeps the paper you give me in my pocket and then my lamps fall on another party present who i says to myself is failin in a proper affection toward his comin son in law so i watches my chance and dumps that powder in old man riddle s coffee see mammon and the archer old anthony rockwall retired manufacturer and proprietor of rockwall s eureka soap looked out the library window of his fifth avenue mansion and grinned his neighbour to the right the aristocratic clubman g van schuylight suffolk jones came out to his waiting motor car wrinkling a contumelious nostril as usual at the italian renaissance sculpture of the soap palace s front elevation stuck up old statuette of nothing doing commented the ex soap king the eden musee ll get that old frozen nesselrode yet if he don t watch out i ll have this house painted red white and blue next summer and see if that ll make his dutch nose turn up any higher and then anthony rockwall who never cared for bells went to the door of his library and shouted mike in the same voice that had once chipped off pieces of the welkin on the kansas prairies tell my son said anthony to the answering menial to come in here before he leaves the house when young rockwall entered the library the old man laid aside his newspaper looked at him with a kindly grimness on his big smooth ruddy countenance rumpled his mop of white hair with one hand and rattled the keys in his pocket with the other richard said anthony rockwail what do you pay for the soap that you use richard only six months home from college was startled a little he had not yet taken the measure of this sire of his who was as full of unexpectednesses as a girl at her first party six dollars a dozen i think dad and your clothes i suppose about sixty dollars as a rule you re a gentleman said anthony decidedly i ve heard of these young bloods spending a dozen for soap and going over the hundred mark for clothes you ve got as much money to waste as any of em and yet you stick to what s decent and moderate now i use the old eureka not only for sentiment but it s the purest soap made whenever you pay more than cents a cake for soap you buy bad perfumes and labels but cents is doing very well for a young man in your generation position and condition as i said you re a gentleman they say it takes three generations to make one they re off money ll do it as slick as soap grease it s made you one by hokey it s almost made one of me i m nearly as impolite and disagreeable and ill mannered as these two old knickerbocker gents on each side of me that can t sleep of nights because i bought in between em there are some things that money can t accomplish remarked young rockwall rather gloomily now don t say that said old anthony shocked i bet my money on money every time i ve been through the encyclopaedia down to y looking for something you can t buy with it and i expect to have to take up the appendix next week i m for money against the field tell me something money won t buy for one thing answered richard rankling a little it won t buy one into the exclusive circles of society oho won t it thundered the champion of the root of evil you tell me where your exclusive circles would be if the first astor hadn t had the money to pay for his steerage passage over richard sighed and that s what i was coming to said the old man less boisterously that s why i asked you to come in there s something going wrong with you boy i ve been noticing it for two weeks out with it i guess i could lay my hands on eleven millions within twenty four hours besides the real estate if it s your liver there s the rambler down in the bay coaled and ready to steam down to the bahamas in two days not a bad guess dad you haven t missed it far ah said anthony keenly what s her name richard began to walk up and down the library floor there was enough comradeship and sympathy in this crude old father of his to draw his confidence why don t you ask her demanded old anthony she ll jump at you you ve got the money and the looks and you re a decent boy your hands are clean you ve got no eureka soap on em you ve been to college but she ll overlook that i haven t had a chance said richard make one said anthony take her for a walk in the park or a straw ride or walk home with her from church chance pshaw you don t know the social mill dad she s part of the stream that turns it every hour and minute of her time is arranged for days in advance i must have that girl dad or this town is a blackjack swamp forevermore and i can t write it i can t do that tut said the old man do you mean to tell me that with all the money i ve got you can t get an hour or two of a girl s time for yourself i ve put it off too late she s going to sail for europe at noon day after to morrow for a two years stay i m to see her alone to morrow evening for a few minutes she s at larchmont now at her aunt s i can t go there but i m allowed to meet her with a cab at the grand central station to morrow evening at the train we drive down broadway to wallack s at a gallop where her mother and a box party will be waiting for us in the lobby do you think she would listen to a declaration from me during that six or eight minutes under those circumstances no and what chance would i have in the theatre or afterward none no dad this is one tangle that your money can t unravel we can t buy one minute of time with cash if we could rich people would live longer there s no hope of getting a talk with miss lantry before she sails all right richard my boy said old anthony cheerfully you may run along down to your club now i m glad it ain t your liver but don t forget to burn a few punk sticks in the joss house to the great god mazuma from time to time you say money won t buy time well of course you can t order eternity wrapped up and delivered at your residence for a price but i ve seen father time get pretty bad stone bruises on his heels when he walked through the gold diggings that night came aunt ellen gentle sentimental wrinkled sighing oppressed by wealth in to brother anthony at his evening paper and began discourse on the subject of lovers woes he told me all about it said brother anthony yawning i told him my bank account was at his service and then he began to knock money said money couldn t help said the rules of society couldn t be bucked for a yard by a team of ten millionaires oh anthony sighed aunt ellen i wish you would not think so much of money wealth is nothing where a true affection is concerned love is all powerful if he only had spoken earlier she could not have refused our richard but now i fear it is too late he will have no opportunity to address her all your gold cannot bring happiness to your son at eight o clock the next evening aunt ellen took a quaint old gold ring from a moth eaten case and gave it to richard wear it to night nephew she begged your mother gave it to me good luck in love she said it brought she asked me to give it to you when you had found the one you loved young rockwall took the ring reverently and tried it on his smallest finger it slipped as far as the second joint and stopped he took it off and stuffed it into his vest pocket after the manner of man and then he phoned for his cab at the station he captured miss lantry out of the gadding mob at eight thirty two we mustn t keep mamma and the others waiting said she to wallack s theatre as fast as you can drive said richard loyally they whirled up forty second to broadway and then down the white starred lane that leads from the soft meadows of sunset to the rocky hills of morning at thirty fourth street young richard quickly thrust up the trap and ordered the cabman to stop i ve dropped a ring he apo ogised as he climbed out it was my mother s and i d hate to lose it i won t detain you a minute i saw where it fell in less than a minute he was back in the cab with the ring but within that minute a crosstown car had stopped directly in front of the cab the cabman tried to pass to the left but a heavy express wagon cut him off he tried the right and had to back away from a furniture van that had no business to be there he tried to back out but dropped his reins and swore dutifully he was blockaded in a tangled mess of vehicles and horses one of those street blockades had occurred that sometimes tie up commerce and movement quite suddenly in the big city why don t you drive on said miss lantry impatiently we ll be late richard stood up in the cab and looked around he saw a congested flood of wagons trucks cabs vans and street cars filling the vast space where broadway sixth avenue and thirly fourth street cross one another as a twenty six inch maiden fills her twenty two inch girdle and still from all the cross streets they were hurrying and rattling toward the converging point at full speed and hurling thcmselves into the struggling mass locking wheels and adding their drivers imprecations to the clamour the entire traffic of manhattan seemed to have jammed itself around them the oldest new yorker among the thousands of spectators that lined the sidewalks had not witnessed a street blockade of the proportions of this one i m very sorry said richard as he resumed his seat but it looks as if we are stuck they won t get this jumble loosened up in an hour it was my fault if i hadn t dropped the ring we let me see the ring said miss lantry now that it can t be helped i don t care i think theatres are stupid anyway at o clock that night somebody tapped lightly

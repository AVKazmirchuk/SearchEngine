mouth yes i m glad you rode out yes i m right glad well i ll be ridin back i reckon that boy i left in the feed store don t know hay from oats he shot lester in the back shot him in the back yes while he was hitchin his hoss i m much obliged jim i kind of thought you d like to know as soon as you could come in and have some coffee before you ride back jim why no i reckon not i must get back to the store and you say yes sam everybody seen em drive away together in a buckboard with a big bundle like clothes tied up in the back of it he was drivin the team he brought over with him from muscogee they ll be hard to over take right away and which i was goin on to tell you they left on the guthrie road but there s no tellin which forks they ll take you know that all right jim much obliged you re welcome sam simmons rolled a cigarette and stabbed his pony with both heels twenty yards away he reined up and called back you don t want no assistance as you might say not any thanks i didn t think you would well so long sam took out and opened a bone handled pocket knife and scraped a dried piece of mud from his left boot i thought at first he was going to swear a vendetta on the blade of it or recite the gipsy s curse the few feuds i had ever seen or read about usually opened that way this one seemed to be presented with a new treat ment thus offered on the stage it would have been hissed off and one of belasco s thrilling melodramas demanded instead i wonder said sam with a profoundly thoughtful expression if the cook has any cold beans left over he called wash the negro cook and finding that he had some ordered him to heat up the pot and make some strong coffee then we went into sam s private room where he slept and kept his armoury dogs and the sad dles of his favourite mounts he took three or four six shooters out of a bookcase and began to look them over whistling the cowboy s lament abstractedly after ward he ordered the two best horses on the ranch saddled and tied to the hitching post now in the feud business in all sections of the country i have observed that in one particular there is a delicate but strict etiquette belonging you must not mention the word or refer to the subject in the presence of a feudist it would be more reprehensible than commenting upon the mole on the chin of your rich aunt i found later on that there is another unwritten rule but i think that belongs solely to the west it yet lacked two hours to supper time but in twenty minutes sam and i were plunging deep into the reheated beans hot coffee and cold beef nothing like a good meal before a long ride said sam eat hearty i had a sudden suspicion why did you have two horses saddled i asked one two one two said sam you can count can t you his mathematics carried with it a momentary qualm and a lesson the thought had not occurred to him that the thought could possibly occur to me not to ride at his side on that red road to revenge and justice it was the higher calculus i was booked for the trail i began to eat more beans in an hour we set forth at a steady gallop eastward our horses were kentucky bred strengthened by the mesquite grass of the west ben tatum s steeds may have been swifter and he had a good lead but if he had heard the punctual thuds of the hoofs of those trailers of ours born in the heart of feudland he might have felt that retribution was creeping up on the hoof prints of his dapper nags i knew that ben tatum s card to play was flight flight until he came within the safer territory of his own henchmen and supporters he knew that the man pur suing him would follow the trail to any end where it might lead during the ride sam talked of the prospect for rain of the price of beef and of the musical glasses you would have thought he had never had a brother or a sweetheart or an enemy on earth there are some sub jects too big even for the words in the unabridged knowing this phase of the feud code but not having practised it sufficiently i overdid the thing by telling some slightly funny anecdotes sam laughed at exactly the right place laughed with his mouth when i caught sight of his mouth i wished i had been blessed with enough sense of humour to have suppressed those anecdotes our first sight of them we had in guthrie tired and hungry we stumbled unwashed into a little yellow pine hotel and sat at a table in the opposite corner we saw the fugitives they were bent upon their meal but looked around at times uneasily the girl was dressed in brown one of these smooth half shiny silky looking affairs with lace collar and cuffs and what i believe they call an accordion plaited skirt she wore a thick brown veil down to her nose and a broad brimmed straw hat with some kind of feathers adorning it the man wore plain dark clothes and his hair was trimmed very short he was such a man as you might see anywhere there they were the murderer and the woman he had stolen there we were the rightful avenger according

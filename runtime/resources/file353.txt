the owl i know replied bud using the cowpuncher s expressive phrase of skepticism but it sounds to me this conversation was held one night in camp while the other members of the band eight in number were sprawling around the fire lingering over their supper when bud and cactus ceased talking they heard piggy s formidable voice holding forth to the others as usual while he was engaged in checking though never satisfying his ravening appetite wat s de use he was saying of chasin little red cowses and hosses round for t ousands of miles dere ain t nuttin in it gallopin t rough dese bushes and briers and gettin a t irst dat a brewery couldn t put out and missin meals say you know what i d do if i was main finger of dis bunch i d stick up a train i d blow de express car and make hard dollars where you guys get wind youse makes me tired dis sook cow kind of cheap sport gives me a pain later on a deputation waited on bud they stood on one leg chewed mesquit twigs and circumlocuted for they hated to hurt his feelings bud foresaw their business and made it easy for them bigger risks and larger profits was what they wanted the suggestion of piggy s about holding up a train had fired their imagination and increased their admiration for the dash and boldness of the instigator they were such simple artless and custom bound bush rangers that they had never before thought of extending their habits beyond the running off of live stock and the shooting of such of their acquaintances as ventured to interfere bud acted on the level agreeing to take a subordinate place in the gang until black eagle should have been given a trial as leader after a great deal of consultation studying of time tables and discussion of the country s topography the time and place for carrying out their new enterprise was decided upon at that time there was a feedstuff famine in mexico and a cattle famine in certain parts of the united states and there was a brisk international trade much money was being shipped along the railroads that connected the two republics it was agreed that the most promising place for the contemplated robbery was at espina a little station on the i and g n about forty miles north of laredo the train stopped there one minute the country around was wild and unsettled the station consisted of but one house in which the agent lived black eagle s band set out riding by night arriving in the vicinity of espina they rested their horses all day in a thicket a few miles distant the train was due at espina at p m they could rob the train and be well over the mexican border with their booty by daylight the next morning to do black eagle justice he exhibited no signs of flinching from the responsible honours that had been conferred upon him he assigned his men to their respective posts with discretion and coached them carefully as to their duties on each side of the track four of the band were to lie concealed in the chaparral gotch ear rodgers was to stick up the station agent bronco charlie was to remain with the horses holding them in readiness at a spot where it was calculated the engine would be when the train stopped bud king was to lie hidden on one side and black eagle himself on the other the two would get the drop on the engineer and fireman force them to descend and proceed to the rear then the express car would be looted and the escape made no one was to move until black eagle gave the signal by firing his revolver the plan was perfect at ten minutes to train time every man was at his post effectually concealed by the thick chaparral that grew almost to the rails the night was dark and lowering with a fine drizzle falling from the flying gulf clouds black eagle crouched behind a bush within five yards of the track two six shooters were belted around him occasionally he drew a large black bottle from his pocket and raised it to his mouth a star appeared far down the track which soon waxed into the headlight of the approaching train it came on with an increasing roar the engine bore down upon the ambushing desperadoes with a glare and a shriek like some avenging monster come to deliver them to justice black eagle flattened himself upon the ground the engine contrary to their calculations instead of stopping between him and bud king s place of concealment passed fully forty years farther before it came to a stand the bandit leader rose to his feet and peered through the bush his men all lay quiet awaiting the signal immediately opposite black eagle was a thing that drew his attention instead of being a regular passenger train it was a mixed one before him stood a box car the door of which by some means had been left slightly open black eagle went up to it and pushed the door farther open an odour came forth a damp rancid familiar musty intoxicating beloved odour stirring strongly at old memories of happy days and travels black eagle sniffed at the witching smell as the returned wanderer smells of the rose that twines his boyhood s cottage home nostalgia seized him he put his hand inside excelsior dry springy curly soft enticing covered the floor outside the drizzle had turned to a chilling rain the train bell clanged the bandit chief unbuckled his belt and cast it with its revolvers upon the ground his spurs followed quickly and his broad sombrero black eagle was moulting the train started with a rattling jerk the ex terror of the border scrambled into the

you think that picture is fairer than the one you saw of colonel calhoun last night the description said the major frowning is not without grounds some exag latitude must be allowed in public speaking and in public acting replied hargraves that is not the point persisted the major unrelenting it was a personal caricature i positively decline to overlook it sir major talbot said hargraves with a winning smile i wish you would understand me i want you to know that i never dreamed of insulting you in my profession all life belongs to me i take what i want and what i can and return it over the footlights now if you will let s let it go at that i came in to see you about something else we ve been pretty good friends for some months and i m going to take the risk of offending you again i know you are hard up for money never mind how i found out a boarding house is no place to keep such matters secret and i want you to let me help you out of the pinch i ve been there often enough myself i ve been getting a fair salary all the season and i ve saved some money you re welcome to a couple hundred or even more until you get stop commanded the major with his arm outstretched it seems that my book didn t lie after all you think your money salve will heal all the hurts of honour under no circumstances would i accept a loan from a casual acquaintance and as to you sir i would starve before i would consider your insulting offer of a financial adjustment of the circumstances we have discussed i beg to repeat my request relative to your quitting the apartment hargraves took his departure without another word he also left the house the same day moving as mrs vardeman explained at the supper table nearer the vicinity of the down town theatre where a magnolia flower was booked for a week s run critical was the situation with major talbot and miss lydia there was no one in washington to whom the major s scruples allowed him to apply for a loan miss lydia wrote a letter to uncle ralph but it was doubtful whether that relative s constricted affairs would permit him to furnish help the major was forced to make an apologetic address to mrs vardeman regarding the delayed payment for board referring to delinquent rentals and delayed remittances in a rather confused strain deliverance came from an entirely unexpected source late one afternoon the door maid came up and announced an old coloured man who wanted to see major talbot the major asked that he be sent up to his study soon an old darkey appeared in the doorway with his hat in hand bowing and scraping with one clumsy foot he was quite decently dressed in a baggy suit of black his big coarse shoes shone with a metallic lustre suggestive of stove polish his bushy wool was gray almost white after middle life it is difficult to estimate the age of a negro this one might have seen as many years as had major talbot i be bound you don t know me mars pendleton were his first words the major rose and came forward at the old familiar style of address it was one of the old plantation darkeys without a doubt but they had been widely scattered and he could not recall the voice or face i don t believe i do he said kindly unless you will assist my memory don t you member cindy s mose mars pendleton what migrated mediately after de war wait a moment said the major rubbing his forehead with the tips of his fingers

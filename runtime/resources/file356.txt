his quiet way until he found out what he wanted to know from the drug store across the street from spencer s shoe store he got a good look at ralph d spencer going to marry the banker s daughter are you jimmy said ben to himself softly well i don t know the next morning jimmy took breakfast at the adamses he was going to little rock that day to order his wedding suit and buy something nice for annabel that would be the first time he had left town since he came to elmore it had been more than a year now since those last professional jobs and he thought he could safely venture out after breakfast quite a family party went downtown together mr adams annabel jimmy and annabel s married sister with her two little girls aged five and nine they came by the hotel where jimmy still boarded and he ran up to his room and brought along his suit case then they went on to the bank there stood jimmy s horse and buggy and dolph gibson who was going to drive him over to the railroad station all went inside the high carved oak railings into the banking room jimmy included for mr adams s future son in law was welcome anywhere the clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good looking agreeable young man who was going to marry miss annabel jimmy set his suit case down annabel whose heart was bubbling with happiness and lively youth put on jimmy s hat and picked up the suit case wouldn t i make a nice drummer said annabel my ralph how heavy it is feels like it was full of gold bricks lot of nickel plated shoe horns in there said jimmy coolly that i m going to return thought i d save express charges by taking them up i m getting awfully economical the elmore bank had just put in a new safe and vault mr adams was very proud of it and insisted on an inspection by every one the vault was a small one but it had a new patented door it fastened with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single handle and had a time lock mr adams beamingly explained its workings to mr spencer who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest the two children may and agatha were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs while they were thus engaged ben price sauntered in and leaned on his elbow looking casually inside between the railings he told the teller that he didn t want anything he was just waiting for a man he knew suddenly there was a scream or two from the women and a commotion unperceived by the elders may the nine year old girl in a spirit of play had shut agatha in the vault she had then shot the bolts and turned the knob of the combination as she had seen mr adams do the old banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment the door can t be opened he groaned the clock hasn t been wound nor the combination set agatha s mother screamed again hysterically hush said mr adams raising his trembling hand all be quite for a moment agatha he called as loudly as he could listen to me during the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror my precious darling wailed the mother she will die of fright open the door oh break it open can t you men do something there isn t a man nearer than little rock who can open that door said mr adams in a shaky voice my god spencer what shall we do that child she can t stand it long in there there isn t

placed it in his hand jimmy stuffed it into his vest pocket threw off his coat and pulled up his shirt sleeves with that act ralph d spencer passed away and jimmy valentine took his place get away from the door all of you he commanded shortly he set his suit case on the table and opened it out flat from that time on he seemed to be unconscious of the presence of any one else he laid out the

pet drill was biting smoothly into the steel door in ten minutes breaking his own burglarious record he threw back the bolts and opened the door agatha almost collapsed but safe was gathered into her mother s arms jimmy valentine put on his coat and walked outside the railings towards the front door as he went he thought he heard a far away voice that he once knew call ralph but he never hesitated at the door a big man stood somewhat in his way hello ben said jimmy still with his strange smile got around at last have you well let s go i don t

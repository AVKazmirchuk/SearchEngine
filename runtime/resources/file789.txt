like a war or a family feud than a fight haywood had learned some of the science of boxing and wrestling from his tutors but these he discarded for the more instinctive methods of battle handed down by the cave dwelling van plushvelts so when he found himself during the m l e seated upon the kicking and roaring smoky s chest he improved the opportunity by vigorously kneading hand fuls of sand and soil into his adversary s ears eyes and mouth and when smoky got the proper leg hold and turned him he fastened both hands in the plushvelt hair and pounded the plushvelt head against the lap of mother earth of course the strife was not incessantly active there were seasons when one sat upon the other holding him down while each blew like a grampus spat out the more inconveniently large sections of gravel and and strove to subdue the spirit of his opponent with a frightful and soul paralyzing glare at last it seemed that in the language of the ring their efforts lacked steam they broke away and each disappeared in a cloud as he brushed away the dust of the conflict as soon as his breath permitted haywood walked close to smoky and said going to play ball smoky looked pensively at the sky at his bat lying on the ground and at the leaguer rounding his pocket sure he said offhandedly the yellowjackets plays the long islands i m cap n of the long islands i guess i didn t mean to say you were ragged said haywood but you are dirty you know sure said smoky yer get that way knockin around say i don t believe them new york papers about ladies drinkin and havin monkeys dinin at the table with em i guess they re lies like they print about people eatin out of silver plates and ownin dogs that cost certainly said haywood what do you play on your team ketcher ever play any never

and yer won t be long ketchin on i d like it bully said haywood i ve alway wanted to play baseball the ladies maids of new york and the families of western mine owners with social ambitions will remember well the sensation that was created by the report that the young multi millionaire haywood van plushvelt was playing ball with the village youths of fishampton it was conceded that the millennium of democracy had come reporters and photographers swarmed to the island the papers printed half page pictures of him as short stop stopping a hot grounder the toadies magazine got out a bat and ball number that covered the subject historically beginning with the vampire bat and ending with the patriarchs ball illustrated with interior views of the van plushvelt country seat ministers educators and sociologists everywhere hailed the event as the tocsin call that proclaimed the universal brotherhood of man one afternoon i was reclining under the trees near the shore at fishampton in the esteemed company of an eminent bald headed young sociologist by way of note it may be inserted that all sociologists are more or less bald and exactly thirty two look em over the sociologist was citing the van plushvelt case as the most important uplift symptom of a generation and as an excuse for his own existence immediately before us were the village baseball grounds and now came the sportive youth of fishampton and distributed themselves shouting about the diamond there said the sociologist pointing there is young van plushvelt i raised myself so far a cosycophant with mary ann and gazed young van plushvelt sat upon the ground he was dressed in a ragged red sweater wrecked and weather worn golf cap run over shoes and trousers of the ser viceable brand dust clinging to the moisture induced by free exercise darkened wide areas of his face that is he repeated the sociologist if he had said him i could have been less vindictive on a bench with an air sat the young millionaire s chum he was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge a neat white straw hat neat low cut tan shoes linen of the well known immaculate trade mark a neat narrow four in hand tie and carried a slender neat bamboo cane i laughed loudly and vulgarly what you want to do said i to the sociologist is to establish a reformatory for the logical vicious circle or else i ve got wheels it looks to me as if things are running round and round in circles instead of getting anywhere what do you mean asked the man of progress why look what he has done to smoky i replied you will always be a fool said my friend the sociologist getting up and walking away the ransom of red chief it looked like a good thing but wait till i tell you we were down south in alabama bill driscoll and myself when this kidnapping idea struck us it was as bill afterward expressed it during a moment of temporary mental apparition but we didn t find that out till later there was a town down there as flat as a flannel cake and called summit of course it contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and self satisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a maypole bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town lot scheme in western illinois with we talked it over on the front steps of the hotel

might begin to rain saratoga trunks when the army and the constabulary began to arrive with their medals and decorations hastily pinned to their pajamas and their snickersnees drawn i crawled into the welcome shadow of a banana plant i remained there for an hour by which time the excitement and the people had cleared away and then my dear goodwin excuse me i saw you sneak back and pluck that ripe and juicy valise from the orange tree i followed you and saw you take it to your own house a hundred thousand dollar crop from one orange tree in a season about breaks the record of the fruit growing industry being a gentleman at that time of course i never mentioned the incident to any one but this morning i was kicked out of a saloon my code of honor is all out at the elbows and i d sell my mother s prayer book for three fingers of aguardiente i m not putting on the screws hard it ought to be worth a thousand to you for me to have slept on that cot through the whole business without waking up and seeing anything goodwin opened two more letters and made memoranda in pencil on them then he called manuel to his secretary who came spryly the ariel when does she sail asked goodwin senor answered the youth at three this afternoon she drops down coast to punta soledad to complete her cargo of fruit from there she sails for new orleans without delay bueno said goodwin these letters may wait yet awhile the secretary returned to his cigarette under the mango tree in round numbers said goodwin facing blythe squarely how much money do you owe in this town not including the sums you have borrowed from me five hundred at a rough guess answered blythe lightly go somewhere in the town and draw up a schedule of your debts said goodwin come back here in two hours and i will send manuel with the money to pay them i will also have a decent outfit of clothing ready for you you will sail on the ariel at three manuel will accompany you as far as the deck of the steamer there he will hand you one thousand dollars in cash i suppose that we needn t discuss what you will be expected to do in return oh i understand piped blythe cheerily i was asleep all the time on the cot under madama ortiz s orange trees and i shake off the dust of coralio forever i ll play fair no more of the lotus for me your proposition is k youre a good fellow goodwin and i let you off light i ll agree to everything but in the meantime i ve a devil of a thirst on old man not a centavo said goodwin firmly until you are on board the ariel you would be drunk in thirty minutes if you had money now but he noticed the blood streaked eyeballs the relaxed form and the shaking hands of beelzebub and he stepped into the dining room through the low window and brought out a glass and a decanter of brandy take a bracer anyway before you go he proposed even as a man to the friend whom he entertains beelzebub blythe s eyes glistened at the sight of the solace for which his soul burned today for the first time his poisoned nerves had been denied their steadying dose and their retort was a mounting torment he grasped the decanter and rattled its crystal mouth against the glass in his trembling hand he flushed the glass and then stood erect holding it aloft for an instant for one fleeting moment he held his head above the drowning waves of his abyss he nodded easily at goodwin raised his brimming glass and murmured a health that men had used in his ancient paradise lost and then so suddenly that he spilled the brandy over his hand he set down his glass untasted in two hours his dry lips muttered to goodwin as he marched down the steps and turned his face toward the town in the edge of the cool banana grove beelzebub halted and snapped the tongue of his belt buckle into another

sauce au diable that goes with it and the distillers are the chefs who prepare it and on johnny s menu card it read brandy with a bottle between them he and billy keogh would sit on the porch of the little consulate at night and roar out great indecorous songs until the natives slipping hastily past would shrug a shoulder and mutter things to themselves about the americanos diablos one day johnny s mozo brought the mail and dumped it on the table johnny leaned from his hammock and fingered the four or five letters dejectedly keogh was sitting on the edge of the table chopping lazily with a paper knife at the legs of a centipede that was crawling among the stationery johnny was in that phase of lotus eating when all the world tastes bitter in one s mouth same old thing he complained fool people writing for information about the country they want to know all about raising fruit and how to make a fortune without work half of em don t even send stamps for a reply they think a consul hasn t anything to do but write letters slit those envelopes for me old man

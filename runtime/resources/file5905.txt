and his cohorts with boyish whoops born of the snow and stress they called they pounded at window and door at the inhospitable silence they waxed restive they assaulted and forced the pregnable barriers and invaded the premises the watchers from the coach heard stumblings and shoutings from the interior of the ravaged house before long a light within flickered glowed flamed high and bright and cheerful then came running back through the driving flakes the exuberant explorers more deeply pitched than the clarion even orchestral in volume the voice of judge menefee proclaimed the succour that lay in apposition with their state of travail the one room of the house was uninhabited he said and bare of furniture but it contained a great fireplace and they had discovered an ample store of chopped wood in a lean to at the rear housing and warmth against the shivering night were thus assured for the placation of bildad rose there was news of a stable not ruined beyond service with hay in a loft near the house gentlemen cried bildad rose from his seat swathed in coats and robes tear me down two panels of that fence so i can drive in that is old man redruth s shanty i thought we must be nigh it they took him to the foolish house in august cheerfully the four passengers sprang at the snow capped rails the exhorted team tugged the coach up the slant to the door of the edifice from which a mid summer madness had ravished its proprietor the driver and two of the passengers began to unhitch judge menefee opened the door of the coach and removed his hat i have to announce miss garland said he the enforced suspension of our journey the driver asserts that the risk in travelling the mountain road by night is too great even to consider it will be necessary to remain in the shelter of this house until morning i beg that you will feel that there is nothing to fear beyond a temporary inconvenience i have personally inspected the house and find that there are means to provide against the rigour of the weather at least you shall be made as comfortable as possible permit me to assist you to alight to the judge s side came the passenger whose pursuit in life was the placing of the little goliath windmill his name was dunwoody but that matters not much in travelling merely from paradise to sunrise city one needs little or no name still one who would seek to divide honours with judge madison l menefee deserves a cognomenal peg upon which fame may hang a wreath thus spake loudly and buoyantly the aerial miller guess you ll have to climb out of the ark mrs mcfarland this wigwam isn t exactly the palmer house but it turns snow and they won t search your grip for souvenir spoons when you leave we ve got a fire going and we ll fix you up with dry tilbys and keep the mice away anyhow all right all right one of the two passengers who were struggling in a melee of horses harness snow and the sarcastic injunctions of bildad rose called loudly from the whirl of his volunteer duties say some of you fellows get miss solomon into the house will you whoa there you confounded brute again must it be gently urged that in travelling from paradise to sunrise city an accurate name is prodigality when judge menefee sanctioned to the act by his grey hair and widespread repute had introduced himself to the lady passenger she had herself sweetly breathed a name in response that the hearing of the male passengers had variously interpreted in the not unjealous spirit of rivalry that eventuated each clung stubbornly to his own theory for the lady passenger to have reasseverated or corrected would have seemed didactic if not unduly solicitous of a specific acquaintance therefore the lady passenger permitted herself to be garlanded and mcfarlanded and solomoned with equal and discreet complacency it is thirty five miles from paradise to sunrise city compagnon de voyage is name enough by the gripsack of the wandering jew for so brief a journey soon the little party of wayfarers were happily seated in a cheerful arc before the roaring fire the robes cushions and removable portions of the coach had been brought in and put to service the lady passenger chose a place near the hearth at one end of the arc there she graced almost a throne that her subjects had prepared she sat upon cushions and leaned against an empty box and barrel robe bespread which formed a defence from the invading draughts she extended her feet delectably shod to the cordial heat she ungloved her hands but retained about her neck her long fur boa the unstable flames half revealed while the warding boa half submerged her face a youthful face altogether feminine clearly moulded and calm with beauty s unchallenged confidence chivalry and manhood were here vying to please and comfort her she seemed to accept their devoirs not piquantly as one courted and attended nor preeningly as many of her sex unworthily reap their honours not yet stolidly as the ox receives his hay but concordantly with nature s own plan as the lily ingests the drop of dew foreordained to its refreshment outside the wind roared mightily the fine snow whizzed through the cracks the cold besieged the backs of the immolated six but the elements did not lack a champion that night judge menefee was attorney for the storm the weather was his client and he strove by special pleading to convince his companions in that frigid jury box that they sojourned in a bower of roses beset only by benignant zephyrs he drew upon a fund of gaiety wit and anecdote sophistical but crowned with success his cheerfulness communicated itself irresistibly each one hastened to contribute his own quota toward the general optimism even the lady passenger was moved to expression i think it is quite charming she said in her slow crystal tones at intervals some one of the passengers would rise and humorously explore the room there was little evidence to be collected of its habitation by old man redruth bildad rose was called upon vivaciously for the ex hermit s history now since the stage driver s horses were fairly comfortable and his passengers appeared to be so peace and comity returned to him the old didapper began bildad somewhat irreverently infested this here house about twenty year he never allowed nobody to come nigh him he d duck his head inside and slam the door whenever a team drove along there was spinning wheels up in his loft all right he used to buy his groceries and tobacco at sam tilly s store on the little muddy last august he went up there dressed in a red bedquilt and told sam he was king solomon and that the queen of sheba was coming to visit him he fetched along all the money he had a little bag full of silver and dropped it in sam s well she won t come says old man redruth to sam if she knows i ve got any money as soon as folks heard he had that sort of a theory about women and money they knowed he was crazy so they sent down and packed him to the foolish asylum was there a romance in his life that drove him to a solitary existence asked one of the passengers a young man who had an agency no said bildad not that i ever heard spoke of just ordinary trouble they say he had had unfortunateness in the way of love derangements with a young lady when he was young before he contracted red bed quilts and had his financial conclusions disqualified i never heard of no romance ah exclaimed judge menefee impressively a case of unrequited affection no doubt no sir returned bildad not at all she never married him marmaduke mulligan down at paradise seen a man once that come from old redruth s town he said redruth was a fine young man but when you kicked him on the pocket all you could hear jingle was a cuff fastener and a bunch of keys he was engaged to this young lady miss alice something was her name i ve forgot this man said she was the kind of girl you like to have reach across you in a car to pay the fare well there come to the town a young chap all affluent and easy and fixed up with buggies and mining stock and leisure time although she was a staked claim miss alice and the new entry seemed to strike a mutual kind of a clip they had calls and coincidences of going to the post office and such things as sometimes make a girl send back the engagement ring and other presents a rift within the loot the poetry man calls it one day folks seen redruth and miss alice standing talking at the gate then he lifts his hat and walks away and that was the last anybody in that town seen of him as far as this man knew what about the young lady asked the young man who had an agency never heard answered bildad right there is where my lode of information turns to an old spavined crowbait and folds its wings for i ve pumped it dry a very sad began judge menefee but his remark was curtailed by a higher authority what a charming story said the lady passenger in flute like tones a little silence followed except for the wind and the crackling of the fire the men were seated upon the floor having slightly mitigated its inhospitable surface with wraps and stray pieces of boards the man who was placing little goliath windmills arose and walked about to ease his cramped muscles suddenly a triumphant shout came from him he hurried back from a dusky corner of the room bearing aloft something in his hand it was an apple a large red mottled firm pippin pleasing to behold in a paper bag on a high shelf in that corner he had found it it could have been no relic of the lovewrecked redruth for its glorious soundness repudiated the theory that it had lain on that musty shelf since august no doubt some recent bivouackers lunching in the deserted house had left it there dunwoody again his exploits demand for him the honours of nomenclature flaunted his apple in the faces of his fellow marooners see what i found mrs mcfarland he cried vaingloriously he held the apple high up in the light of the fire where it glowed a still richer red the lady passenger smiled calmly always calmly what a charming apple she murmured clearly for a brief space judge menefee felt crushed humiliated relegated second place galled him why had this blatant obtrusive unpolished man of windmills been selected by fate instead of himself to discover the sensational apple he could have made of the act a scene a function a setting for some impromptu fanciful discourse or piece of comedy and have retained the role of cynosure actually the lady passenger was regarding this ridiculous dunboddy or woodbundy with an admiring smile as if the fellow had performed a feat and the windmill man swelled and gyrated like a sample of his own goods puffed up with the wind that ever blows from the chorus land toward the domain of the star while the transported dunwoody with his aladdin s apple was receiving the fickle attentions of all the resourceful jurist formed a plan to recover his own laurels with his courtliest smile upon his heavy but classic features judge menefee advanced and took the apple as if to examine it from the hand of dunwoody in his hand it became exhibit a a fine apple he said approvingly really my dear mr dudwindy you have eclipsed all of us as a forager but i have an idea this apple shall become an emblem a token a symbol a prize bestowed by the mind and heart of beauty upon the most deserving the audience except one applauded good on the stump ain t he commented the passenger who was nobody in particular to the young man who had an agency the unresponsive one was the windmill man he saw himself reduced to the ranks never would the thought have occurred to him to declare his apple an emblem he had intended after it had been divided and eaten to create diversion by sticking the seeds against his forehead and naming them for young ladies of his acquaintance one he was going to name mrs mcfarland the seed that fell off first would be but twas too late now the apple continued judge menefee charging his jury in modern days occupies though undeservedly a lowly place in our esteem indeed it is so constantly associated with the culinary and the commercial that it is hardly to be classed among the polite fruits but in ancient times this was not so biblical historical and mythological lore abounds with evidences that the apple was the aristocrat of fruits we still say the apple of the eye when we wish to describe something superlatively precious we find in proverbs the comparison to apples of silver no other product of tree or vine has been so utilised in figurative speech who has not heard of and longed for the apples of the hesperides i need not call your attention to the most tremendous and significant instance of the apple s ancient prestige when its consumption by our first parents occasioned the fall of man from his state of goodness and perfection apples like them said the windmill man lingering with the objective article are worth a barrel in the chicago market now what i have to propose said judge menefee conceding an indulgent smile to his interrupter is this we must remain here perforce until morning we have wood in plenty to keep us warm our next need is to entertain ourselves as best we can in order that the time shall not pass too slowly i propose that we place this apple in the hands of miss garland it is no longer a fruit but as i said a prize in award representing a great human idea miss garland herself shall cease to be an individual but only temporarily i am happy to add a low bow full of the old time grace she shall represent her sex she shall be the embodiment the epitome of womankind the heart and brain i may say of god s masterpiece of creation in this guise she shall judge and decide the question which follows but a few minutes ago our friend mr rose favoured us with an entertaining but fragmentary sketch of the romance in the life of the former professor of this habitation the few facts that we have learned seem to me to open up a fascinating field for conjecture for the study of human hearts for the exercise of the imagination in short for story telling let us make use of the opportunity let each one of us relate his own version of the story of redruth the hermit and his lady love beginning where mr rose s narrative ends at the parting of the lovers at the gate this much should be assumed and conceded that the young lady was not necessarily to blame for redruth s becoming a crazed and world hating hermit when we have done miss garland shall render the judgement of woman as the spirit of her sex she shall decide which version of the story best and most truly depicts human and love interest and most faithfully estimates the character and acts of redruth s betrothed according to the feminine view the apple shall be bestowed upon him who is awarded the decision if you are all agreed we shall be pleased to hear the first story from mr dinwiddie the last sentence captured the windmill man he was not one to linger in the dumps that s a first rate scheme judge he said heartily be a regular short story vaudeville won t it i used to be correspondent for a paper in springfield and when there wasn t any news i faked it guess i can do my turn all right i think the idea is charming said the lady passenger brightly it will be almost like a game judge menefee stepped forward and placed the apple in her hand impressively in olden days he said orotundly paris awarded the golden apple to the most beautiful i was at the exposition remarked the windmill man now cheerful again but i never heard of it and i was on the midway too all the time i wasn t at the machinery exhibit but now continued the judge the fruit shall translate to us the mystery and wisdom of the feminine heart take the apple miss garland hear our modest tales of romance and then award the prize as you may deem it just the lady passenger smiled sweetly the apple lay in her lap beneath her robes and wraps she reclined against her protecting bulwark brightly and cosily at ease but for the voices and the wind one might have listened hopefully to hear her purr someone cast fresh logs upon the fire judge menefee nodded suavely will you oblige us with the initial story he asked the windmill man sat as sits a turk with his hat well back on his head on account of the draughts well he began without any embarrassment this is about the way i size up the difficulty of course redruth was jostled a good deal by this duck who had money to play ball with who tried to cut him out of his girl so he goes around naturally and asks her if the game is still square well nobody wants a guy cutting in with buggies and gold bonds when he s got an option on a girl well he goes around to see her well maybe he s hot and talks like the proprietor and forgets that an engagement ain t always a lead pipe cinch well i guess that makes alice warm under the lacy yoke well she answers back sharp well he say interrupted the passenger who was nobody in particular if you could put up a windmill on every one of them wells you re using you d be able to retire from business wouldn t you the windmill man grinned good naturedly oh i ain t no guy de mopassong he said cheerfully i m giving it to you in straight american well she says something like this mr gold bonds is only a friend says she but he takes me riding and buys me theatre tickets and that s what you never do ain t i to never have any pleasure in life while i can pass this chatfield chatfield thing along says redruth hand out the mitt to the willie with creases in it or you don t put your slippers under my wardrobe now that kind of train orders don t go with a girl that s got any spirit i bet that girl loved her honey all the time maybe she only wanted as girls do to work the good thing for a little fun and caramels before she settled down to patch george s other pair and be a good wife but he is glued to the high horse and won t come down well she hands him back the ring proper enough and george goes away and hits the booze yep that s what done it i bet that girl fired the cornucopia with the fancy vest two days after her steady left george boards a freight and checks his bag of crackers for parts unknown he sticks to old booze for a number of years and then the aniline and aquafortis gets the decision me for the hermit s hut says george and the long whiskers and the buried can of money that isn t there but that alice in my mind was on the level she never married but took up typewriting as soon as the wrinkles began to show and kept a cat that came when you said weeny weeny weeny i got too much faith in good women to believe they throw down the fellow they re stuck on every time for the dough the windmill man ceased i think said the lady passenger slightly moving upon her lowly throne that that is a char oh miss garland interposed judge menefee with uplifted hand i beg of you no comments it would not be fair to the other contestants mr er will you take the next turn the judge addressed the young man who had the agency my version of the romance began the young man diffidently clasping his hands would be this they did not quarrel when they parted mr redruth bade her good by and went out into the world to seek his fortune he knew his love would remain true to him he scorned the thought that his rival could make an impression upon a heart so fond and faithful i would say that mr redruth went out to the rocky mountains in wyoming to seek for gold one day a crew of pirates landed and captured him while at work and hey what s that sharply called the passenger who was nobody in particular a crew of pirates landed in the rocky mountains will you tell us how they sailed landed from a train said the narrator quietly and not without some readiness they kept him prisoner in a cave for months and then they took him hundreds of miles away to the forests of alaska there a beautiful indian girl fell in love with him but he remained true to alice after another year of wandering in the woods he set out with the diamonds what diamonds asked the unimportant passenger almost with acerbity the ones the saddlemaker showed him in the peruvian temple said the other somewhat obscurely when he reached home alice s mother led him weeping to a green mound under a willow tree her heart was broken when you left said her mother and what of my rival of chester mcintosh asked mr redruth as he knelt sadly by alice s grave when he found out she answered that her heart was yours he pined away day by day until at length he started a furniture store in grand rapids we heard lately that he was bitten to death by an infuriated moose near south bend ind where he had gone to try to forget scenes of civilisation with which mr redruth forsook the face of mankind and became a hermit as we have seen my story concluded the young man with an agency may lack the literary quality but what i wanted it to show is that the young lady remained true she cared nothing for wealth in comparison with true affection i admire and believe in the fair sex too much to think otherwise the narrator ceased with a sidelong glance at the corner where reclined the lady passenger bildad rose was next invited by judge menefee to contribute his story in the contest for the apple of judgment the stage driver s essay was brief i m not one of them lobo wolves he said who are always blaming on women the calamities of life my testimony in regards to the fiction story you ask for judge will be about as follows what ailed redruth was pure laziness if he had up and slugged this percival de lacey that tried to give him the outside of the road and had kept alice in the grape vine swing with the blind bridle on all would have been well the woman you want is sure worth taking pains for send for me if you want me again says redruth and hoists his stetson and walks off he d have called it pride but the nixycomlogical name for it is laziness no woman don t like to run after a man let him come back hisself says the girl and i ll be bound she tells the boy with the pay ore to trot and then spends her time watching out the window for the man with the empty pocket book and the tickly moustache i reckon redruth waits about nine year expecting her to send him a note by a nigger asking him to forgive her but she don t this game won t work says redruth then so won t i and he goes in the hermit business and raises whiskers yes laziness and whiskers was what done the trick they travel together you ever hear of a man with long whiskers and hair striking a bonanza no look at the duke of marlborough and this standard oil snoozer have they got em now this alice didn t never marry i ll bet a hoss if redruth had married somebody else she might have done so too but he never turns up she has these here things they call fond memories and maybe a lock of hair and a corset steel that he broke treasured up them sort of articles is as good as a husband to some women i d say she played out a lone hand i don t blame no woman for old man redruth s abandonment of barber shops and clean shirts next in order came the passenger who was nobody in particular nameless to us he travels the road from paradise to sunrise city but him you shall see if the firelight be not too dim as he responds to the judge s call a lean form in rusty brown clothing sitting like a frog his arms wrapped about his legs his chin resting upon his knees smooth oakum coloured hair long nose mouth like a satyr s with upturned tobacco stained corners an eye like a fish s a red necktie with a horseshoe pin he began with a rasping chuckle that gradually formed itself into words everybody wrong so far what a romance without any orange blossoms ho ho my money on the lad with the butterfly tie and the certified checks in his trouserings take em as they parted at the gate all right you never loved me says redruth wildly or you wouldn t speak to a man who can buy you the ice cream i hate him says she i loathe his side bar buggy i despise the elegant cream bonbons he sends me in gilt boxes covered with real lace i feel that i could stab him to the heart when he presents me with a solid medallion locket with turquoises and pearls running in a vine around the border away with him tis only you i love back to the cosey corner says redruth was i bound and lettered in east aurora get platonic if you please no jack pots for mine go and hate your friend some more for me the nickerson girl on avenue b and gum and a trolley ride around that night comes john w croesus what tears says he arranging his pearl pin you have driven my lover away says little alice sobbing i hate the sight of you marry me then says john w lighting a henry clay what she cries indignantly marry you never she says until this blows over and i can do some shopping and you see about the licence there s a telephone next door if you want to call up the county clerk the narrator paused to give vent to his cynical chuckle did they marry he continued did the duck swallow the june bug and then i take up the case of old boy redruth there s where you are all wrong again according to my theory what turned him into a hermit one says laziness one says remorse one says booze i say women did it how old is the old man now asked the speaker turning to bildad rose i should say about sixty five all right he conducted his hermit shop here for twenty years say he was twenty five when he took off his hat at the gate that leaves twenty years for him to account for or else be docked where did he spend that ten and two fives i ll give you my idea up for bigamy say there was the fat blonde in saint jo and the panatela brunette at skillet ridge and the gold tooth down in the kaw valley redruth gets his cases mixed and they send him up the road he gets out after they are through with him and says any line for me except the crinoline the hermit trade is not overdone and the stenographers never apply to em for work the jolly hermit s life for me no more long hairs in the comb or dill pickles lying around in the cigar tray you tell me they pinched old redruth for the noodle villa just because he said he was king solomon figs he was solomon that s all of mine i guess it don t call for any apples enclosed find stamps it don t sound much like a prize winner respecting the stricture laid by judge menefee against comments upon the stories all were silent when the passenger who was nobody in particular had concluded and then the ingenious originator of the contest cleared his throat to begin the ultimate entry for the prize though seated with small comfort upon the floor you might search in vain for any abatement of dignity in judge menefee the now diminishing firelight played softly upon his face as clearly chiselled as a roman emperor s on some old coin and upon the thick waves of his honourable grey hair a woman s heart he began in even but thrilling tones who can hope to fathom it the ways and desires of men are various i think that the hearts of all women beat with the same rhythm and to the same old tune of love love to a woman means sacrifice if she be worthy of the name no gold or rank will outweigh with her a genuine devotion gentlemen of the er i should say my friends the case of redruth versus love and affection has been called yet who is on trial not redruth for he has been punished not those immortal passions that clothe our lives with the joy of the angels then who each man of us here to night stands at the bar to answer if chivalry or darkness inhabits his bosom to judge us sits womankind in the form of one of its fairest flowers in her hand she holds the prize intrinsically insignificant but worthy of our noblest efforts to win as a guerdon of approval from so worthy a representative of feminine judgment and taste in taking up the imaginary history of redruth and the fair being to whom he gave his heart i must in the beginning raise my voice against the unworthy insinuation that the selfishness or perfidy or love of luxury of any woman drove him to renounce the world i have not found woman to be so unspiritual or venal we must seek elsewhere among man s baser nature and lower motives for the cause there was in all probability a lover s quarrel as they stood at the gate on that memorable day tormented by jealousy young redruth vanished from his native haunts but had he just cause to do so there is no evidence for or against but there is something higher than evidence there is the grand eternal belief in woman s goodness in her steadfastness against temptation in her loyalty even in the face of proffered riches i picture to myself the rash lover wandering self tortured about the world i picture his gradual descent and finally his complete despair when he realises that he has lost the most precious gift life had to offer him then his withdrawal from the world of sorrow and the subsequent derangement of his faculties becomes intelligible but what do i see on the other hand a lonely woman fading away as the years roll by still faithful still waiting still watching for a form and listening for a step that will come no more she is old now her hair is white and smoothly banded each day she sits at the door and gazes longingly down the dusty road in spirit she is waiting there at the gate just as he left her his forever but not here below yes my belief in woman paints that picture in my mind parted forever on earth but waiting she in anticipation of a meeting in elysium he in the slough of despond i thought he was in the bughouse said the passenger who was nobody in particular judge menefee stirred a little impatiently the men sat drooping in grotesque attitudes the wind had abated its violence coming now in fitful virulent puffs the fire had burned to a mass of red coals which shed but a dim light within the room the lady passenger in her cosey nook looked to be but a formless dark bulk crowned by a mass of coiled sleek hair and showing but a small space of snowy forehead above her clinging boa judge menefee got stiffly to his feet and now miss garland he announced we have concluded it is for you to award the prize to the one of us whose argument especially i may say in regard to his estimate of true womanhood approaches nearest to your own conception no answer came from the lady passenger judge menefee bent over solicitously the passenger who was nobody in particular laughed low and harshly the lady was sleeping sweetly the judge essayed to take her hand to awaken her in doing so he touched a small cold round irregular something in her lap she has eaten the apple announced judge menefee in awed tones as he held up the core for them to see the missing chord i stopped overnight at the sheep ranch of rush kinney on the sandy fork of the nueces mr kinney and i had been strangers up to the time when i called hallo at his hitching rack but from that moment until my departure on the next morning we were according to the texas code undeniable friends after supper the ranchman and i lugged our chairs outside the two room house to its floorless gallery roofed with chaparral and sacuista grass with the rear legs of our chairs sinking deep into the hardpacked loam each of us reposed against an elm pillar of the structure and smoked el toro tobacco while we wrangled amicably concerning the affairs of the rest of the world as for conveying adequate conception of the engaging charm of that prairie evening despair waits upon it it is a bold chronicler who will undertake the description of a texas night in the early spring an inventory must suffice the ranch rested upon the summit of a lenient slope the ambient prairie diversified by arroyos and murky patches of brush and pear lay around us like a darkened bowl at the bottom of which we reposed as dregs like a turquoise cover the sky pinned us there the miraculous air heady with ozone and made memorably sweet by leagues of wild flowerets gave tang and savour to the breath in the sky was a great round mellow searchlight which we knew to be no moon but the dark lantern of summer who came to hunt northward the cowering spring in the nearest corral a flock of sheep lay silent until a groundless panic would send a squad of them huddling together with a drumming rush for other sounds a shrill family of coyotes yapped beyond the shearing pen and whippoorwills twittered in the long grass but even these dissonances hardly rippled the clear torrent of the mocking birds notes that fell from a dozen neighbouring shrubs and trees it would not have been preposterous for one to tiptoe and essay to touch the stars they hung so bright and imminent mr kinney s wife a young and capable woman we had left in the house she remained to busy herself with the domestic round of duties in which i had observed that she seemed to take a buoyant and contented pride in one room we had supped presently from the other as kinney and i sat without there burst a volume of sudden and brilliant music if i could justly estimate the art of piano playing the construer of that rollicking fantasia had creditably mastered the secrets of the keyboard a piano and one so well played seemed to me to be an unusual thing to find in that small and unpromising ranch house i must have looked my surprise at rush kinney for he laughed in his soft southern way and nodded at me through the moonlit haze of our cigarettes you don t often hear as agreeable a noise as that on a sheep ranch he remarked but i never see any reason for not playing up to the arts and graces just because we happen to live out in the brush it s a lonesome life for a woman and if a little music can make it any better why not have it that s the way i look at it a wise and generous theory i assented and mrs kinney plays well i am not learned in the science of music but i should call her an uncommonly good performer she has technic and more than ordinary power the moon was very bright you will understand and i saw upon kinney s face a sort of amused and pregnant expression as though there were things behind it that might be expounded you came up the trail from the double elm fork he said promisingly as you crossed it you must have seen an old deserted jacal to your left under a comma mott i did said i there was a drove of javalis rooting around it i could see by the broken corrals that no one lived there that s where this music proposition started said kinney i don t mind telling you about it while we smoke that s where old cal adams lived he had about eight hundred graded merinos and a daughter that was solid silk and as handsome as a new stake rope on a thirty dollar pony and i don t mind telling you that i was guilty in the second degree of hanging around old cal s ranch all the time i could spare away from lambing and shearing miss marilla was her name and i had figured it out by the rule of two that she was destined to become the chatelaine and lady superior of rancho lomito belonging to r kinney esq where you are now a welcome and honoured guest i will say that old cal wasn t distinguished as a sheepman he was a little old stoop shouldered hombre about as big as a gun scabbard with scraggy white whiskers and condemned to the continuous use of language old cal was so obscure in his chosen profession that he wasn t even hated by the cowmen and when a sheepman don t get eminent enough to acquire the hostility of the cattlemen he is mighty apt to die unwept and considerably unsung but that marilla girl was a benefit to the eye and she was the most elegant kind of a housekeeper i was the nearest neighbour and i used to ride over to the double elm anywhere from nine to sixteen times a week with fresh butter or a quarter of venison or a sample of new sheep dip just as a frivolous excuse to see marilla marilla and me got to be extensively inveigled with each other and i was pretty sure i was going to get my rope around her neck and lead her over to the lomito only she was so everlastingly permeated with filial sentiments toward old cal that i never could get her to talk about serious matters you never saw anybody in your life that was as full of knowledge and had less sense than old cal he was advised about all the branches of information contained in learning and he was up to all the rudiments of doctrines and enlightenment you couldn t advance him any ideas on any of the parts of speech or lines of thought you would have thought he was a professor of the weather and politics and chemistry and natural history and the origin of derivations any subject you brought up old cal could give you an abundant synopsis of it from the greek root up to the time it was sacked and on the market one day just after the fall shearing i rides over to the double elm with a lady s magazine about fashions for marilla and a scientific paper for old cal while i was tying my pony to a mesquite out runs marilla tickled to death with some news that couldn t wait oh rush she says all flushed up with esteem and gratification what do you think dad s going to buy me a piano ain t it grand i never dreamed i d ever have one it s sure joyful says i i always admired the agreeable uproar of a piano it ll be lots of company for you that s mighty good of uncle cal to do that i m all undecided says marilla between a piano and an organ a parlour organ is nice either of em says i is first class for mitigating the lack of noise around a sheep ranch for my part i says i shouldn t like anything better than to ride home of an evening and listen to a few waltzes and jigs with somebody about your size sitting on the piano stool and rounding up the notes oh hush about that says marilla and go on in the house dad hasn t rode out to day he s not feeling well old cal was inside lying on a cot he had a pretty bad cold and cough i stayed to supper going to get marilla a piano i hear says i to him why yes something of the kind rush says he she s been hankering for music for a long spell and i allow to fix her up with something in that line right away the sheep sheared six pounds all round this fall and i m going to get marilla an instrument if it takes the price of the whole clip to do it star wayno says i the little girl deserves it i m going to san antone on the last load of wool says uncle cal and select an instrument for her myself wouldn t it be better i suggests to take marilla along and let her pick out one that she likes i might have known that would set uncle cal going of course a man like him that knew everything about everything would look at that as a reflection on his attainments no sir it wouldn t says he pulling at his white whiskers there ain t a better judge of musical instruments in the whole world than what i am i had an uncle says he that was a partner in a piano factory and i ve seen thousands of em put together i know all about musical instruments from a pipe organ to a corn stalk fiddle there ain t a man lives sir that can tell me any news about any instrument that has to be pounded blowed scraped grinded picked or wound with a key you get me what you like dad says marilla who couldn t keep her feet on the floor from joy of course you know what to select i d just as lief it was a piano or a organ or what i see in st louis once what they call a orchestrion says uncle cal that i judged was about the finest thing in the way of music ever invented but there ain t room in this house for one anyway i imagine they d cost a thousand dollars i reckon something in the piano line would suit marilla the best she took lessons in that respect for two years over at birdstail i wouldn t trust the buying of an instrument to anybody else but myself i reckon if i hadn t took up sheep raising i d have been one of the finest composers or piano and organ manufacturers in the world that was uncle cal s style but i never lost any patience with him on account of his thinking so much of marilla and she thought just as much of him he sent her to the academy over at birdstail for two years when it took nearly every pound of wool to pay the expenses along about tuesday uncle cal put out for san antone on the last wagonload of wool marilla s uncle ben who lived in birdstail come over and stayed at the ranch while uncle cal was gone it was ninety miles to san antone and forty to the nearest railroad station so uncle cal was gone about four days i was over at the double elm when he came rolling back one evening about sundown and up there in the wagon sure enough was a piano or a organ we couldn t tell which all wrapped up in woolsacks with a wagon sheet tied over it in case of rain and out skips marilla hollering oh oh with her eyes shining and her hair a flying dad dad she sings out have you brought it have you brought it and it right there before her eyes as women will do finest piano in san antone says uncle cal waving his hand proud genuine rosewood and the finest loudest tone you ever listened to i heard the storekeeper play it and i took it on the spot and paid cash down me and ben and uncle cal and a mexican lifted it out of the wagon and carried it in the house and set it in a corner it was one of them upright instruments and not very heavy or very big and then all of a sudden uncle cal flops over and says he s mighty sick he s got a high fever and he complains of his lungs he gets into bed while me and ben goes out to unhitch and put the horses in the pasture and marilla flies around to get uncle cal something hot to drink but first she puts both arms on that piano and hugs it with a soft kind of a smile like you see kids doing with their christmas toys when i came in from the pasture marilla was in the room where the piano was i could see by the strings and woolsacks on the floor that she had had it unwrapped but now she was tying the wagon sheet over it again and there was a kind of solemn whitish look on her face ain t wrapping up the music again are you marilla i asks what s the matter with just a couple of tunes for to see how she goes under the saddle not to night rush says she i don t want to play any to night dad s too sick just think rush he paid three hundred dollars for it nearly a third of what the wool clip brought well it ain t anyways in the neighbourhood of a third of what you are worth i told her and i don t think uncle cal is too sick to hear a little agitation of the piano keys just to christen the machine not to night rush says marilla in a way that she had when she wanted to settle things but it seems that uncle cal was plenty sick after all he got so bad that ben saddled up and rode over to birdstail for doc simpson i stayed around to see if i d be needed for anything when uncle cal s pain let up on him a little he called marilla and says to her did you look at your instrument honey and do you like it it s lovely dad says she leaning down by his pillow i never saw one so pretty how dear and good it was of you to buy it for me i haven t heard you play on it any yet says uncle cal and i ve been listening my side don t hurt quite so bad now won t you play a piece marilla but no she puts uncle cal off and soothes him down like you ve seen women do with a kid it seems she s made up her mind not to touch that piano at present when doc simpson comes over he tells us that uncle cal has pneumonia the worst kind and as the old man was past sixty and nearly on the lift anyhow the odds was against his walking on grass any more on the fourth day of his sickness he calls for marilla again and wants to talk piano doc simpson was there and so was ben and mrs ben trying to do all they could i d have made a wonderful success in anything connected with music says uncle cal i got the finest instrument for the money in san antone ain t that piano all right in every respect marilla it s just perfect dad says she it s got the finest tone i ever heard but don t you think you could sleep a little while now dad no i don t says uncle cal i want to hear that piano i don t believe you ve even tried it yet i went all the way to san antone and picked it out for you myself it took a third of the fall clip to buy it but i don t mind that if it makes my good girl happier won t you play a little bit for dad marilla doc simpson beckoned marilla to one side and recommended her to do what uncle cal wanted so it would get him quieted and her uncle ben and his wife asked her too why not hit out a tune or two with the soft pedal on i asks marilla uncle cal has begged you so often it would please him a good deal to hear you touch up the piano he s bought for you don t you think you might but marilla stands there with big tears rolling down from her eyes and says nothing and then she runs over and slips her arm under uncle cal s neck and hugs him tight why last night dad we heard her say i played it ever so much honest i have been playing it and it s such a splendid instrument you don t know how i love it last night i played bonnie dundee and the anvil polka and the blue danube and lots of pieces you must surely have heard me playing a little didn t you dad i didn t like to play loud when you was so sick well well says uncle cal maybe i did maybe i did and forgot about it my head is a little cranky at times i heard the man in the store play it fine i m mighty glad you like it marilla yes i believe i could go to sleep a while if you ll stay right beside me till i do there was where marilla had me guessing much as she thought of that old man she wouldn t strike a note on that piano that he d bought her i couldn t imagine why she told him she d been playing it for the wagon sheet hadn t ever been off of it since she put it back on the same day it come i knew she could play a little anyhow for i d once heard her snatch some pretty fair dance music out of an old piano at the charco largo ranch well in about a week the pneumonia got the best of uncle cal they had the funeral over at birdstail and all of us went over i brought marilla back home in my buckboard her uncle ben and his wife were going to stay there a few days with her that night marilla takes me in the room where the piano was while the others were out on the gallery come here rush says she i want you to see this now she unties the rope and drags off the wagon sheet if you ever rode a saddle without a horse or fired off a gun that wasn t loaded or took a drink out of an empty bottle why then you might have been able to scare an opera or two out of the instrument uncle cal had bought instead of a piano it was one of the machines they ve invented to play the piano with by itself it was about as musical as the holes of a flute without the flute and that was the piano that uncle cal had selected and standing by it was the good fine all wool girl that never let him know it and what you heard playing a while ago concluded mr kinney was that same deputy piano machine only just at present it s shoved up against a six hundred dollar piano that i bought for marilla as soon as we was married a call loan in those days the cattlemen were the anointed they were the grandees of the grass kings of the kine lords of the lea barons of beef and bone they might have ridden in golden chariots had their tastes so inclined the cattleman was caught in a stampede of dollars it seemed to him that he had more money than was decent but when he had bought a watch with precious stones set in the case so large that they hurt his ribs and a california saddle with silver nails and angora skin suaderos and ordered everybody up to the bar for whisky what else was there for him to spend money for not so circumscribed in expedient for the reduction of surplus wealth were those lairds of the lariat who had womenfolk to their name in the breast of the rib sprung sex the genius of purse lightening may slumber through years of inopportunity but never my brothers does it become extinct so out of the chaparral came long bill longley from the bar circle branch on the frio a wife driven man to taste the urban joys of success something like half a million dollars he had with an income steadily increasing long bill was a graduate of the camp and trail luck and thrift a cool head and a telescopic eye for mavericks had raised him from cowboy to be a cowman then came the boom in cattle and fortune stepping gingerly among the cactus thorns came and emptied her cornucopia at the doorstep of the ranch in the little frontier city of chaparosa longley built a costly residence here he became a captive bound to the chariot of social existence he was doomed to become a leading citizen he struggled for a time like a mustang in his first corral and then he hung up his quirt and spurs time hung heavily on his hands he organised the first national bank of chaparosa and was elected its president one day a dyspeptic man wearing double magnifying glasses inserted an official looking card between the bars of the cashier s window of the first national bank five minutes later the bank force was dancing at the beck and call of a national bank examiner this examiner mr j edgar todd proved to be a thorough one at the end of it all the examiner put on his hat and called the president mr william r longley into the private office well how do you find things asked longley in his slow deep tones any brands in the round up you didn t like the looks of the bank checks up all right mr longley said todd and i find your loans in very good shape with one exception you are carrying one very bad bit of paper one that is so bad that i have been thinking that you surely do not realise the serious position it places you in i refer to a call loan of made to thomas merwin not only is the amount in excess of the maximum sum the bank can loan any individual legally but it is absolutely without endorsement or security thus you have doubly violated the national banking laws and have laid yourself open to criminal prosecution by the government a report of the matter to the comptroller of the currency which i am bound to make would i am sure result in the matter being turned over to the department of justice for action you see what a serious thing it is bill longley was leaning his lengthy slowly moving frame back in his swivel chair his hands were clasped behind his head and he turned a little to look the examiner in the face the examiner was surprised to see a smile creep about the rugged mouth of the banker and a kindly twinkle in his light blue eyes if he saw the seriousness of the affair it did not show in his countenance of course you don t know tom merwin said longley almost genially yes i know about that loan it hasn t any security except tom merwin s word somehow i ve always found that when a man s word is good it s the best security there is oh yes i know the government doesn t think so i guess i ll see tom about that note mr todd s dyspepsia seemed to grow suddenly worse he looked at the chaparral banker through his double magnifying glasses in amazement you see said longley easily explaining the thing away tom heard of head of two year olds down near rocky ford on the rio grande that could be had for a head i reckon twas one of old leandro garcia s outfits that he had smuggled over and he wanted to make a quick turn on em those cattle are worth on the hoof in kansas city tom knew it and i knew it he had and i let him have the to make the deal with his brother ed took em on to market three weeks ago he ought to be back most any day now with the money when he comes tom ll pay that note the bank examiner was shocked it was perhaps his duty to step out to the telegraph office

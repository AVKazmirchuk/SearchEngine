come said the painter man i took three different kinds of medicine before dinner by the tablespoonful the taste still lingers i am primed for telling the truth you want to know if the picture is or if it isn t right said lonny is it wool or cotton should i paint some more or cut it out and ride herd a plenty i heard a rumour during pie said the artist that the state is about to pay you two thousand dollars for this picture it s passed the senate said lonny and the house rounds it up to morrow that s lucky said the pale man do you carry a rabbit s foot no said lonny but it seems i had a grandfather he s considerable mixed up in the colour scheme it took me a year to paint that picture is she entirely awful or not some says now that the steer s tail ain t badly drawed they think it s proportioned nice tell me the artist glanced at lonny s wiry figure and nut brown skin something stirred him to a passing irritation for art s sake son he said fractiously don t spend any more money for paint it isn t a picture at all it s a gun you hold up the state with it if you like and get your two thousand but don t get in front of any more canvas live under it buy a couple of hundred ponies with the money i m told they re that cheap and ride ride ride fill your lungs and eat and sleep and be happy no more pictures you look healthy that s genius cultivate it he looked at his watch twenty minutes to three four capsules and one tablet at three that s all you wanted to know isn t it at three o clock the cowpunchers rode up for lonny bringing hot tamales saddled traditions must be observed to celebrate the passage of the bill by the senate the gang must ride wildly through the town creating uproar and excitement liquor must be partaken of the suburbs shot up and the glory of the san saba country vociferously proclaimed a part of the programme had been carried out in the saloons on the way up lonny mounted hot tamales the accomplished little beast prancing with fire and intelligence he was glad to feel lonny s bowlegged grip against his ribs again lonny was his friend and he was willing to do things for him come on boys said lonny urging hot tomales into a gallop with his knees with a whoop the inspired lobby tore after him through the dust lonny led his cohorts straight for the capitol with a wild yell the gang endorsed his now evident intention of riding into it hooray for san saba up the six broad limestone steps clattered the broncos of the cowpunchers into the resounding hallway they pattered scattering in dismay those passing on foot lonny in the lead shoved hot tamales direct for the great picture at that hour a downpouring soft light from the second story windows bathed the big canvas against the darker background of the hall the painting stood out with valuable effect in spite of the defects of the art you could almost fancy that you gazed out upon a landscape you might well flinch a step from the convincing figure of the life size steer stampeding across the grass perhaps it seemed thus to hot tamales the scene was in his line perhaps he only obeyed the will of his rider his ears pricked up he snorted lonny leaned forward in the saddle and elevated his elbows wing like thus signals the cowpuncher to his steed to launch himself full speed ahead did hot tamales fancy he saw a steer red and cavorting that should be headed off and driven back to the herd there was a fierce clatter of hoofs a rush a gathering of steely flank muscles a leap to the jerk of the bridle rein and hot tamales with lonny bending low in the saddle to dodge the top of the frame ripped through the great canvas like a shell from a mortar leaving the cloth hanging in ragged sheds about a monstrous hole quickly lonny pulled up his pony and rounded the pillars spectators came running too astounded to add speech to the commotion the sergeant at arms of the house came forth frowned looked ominous and then grinned many of the legislators crowded out to observe the tumult lonny s cowpunchers were stricken to silent horror by his mad deed senator kinney happened to be among the earliest to emerge before he could speak lonny leaned in his saddle as hot tamales pranced pointed his quirt at the senator and said calmly that was a fine speech you made to day mister but you might as well let up on that propriation business i ain t askin the state to give me nothin i thought i had a picture to sell to it but it wasn t one you said a heap of things about grandfather briscoe that makes me kind of proud i m his grandson well the briscoes ain t takin presents from the state yet anybody can have the frame that wants it hit her up boys away scuttled the san saba delegation out of the hall down the steps along the dusty street halfway to the san saba country they camped that night at bedtime lonny stole away from the campfire and sought hot tamales placidly eating grass at the end of his stake rope lonny hung upon his neck and his art aspirations went forth forever in one long regretful sigh but as he thus made renunciation his breath formed a word or two you was the only one tamales what seen anything in it it did look like a steer didn t it old hoss phoebe you are a man of many novel adventures and varied enterprises i said to captain patricio malone do you believe that the possible element of good luck or bad luck if there is such a thing as luck has influenced your career or persisted for or against you to such an extent that you were forced to attribute results to the operation of the aforesaid good luck or bad luck this question of almost the dull insolence of legal phraseology was put while we sat in rousselin s little red tiled cafe near congo square in new orleans brown faced white hatted finger ringed captains of adventure came often to rousselin s for the cognac they came from sea and land and were chary of relating the things they had seen not because they were more wonderful than the fantasies of the ananiases of print but because they were so different and i was a perpetual wedding guest always striving to cast my buttonhole over the finger of one of these mariners of fortune this captain malone was a hiberno iberian creole who had gone to and fro in the earth and walked up and down in it he looked like any other well dressed man of thirty five whom you might meet except that he was hopelessly weather tanned and wore on his chain an ancient ivory and gold peruvian charm against evil which has nothing at all to do with this story my answer to your question said the captain smiling will be to tell you the story of bad luck kearny that is if you don t mind hearing it my reply was to pound on the table for rousselin strolling along tchoupitoulas street one night began captain malone i noticed without especially taxing my interest a small man walking rapidly toward me he stepped upon a wooden cellar door crashed through it and disappeared i rescued him from a heap of soft coal below he dusted himself briskly swearing fluently in a mechanical tone as an underpaid actor recites the gypsy s curse gratitude and the dust in his throat seemed to call for fluids to clear them away his desire for liquidation was expressed so heartily that i went with him to a cafe down the street where we had some vile vermouth and bitters looking across that little table i had my first clear sight of francis kearny he was about five feet seven but as tough as a cypress knee his hair was darkest red his mouth such a mere slit that you wondered how the flood of his words came rushing from it his eyes were the brightest and lightest blue and the hopefulest that i ever saw he gave the double impression that he was at bay and that you had better not crowd him further just in from a gold hunting expedition on the coast of costa rica he explained second mate of a banana steamer told me the natives were panning out enough from the beach sands to buy all the rum red calico and parlour melodeons in the world the day i got there a syndicate named incorporated jones gets a government concession to all minerals from a given point for a next choice i take coast fever and count green and blue lizards for six weeks in a grass hut i had to be notified when i was well for the reptiles were actually there then i shipped back as third cook on a norwegian tramp that blew up her boiler two miles below quarantine i was due to bust through that cellar door here to night so i hurried the rest of the way up the river roustabouting on a lower coast packet that made up a landing for every fisherman that wanted a plug of tobacco and now i m here for what comes next and it ll be along it ll be along said this queer mr kearny it ll be along on the beams of my bright but not very particular star from the first the personality of kearny charmed me i saw in him the bold heart the restless nature and the valiant front against the buffets of fate that make his countrymen such valuable comrades in risk and adventure and just then i was wanting such men moored at a fruit company s pier i had a ton steamer ready to sail the next day with a cargo of sugar lumber and corrugated iron for a port in well let us call the country esperando it has not been long ago and the name of patricio malone is still spoken there when its unsettled politics are discussed beneath the sugar and iron were packed a thousand winchester rifles in aguas frias the capital don rafael valdevia minister of war esperando s greatest hearted and most able patriot awaited my coming no doubt you have heard with a smile of the insignificant wars and uprisings in those little tropic republics they make but a faint clamour against the din of great nations battles but down there under all the ridiculous uniforms and petty diplomacy and senseless countermarching and intrigue are to be found statesmen and patriots don rafael valdevia was one his great ambition was to raise esperando into peace and honest prosperity and the respect of the serious nations so he waited for my rifles in aguas frias but one would think i am trying to win a recruit in you no it was francis kearny i wanted and so i told him speaking long over our execrable vermouth breathing the stifling odour from garlic and tarpaulins which as you know is the distinctive flavour of cafes in the lower slant of our city i spoke of the tyrant president cruz and the burdens that his green and insolent cruelty laid upon the people and at that kearny s tears flowed and then i dried them with a picture of the fat rewards that would be ours when the oppressor should be overthrown and the wise and generous valdevia in his seat then kearny leaped to his feet and wrung my hand with the strength of a roustabout he was mine he said till the last minion of the hated despot was hurled from the highest peaks of the cordilleras into the sea i paid the score and we went out near the door kearny s elbow overturned an upright glass showcase smashing it into little bits i paid the storekeeper the price he asked come to my hotel for the night i said to kearny we sail to morrow at noon he agreed but on the sidewalk he fell to cursing again in the dull monotonous way that he had done when i pulled him out of the coal cellar captain said he before we go any further it s no more than fair to tell you that i m known from baffin s bay to terra del fuego as bad luck kearny and i m it everything i get into goes up in the air except a balloon every bet i ever made i lost except when i coppered it every boat i ever sailed on sank except the submarines everything i was ever interested in went to pieces except a patent bombshell that i invented everything i ever took hold of and tried to run i ran into the ground except when i tried to plough and that s why they call me bad luck kearny i thought i d tell you bad luck said i or what goes by that name may now and then tangle the affairs of any man but if it persists beyond the estimate of what we may call the averages there must be a cause for it there is said kearny emphatically and when we walk another square i will show it to you surprised i kept by his side until we came to canal street and out into the middle of its great width kearny seized me by an arm and pointed a tragic forefinger at a rather brilliant star that shone steadily about thirty degrees above the horizon that s saturn said he the star that presides over bad luck and evil and disappointment and nothing doing and trouble i was born under that star every move i make up bobs saturn and blocks it he s the hoodoo planet of the heavens they say he s miles in diameter and no solider of body than split pea soup and he s got as many disreputable and malignant rings as chicago now what kind of a star is that to be born under i asked kearny where he had obtained all this astonishing knowledge from azrath the great astrologer of cleveland ohio said he that man looked at a glass ball and told me my name before i d taken a chair he prophesied the date of my birth and death before i d said a word and then he cast my horoscope and the sidereal system socked me in the solar plexus it was bad luck for francis kearny from a to izard and for his friends that were implicated with him for that i gave up ten dollars this azrath was sorry but he respected his profession too much to read the heavens wrong for any man it was night time and he took me out on a balcony and gave me a free view of the sky and he showed me which saturn was and how to find it in different balconies and longitudes but saturn wasn t all he was only the man higher up he furnishes so much bad luck that they allow him a gang of deputy sparklers to help hand it out they re circulating and revolving and hanging around the main supply all the time each one throwing the hoodoo on his own particular district you see that ugly little red star about eight inches above and to the right of saturn kearny asked me well that s her that s phoebe she s got me in charge by the day of your birth says azrath to me your life is subjected to the influence of saturn by the hour and minute of it you must dwell under the sway and direct authority of phoebe the ninth satellite so said this azrath kearny shook his fist violently skyward curse her she s done her work well said he ever since i was astrologized bad luck has followed me like my shadow as i told you and for many years before now captain i ve told you my handicap as a man should if you re afraid this evil star of mine might cripple your scheme leave me out of it i reassured kearny as well as i could i told him that for the time we would banish both astrology and astronomy from our heads the manifest valour and enthusiasm of the man drew me let us see what a little courage and diligence will do against bad luck i said we will sail to morrow for esperando fifty miles down the mississippi our steamer broke her rudder we sent for a tug to tow us back and lost three days when we struck the blue waters of the gulf all the storm clouds of the atlantic seemed to have concentrated above us we thought surely to sweeten those leaping waves with our sugar and to stack our arms and lumber on the floor of the mexican gulf kearny did not seek to cast off one iota of the burden of our danger from the shoulders of his fatal horoscope he weathered every storm on deck smoking a black pipe to keep which alight rain and sea water seemed but as oil and he shook his fist at the black clouds behind which his baleful star winked its unseen eye when the skies cleared one evening he reviled his malignant guardian with grim humour on watch aren t you you red headed vixen out making it hot for little francis kearny and his friends according to hoyle twinkle twinkle little devil you re a lady aren t you dogging a man with your bad luck just because he happened to be born while your boss was floorwalker get busy and sink the ship you one eyed banshee phoebe h m sounds as mild as a milkmaid you can t judge a woman by her name why couldn t i have had a man star i can t make the remarks to phoebe that i could to a man oh phoebe you be blasted for eight days gales and squalls and waterspouts beat us from our course five days only should have landed us in esperando our jonah swallowed the bad credit of it with appealing frankness but that scarcely lessened the hardships our cause was made to suffer at last one afternoon we steamed into the calm estuary of the little rio escondido three miles up this we crept feeling for the shallow channel between the low banks that were crowded to the edge with gigantic trees and riotous vegetation then our whistle gave a little toot and in five minutes we heard a shout and carlos my brave carlos quintana crashed through the tangled vines waving his cap madly for joy a hundred yards away was his camp where three hundred chosen patriots of esperando were awaiting our coming for a month carlos had been drilling them there in the tactics of war and filling them with the spirit of revolution and liberty my captain compadre mio shouted carlos while yet my boat was being lowered you should see them in the drill by companies in the column wheel in the march by fours they are superb also in the manual of arms but alas performed only with sticks of bamboo the guns capitan say that you have brought the guns a thousand winchesters carlos i called to him and two gatlings valgame dios he cried throwing his cap in the air we shall sweep the world at that moment kearny tumbled from the steamer s side into the river he could not swim so the crew threw him a rope and drew him back aboard i caught his eye and his look of pathetic but still bright and undaunted consciousness of his guilty luck i told myself that although he might be a man to shun he was also one to be admired i gave orders to the sailing master that the arms ammunition and provisions were to be landed at once that was easy in the steamer s boats except for the two gatling guns for their transportation ashore we carried a stout flatboat brought for the purpose in the steamer s hold in the meantime i walked with carlos to the camp and made the soldiers a little speech in spanish which they received with enthusiasm and then i had some wine and a cigarette in carlos s tent later we walked back to the river to see how the unloading was being conducted the small arms and provisions were already ashore and the petty officers and squads of men conveying them to camp one gatling had been safely landed the other was just being hoisted over the side of the vessel as we arrived i noticed kearny darting about on board seeming to have the ambition of ten men and doing the work of five i think his zeal bubbled over when he saw carlos and me a rope s end was swinging loose from some part of the tackle kearny leaped impetuously and caught it there was a crackle and a hiss and a smoke of scorching hemp and the gatling dropped straight as a plummet through the bottom of the flatboat and buried itself in twenty feet of water and five feet of river mud i turned my back on the scene i heard carlos s loud cries as if from some extreme grief too poignant for words i heard the complaining murmur of the crew and the maledictions of torres the sailing master i could not bear to look by night some degree of order had been restored in camp military rules were not drawn strictly and the men were grouped about the fires of their several messes playing games of chance singing their native songs or discussing with voluble animation the contingencies of our march upon the capital to my tent which had been pitched for me close to that of my chief lieutenant came kearny indomitable smiling bright eyed bearing no traces of the buffets of his evil star rather was his aspect that of a heroic martyr whose tribulations were so high sourced and glorious that he even took a splendour and a prestige from them well captain said he i guess you realize that bad luck kearny is still on deck it was a shame now about that gun she only needed to be slewed two inches to clear the rail and that s why i grabbed that rope s end who d have thought that a sailor even a sicilian lubber on a banana coaster would have fastened a line in a bow knot don t think i m trying to dodge the responsibility captain it s my luck there are men kearny said i gravely who pass through life blaming upon luck and chance the mistakes that result from their own faults and incompetency i do not say that you are such a man but if all your mishaps are traceable to that tiny star the sooner we endow our colleges with chairs of moral astronomy the better it isn t the size of the star that counts said kearny it s the quality just the way it is with women that s why they give the biggest planets masculine names and the little stars feminine ones to even things up when it comes to getting their work in suppose they had called my star agamemnon or bill mccarty or something like that instead of phoebe every time one of those old boys touched their calamity button and sent me down one of their wireless pieces of bad luck i could talk back and tell em what i thought of em in suitable terms but you can t address such remarks to a phoebe it pleases you to make a joke of it kearny said i without smiling but it is no joke to me to think of my gatling mired in the river ooze as to that said kearny abandoning his light mood at once i have already done what i could i have had some experience in hoisting stone in quarries torres and i have already spliced three hawsers and stretched them from the steamer s stern to a tree on shore we will rig a tackle and have the gun on terra firma before noon to morrow one could not remain long at outs with bad luck kearny once more said i to him we will waive this question of luck have you ever had experience in drilling raw troops i was first sergeant and drill master said kearny in the chilean army for one year and captain of artillery for another what became of your command i asked shot down to a man said kearny during the revolutions against balmaceda somehow the misfortunes of the evil starred one seemed to turn to me their comedy side i lay back upon my goat s hide cot and laughed until the woods echoed kearny grinned i told you how it was he said to morrow i said i shall detail one hundred men under your command for manual of arms drill and company evolutions you rank as lieutenant now for god s sake kearny i urged him try to combat this superstition if it is one bad luck may be like any other visitor preferring to stop where it is expected get your mind off stars look upon esperando as your planet of good fortune i thank you captain said kearny quietly i will try to make it the best handicap i ever ran by noon the next day the submerged gatling was rescued as kearny had promised then carlos and manuel ortiz and kearny my lieutenants distributed winchesters among the troops and put them through an incessant rifle drill we fired no shots blank or solid for of all coasts esperando is the stillest and we had no desire to sound any warnings in the ear of that corrupt government until they should carry with them the message of liberty and the downfall of oppression in the afternoon came a mule rider bearing a written message to me from don rafael valdevia in the capital aguas frias whenever that man s name comes to my lips words of tribute to his greatness his noble simplicity and his conspicuous genius follow irrepressibly he was a traveller a student of peoples and governments a master of sciences a poet an orator a leader a soldier a critic of the world s campaigns and the idol of the people in esperando i had been honoured by his friendship for years it was i who first turned his mind to the thought that he should leave for his monument a new esperando a country freed from the rule of unscrupulous tyrants and a people made happy and prosperous by wise and impartial legislation when he had consented he threw himself into the cause with the undivided zeal with which he endowed all of his acts the coffers of his great fortune were opened to those of us to whom were entrusted the secret moves of the game his popularity was already so great that he had practically forced president cruz to offer him the portfolio of minister of war the time don rafael said in his letter was ripe success he prophesied was certain the people were beginning to clamour publicly against cruz s misrule bands of citizens in the capital were even going about of nights hurling stones at public buildings and expressing their dissatisfaction a bronze statue of president cruz in the botanical gardens had been lassoed about the neck and overthrown it only remained for me to arrive with my force and my thousand rifles and for himself to come forward and proclaim himself the people s saviour to overthrow cruz in a single day there would be but a half hearted resistance from the six hundred government troops stationed in the capital th country was ours he presumed that by this time my steamer had arrived at quintana s camp he proposed the eighteenth of july for the attack that would give us six days in which to strike camp and march to aguas frias in the meantime don rafael remained my good friend and compadre en la cause de la libertad on the morning of the th we began our march toward the sea following range of mountains over the sixty mile trail to the capital our small arms and provisions were laden on pack mules twenty men harnessed to each gatling gun rolled them smoothly along the flat alluvial lowlands our troops well shod and well fed moved with alacrity and heartiness i and my three lieutenants were mounted on the tough mountain ponies of the country a mile out of camp one of the pack mules becoming stubborn broke away from the train and plunged from the path into the thicket the alert kearny spurred quickly after it and intercepted its flight rising in his stirrups he released one foot and bestowed upon the mutinous animal a hearty kick the mule tottered and fell with a crash broadside upon the ground as we gathered around it it walled its great eyes almost humanly towards kearny and expired that was bad but worse to our minds was the concomitant disaster part of the mule s burden had been one hundred pounds of the finest coffee to be had in the tropics the bag burst and spilled the priceless brown mass of the ground berries among the dense vines and weeds of the swampy land mala suerte when you take away from an esperandan his coffee you abstract his patriotism and per cent of his value as a soldier the men began to rake up the precious stuff but i beckoned kearny back along the trail where they would not hear the limit had been reached i took from my pocket a wallet of money and drew out some bills mr kearny said i here are some funds belonging to don rafael valdevia which i am expending in his cause i know of no better service it can buy for him that this here is one hundred dollars luck or no luck we part company here star or no star calamity seems to travel by your side you will return to the steamer she touches at amotapa to discharge her lumber and iron and then puts back to new orleans hand this note to the sailing master who will give you passage i wrote on a leaf torn from my book and placed it and the money in kearny s hand good bye i said extending my own it is not that i am displeased with you but there is no place in this expedition for let us say the senorita phoebe i said this with a smile trying to smooth the thing for him may you have better luck companero kearny took the money and the paper it was just a little touch said he just a little lift with the toe of my boot but what s the odds that blamed mule would have died if i had only dusted his ribs with a powder puff it was my luck well captain i would have liked to be in that little fight with you over in aguas frias success to the cause adios he turned around and set off down the trail without looking back the unfortunate mule s pack saddle was transferred to kearny s pony and we again took up the march four days we journeyed over the foot hills and mountains fording icy torrents winding around the crumbling brows of ragged peaks creeping along rocky flanges that overlooked awful precipices crawling breathlessly over tottering bridges that crossed bottomless chasms on the evening of the seventeenth we camped by a little stream on the bare hills five miles from aguas frias at daybreak we were to take up the march again at midnight i was standing outside my tent inhaling the fresh cold air the stars were shining bright in the cloudless sky giving the heavens their proper aspect of illimitable depth and distance when viewed from the vague darkness of the blotted earth almost at its zenith was the planet saturn and with a half smile i observed the sinister red sparkle of his malignant attendant the demon star of kearny s ill luck and then my thoughts strayed across the hills to the scene of our coming triumph where the heroic and noble don rafael awaited our coming to set a new and shining star in the firmament of nations i heard a slight rustling in the deep grass to my right i turned and saw kearny coming toward me he was ragged and dew drenched and limping his hat and one boot were gone about one foot he had tied some makeshift of cloth and grass but his manner as he approached was that of a man who knows his own virtues well enough to be superior to rebuffs well sir i said staring at him coldly if there is anything in persistence i see no reason why you should not succeed in wrecking and ruining us yet i kept half a day s journey behind said kearny fishing out a stone from the covering of his lame foot so the bad luck wouldn t touch you i couldn t help it captain i wanted to be in on this game it was a pretty tough trip especially in the department of the commissary in the low grounds there were always bananas and oranges higher up it was worse but your men left a good deal of goat meat hanging on the bushes in the camps here s your hundred dollars you re nearly there now captain let me in on the scrapping to morrow not for a hundred times a hundred would i have the tiniest thing go wrong with my plans now i said whether caused by evil planets or the blunders of mere man but yonder is aguas frias five miles away and a clear road i am of the mind to defy saturn and all his satellites to spoil our success now at any rate i will not turn away to night as weary a traveller and as good a soldier as you are lieutenant kearny manuel ortiz s tent is there by the brightest fire rout him out and tell him to supply you with food and blankets and clothes we march again at daybreak kearny thanked me briefly but feelingly and moved away he had gone scarcely a dozen steps when a sudden flash of bright light illumined the surrounding hills a sinister growing hissing sound like escaping steam filled my ears then followed a roar as of distant thunder which grew louder every instant this terrifying noise culminated in a tremendous explosion which seemed to rock the hills as an earthquake would the illumination waxed to a glare so fierce that i clapped my hands over my eyes to save them i thought the end of the world had come i could think of no natural phenomenon that would explain it my wits were staggering the deafening explosion trailed off into the rumbling roar that had preceded it and through this i heard the frightened shouts of my troops as they stumbled from their resting places and rushed wildly about also i heard the harsh tones of kearny s voice crying they ll blame it on me of course and what the devil it is it s not francis kearny that can give you an answer i opened my eyes the hills were still there dark and solid it had not been then a volcano or an earthquake i looked up at the sky and saw a comet like trail crossing the zenith and extending westward a fiery trail waning fainter and narrower each moment a meteor i called aloud a meteor has fallen there is no danger and then all other sounds were drowned by a great shout from kearny s throat he had raised both hands above his head and was standing tiptoe phoebe s gone he cried with all his lungs she s busted and gone to hell look captain the little red headed hoodoo has blown herself to smithereens she found kearny too tough to handle and she puffed up with spite and meanness till her boiler blew up it s be bad luck kearny no more oh let us be joyful humpty dumpty sat on a wall humpty busted and that ll be all i looked up wondering and picked out saturn in his place but the small red twinkling luminary in his vicinity which kearny had pointed out to me as his evil star had vanished i had seen it there but half an hour before there was no doubt that one of those awful and mysterious spasms of nature had hurled it from the heavens i clapped kearny on the shoulder little man said i let this clear the way for you it appears that astrology has failed to subdue you your horoscope must be cast anew with pluck and loyalty for controlling stars i play you to win now get to your tent and sleep daybreak is the word at nine o clock on the morning of the eighteenth of july i rode into aguas frias with kearny at my side in his clean linen suit and with his military poise and keen eye he was a model of a fighting adventurer i had visions of him riding as commander of president valdevia s body guard when the plums of the new republic should begin to fall carlos followed with the troops and supplies he was to halt in a wood outside the town and remain concealed there until he received the word to advance kearny and i rode down the calle ancha toward the residencia of don rafael at the other side of the town as we passed the superb white buildings of the university of esperando i saw at an open window the gleaming spectacles and bald head of herr bergowitz professor of the natural sciences and friend of don rafael and of me and of the cause he waved his hand to me with his broad bland smile there was no excitement apparent in aguas frias the people went about leisurely as at all times the market was thronged with bare headed women buying fruit and carne we heard the twang and tinkle of string bands in the patios of the cantinas we could see that it was a waiting game that don rafael was playing his residencia as a large but low building around a great courtyard in grounds crowed with ornamental trees and tropic shrubs at his door an old woman who came informed us that don rafael had not yet arisen tell him said i that captain malone and a friend wish to see him at once perhaps he has overslept she came back looking frightened i have called she said and rung his bell many times but he does not answer i knew where his sleeping room was kearny and i pushed by her and went to it i put my shoulder against the thin door and forced it open in an armchair by a great table covered with maps and books sat don rafael with his eyes closed i touched his hand he had been dead many hours on his head above one ear was a wound caused by a heavy blow it had ceased to bleed long before i made the old woman call a mozo and dispatched him in haste to fetch herr bergowitz he came and we stood about as if we were half stunned by the awful shock thus can the letting of a few drops of blood from one man s veins drain the life of a nation presently herr bergowitz stooped and picked up a darkish stone the size of an orange which he saw under the table he examined it closely through his great glasses with the eye of science a fragment said he of a detonating meteor the most remarkable one in twenty years exploded above this city a little after midnight this morning the professor looked quickly up at the ceiling we saw the blue sky through a hole the size of an orange nearly above don rafael s chair i heard a familiar sound and turned kearny had thrown himself on the floor and was babbling his compendium of bitter blood freezing curses against the star of his evil luck undoubtedly phoebe had been feminine even when hurtling on her way to fiery dissolution and everlasting doom the last word had been hers captain malone was not unskilled in narrative he knew the point where a story should end i sat reveling in his effective conclusion when he aroused me by continuing of course said he our schemes were at an end there was no one to take don rafael s place our little army melted away like dew before the sun one day after i had returned to new orleans i related this story to a friend who holds a professorship in tulane university when i had finished he laughed and asked whether i had any knowledge of kearny s luck afterward i told him no that i had seen him no more but that when he left me he had expressed confidence that his future would be successful now that his unlucky star had been overthrown no doubt said the professor he is happier not to know one fact if he derives his bad luck from phoebe the ninth satellite of saturn that malicious lady is still engaged in overlooking his career the star close to saturn that he imagined to be her was near that planet simply by the chance of its orbit probably at different times he has regarded many other stars that happened to be in saturn s neighbourhood as his evil one the real phoebe is visible only through a very good telescope about a year afterward continued captain malone i was walking down a street that crossed the poydras market an immensely stout pink faced lacy in black satin crowded me from the narrow sidewalk with a frown behind her trailed a little man laden to the gunwales with bundles and bags of goods and vegetables it was kearny but changed i stopped and shook one of his hands which still clung to a bag of garlic and red peppers how is the luck old companero i asked him i had not the heart to tell him the truth about his star well said he i am married as you may guess francis called the big lady in deep tones are you going to stop in the street talking all day i am coming phoebe dear said kearny hastening after her captain malone ceased again after all do you believe in luck i asked do you answered the captain with his ambiguous smile shaded by the brim of his soft straw hat a double dyed deceiver the trouble began in laredo it was the llano kid s fault for he should have confined his habit of manslaughter to mexicans but the kid was past twenty and to have only mexicans to one s credit at twenty is to blush unseen on the rio grande border it happened in old justo valdos s gambling house there was a poker game at which sat players who were not all friends as happens often where men ride in from afar to shoot folly as she gallops there was a row over so small a matter as a pair of queens and when the smoke had cleared away it was found that the kid had committed an indiscretion and his adversary had been guilty of a blunder for the unfortunate combatant instead of being a greaser was a high blooded youth from the cow ranches of about the kid s own age and possessed of friends and champions his blunder in missing the kid s right ear only a sixteenth of an inch when he pulled his gun did not lessen the indiscretion of the better marksman the kid not being equipped with a retinue nor bountifully supplied with personal admirers and supporters on account of a rather umbrageous reputation even for the border considered it not incompatible with his indispensable gameness to perform that judicious tractional act known as pulling his freight quickly the avengers gathered and sought him three of them overtook him within a rod of the station the kid turned and showed his teeth in that brilliant but mirthless smile that usually preceded his deeds of insolence and violence and his pursuers fell back without making it necessary for him even to reach for his weapon but in this affair the kid had not felt the grim thirst for encounter that usually urged him on to battle it had been a purely chance row born of the cards and certain epithets impossible for a gentleman to brook that had passed between the two the kid had rather liked the slim haughty brown faced young chap whom his bullet had cut off in the first pride of manhood and now he wanted no more blood he wanted to get away and have a good long sleep somewhere in the sun on the mesquit grass with his handkerchief over his face even a mexican might have crossed his path in safety while he was in this mood the kid openly boarded the north bound passenger train that departed five minutes later but at webb a few miles out where it was flagged to take on a traveller he abandoned that manner of escape there were telegraph stations ahead and the kid looked askance at electricity and steam saddle and spur were his rocks of safety the man whom he had shot was a stranger to him but the kid knew that he was of the coralitos outfit from hidalgo and that the punchers from that ranch were more relentless and vengeful than kentucky feudists when wrong or harm was done to one of them so with the wisdom that has characterized many great farmers the kid decided to pile up as many leagues as possible of chaparral and pear between himself and the retaliation of the coralitos bunch near the station was a store and near the store scattered among the mesquits and elms stood the saddled horses of the customers most of them waited half asleep with sagging limbs and drooping heads but one a long legged roan with a curved neck snorted and pawed the turf him the kid mounted gripped with his knees and slapped gently with the owner s own quirt if the slaying of the temerarious card player had cast a cloud over the kid s standing as a good and true citizen this last act of his veiled his figure in the darkest shadows of disrepute on the rio grande border if you take a man s life you sometimes take trash but if you take his horse you take a thing the loss of which renders him poor indeed and which enriches you not if you are caught for the kid there was no turning back now with the springing roan under him he felt little care or uneasiness after a five mile gallop he drew it in to the plainsman s jogging trot and rode northeastward toward the nueces river bottoms he knew the country well its most tortuous and obscure trails through the great wilderness of brush and pear and its camps and lonesome ranches where one might find safe entertainment always he bore to the east for the kid had never seen the ocean and he had a fancy to lay his hand upon the mane of the great gulf the gamesome colt of the greater waters so after three days he stood on the shore at corpus christi and looked out across the gentle ripples of a quiet sea captain boone of the schooner flyaway stood near his skiff which one of his crew was guarding in the surf when ready to sail he had discovered that one of the necessaries of life in the parallelogrammatic shape of plug tobacco had been forgotten a sailor had been dispatched for the missing cargo meanwhile the captain paced the sands chewing profanely at his pocket store a slim wiry youth in high heeled boots came down to the water s edge his face was boyish but with a premature severity that hinted at a man s experience his complexion was naturally dark and the sun and wind of an outdoor life had burned it to a coffee brown his hair was as black and straight as an indian s his face had not yet upturned to the humiliation of a razor his eyes were a cold and steady blue he carried his left arm somewhat away from his body for pearl handled s are frowned upon by town marshals and are a little bulky when placed in the left armhole of one s vest he looked beyond captain boone at the gulf with the impersonal and expressionless dignity of a chinese emperor thinkin of buyin that ar gulf buddy asked the captain made sarcastic by his narrow escape from a tobaccoless voyage why no said the kid gently i reckon not i never saw it before i was just looking at it not thinking of selling it are you not this trip said the captain i ll send it to you c o d when i get back to buenas tierras here comes that capstanfooted lubber with the chewin i ought to ve weighed anchor an hour ago is that your ship out there asked the kid why yes answered the captain if you want to call a schooner a ship and i don t mind lyin but you better say miller and gonzales owners and ordinary plain billy be damned old samuel k boone skipper where are you going to asked the refugee buenas tierras coast of south america i forgot what they called the country the last time i was there cargo lumber corrugated iron and machetes what kind of a country is it asked the kid hot or cold warmish buddy said the captain but a regular paradise lost for elegance of scenery and be yooty of geography ye re wakened every morning by the sweet singin of red birds with seven purple tails and the sighin of breezes in the posies and roses and the inhabitants never work for they can reach out and pick steamer baskets of the choicest hothouse fruit without gettin out of bed and there s no sunday and no ice and no rent and no troubles and no use and no nothin it s a great country for a man to go to sleep with and wait for somethin to turn up the bananys and oranges and hurricanes and pineapples that ye eat comes from there that sounds to me said the kid at last betraying interest what ll the expressage be to take me out there with you twenty four dollars said captain boone grub and transportation second cabin i haven t got a first cabin you ve got my company said the kid pulling out a buckskin bag with three hundred dollars he had gone to laredo for his regular blowout the duel in valdos s had cut short his season of hilarity but it had left him with nearly for aid in the flight that it had made necessary all right buddy said the captain i hope your ma won t blame me for this little childish escapade of yours he beckoned to one of the boat s crew let sanchez lift you out to the skiff so you won t get your feet wet thacker the united states consul at buenas tierras was not yet drunk it was only eleven o clock and he never arrived at his desired state of beatitude a state wherein he sang ancient maudlin vaudeville songs and pelted his screaming parrot with banana peels until the middle of the afternoon so when he looked up from his hammock at the sound of a slight cough and saw the kid standing in the door of the consulate he was still in a condition to extend the hospitality and courtesy due from the representative of a great nation don t disturb yourself said the kid easily i just dropped in they told me it was customary to light at your camp before starting in to round up the town i just came in on a ship from texas glad to see you mr said the consul the kid laughed sprague dalton he said it sounds funny to me to hear it i m called the llano kid in the rio grande country i m thacker said the consul take that cane bottom chair now if you ve come to invest you want somebody to advise you these dingies will cheat you out of the gold in your teeth if you don t understand their ways try a cigar much obliged said the kid but if it wasn t for my corn shucks and the little bag in my back pocket i couldn t live a minute he took out his makings and rolled a cigarette they speak spanish here said the consul you ll need an interpreter if there s anything i can do why i d be delighted if you re buying fruit lands or looking for a concession of any sort you ll want somebody who knows the ropes to look out for you i speak spanish said the kid about nine times better than i do english everybody speaks it on the range where i come from and i m not in the market for anything you speak spanish said thacker thoughtfully he regarded the kid absorbedly you look like a spaniard too he continued and you re from texas and you can t be more than twenty or twenty one i wonder if you ve got any nerve you got a deal of some kind to put through asked the texan with unexpected shrewdness are you open to a proposition said thacker what s the use to deny it said the kid i got into a little gun frolic down in laredo and plugged a white man there wasn t any mexican handy and i come down to your parrot and monkey range just for to smell the morning glories and marigolds now do you sabe thacker got up and closed the door let me see your hand he said he took the kid s left hand and examined the back of it closely i can do it he said excitedly your flesh is as hard as wood and as healthy as a baby s it will heal in a week if it s a fist fight you want to back me for said the kid don t put your money up yet make it gun work and i ll keep you company but no barehanded scrapping like ladies at a tea party for me it s easier than that said thacker just step here will you through the window he pointed to a two story white stuccoed house with wide galleries rising amid the deep green tropical foliage on a wooded hill that sloped gently from the sea in that house said thacker a fine old castilian gentleman and his wife are yearning to gather you into their arms and fill your pockets with money old santos urique lives there he owns half the gold mines in the country you haven t been eating loco weed have you asked the kid sit down again said thacker and i ll tell you twelve years ago they lost a kid no he didn t die although most of em here do from drinking the surface water he was a wild little devil even if he wasn t but eight years old everybody knows about it some americans who were through here prospecting for gold had letters to senor urique and the boy was a favorite with them they filled his head with big stories about the states and about a month after they left the kid disappeared too he was supposed to have stowed himself away among the banana bunches on a fruit steamer and gone to new orleans he was seen once afterward in texas it was thought but they never heard anything more of him old urique has spent thousands of dollars having him looked for the madam was broken up worst of all the kid was her life she wears mourning yet but they say she believes he ll come back to her some day and never gives up hope on the back of the boy s left hand was tattooed a flying eagle carrying a spear in his claws that s old urique s coat of arms or something that he inherited in spain the kid raised his left hand slowly and gazed at it curiously that s it said thacker reaching behind the official desk for his bottle of smuggled brandy you re not so slow i can do

back against the wall and held his glass up to the light we ve come now said he to the question of how far you re willing to go in a little matter of the sort i told you why i came down here said the kid simply a good answer said the consul but you won t have to go that far here s the scheme after i get the trademark tattooed on your hand i ll notify old urique in the meantime i ll furnish you

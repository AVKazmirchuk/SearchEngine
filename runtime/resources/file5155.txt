next meal there will be nothing the last centavo is spent she pressed closer against the grating sell the goods in the shop take anything for them have i not tried did i not offer them for one tenth their cost not even one peso would any one give there is not one real in this town to assist dickee malonee dick clenched his teeth grimly that s the comandante he growled he s responsible for that sentiment wait oh wait till the cards are all out pasa lowered her voice to almost a whisper and listen heart of my heart she said i have endeavored to be brave but i cannot live without thee three days now dicky caught a faint gleam of steel from the folds of her mantilla for once she looked in his face and saw it without a smile stern menacing and purposeful then he suddenly raised his hand and his smile came back like a gleam of sunshine the hoarse signal of an incoming steamer s siren sounded in the harbor dicky called to the sentry who was pacing before the door what steamer comes the catarina of the vesuvius line without doubt of that line go you picarilla said dicky joyously to pasa to the american consul tell him i wish to speak with him see that he comes at once and look you let me see a different look in those eyes for i promise your head shall rest upon this arm tonight it was an hour before the consul came he held his green umbrella under his arm and mopped his forehead impatiently now see here maloney he began captiously you fellows seem to think you can cut up any kind of row and expect me to pull you out of it i m neither the war department nor a gold mine this country has its laws you know and there s one against pounding the senses out of the regular army you irish are forever getting into trouble i don t see what i can do anything like tobacco now to make you comfortable or newspapers son of eli interrupted dicky gravely you haven t changed an iota that is almost a duplicate of the speech you made when old koen s donkeys and geese got into the chapel loft and the culprits wanted to hide in your room oh heavens exclaimed the consul hurriedly adjusting his spectacles are you a yale man too were you in that crowd i don t seem to remember any one with red any one named maloney such a lot of college men seem to have misused their advantages one of the best mathematicians of the class of is selling lottery tickets in belize a cornell man dropped off here last month he was second steward on a guano boat i ll write to the department if you like maloney or if there s any tobacco or newspa there s nothing interrupted dicky shortly but this you go tell the captain of the catarina that dicky maloney wants to see him as soon as he can conveniently come tell him where i am hurry that s all the consul glad to be let off so easily hurried away the captain of the catarina a stout man sicilian born soon appeared shoving with little ceremony through the guards to the jail door the vesuvius fruit company had a habit of doing things that way in anchuria i am exceeding sorry exceeding sorry said the captain to see this occur i place myself at your service mr maloney what you need shall be furnished whatever you say shall be done dicky looked at him unsmilingly his red hair could not detract from his attitude of severe dignity as he stood tall and calm with his now grim mouth forming a horizontal line captain de lucco i believe i still have funds in the hands of your company ample and personal funds i ordered a remittance last week the money has not arrived you know what is needed in this game money and money and more money why has it not been sent by the cristobal replied de lucco gesticulating it was despatched where is the cristobal off cape antonio i spoke her with a broken shaft a tramp coaster was towing her back to new orleans i brought money ashore thinking your need for it might not withstand delay in this envelope is one thousand dollars there is more if you need it mr maloney for the present it will suffice said dicky softening as he crinkled the envelope and looked down at the half inch thickness of smooth dingy bills the long green he said gently with a new reverence in his gaze is there anything it will not buy captain i had three friends replied de lucco who was a bit of a philosopher who had money one of them speculated in stocks and made ten million another is in heaven and the third married a poor girl whom he loved the answer then said dicky is held by the almighty wall street and cupid so the question remains this queried the captain including dicky s surroundings in a significant gesture of his hand is it it is notiit is not connected with the business of your little shop there is no failure in your plans no no said dicky this is merely the result of a little private affair of mine a digression from the regular line of business they say for a complete life a man must know poverty love and war but they don t go well together capitan mio no there is no failure in my business the little shop is doing very well when the captain had departed dicky called the sergeant of the jail squad and asked am i preso by the military or by the civil authority surely there is no martial law in effect now senor bueno now go or send to the alcalde the juez de la paz and the jefe de los policios tell them i am prepared at once to satisfy the demands of justice a folded bill of the long green slid into the sergeant s hand then dicky s smile came back again for he knew that the hours of his captivity were numbered and he hummed in time with the sentry s tread they re hanging men and women now for lacking of the green so that night dicky sat by the window of the room over his shop an his little saint sat close by working at something silken and dainty dicky was thoughtful and grave his red hair was in an unusual state of disorder pasa s fingers often ached to smooth and arrange it but dicky would never allow it he was poring tonight over a great litter of maps and books and papers on his table until that perpendicular line came between his brows that always distressed pasa presently she went and brought his hat and stood with it until he looked up inquiringly it is sad for you here she explained go out and drink vino blanco come back when you get that smile you used to wear that is what i wish to see dicky laughed and threw down his papers the vino blanco stage is past it has served its turn perhaps after all there was less entered my mouth and more my ears than people thought but there will be no more maps or frowns tonight i promise you that come they sat upon a reed silleta at the window and watched the quivering gleams from the lights of the catarina reflected in the harbor presently pasa rippled out one of her infrequent chirrups of audible laughter i was thinking she began anticipating dicky s question of the foolish things girls have in their minds because i went to school in the states i used to have ambitions nothing less than to be the president s wife would satisfy me and look thou red picaroon to what obscure fate thou hast stolen me don t give up hope said dicky smiling more than one irishman has been the ruler of a south american country there was a dictator of chili named o higgins why not a president maloney of anchuria say the word santita mia and we ll make the race no no no thou red haired reckless one sighed pasa i am content she laid her head against his arm here xvi rouge et noir it has been indicated that disaffection followed the elevation of losada to the presidency this feeling continued to grow throughout the entire republic there seemed to be a spirit of silent sullen discontent even the old liberal party to which goodwin zavalla and other patriots had lent their aid was disappointed losada had failed to become a popular idol fresh taxes fresh import duties and more than all his tolerance of the outrageous oppression of citizens by the military had rendered him the most obnoxious president since the despicable alforan the majority of his own cabinet were out of sympathy with him the army which he had courted by giving it license to tyrannize had been his main and thus far adequate support but the most impolitic of the administration s moves had been when it antagonized the vesuvius fruit company an organization plying twelve steamers with a cash capital somewhat larger than anchuria s surplus and debt combined reasonably an established concern like the vesuvius would become irritated at having a small retail republic with no rating at all attempt to squeeze it so when the government proxies applied for a subsidy they encountered a polite refusal the president at once retaliated by clapping an export duty of one real per bunch on bananas a thing unprecedented in fruit growing countries the vesuvius company had invested large sums in wharves and plantations along the anchurian coast their agents had erected fine homes in the towns where they had their headquarters and heretofore had worked with the republic in good will and with advantage to both it would lose an immense sum if compelled to move out the selling price of bananas from vera cruz to trinidad was three reales per bunch this new duty of one real would have ruined the fruit growers in anchuria and have seriously discommoded the vesuvius company had it declined to pay it but for some reason the vesuvius continued to buy anchurian fruit paying four reals for it and not suffering the growers to bear the loss this apparent victory deceived his excellency and he began to hunger for more of it he sent an emissary to request a conference with a representative of the fruit company the vesuvius sent mr franzoni a little stout cheerful man always cool and whistling airs from verdi s operas senor espirition of the office of the minister of finance attempted the sandbagging in behalf of anchuria the meeting took place in the cabin of the salvador of the vesuvius line senor espirition opened negotiations by announcing that the government contemplated the building of a railroad to skirt the alluvial coast lands after touching upon the benefits such a road would confer upon the interests of the vesuvius he reached the definite suggestion that a contribution to the road s expenses of say fifty thousand pesos would not be more than an equivalent to benefits received mr franzoni denied that his company would receive any benefits from a contemplated road as its representative he must decline to contribute fifty thousand pesos but he would assume the responsibility of offering twenty five did senor espirition understand senor franzoni to mean twenty five thousand pesos by no means twenty five pesos and in silver not in gold your offer insults my government cried senor espirition rising with indignation then said mr franzoni in warning tone we will change it the offer was never changed could mr franzoni have meant the government this was the state of affairs in anchuria when the winter season opened at coralio at the end of the second year of losada s administration so when the government and society made its annual exodus to the seashore it was evident that the presidential advent would not be celebrated by unlimited rejoicing the tenth of november was the day set for the entrance into coralio of the gay company from the capital a narrow gauge railroad runs twenty miles into the interior from solitas the government party travels by carriage from san mateo to this road s terminal point and proceeds by train to solitas from here they march in grand procession to coralio where on the day of their coming festivities and ceremonies abound but this season saw an ominous dawning of the tenth of november although the rainy season was over the day seemed to hark back to reeking june a fine drizzle of rain fell all during the forenoon the procession entered coralio amid a strange silence president losada was an elderly man grizzly bearded with a considerable ratio of indian blood revealed in his cinnamon complexion his carriage headed the procession surrounded and guarded by captain cruz and his famous troop of one hundred light horse el ciento huilando colonel rocas followed with a regiment of the regular army the president s sharp beady eyes glanced about him for the expected demonstration of welcome but he faced a stolid indifferent array of citizens sightseers the anchurians are by birth and habit and they turned out to their last able bodied unit to witness the scene but they maintained an accusive silence they crowded the streets to the very wheel ruts they covered the red tile roofs to the eaves but there was never a viva from them no wreaths of palm and lemon branches or gorgeous strings of paper roses hung from the windows and balconies as was the custom there was an apathy a dull dissenting disapprobation that was the more ominous because it puzzled no one feared an outburst a revolt of the discontents for they had no leader the president and those loyal to him had never even heard whispered a name among them capable of crystallizing the dissatisfaction into opposition no there could be no danger the people always procured a new idol before they destroyed an old one at length after a prodigious galloping and curvetting of red sashed majors gold laced colonels and epauletted generals the procession formed for its annual progress down the calle grande to the casa morena where the ceremony of welcome to the visiting president always took place the swiss band led the line of march after it pranced the local comandante mounted and a detachment of his troops next came a carriage with four members of the cabinet conspicuous among them the minister of war old general pilar with his white moustache and his soldierly bearing then the president s vehicle containing also the ministers of finance and state and surrounded by captain cruz s light horse formed in a close double file of fours following them the rest of the officials of state the judges and distinguished military and social ornaments of public and private life as the band struck up and the movement began like a bird of ill omen the valhalla the swiftest steamship of the vesuvius line glided into the harbor in plain view of the president and his train of course there was nothing menacing about its arrival a business firm does not go to war with a nation but it reminded senor espirition and others in those carriages that the vesuvius fruit company was undoubtedly carrying something up its sleeve for them by the time the van of the procession had reached the government building captain cronin of the valhalla and mr vincenti member of the vesuvius company had landed and were pushing their way bluff hearty and nonchalant through the crowd on the narrow sidewalk clad in white linen big debonair with an air of good humored authority they made conspicuous figures among the dark mass of unimposing anchurians as they penetrated to within a few yards of the steps of the casa morena looking easily above the heads of the crowd they perceived another that towered above the undersized natives it was the fiery poll of dicky maloney against the wall close by the lower step and his broad seductive grin showed that he recognized their presence dicky had attired himself becomingly for the festive occasion in a well fitting black suit pasa was close by his side her head covered with the ubiquitous black mantilla mr vincenti looked at her attentively botticelli s madonna he remarked gravely i wonder when she got into the game i don t like his getting tangled with the women i hoped he would keep away from them captain cronin s laugh almost drew attention from the parade with that head of hair keep away from the women and a maloney hasn t he got a license but nonsense aside what do you think of the prospects it s a species of filibustering out of my line vincenti glanced again at dicky s head and smiled rouge et noir he said there you have it make your play gentlemen our money is on the red the lad s game said cronin with a commending look at the tall easy figure by the steps but tis all like fly by night theatricals to me the talk s bigger than the stage there s a smell of gasoline in the air and they re their own audience and scene shifters they ceased talking for general pilar had descended from the first carriage and had taken his stand upon the top step of casa morena as the oldest member of the cabinet custom had decreed that he should make the address of welcome presenting the keys of the official residence to the president at its close general pilar was one of the most distinguished citizens of the republic hero of three wars and innumerable revolutions he was an honored guest at european courts and camps an eloquent speaker and a friend to the people he represented the highest type of the anchurians holding in his hand the gilt keys of casa morena he began his address in a historical form touching upon each administration and the advance of civilization and prosperity from the first dim striving after liberty down to present times arriving at the regime of president losada at which point according to precedent he should have delivered a eulogy upon its wise conduct and the happiness of the people general pilar paused then he silently held up the bunch of keys high above his head with his eyes closely regarding it the ribbon with which they were bound fluttered in the breeze it still blows cried the speaker exultantly citizens of anchuria give thanks to the saints this night that our air is still free thus disposing of losada s administration he abruptly reverted to that of olivarra anchuria s most popular ruler olivarra had been assassinated nine years before while in the prime of life and usefulness a faction of the liberal party led by losada himself had been accused of the deed whether guilty or not it was eight years before the ambitious and scheming losada had gained his goal upon this theme general pilar s eloquence was loosed he drew the picture of the beneficent olivarra with a loving hand he reminded the people of the peace the security and the happiness they had enjoyed during that period he recalled in vivid detail and with significant contrast the last winter sojourn of president olivarra in coralio when his appearance at their fiestas was the signal for thundering vivas of love and approbation the first public expression of sentiment from the people that day followed a low sustained murmur went among them like the surf rolling along the shore ten dollars to a dinner at the saint charles remarked mr vincenti that rouge wins i never bet against my own interests said captain cronin lighting a cigar long winded old boy for his age what s he talking about my spanish replied vincenti runs about ten words to the minute his is something around two hundred whatever he s saying he s getting them warmed up friends and brothers general pilar was saying could i reach out my hand this day across the lamentable silence of the grave to olivarra the good to the ruler who was one of you whose tears fell when you sorrowed and whose smile followed your joy i would bring him back to you but olivarra is dead dead at the hands of a craven assassin the speaker turned and gazed boldly into the carriage of the president his arm remained extended aloft as if to sustain his peroration the president was listening aghast at this remarkable address of welcome he was sunk back upon his seat trembling with rage and dumb surprise his dark hands tightly gripping the carriage cushions half rising he extended one arm toward the speaker and shouted a harsh command at captain cruz the leader of the flying hundred sat his horse immovable with folded arms giving no sign of having heard losada sank back again his dark features distinctly paling who says that olivarra is dead suddenly cried the speaker his voice old as he was sounding like a battle trumpet his body lies in the grave but to the people he loved he has bequeathed his spirit yes more his learning his courage his kindness yes more his youth his image people of anchuria have you forgotten ramon the son of olivarra cronin and vincenti watching closely saw dicky maloney suddenly raise his hat tear off his shock of red hair leap up the steps and stand at the side of general pilar the minister of war laid his arm across the young man s shoulders all who had known president olivarra saw again his same lion like pose the same frank undaunted expression the same high forehead with the peculiar line of the clustering crisp black hair general pilar was an experienced orator he seized the moment of breathless silence that preceded the storm citizens of anchuria he trumpeted holding aloft the keys of casa morena i am here to deliver these keys the keys to your homes and liberty to your chosen president shall i deliver them to enrico olivarra s assassin or to his son olivarra olivarra the crowd shrieked and howled all vociferated the magic name men women children and the parrots and the enthusiasm was not confined to the blood of the plebs colonel rocas ascended the steps and laid his sword theatrically at young ramon olivarra s feet four members of the cabinet embraced him captain cruz gave a command and twenty of el ciento huilando dismounted and arranged themselves in a cordon about the steps of casa morena but ramon olivarra seized that moment to prove himself a born genius and politician he waved those soldiers aside and descended the steps to the street there without losing his dignity or the distinguished elegance that the loss of his red hair brought him betook the proletariat to his bosom the barefooted the dirty indians caribs babies beggars old young saints soldiers and sinners he missed none of them while this act of the drama was being presented the scene shifters had been busy at the duties that had been assigned to them two of cruz s dragoons had seized the bridle reins of losada s horses others formed a close guard around the carriage and they galloped off with the tyrant and his two unpopular ministers no doubt a place had been prepared for them there are a number of well barred stone apartments in coralio rouge wins said mr vincenti calmly lighting another cigar captain cronin had been intently watching the vicinity of the stone steps for some time good boy he exclaimed suddenly as if relieved i wondered if he was going to forget his kathleen mavourneen young olivarra had reascended the steps and spoken a few words to general pilar then that distinguished veteran descended to the ground and approached pasa who still stood wonder eyed where dicky had left her with his plumed hat in his hand and his medals and decorations shining on his breast the general spoke to her and gave her his arm and they went up the stone steps of the casa morena together and then ramon olivarra stepped forward and took both her hands before all the people and while the cheering was breaking out afresh everywhere captain cronin and mr vincenti turned and walked back toward the shore where the gig was waiting for them there ll be another presidente proclamada in the morning said mr vincenti musingly as a rule they are not as reliable as the elected ones but this youngster seems to have some good stuff in him he planned and maneuvered the entire campaign olivarra s widow you know was wealthy after her husband was assassinated she went to the states and educated her son at yale the vesuvius company hunted him up and backed him in the little game it s a glorious thing said cronin half jestingly to be able to discharge a government and insert one of your own choosing in these days oh it is only amatter of business said vincenti stopping and offering the stump of his cigar to a monkey that swung down from a lime tree and that is what moves the world of today that extra real on the price of bananas had to go we took the shortest way of removing it xvii two recalls there remains three duties to be performed before the curtain falls upon the patched comedy two have been promised the third is no less obligatory it was set forth in the program of this tropic vaudeville that it would be made known why shorty day of the columbia detective agency lost his position also that smith should come again to tell us what mystery he followed that night on the shores of anchuria when he strewed so many cigar stumps around the coconut palm during his lonely night vigil on the beach these things were promised but a bigger thing yet remains to be accomplished the clearing up of a seeming wrong that has been done according to the array of chronicled facts truthfully set forth that have been presented and one voice speaking shall do these three things two men sat on a stringer of a north river pier in the city of new york a steamer from the tropics had begun to unload bananas and oranges on the pier now and then a banana or two would fall from an overripe bunch and one of the two men would shamble forward seize the fruit and return to share it with his companion one of the men was in the ultimate stage of deterioration as far as rain and wind and sun could wreck the garments he wore it had been done in his person the ravages of drink were as plainly visible and yet upon his high bridged rubicund nose was jauntily perched a pair of shining and flawless gold rimmed glasses the other man was not so far gone upon the descending highway of the incompetents truly the flower of his manhood had gone to seed seed that perhaps no soil might sprout but there were still cross cuts along where he travelled through which he might yet regain the pathway of usefulness without disturbing the slumbering miracles this man was short and compactly built he had an oblique dead eye like that of a sting ray and the moustache of a cocktail mixer we know the eye and the moustache we know that smith of the luxurious yacht the gorgeous raiment the mysterious mission the magic disappearance has come again though shorn of the accessories of his former state at his third banana the man with the nose glasses spat it from him with a shudder deuce take all fruit he remarked in a patrician tone of disgust i lived for two years where these things grow the memory of their taste lingers with you the oranges are not so bad just see if you can gather a couple of them o day when the next broken crate comes up did you live down with the monkeys asked the other made tepidly garrulous by the sunshine and the alleviating meal of juicy fruit i was down there once myself but only for a few hours that was when i was with the columbia detective agency the monkey people did me up i d have my job yet if it hadn t been for them i ll tell you about it one day the chief sent a note around to the office that read send o day here at once for a big piece of business i was the crack detective of the agency at that time they always handed me the big jobs the address the chief wrote from was down in the wall street district when i got there i found him in a private office with a lot of directors who were looking pretty fuzzy they stated the case the president of the republic insurance company had skipped with about a tenth of a million dollars in cash the directors wanted him back pretty bad but they wanted the money worse they said they needed it they had traced the old gent s movements to where he boarded a tramp fruit steamer bound for south america that same morning with his daughter and a big gripsack all the family he had one of the directors had his steam yacht coaled and with steam up ready for a trip and he turned her over to me cart blongsh in four hours i was on board of her and hot on the trail of the fruit tub i had a pretty good idea where old wahrfield that was his name j churchill wahrfield would head for at that time we had a treaty with about every foreign country except belgium and that banana republic anchuria there wasn t a photo of old wahrfield to be had in new york he had been foxy there but i had his description and besides the lady with him would be a dead give away anywhere she was one of the high flyers in society not the kind that have their pictures in the sunday papers but the real sort that open chrysanthemum shows and christen battleships well sir we never got a sight of that fruit tub on the road the ocean is a pretty big place and i guess we took different paths across it but we kept going toward this anchuria where the fruiter was bound for we struck the monkey coast one afternoon about four there was a ratty looking steamer off shore taking on bananas the monkeys were loading her up with big barges it might be the one the old man had taken and it might not i went ashore to look around the scenery was pretty good i never saw any finer on the new york stage i struck an american on shore a big cool chap standing around with the monkeys he showed me the consul s office the consul was a nice young fellow he said the fruiter was the karlsefin running generally to new orleans but took her last cargo to new york then i was sure my people were on board although everybody told me that no passengers had landed i didn t think they would land until after dark for they might have been shy about it on account of seeing that yacht of mine hanging around so all i had to do was to wait and nab em when they came ashore i couldn t arrest old wahrfield without extradition papers but my play was to get the cash they generally give up if you strike em when they re tired and rattled and short on nerve after dark i sat under a coconut tree on the beach for a while and then i walked around and investigated that town some and it was enough to give you the lions if a man could stay in new york and be honest he d better do it than to hit that monkey town with a million dinky little mud houses grass over your shoe tops in the streets ladies in low neck and short sleeves walking around smoking cigars tree frogs rattling like a hose cart going to a ten blow big mountains dropping gravel in the back yards and the sea licking the paint off in front no sir a man had better be in god s country living on free lunch than there the main street ran along the beach and i walked down it and then turned up a kind of lane where the houses were made of poles and straw i wanted to see what the monkeys did when they weren t climbing coconut trees the very first shack i looked in i saw my people they must have come ashore while i was promenading a man about fifty smooth face heavy eyebrows dressed in black broadcloth looking like he was just about to say can any little boy in the sunday school answer that he was freezing on to a grip that weighed like a dozen gold bricks and a swell girl a regular peach with a fifth avenue cut was sitting on a wooden chair an old black woman was fixing some coffee and beans on a table the light they had come from a lantern hung on a nail i went and stood in the door and they looked at me and i said mr wahrfield you are my prisoner i hope for the lady s sake you will take the matter sensibly you know why i want you who are you says the old gent o day says i of the columbia detective agency and now sir let me give you a piece of good advice you go back and take your medicine like a man hand em back the boodle and maybe they ll let you off light go back easy and i ll put in a word for you i ll give you five minutes to decide i pulled out my watch and waited then the young lady chipped in she was one of the genuine high steppers you could tell by the way her clothes fit and the style she had that fifth avenue was made for her come inside she says don t stand in the door and disturb the whole street with that suit of clothes now what is it you want three minutes gone i said i ll tell you again while the other two tick off you ll admit being the president of the republic won t you i am says he well then says i it ought to be plain to you wanted in new york j churchill wahrfield president of the republic insurance company also the funds belonging to said company now in that grip in the unlawful possession of said j churchill wahrfield oh h h h says the young lady as if she was thinking you want to take us back to new york to take mr wahrfield there s no charge against you miss there ll be no objection of course to your returning with your father of a sudden the girl gave a tiny scream and grabbed the old boy around the neck oh father father she says kind of contralto can this be true have you taken money that is not yours speak father it made you shiver to hear the tremolo stop she put on her voice the old boy looked pretty bughouse when she first grappled him but she went on whispering in his ear and patting his offshoulder till he stood still but sweating a little she got him to one side and they talked together a minute and then he put on some gold eyeglasses and walked up and handed me the grip mr detective he says talking a little broken i conclude to return with you i have finished to discover that life on this desolate and displeased coast would be worse than to die itself i will go back and hurl myself upon the mercy of the republic company have you brought a sheep sheep says i i haven t a single ship cut in the young lady don t get funny father is of german birth and doesn t speak perfect english how did you come up the girl was all broke up she had a handkerchief to her face and kept saying every little bit h father father she walked up to me and laid her lily white hand on the clothes that had pained her at first i smelt a million violets she was a lulu i told her i came in a private yacht mr o day she says oh take us away from this horrid country at once can you will you say you will i ll try i said concealing the fact that i was dying to get them on salt water before they could change their mind one thing they both kicked against was going through the town to the boat landing said they dreaded publicity and now that they were going to return they had a hope that the thing might yet be kept out of the papers they swore they wouldn t go unless i got them out to the yacht without any one knowing it so i agreed to humor them the sailors who rowed me ashore were playing billiards in a bar room near the water waiting for orders and i proposed to have them take the boat down the beach half a mile or so and take us up there how to get them word was the question for i couldn t leave the grip with the prisoner and i couldn t take it with me not knowing but what the monkeys might stick me up the young lady says the old colored woman would take them a note i sat down and wrote it and gave it to the dame with plain directions what to do and she grins like a baboon and shakes her head then mr wahrfield handed her a string of foreign dialect and she nods her head and says see senor maybe fifty times and lights out with the note ld augusta only understands german said miss wahrfield smiling at me we stopped in her house to ask where we could find lodging and she insisted upon our having coffee she tells us she was raised in a german family in san domingo very likely i said but you can search me for german words except nix verstay and noch einst i would have called that see senor french though on a gamble well we three made a sneak around the edge of town so as not to be seen we got tangled in vines and ferns and the banana bushes and tropical scenery a good deal the monkey suburbs was as wild as places in central park we came out on the beach a good half mile below a brown chap was lying asleep under a coconut tree with a ten foot musket beside him mr wahrfield takes up the gun and pitches it into the sea the coast is guarded he says rebellion and plots ripen like fruit he pointed to the sleeping man who never stirred thus he says they perform trusts children i saw our boat coming and i struck a match and lit a piece of newspaper to show them where we were in thirty minutes we were on board the yacht the first thing mr wahrfield and his daughter and i took the grip into the owner s cabin opened it up and took an inventory there was one hundred and five thousand dollars united states treasury notes in it besides a lot of diamond jewelry and a couple of hundred havana cigars i gave the old man the cigars and a receipt for the rest of the lot as agent for the company and locked the stuff up in my private quarters i never had a pleasanter trip than that one after we got to sea the young lady turned out to be the jolliest ever the very first time we sat down to dinner and the steward filled her glass with champagne that director s yacht was a regular floating waldorf astoria she winks at me and says what s the use to borrow trouble mr fly cop here s hoping you may live to eat the hen that scratches on your grave there was a piano on board and she sat down to it and sung better than you give up two cases to hear plenty times she knew about nine operas clean through she was sure enough bon ton and swell she wasn t one of the among others present kind she belonged on the special mention list the old man too perked up amazingly on the way he passed the cigars and says to me once quite chipper out of a cloud of smoke mr o day somehow i think the republic company will not give me the much trouble guard well the gripvalise of the money mr o day for that it must be returned to them that it belongs when we finish to arrive when we landed in new york i phoned to the chief to meet us in that director s office we got in a cab and went there i carried the grip and we walked in and i was pleased to see that the chief had got together that same old crowd of moneybugs with pink faces and white vests to see us march in i set the grip on the table there s the money i said and your prisoner said the chief i pointed to mr wahrfield and he stepped forward and says the honor of a word with you sir to explain he and the chief went into another room and stayed ten minutes when they came back the chief looked as black as a ton of coal did this gentleman he says to me have this valise in his possession when you first saw him he did said i the chief took up the grip and handed it to the prisoner with a bow and says to the director crowd do any of you recognize this gentleman they all shook their pink faces allow me to present he goes on senor miraflores president of the republic of anchuria the senor has generously consented to overlook this outrageous blunder on condition that we undertake to secure him against the annoyance of public comment it is a concession on his part to overlook an insult for which he might claim international redress i think we can gratefully promise him secrecy in the matter they gave him a pink nod all round o day he says to me as a private detective you re wasted in a war where kidnapping governments is in the rules you d be invaluable come down to the office at eleven i knew what that meant so that s the president of the monkeys says i well why couldn t he have said so wouldn t it jar you xviii the vitagraphoscope vaudeville is intrinsically episodic and discontinuous its audiences do not demand denouements sufficient unto each turn is the evil thereof no one cares how many romances the singing comedienne may have had if she can capably sustain the limelight and a high note or two the audiences reck not if the performing dogs get to the pound the moment they have jumped through their last hoop they do not desire bulletins about the possible injuries received by the comic cyclist who retires head first from the stage in a crash of property china ware neither do they consider that their seat coupons entitle them to be instructed whether or no there is a sentiment between the lady solo banjoist and the irish monologist therefore let us have no lifting of the curtain upon a tableau of the united lovers backgrounded by defeated villainy and derogated by the comic osculating maid and butler thrown in as a sop to the cerberi of the fifty cent seats but our program ends with a brief turn or two and then to the exits whoever sits the show out may find if he will the slender thread that binds together though ever so slightly the story that perhaps only the walrus will understand extracts from a letter from the first vice president of the republic insurance company of new

the artist a young man of prepossessing appearance sits in a dejected attitude amid a litter of sketches with his head resting upon his hand an oil stove stands on a pine box in the center of the studio the artist rises tightens his waist belt to another hole and lights the stove he goes to a tin bread box half hidden by a screen takes out a solitary link of sausage turns the box upside down to show that there is no more and chucks the sausage into a frying pan which he sets upon the stove the flame of the stove goes out showing that there is no more oil the artist in evident despair seizes the sausage in a sudden access of rage and hurls it violently from him at the same time a door opens and a man who enters receives the sausage forcibly against his nose he seems to cry out and is observed to make a dance step or two vigorously the newcomer is a ruddy faced active keen looking man apparently of irish ancestry next he is observed to laugh immoderately he kicks over the stove he claps the artist who is vainly striving to grasp his hand vehemently upon the back then he goes through a pantomime which to the sufficiently intelligent spectator reveals that he has acquired large sums of money by trading pot metal hatchets and razors to the indians of the cordillera mountains for gold dust he draws a roll of money as large as a small loaf of bread from his pocket and waves it above his head while at the same time he makes pantomime of drinking from a glass the artist hurriedly secures his hat and the two leave the studio together the writing on the sands scene the beach at nice a woman beautiful still young exquisitely clothed complacent poised reclines near the water idly scrawling letters in the sand with the staff of her silken parasol the beauty of her face is audacious her languid pose is one that you feel to be impermanent you wait expectant for her to spring or glide or crawl like a panther that has unaccountably become stock still she idly scrawls in the sand and the word that she always writes is isabel a man sits a few yards away you can see that they are companions ever if no longer comrades his face is dark and smooth and almost inscrutable but not quite the two speak little together the man also scratches on the sand with his cane and the word that he writes is anchuria and then he looks out where the mediterranean and the sky intermingle with death in his gaze the wilderness and thou scene the borders of a gentleman s estate in a tropical land an old indian with a mahogany colored face is trimming the grass on a grave by a mangrove swamp presently he rises to his feet and walks slowly toward a grove that is shaded by the gathering brief twilight in the edge of the grove stands a man who is stalwart with a kind and courteous air and a woman of a serene and clear cut loveliness when the old indian comes up to them the man drops money in his hand the grave tender with the stolid pride of his race takes it as his due and goes his way the two in the edge of the grove turn back along the dim pathway and walk close close for after all what is the world at its best but a little round field of the moving pictures with two walking together in it curtain the four million not very long ago some one invented the assertion that there were only four hundred people in new york city who were really worth noticing but a wiser man has arisen the census taker and his larger estimate of human interest has been preferred in marking out the field of these little stories of the four million tobin s palm tobin and me the two of us went down to coney one day for there was four dollars between us and tobin had need of distractions for there was katie mahorner his sweetheart of county sligo lost since she started for america three months before with two hundred dollars her own savings and one hundred dollars from the sale of tobin s inherited estate a fine cottage and pig on the bog shannaugh and since the letter that tobin got saying that she had started to come to him not a bit of news had he heard or seen of katie mahorner tobin advertised in the papers but nothing could be found of the colleen so to coney me and tobin went thinking that a turn at the chutes and the smell of the popcorn might raise the heart in his bosom but tobin was a hardheaded man and the sadness stuck in his skin he ground his teeth at the crying balloons he cursed the moving pictures and though he would drink whenever asked he scorned punch and judy and was for licking the tintype men as they came so i gets him down a side way on a board walk where the attractions were some less violent at a little six by eight stall tobin halts with a more human look in his eye tis here says he i will be diverted i ll have the palm of me hand investigated by the wonderful palmist of the nile and see if what is to be will be tobin was a believer in signs and the unnatural in nature he possessed illegal convictions in his mind along the subjects of black cats lucky numbers and the weather predictions in the papers we went into the enchanted chicken coop which was fixed mysterious with red cloth and pictures of hands with lines crossing em like a railroad centre the sign over the door says it is madame zozo the egyptian palmist there was a fat woman inside in a red jumper with pothooks and beasties embroidered upon it tobin gives her ten cents and extends one of his hands she lifts tohin s hand which is own brother to the hoof of a drayhorse and examines it to see whether tis a stone in the frog or a cast shoe he has come for man says this madame zozo the line of your fate shows tis not me foot at all says tobin interrupting sure tis no beauty but ye hold the palm of me hand the line shows says the madame that ye ve not arrived at your time of life without bad luck and there s more to come the mound of venus or is that a stone bruise shows that ye ve been in love there s been trouble in your life on account of your sweetheart tis katie mahorner she has references with whispers tobin to me in a loud voice to one side i see says the palmist a great deal of sorrow and tribulation with one whom ye cannot forget i see the lines of designation point to the letter k and the letter m in her name whist says tobin to me do ye hear that look out goes on the palmist for a dark man and a light woman for they ll both bring ye trouble ye ll make a voyage upon the water very soon and have a financial loss i see one line that brings good luck there s a man coming into your life who will fetch ye good fortune ye ll know him when ye see him by his crooked nose is his name set down asks tobin twill be convenient in the way of greeting when he backs up to dump off the good luck his name says the palmist thoughtful looking is not spelled out by the lines but they indicate tis a long one and the letter o should be in it there s no more to tell good evening don t block up the door tis wonderful how she knows says tobin as we walk to the pier as we squeezed through the gates a nigger man sticks his lighted segar against tobin s ear and there is trouble tobin hammers his neck and the women squeal and by presence of mind i drag the little man out of the way before the police comes tobin is always in an ugly mood when enjoying himself on the boat going back when the man calls who wants the good looking waiter tobin tried to plead guilty feeling the desire to blow the foam off a crock of suds but when he felt in his pocket he found himself discharged for lack of evidence somebody had disturbed his change during the commotion so we sat dry upon the stools listening to the dagoes fiddling on deck if anything tobin was lower in spirits and less congenial with his misfortunes than when we started on a seat against the railing was a young woman dressed suitable for red automobiles with hair the colour of an unsmoked meerschaum in passing by tobin kicks her foot without intentions and being polite to ladies when in drink he tries to give his hat a twist while apologising but he knocks it off and the wind carries it overboard tobin came back and sat down and i began to look out for him for the man s adversities were becoming frequent he was apt when pushed so close by hard luck to kick the best dressed man he could see and try to take command of the boat presently tobin grabs my arm and says excited jawn says he do ye know what we re doing we re taking a voyage upon the water there now says i subdue yeself the boat l land in ten minutes more look says he at the light lady upon the bench and have ye forgotten the nigger man that burned me ear and isn t the money i had gone a dollar sixty five it was i thought he was no more than summing up his catastrophes so as to get violent with good excuse as men will do and i tried to make him understand such things was trifles listen says tobin ye ve no ear for the gift of prophecy or the miracles of the inspired what did the palmist lady tell ye out of me hand tis coming true before your eyes look out says she for a dark man and a light woman they ll bring ye trouble have ye forgot the nigger man though be got some of it back from me fist can ye show me a lighter woman than the blonde lady that was the cause of me hat falling in the water and where s the dollar sixty five i had in me vest when we left the shooting gallery the way tobin put it it did seem to corroborate the art of prediction though it looked to me that these accidents could happen to any one at coney without the implication of palmistry tobin got up and walked around on deck looking close at the passengers out of his little red eyes i asked him the interpretation of his movements ye never know what tobin has in his mind until he begins to carry it out ye should know says he i m working out the salvation promised by the lines in me palm i m looking for the crooked nose man that s to bring the good luck tis all that will save us jawn did ye ever see a straighter nosed gang of hellions in the days of your life twas the nine thirty boat and we landed and walked up town through twenty second street tobin being without his hat on a street corner standing under a gas light and looking over the elevated road at the moon was a man a long man he was dressed decent with a segar between his teeth and i saw that his nose made two twists from bridge to end like the wriggle of a snake tobin saw it at the same time and i heard him breathe hard like a horse when you take the saddle off he went straight up to the man and i went with him good night to ye tobin says to the man the man takes out his segar and passes the compliments sociable would ye hand us your name asks tobin and let us look at the size of it it may be our duty to become acquainted with ye my name says the man polite is friedenhausman maximus g friedenhausman tis the right length says tobin do you spell it with an o anywhere down the stretch of it i do not says the man can ye spell it with an o inquires tobin turning anxious if your conscience says the man with the nose is indisposed toward foreign idioms ye might to please yourself smuggle the letter into the penultimate syllable tis well says tobin ye re in the presence of jawn malone and daniel tobin tis highly appreciated says the man with a bow and now since i cannot conceive that ye would hold a spelling bee upon the street corner will ye name some reasonable excuse for being at large by the two signs answers tobin trying to explain which

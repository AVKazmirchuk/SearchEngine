repaired and call in at ten we ll be pleased to accommodate you in the matter of this loan it s a slight thing says buckingham skinner modest but as i said only for temporary loose change it s nothing to be ashamed of says i in respect for his mortification in case of an emergency of course it s small compared to organizing a trust or bridge whist but even the chicago university had to be started in a small way what s your graft these days buckingham skinner asks me the legitimate says i i m handling rhinestones and dr oleum sinapi s electric headache battery and the swiss warbler s bird call a small lot of the new queer ones and twos and the bonanza budget consisting of a rolled gold wedding and engagement ring six egyptian lily bulbs a combination pickle fork and nail clipper and fifty engraved visiting cards no two names alike all for the sum of cents two months ago says buckingham skinner i was doing well down in texas with a patent instantaneous fire kindler made of compressed wood ashes and benzine i sold loads of em in towns where they like to burn niggers quick without having to ask somebody for a light and just when i was doing the best they strikes oil down there and puts me out of business your machine s too slow now pardner they tells me we can have a coon in hell with this here petroleum before your old flint and tinder truck can get him warm enough to perfess religion and so i gives up the kindler and drifts up here to k c this little curtain raiser you seen me doing mr pickens with the simulated farm and the hypothetical teams ain t in my line at all and i m ashamed you found me working it no man says i kindly need to be ashamed of putting the skibunk on a loan corporation for even so small a sum as ten dollars when he is financially abashed still it wasn t quite the proper thing it s too much like borrowing money without paying it back i liked buckingham skinner from the start for as good a man as ever stood over the axles and breathed gasoline smoke and pretty soon we gets thick and i let him in on a scheme i d had in mind for some time and offers to go partners anything says buck that is not actually dishonest will find me willing and ready let us perforate into the inwardness of your proposition i feel degraded when i am forced to wear property straw in my hair and assume a bucolic air for the small sum of ten dollars actually mr pickens it makes me feel like the ophelia of the great occidental all star one night consolidated theatrical aggregation this scheme of mine was one that suited my proclivities by nature i am some sentimental and have always felt gentle toward the mollifying elements of existence i am disposed to be lenient with the arts and sciences and i find time to instigate a cordiality for the more human works of nature such as romance and the atmosphere and grass and poetry and the seasons i never skin a sucker without admiring the prismatic beauty of his scales i never sell a little auriferous beauty to the man with the hoe without noticing the beautiful harmony there is between gold and green and that s why i liked this scheme it was so full of outdoor air and landscapes and easy money we had to have a young lady assistant to help us work this graft and i asked buck if he knew of one to fill the bill one says i that is cool and wise and strictly business from her pompadour to her oxfords no ex toe dancers or gum chewers or crayon portrait canvassers for this buck claimed he knew a suitable feminine and he takes me around to see miss sarah malloy the minute i see her i am pleased she looked to be the goods as ordered no sign of the three p s about her no peroxide patchouli nor peau de soie about twenty two brown hair pleasant ways the kind of a lady for the place a description of the sandbag if you please she begins why ma am says i this graft of ours is so nice and refined and romantic it would make the balcony scene in romeo and juliet look like second story work we talked it over and miss malloy agreed to come in as a business partner she said she was glad to get a chance to give up her place as stenographer and secretary to a suburban lot company and go into something respectable this is the way we worked our scheme first i figured it out by a kind of a proverb the best grafts in the world are built up on copy book maxims and psalms and proverbs and esau s fables they seem to kind of hit off human nature our peaceful little swindle was constructed on the old saying the whole push loves a lover one evening buck and miss malloy drives up like blazes in a buggy to a farmer s door she is pale but affectionate clinging to his arm always clinging to his arm any one can see that she is a peach and of the cling variety they claim they are eloping for to be married on account of cruel parents they ask where they can find a preacher farmer says b gum there ain t any preacher nigher than reverend abels four miles over on caney creek farmeress wipes her hand on her apron and rubbers through her specs illustration she is a peach and of the cling variety then lo and look ye up the road from the other way jogs parleyvoo

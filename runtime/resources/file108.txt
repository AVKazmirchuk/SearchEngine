noches beezlebub blythe lingered over his cups polishing his eyeglasses with a disreputable handkerchief i thought i could do it but i couldn t he muttered to himself after a time a gentleman can t blackmail the man that he drinks with viii the admiral spilled milk draws few tears from an anchurian administration many are its lacteal sources and the clocks hands point forever to milking time even the rich cream skimmed from the treasury by the bewitched miraflores did not cause the newly installed patriots to waste time in unprofitable regrets the government philosophically set about supplying the deficiency by increasing the import duties and by suggesting to wealthy private citizens that contributions according to their means would be considered patriotic and in order prosperity was expected to attend the reign of losada the new president the ousted office holders and military favorites organized a new liberal party and began to lay their plans for a re succession thus the game of anchurian politics began like a chinese comedy to unwind slowly its serial length here and there mirth peeps for an instant from the wings and illumines the florid lines a dozen quarts of champagne in conjunction with an informal sitting of the president and his cabinet led to the establishment of the navy and the appointment of felipe carrera as its admiral next to the champagne the credit of the appointment belongs to don sabas placido the newly confirmed minister of war the president had requested a convention of his cabinet for the discussion of questions politic and for the transaction of certain routine matters of state the session had been signally tedious the business and the wine prodigiously dry a sudden prankish humor of don sabas impelling him to the deed spiced the grave affairs of state with a whiff of agreeable playfulness in the dilatory order of business had come a bulletin from the coast department of orilla del mar reporting the seizure by the custom house officers at the town of coralio of the sloop estrella del noche and her cargo of drygoods patent medicines granulated sugar and three star brandy also six martini rifles and a barrel of american whiskey caught in the act of smuggling the sloop with its cargo was now according to law the property of the republic the collector of customs in making his report departed from the conventional forms so far as to suggest that the confiscated vessel be converted to the use of the government the prize was the first capture to the credit of the department in ten years the collector took opportunity to pat his department on the back it often happened that government officers required transportation from point to point along the coast and means were usually lacking furthermore the sloop could be manned by a loyal crew and employed as a coast guard to discourage the pernicious art of smuggling the collector also ventured to nominate one to whom the charge of the boat could be safely intrusted a young man of coralio felipe carrera not be it understood one of extreme wisdom but loyal and the best sailor along the coast it was upon this hint that the minister of war acted executing a rare piece of drollery that so enlivened the tedium of the executive session in the consultation of this small maritime banana republic was a forgotten section that provided for the maintenance of a navy this provision with many other wiser ones had lain inert since the establishment of the republic anchuria had no navy and had no use for one it was characteristic of don sabas a man at once merry learned whimsical and audacious that he should have disturbed the dust of this musty and sleeping statute to increase the humor of the world by so much as a smile from his indulgent colleagues with delightful mock seriousness the minister of war proposed the creation of a navy he argued its need and the glories it might achieve with such gay and witty zeal that the travesty overcame with its humor even the swart dignity of president losada himself the champagne was bubbling trickily in the veins of the mercurial statesmen it was not the custom of the grave governors of anchuria to enliven their sessions with a beverage so apt to cast a veil of disparagement over sober affairs the wine had been a thoughtful compliment tendered by the agent of the vesuvius fruit company as a token of amicable relations and certain consummated deals between that company and the republic of anchuria the jest was carried to

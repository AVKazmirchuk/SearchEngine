frio country put forth easter blossoms of new hats and gowns as faithfully as is done anywhere and the southwest is for one day a mingling of prickly pear paris and paradise and now it was good friday and tonia weaver s easter hat blushed unseen in the desert air of an impotent express car beyond the burned trestle on saturday noon the rogers girls from the shoestring ranch and ella reeves from the anchor o and mrs bennet and ida from green valley would convene at the espinosa and pick up tonia with their easter hats and frocks carefully wrapped and bundled against the dust the fair aggregation would then merrily jog the ten miles to cactus where on the morrow they would array themselves subjugate man do homage to easter and cause jealous agitation among the lilies of the field tonia sat on the steps of the espinosa ranch house flicking gloomily with a quirt at a tuft of curly mesquite she displayed a frown and a contumelious lip and endeavored to radiate an aura of disagreeableness and tragedy i hate railroads she announced positively and men men pretend to run them can you give any excuse why a trestle should burn ida bennet s hat is to be trimmed with violets i shall not go one step toward cactus without a new hat if i were a man i would get one two men listened uneasily to this disparagement of their kind one was wells pearson foreman of the mucho calor cattle ranch the other was thompson burrows the prosperous sheepman from the quintana valley both thought tonia weaver adorable especially when she railed at railroads and menaced men either would have given up his epidermis to make for her an easter hat more cheerfully than the ostrich gives up his tip or the aigrette lays down its life neither possessed the ingenuity to conceive a means of supplying the sad deficiency against the coming sabbath pearson s deep brown face and sunburned light hair gave him the appearance of a schoolboy seized by one of youth s profound and insolvable melancholies tonia s plight grieved him through and through thompson burrows was the more skilled and pliable he hailed from somewhere in the east originally and he wore neckties and shoes and was made dumb by woman s presence the big water hole on sandy creek said pearson scarcely hoping to make a hit was filled up by that last rain oh was it said tonia sharply thank you for the information i suppose a new hat is nothing to you mr pearson i suppose you think a woman ought to wear an old stetson five years without a change as you do if your old water hole could have put out the fire on that trestle you might have some reason to talk about it i am deeply sorry said burrows warned by pearson s fate that you failed to receive your hat miss weaver deeply sorry indeed if there was anything i could do don t bother interrupted tonia with sweet sarcasm if there was anything you could do you d be doing it of course there isn t tonia paused a sudden sparkle of hope had come into her eye her frown smoothed away she had an inspiration there s a store over at lone elm crossing on the nueces she said that keeps hats eva rogers got hers there she said it was the latest style it might have some left but it s twenty eight miles to lone elm the spurs of two men who hastily arose jingled and tonia almost smiled the knights then were not all turned to dust nor were their rowels rust of course said tonia looking thoughtfully at a white gulf cloud sailing across the cerulean dome nobody could ride to lone elm and back by the time the girls call by for me to morrow so i reckon i ll have to stay at home this easter sunday and then she smiled well miss tonia said pearson reaching for his hat as guileful as a sleeping babe i reckon i ll be trotting along back to mucho calor there s some cutting out to be done on dry branch first thing in the morning and me and road runner has got to be on hand it s too bad your hat got sidetracked maybe they ll get that trestle mended yet in time for easter i must be riding too miss tonia announced burrows looking at his watch i declare it s nearly five o clock i must be out at my lambing camp in time to help pen those crazy ewes tonia s suitors seemed to have been smitten with a need for haste they bade her a ceremonious farewell and then shook each other s hands with the elaborate and solemn courtesy of the southwesterner hope i ll see you again soon mr pearson said burrows same here said the cowman with the serious face of one whose friend goes upon a whaling voyage be gratified to see you ride over to mucho calor any time you strike that section of the range pearson mounted road runner the soundest cow pony on the frio and let him pitch for a minute as he always did on being mounted even at the end of a day s travel what kind of a hat was that miss tonia he called that you ordered from san antone i can t help but be sorry about that hat a straw said tonia the latest shape of course trimmed with red roses that s what i like red roses there s no color more becoming to your complexion and hair said burrows admiringly it s what i like said tonia and of all the flowers give me red roses keep all the pinks and blues for yourself but what s the use when trestles burn and leave you

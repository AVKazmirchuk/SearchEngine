cherokee derived his title from the fact that he claimed to have lived for a time with that tribe in the indian nation on the twentieth day of december baldy the mail rider brought yellowhammer a piece of news what do i see in albuquerque said baldy to the patrons of the bar but cherokee all embellished and festooned up like the czar of turkey and lavishin money in bulk him and me seen the elephant and the owl and we had specimens of this seidlitz powder wine and cherokee he audits all the bills c o d his pockets looked like a pool table s after a fifteen ball run cherokee must have struck pay ore remarked california ed well he s white i m much obliged to him for his success seems like cherokee would ramble down to yellowhammer and see his friends said another slightly aggrieved but that s the way prosperity is the finest cure there is for lost forgetfulness you wait said baldy i m comin to that cherokee strikes a three foot vein up in the mariposas that assays a trip to europe to the ton and he closes it out to a syndicate outfit for a hundred thousand hasty dollars in cash then he buys himself a baby sealskin overcoat and a red sleigh and what do you think he takes it in his head to do next chuck a luck said texas whose ideas of recreation were the gamester s come and kiss me ma honey sang shorty who carried tintypes in his pocket and wore a red necktie while working on his claim bought a saloon suggested thirsty rogers cherokee took me to a room continued baldy and showed me he s got that room full of drums and dolls and skates and bags of candy and jumping jacks and toy lambs and whistles and such infantile truck and what do you think he s goin to do with them inefficacious knick knacks don t surmise none cherokee told me he s goin to lead em up in his red sleigh and wait a minute don t order no drinks yet he s goin to drive down here to yellowhammer and give the kids the kids of this here town the biggest christmas tree and the biggest cryin doll and little giant boys tool chest blowout that was ever seen west of the cape hatteras two minutes of absolute silence ticked away in the wake of baldy s words it was broken by the house who

cane on the bar that our friend cherokee should possess such an erroneous conception of ah his as it were own town oh it ain t the eighth wonder of the terrestrial world said baldy cherokee s been gone from yellowhammer over seven months lots of things could happen in that time how s he to know that there ain t a single kid in this town and so far as emigration is concerned none expected come

buzzed for nearly a century were good friends well proven by years of ups and downs together they were seated where they had a habit of meeting in the little creole haunted cafe of madame tibault in dumaine street if you know the place you will experience a thrill of pleasure in recalling it to mind it is small and dark with six little polished tables at which you may sit and drink the best coffee in new orleans and concoctions of absinthe equal to sazerac s best madame tibault fat and indulgent presides at the desk and takes your money nicolette and meme madame s nieces in charming bib aprons bring the desirable beverages dumars with true creole luxury was sipping his absinthe with half closed eyes in a whirl of cigarette smoke robbins was looking over the morning pic detecting as young reporters will the gross blunders in the make up and the envious blue pencilling his own stuff had received this item in the advertising columns caught his eye and with an exclamation of sudden interest he read it aloud to his friend public auction at three o clock this afternoon there will be sold to the highest bidder all the common property of the little sisters of samaria at the home of the sisterhood in bonhomme street the sale will dispose of the building ground and the complete furnishings of the house and chapel without reserve this notice stirred the two friends to a reminiscent talk concerning an episode in their journalistic career that had occurred about two years before they recalled the incidents went over the old theories and discussed it anew from the different perspective time had brought there were no other customers in the cafe madame s fine ear had caught the line of their talk and she came over to their table for had it not been her lost money her vanished twenty thousand dollars that had set the whole matter going the three took up the long abandoned mystery threshing over the old dry chaff of it it was in the chapel of this house of the little sisters of samaria that robbins and dumars had stood during that eager fruitless news search of theirs and looked upon the gilded statue of the virgin thass so boys said madame summing up thass ver wicked man m sieur morin everybody shall be cert he steal those money i plaze in his hand for keep safe yes he s boun spend that money somehow madame turned a broad and contemplative smile upon dumars i ond stand you m sieur dumars those day you come ask fo tell ev ything i know bout m sieur morin ah yes i know most time when those men lose money you say cherchez la femme there is somewhere the woman but not for m sieur morin no boys before he shall die he is like one saint you might s well m sieur dumars go try find those money in the statue of virgin mary that m sieur morin present at those p tite soeurs as try find one femme at madame tibault s last words robbins started slightly and cast a keen sidelong glance at dumars the creole sat unmoved dreamily watching the spirals of his cigarette smoke it was then nine o clock in the morning and a few minutes later the two friends separated going different ways to their day s duties and now follows the brief story of madame tibault s vanished thousands new orleans will readily recall to mind the circumstances attendant upon the death of mr gaspard morin in that city mr morin was an artistic goldsmith and jeweller in the old french quarter and a man held in the highest esteem he belonged to one of the oldest french families and was of some distinction as an antiquary and historian he was a bachelor about fifty years of age he lived in quiet comfort at one of those rare old hostelries in royal street he was found in his rooms one morning dead from unknown causes when his affairs came to be looked into it was found that he was practically insolvent his stock of goods and personal property barely but nearly enough to free him from censure covering his liabilities following came the disclosure that he had been entrusted with the sum of twenty thousand dollars by a former upper servant in the morin family one madame tibault which she had received as a legacy from relatives in france the most searching scrutiny by friends and the legal authorities failed to reveal the disposition of the money it had vanished and left no trace some weeks before his death mr morin had drawn the entire amount in gold coin from the bank where it had been placed while he looked about he told madame tibault for a safe investment therefore mr morin s memory seemed doomed to bear the cloud of dishonesty while madame was of course disconsolate then it was that robbins and dumars representing their respective journals began one of those pertinacious private investigations which of late years the press has adopted as a means to glory and the satisfaction of public curiosity cherchez la femme said dumars that s the ticket agreed robbins all roads lead to the eternal feminine we will find the woman they exhausted the knowledge of the staff of mr morin s hotel from the bell boy down to the proprietor they gently but inflexibly pumped the family of the deceased as far as his cousins twice removed they artfully sounded the employees of the late jeweller and dogged his customers for information concerning his habits like bloodhounds they traced every step of the supposed defaulter as nearly as might be for years along the limited and monotonous paths he had trodden at the end of their labours mr morin stood an immaculate man not one weakness that might be served up as a criminal tendency not one deviation from the path of rectitude not even a hint of a predilection for the opposite sex was found to be placed in his debit his life had been as regular and austere as a monk s his habits simple and unconcealed generous charitable and a model in propriety was the verdict of all who knew him what now asked robbins fingering his empty notebook cherchez la femme said dumars lighting a cigarette try lady bellairs this piece of femininity was the race track favourite of the season being feminine she was erratic in her gaits and there were a few heavy losers about town who had believed she could be true the reporters applied for information mr morin certainly not he was never even a spectator at the races not that kind of a man surprised the gentlemen should ask shall we throw it up suggested robbins and let the puzzle department have a try cherchez la femme hummed dumars reaching for a match try the little sisters of what d you call em it had developed during the investigation that mr morin had held this benevolent order in particular favour he had contributed liberally toward its support and had chosen its chapel as his favourite place of private worship it was said that he went there daily to make his devotions at the altar indeed toward the last of his life his whole mind seemed to have fixed itself upon religious matters perhaps to the detriment of his worldly affairs thither went robbins and dumars and were admitted through the narrow doorway in the blank stone wall that frowned upon bonhomme street an old woman was sweeping the chapel she told them that sister felicite the head of the order was then at prayer at the altar in the alcove in a few moments she would emerge heavy black curtains screened the alcove they waited soon the curtains were disturbed and sister felicite came forth she was tall tragic bony and plain featured dressed in the black gown and severe bonnet of the sisterhood robbins a good rough and tumble reporter but lacking the delicate touch began to speak they represented the press the lady had no doubt heard of the morin affair it was necessary in justice to that gentleman s memory to probe the mystery of the lost money it was known that he had come often to this chapel any information now concerning mr morin s habits tastes the friends he had and so on would be of value in doing him posthumous justice sister felicite had heard whatever she knew would be willingly told but it was very little monsieur morin had been a good friend to the order sometimes contributing as much as a hundred dollars the sisterhood was an independent one depending entirely upon private contributions for the means to carry on its charitable work mr morin had presented the chapel with silver candlesticks and an altar cloth he came every day to worship in the chapel sometimes remaining for an hour he was a devout catholic consecrated to holiness yes and also in the alcove was a statue of the virgin that he had himself modeled cast and presented to the order oh it was cruel to cast a doubt upon so good a man robbins was also profoundly grieved at the imputation but until it was found what mr morin had done with madame tibault s money he feared the tongue of slander would not be stilled sometimes in fact very often in affairs of the kind there was er as the saying goes er a lady in the case in absolute confidence now if perhaps sister felicite s large eyes regarded him solemnly there was one woman she said slowly to whom he bowed to whom he gave his heart robbins fumbled rapturously for his pencil behold the woman said sister felicite suddenly in deep tones she reached a long arm and swept aside the curtain of the alcove in there was a shrine lit to a glow of soft colour by the light pouring through a stained glass window within a deep niche in the bare stone wall stood an image of the virgin mary the colour of pure gold dumars a conventional catholic succumbed to the dramatic in the act he bowed his head for an instant and made the sign of the cross the somewhat abashed robbins murmuring an indistinct apology backed awkwardly away sister felicite drew back the curtain and the reporters departed on the narrow sidewalk of bonhomme street robbins turned to dumars with unworthy sarcasm well what next churchy law fem absinthe said dumars with the history of the missing money thus partially related some conjecture may be formed of the sudden idea that madame tibault s words seemed to have suggested to robbins s brain was it so wild a surmise that the religious fanatic had offered up his wealth or rather madame tibault s in the shape of a material symbol of his consuming devotion stranger things have been done in the name of worship was it not possible that the lost thousands were molded into that lustrous image that the goldsmith had formed it of the pure and precious metal and set it there through some hope of a perhaps disordered brain to propitiate the saints and pave the way to his own selfish glory that afternoon at five minutes to three robbins entered the chapel door of the little sisters of samaria he saw in the dim light a crowd of perhaps a hundred people gathered to attend the sale most of them were members of various religious orders priests and churchmen come to purchase the paraphernalia of the chapel lest they fall into desecrating hands others were business men and agents come to bid upon the realty a clerical looking brother had volunteered to wield the hammer bringing to the office of auctioneer the anomaly of choice diction and dignity of manner a few of the minor articles were sold and then two assistants brought forward the image of the virgin robbins started the bidding at ten dollars a stout man in an ecclesiastical garb went to fifteen a voice from another part of the crowd raised to twenty the three bid alternately raising by bids of five until the offer was fifty dollars then the stout man dropped out and robbins as a sort of coup de main went to a hundred one hundred and fifty said the other voice two hundred bid robbins boldly two fifty called his competitor promptly the reporter hesitated for the space of a lightning flash estimating how much he could borrow from the boys in the office and screw from the business manager from his next month s salary three hundred he offered three fifty spoke up the other in a louder voice a voice that sent robbins diving suddenly through the crowd in its direction to catch dumars its owner ferociously by the collar you unconverted idiot hissed robbins close to his ear pool agreed said dumars coolly i couldn t raise three hundred and fifty dollars with a search warrant but i can stand half what you come bidding against me for i thought i was the only fool in the crowd explained robbins no one else bidding the statue was knocked down to the syndicate at their last offer dumars remained with the prize while robbins hurried forth to wring from the resources and credit of both the price he soon returned with the money and the two musketeers loaded their precious package into a carriage and drove with it to dumars s room in old chartres street nearby they lugged it covered with a cloth up the stairs and deposited it on a table a hundred pounds it weighed if an ounce and at that estimate according to their calculation if their daring theory were correct it stood there worth twenty thousand golden dollars robbins removed the covering and opened his pocket knife sacre muttered dumars shuddering it is the mother of christ what would you do shut up judas said robbins coldly it s too late for you to be saved now with a firm hand he chipped a slice from the shoulder of the image the cut showed a dull grayish metal with a thin coating of gold leaf lead announced robbins hurling his knife to the floor gilded to the devil with it said dumars forgetting his scruples i must have a drink together they walked moodily to the cafe of madame tribault two squares away it seemed that madame s mind had been stirred that day to fresh recollections of the past services of the two young men in her behalf you mustn t sit by those table she interposed as they were about to drop into their accustomed seats thass so boys but no i mek you come at this room like my tres bon amis yes i goin mek for you myself one anisette and one cafe royale ver fine ah i lak treat my fren nize yes plis come in this way madame led them into the little back room into which she sometimes invited the especially favoured of her customers in two comfortable armchairs by a big window that opened upon the courtyard she placed them with a low table between bustling hospitably about she began to prepare the promised refreshments it was the first time the reporters had been honoured with admission to the sacred precincts the room was in dusky twilight flecked with gleams of the polished fine woods and burnished glass and metal that the creoles love from the little courtyard a tiny fountain sent in an insinuating sound of trickling waters to which a banana plant by the window kept time with its tremulous leaves robbins an investigator by nature sent a curious glance roving about the room from some barbaric ancestor madame had inherited a penchant for the crude in decoration the walls were adorned with cheap lithographs florid libels upon nature addressed to the taste of the bourgeoisie birthday cards garish newspaper supplements and specimens of art advertising calculated to reduce the optic nerve to stunned submission a patch of something unintelligible in the midst of the more candid display puzzled robbins and he rose and took a step nearer to interrogate it at closer range then he leaned weakly against the wall and called out madame tibault oh madame since when oh since when have you been in the habit of papering your walls with five thousand dollar united states four per cent gold bonds tell me is this a grimm s fairy tale or should i consult an oculist at his words madame tibault and dumars approached h what you say said madame cheerily h what you say m sieur robbin bon ah those nize li l peezes papier one tam i think those w at you call

observe the fortune returned to her by m sieur morin that best of men that saint in glory marsy said robbins i m going on a jamboree for three days the esteemed pic will have to get along without my

that is guaranteed to produce the desired results her name is belle of kentucky twelve year old bourbon in quarts how does the idea strike you allons said dumars cherchez la femme friends in san rosario the west bound train stopped at san rosario on time at a m a man with a thick black leather wallet under his arm left the train and walked rapidly up the main street of the town there were other passengers who also got off at san rosario but they either slouched limberly over to the railroad eating house or the silver dollar saloon or joined the groups of idlers about the station indecision had no part in the movements of the man with the wallet he was short in stature but strongly built with very light closely trimmed hair smooth determined face and aggressive gold rimmed nose glasses he was well dressed in the prevailing eastern style his air denoted a quiet but conscious reserve force if not actual authority after walking a distance of three squares he came to the centre of the town s business area here another street of importance crossed the main one forming the hub of san rosario s life and commerce upon one corner stood the post office upon another rubensky s clothing emporium the other two diagonally opposing corners were occupied by the town s two banks the first national and the stockmen s national into the first national bank of san rosario the newcomer walked never slowing his brisk step until he stood at the cashier s window the bank opened for business at nine and the working force was already assembled each member preparing his department for the day s business the cashier was examining the mail when he noticed the stranger standing at his window bank doesn t open til nine he remarked curtly but without feeling he had had to make that statement so often to early birds since san rosario adopted city banking hours i am well aware of that said the other man in cool brittle tones will you kindly receive my card the cashier drew the small spotless parallelogram inside the bars of his wicket and read j f c nettlewick national bank examiner oh er will you walk around inside mr er nettlewick your first visit didn t know your business of course walk right around please the examiner was quickly inside the sacred precincts of the bank where he was ponderously introduced to each employee in turn by mr edlinger the cashier a middle aged gentleman of deliberation discretion and method i was kind of expecting sam turner round again pretty soon said mr edlinger sam s been examining us now for about four years i guess you ll find us all right though considering the tightness in business not overly much money on hand but able to stand the storms sir stand the storms mr turner and i have been ordered by the comptroller to exchange districts said the examiner in his decisive formal tones he is covering my old territory in southern illinois and indiana i will take the cash first please perry dorsey the teller was already arranging his cash on the counter for the examiner s inspection he knew it was right to a cent and he had nothing to fear but he was nervous and flustered so was every man in the bank there was something so icy and swift so impersonal and uncompromising about this man that his very presence seemed an accusation he looked to be a man who would never make nor overlook an error mr nettlewick first seized the currency and with a rapid almost juggling motion counted it by packages then he spun the sponge cup toward him and verified the count by bills his thin white fingers flew like some expert musician s upon the keys of a piano he dumped the gold upon the counter with a crash and the coins whined and sang as they skimmed across the marble slab from the tips of his nimble digits the air was full of fractional currency when he came to the halves and quarters he counted the last nickle and dime he had the scales brought and he weighed every sack of silver in the vault he questioned dorsey concerning each of the cash memoranda certain checks charge slips etc carried over from the previous day s work with unimpeachable courtesy yet with something so mysteriously momentous in his frigid manner that the teller was reduced to pink cheeks and a stammering tongue this newly imported examiner was so different from sam turner it had been sam s way to enter the bank with a shout pass the cigars and tell the latest stories he had picked up on his rounds his customary greeting to dorsey had been hello perry haven t skipped out with the boodle yet i see turner s way of counting the cash had been different too he would finger the packages of bills in a tired kind of way and then go into the vault and kick over a few sacks of silver and the thing was done halves and quarters and dimes not for sam turner no chicken feed for me he would say when they were set before him i m not in the agricultural department but then turner was a texan an old friend of the bank s president and had known dorsey since he was a baby while the examiner was counting the cash major thomas b kingman known to every one as major tom the president of the first national drove up to the side door with his old dun horse and buggy and came inside he saw the examiner busy with the money and going into the little pony corral as he called it in which his desk was railed off he began to look over his letters earlier a little incident had occurred that even the sharp eyes of the examiner had failed to notice when he had begun his work at the cash counter mr edlinger had winked significantly at roy wilson the youthful bank messenger and nodded his head slightly toward the front door roy understood got his hat and walked leisurely out with his collector s book under his arm once outside he made a bee line for the stockmen s national that bank was also getting ready to open no customers had as yet presented themselves say you people cried roy with the familiarity of youth and long acquaintance you want to get a move on you there s a new bank examiner over at the first and he s a stem winder he s counting nickles on perry and he s got the whole outfit bluffed mr edlinger gave me the tip to let you know mr buckley president of the stockmen s national a stout elderly man looking like a farmer dressed for sunday heard roy from his private office at the rear and called him has major kingman come down to the bank yet he asked of the boy yes sir he was just driving up as i left said roy i want you to take him a note put it into his own hands as soon as you get back mr buckley sat down and began to write roy returned and handed to major kingman the envelope containing the note the major read it folded it and slipped it into his vest pocket he leaned back in his chair for a few moments as if he were meditating deeply and then rose and went into the vault he came out with the bulky old fashioned leather note case stamped on the back in gilt letters bills discounted in this were the notes due the bank with their attached securities and the major in his rough way dumped the lot upon his desk and began to sort them over by this time nettlewick had finished his count of the cash his pencil fluttered like a swallow over the sheet of paper on which he had set his figures he opened his black wallet which seemed to be also a kind of secret memorandum book made a few rapid figures in it wheeled and transfixed dorsey with the glare of his spectacles that look seemed to say you re safe this time but cash all correct snapped the examiner he made a dash for the individual bookkeeper and for a few minutes there was a fluttering of ledger leaves and a sailing of balance sheets through the air how often do you balance your pass books he demanded suddenly er once a month faltered the individual bookkeeper wondering how many years they would give him all right said the examiner turning and charging upon the general bookkeeper who had the statements of his foreign banks and their reconcilement memoranda ready everything there was found to be all right then the stub book of the certificates of deposit flutter flutter zip zip check all right list of over drafts please thanks h m m unsigned bills of the bank next all right then came the cashier s turn and easy going mr edlinger rubbed his nose and polished his glasses nervously under the quick fire of questions concerning the circulation undivided profits bank real estate and stock ownership presently nettlewick was aware of a big man towering above him at his elbow a man sixty years of age rugged and hale with a rough grizzled beard a mass of gray hair and a pair of penetrating blue eyes that confronted the formidable glasses of the examiner without a flicker er major kingman our president er mr nettlewick said the cashier two men of very different types shook hands one was a finished product of the world of straight lines conventional methods and formal affairs the other was something freer wider and nearer to nature tom kingman had not been cut to any pattern he had been mule driver cowboy ranger soldier sheriff prospector and cattleman now when he was bank president his old comrades from the prairies of the saddle tent and trail found no change in him he had made his fortune when texas cattle were at the high tide of value and had organized the first national bank of san rosario in spite of his largeness of heart and sometimes unwise generosity toward his old friends the bank had prospered for major tom kingman knew men as well as he knew cattle of late years the cattle business had known a depression and the major s bank was one of the few whose losses had not been great and now said the examiner briskly pulling out his watch the last thing is the loans we will take them up now if you please he had gone through the first national at almost record breaking speed but thoroughly as he did everything the running order of the bank was smooth and clean and that had facilitated his work there was but one other bank in the town he received from the government a fee of twenty five dollars for each bank that he examined he should be able to go over those loans and discounts in half an hour if so he could examine the other bank immediately afterward and catch the the only other train that day in the direction he was working otherwise he would have to spend the night and sunday in this uninteresting western town that was why mr nettlewick was rushing matters come with me sir said major kingman in his deep voice that united the southern drawl with the rhythmic twang of the west we will go over them together nobody in the bank knows those notes as i do some of em are a little wobbly on their legs and some are mavericks without extra many brands on their backs but they ll most all pay out at the round up the two sat down at the president s desk first the examiner went through the notes at lightning speed and added up their total finding it to agree with the amount of loans carried on the book of daily balances next he took up the larger loans inquiring scrupulously into the condition of their endorsers or securities the new examiner s mind seemed to course and turn and make unexpected dashes hither and thither like a bloodhound seeking a trail finally he pushed aside all the notes except a few which he arranged in a neat pile before him and began a dry formal little speech i find sir the condition of your bank to be very good considering the poor crops and the depression in the cattle interests of your state the clerical work seems to be done accurately and punctually your past due paper is moderate in amount and promises only a small loss i would recommend the calling in of your large loans and the making of only sixty and ninety day or call loans until general business revives and now there is one thing more and i will have finished with the bank here are six notes aggregating something like they are secured according to their faces by various stocks bonds shares etc to the value of those securities are missing from the notes to which they should be attached i suppose you have them in the safe or vault you will permit me to examine them major tom s light blue eyes turned unflinchingly toward the examiner no sir he said in a low but steady tone those securities are neither in the safe nor in the vault i have taken them you may hold me personally responsible for their absence nettlewick felt a slight thrill he had not expected this he had struck a momentous trail when the hunt was drawing to a close ah said the examiner he waited a moment and then continued may i ask you to explain more definitely the securities were taken by me repeated the major it was not for my own use but to save an old friend in trouble come in here sir and we ll talk it over he led the examiner into the bank s private office at the rear and closed the door there was a desk and a table and half a dozen leather covered chairs on the wall was the mounted head of a texas steer with horns five feet from tip to tip opposite hung the major s old cavalry saber that he had carried at shiloh and fort pillow placing a chair for nettlewick the major seated himself by the window from which he could see the post office and the carved limestone front of the stockmen s national he did not speak at once and nettlewick felt perhaps that the ice could be broken by something so near its own temperature as the voice of official warning your statement he began since you have failed to modify it amounts as you must know to a very serious thing you are aware also of what my duty must compel me to do i shall have to go before the united states commissioner and make i know i know said major tom with a wave of his hand you don t suppose i d run a bank without being posted on national banking laws and the revised statutes do your duty i m not asking any favours but i spoke of my friend i did want you to hear me tell you about bob nettlewick settled himself in his chair there would be no leaving san rosario for him that day he would have to telegraph to the comptroller of the currency he would have to swear out a warrant before the united states commissioner for the arrest of major kingman perhaps he would be ordered to close the bank on account of the loss of the securities it was not the first crime the examiner had unearthed once or twice the terrible upheaval of human emotions that his investigations had loosed had almost caused a ripple in his official calm he had seen bank men kneel and plead and cry like women for a chance an hour s time the overlooking of a single error one cashier had shot himself at his desk before him none of them had taken it with the dignity and coolness of this stern old westerner nettlewick felt that he owed it to him at least to listen if he wished to talk with his elbow on the arm of his chair and his square chin resting upon the fingers of his right hand the bank examiner waited to hear the confession of the president of the first national bank of san rosario when a man s your friend began major tom somewhat didactically for forty years and tried by water fire earth and cyclones when you can do him a little favour you feel like doing it embezzle for him worth of securities thought the examiner we were cowboys together bob and i continued the major speaking slowly and deliberately and musingly as if his thoughts were rather with the past than the critical present and we prospected together for gold and silver over arizona new mexico and a good part of california we were both in the war of sixty one but in different commands we ve fought indians and horse thieves side by side we ve starved for weeks in a cabin in the arizona mountains buried twenty feet deep in snow we ve ridden herd together when the wind blew so hard the lightning couldn t strike well bob and i have been through some rough spells since the first time we met in the branding camp of the old anchor bar ranch and during that time we ve found it necessary more than once to help each other out of tight places in those days it was expected of a man to stick to his friend and he didn t ask any credit for it probably next day you d need him to get at your back and help stand off a band of apaches or put a tourniquet on your leg above a rattlesnake bite and ride for whisky so after all it was give and take and if you didn t stand square with your pardner why you might be shy one when you needed him but bob was a man who was willing to go further than that he never played a limit twenty years ago i was sheriff of this country and i made bob my chief deputy that was before the boom in cattle when we both made our stake i was sheriff and collector and it was a big thing for me then i was married and we had a boy and a girl a four and a six year old there was a comfortable house next to the courthouse furnished by the county rent free and i was saving some money bob did most of the office work both of us had seen rough times and plenty of rustling and danger and i tell you it was great to hear the rain and the sleet dashing against the windows of nights and be warm and safe and comfortable and know you could get up in the morning and be shaved and have folks call you mister and then i had the finest wife and kids that ever struck the range and my old friend with me enjoying the first fruits of prosperity and white shirts and i guess i was happy yes i was happy about that time the major sighed and glanced casually out of the window the bank examiner changed his position and leaned his chin upon his other hand one winter continued the major the money for the county taxes came pouring in so fast that i didn t have time to take the stuff to the bank for a week i just shoved the checks into a cigar box and the money into a sack and locked them in the big safe that belonged to the sheriff s office i had been overworked that week and was about sick anyway my nerves were out of order and my sleep at night didn t seem to rest me the doctor had some scientific name for it and i was taking medicine and so added to the rest i went to bed at night with that money on my mind not that there was much need of being worried for the safe was a good one and nobody but bob and i knew the combination on friday night there was about in cash in the bag on saturday morning i went to the office as usual the safe was locked and bob was writing at his desk i opened the safe and the money was gone i called bob and roused everybody in the court house to announce the robbery it struck me that bob took it pretty quiet considering how much it reflected upon both him and me two days went by and we never got a clew it couldn t have been burglars for the safe had been opened by the combination in the proper way people must have begun to talk for one afternoon in comes alice that s my wife and the boy and girl and alice stamps her foot and her eyes flash and she cries out the lying wretches tom tom and i catch her in a faint and bring her round little by little and she lays her head down and cries and cries for the first time since she took tom kingman s name and fortunes and jack and zilla the youngsters they were always wild as tiger cubs to rush over bob and climb all over him whenever they were allowed to come to the court house they stood and kicked their little shoes and herded together like scared partridges they were having their first trip down into the shadows of life bob was working at his desk and he got up and went out without a word the grand jury was in session then and the next morning bob went before them and confessed that he stole the money he said he lost it in a poker game in fifteen minutes they had found a true bill and sent me the warrant to arrest the man with whom i d been closer than a thousand brothers for many a year i did it and then i said to bob pointing there s my house and here s my office and up there s maine and out that way is california and over there is florida and that s your range til court meets you re in my charge and i take the responsibility you be here when you re wanted thanks tom he said kind of carelessly i was sort of hoping you wouldn t lock me up court meets next monday so if you don t object i ll just loaf around the office until then i ve got one favour to ask if it isn t too much if you d let the kids come out in the yard once in a while and have a romp i d like it why not i answered him they re welcome and so are you and come to my house the same as ever you see mr nettlewick you can t make a friend of a thief but neither can you make a thief of a friend all at once the examiner made no answer at that moment was heard the shrill whistle of a locomotive pulling into the depot that was the train on the little narrow gauge road that struck into san rosario from the south the major cocked his ear and listened for a moment and looked at his watch the narrow gauge was in on time the major continued so bob hung around the office reading the papers and smoking i put another deputy to work in his place and after a while the first excitement of the case wore off one day when we were alone in the office bob came over to where i was sitting he looked sort of grim and blue the same look he used to get when he d been up watching for indians all night or herd riding tom says he it s harder than standing off redskins it s harder than lying in the lava desert forty miles from water but i m going to stick it out to the end you know that s been my style but if you d tip me the smallest kind of a sign if you d just say bob i understand why it would make it lots easier i was surprised i don t know what you mean bob i said of course you know that i d do anything under the sun to help you that i could but you ve got me guessing all right tom was all he said and he went back to his newspaper and lit another cigar it was the night before court met when i found out what he meant i went to bed that night with that same old light headed nervous feeling come back upon me i dropped off to sleep about midnight when i awoke i was standing half dressed in one of the court house corridors bob was holding one of my arms our family doctor the other and alice was shaking me and half crying she had sent for the doctor without my knowing it and when he came they had found me out of bed and missing and had begun a search sleep walking said the doctor all of us went back to the house and the doctor told us some remarkable stories about the strange things people had done while in that condition i was feeling rather chilly after my trip out and as my wife was out of the room at the time i pulled open the door of an old wardrobe that stood in the room and dragged out a big quilt i had seen in there with it tumbled out the bag of money for stealing which bob was to be tried and convicted in the morning how the jumping rattlesnakes did that get there i yelled and all hands must have seen how surprised i was bob knew in a flash you darned old snoozer he said with the old time look on his face i saw you put it there i watched you open the safe and take it out and i followed you i looked through the window and saw you hide it in that wardrobe then you blankety blank flop eared sheep headed coyote what did you say you took it for because said bob simply i didn t know you were asleep i saw him glance toward the door of the room where jack and zilla were and i knew then what it meant to be a man s friend from bob s point of view major tom paused and again directed his glance out of the window he saw some one in the stockmen s national bank reach and draw a yellow shade down the whole length of its plate glass big front window although the position of the sun did not seem to warrant such a defensive movement against its rays nettlewick sat up straight in his chair he had listened patiently but without consuming interest to the major s story it had impressed him as irrelevant to the situation and it could certainly have no effect upon the consequences those western people he thought had an exaggerated sentimentality they were not business like they needed to be protected from their friends evidently the major had concluded and what he had said amounted to nothing may i ask said the examiner if you have anything further to say that bears directly upon the question of those abstracted securities abstracted securities sir major tom turned suddenly in his chair his blue eyes flashing upon the examiner what do you mean sir he drew from his coat pocket a batch of folded papers held together by a rubber band tossed them into nettlewick s hands and rose to his feet you ll find those securities there sir every stock bond and share of em i took them from the notes while you were counting the cash examine and compare them for yourself the major led the way back into the banking room the examiner astounded perplexed nettled at sea followed he felt that he had been made the victim of something that was not exactly a hoax but that left him in the shoes of one who had been played upon used and then discarded without even an inkling of the game perhaps also his official position had been irreverently juggled with but there was nothing he could take hold of an official report of the matter would be an absurdity and somehow he felt that he would never know anything more about the matter than he did then frigidly mechanically nettlewick examined the securities found them to tally with the notes gathered his black wallet and rose to depart i will say he protested turning the indignant glare of his glasses upon major kingman that your statements your misleading statements which you have not condescended to explain do not appear to be quite the thing regarded either as business or humour i do not understand such motives or actions major tom looked down at him serenely and not unkindly son he said there are plenty of things in the chaparral and on the prairies and up the canyons that you don t understand but i want to thank you for listening to a garrulous old man s prosy story we old texans love to talk about our adventures and our old comrades and the home folks have long ago learned to run when we begin with once upon a time so we have to spin our yarns to the stranger within our gates the major smiled but the examiner only bowed coldly and abruptly quitted the bank they saw him travel diagonally across the street in a straight line and enter the stockmen s national bank major tom sat down at his desk and drew from his vest pocket the note roy had given him he had read it once but hurriedly and now with something like a twinkle in his eyes he read it again these were the words he read dear tom i hear there s one of uncle sam s grayhounds going through you and that means that we ll catch him inside of a couple of hours maybe now i want you to do something for me we ve got just in the bank and the law requires that we have i let ross and fisher have late yesterday afternoon to buy up that gibson bunch of cattle they ll realise in less than thirty days on the transaction but that won t make my cash on hand look any prettier to that bank examiner now i can t show him those notes for they re just plain notes of hand without any security in sight but you know very well that pink ross and jim fisher are two of the finest white men god ever made and they ll do the square thing you remember jim fisher he was the one who shot that faro dealer in el paso i wired sam bradshaw s bank to send me and it will get in on the narrow gauge at you can t let a bank examiner in to count and close your doors tom you hold that examiner hold him hold him if you have to rope him and sit on his head watch our front window after the narrow gauge gets in and when we ve got the cash inside we ll pull down the shade for a signal don t turn him loose till then i m counting on you tom your old pard bob buckly prest stockmen s national the major began to tear the note into small pieces and throw them into his waste basket he gave a satisfied chuckle as he did so confounded old reckless cowpuncher he growled contentedly that pays him some on account for what he tried to do for me in the sheriff s office twenty years ago the fourth in salvador on a summer s day while the city was rocking with the din and red uproar of patriotism billy casparis told me this story in his way billy is ulysses jr like satan he comes from going to and fro upon the earth and walking up and down in it to morrow morning while you are cracking your breakfast egg he may be off with his little alligator grip to boom a town site in the middle of lake okeechobee or to trade horses with the patagonians we sat at a little round table and between us were glasses holding big lumps of ice and above us leaned an artificial palm and because our scene was set with the properties of the one they recalled to his mind billy was stirred to narrative it reminds me said he of a fourth i helped to celebrate down in salvador twas while i was running an ice factory down there after i unloaded that silver mine i had in colorado i had what they called a conditional concession they made me put up a thousand dollars cash forfeit that i would make ice continuously for six months if i did that i could draw down my ante if i failed to do so the government took the pot so the inspectors kept dropping in trying to catch me without the goods one day when the thermometer was at the clock at half past one and the calendar at july third two of the little brown oily nosers in red trousers slid in to make an inspection now the factory hadn t turned out a pound of ice in three weeks for a couple of reasons the salvador heathen wouldn t buy it they said it make things cold they put it in and i couldn t make any more because i was broke all i was holding on for was to get down my thousand so i could leave the country the six months would be up on the sixth of july well i showed em all the ice i had i raised the lid of a darkish vat and there was an elegant pound block of ice beautiful and convincing to the eye i was about to close down the lid again when one of those brunette sleuths flops down on his red knees and lays a slanderous and violent hand on my guarantee of good faith and in two minutes more they had dragged out on the floor that fine chunk of molded glass that had cost me fifty dollars to have shipped down from frisco ice y says the fellow that played me the dishonourable trick verree warm ice y yes the day is that hot senor yes maybeso it is of desirableness to leave him out to get the cool yes yes says i yes for i knew they had me touching s believing ain t it boys yes now there s some might say the seats of your trousers are sky blue but tis my opinion they are red let s apply the tests of the laying on of hands and feet and so i hoisted both those inspectors out the door on the toe of my shoe and sat down to cool off on my block of disreputable glass and as i live without oats while i sat there homesick for money and without a cent to my ambition there came on the breeze the most beautiful smell my nose had entered for a year god knows where it came from in that backyard of a country it was a bouquet of soaked lemon peel cigar stumps and stale beer exactly the smell of goldbrick charley s place on fourteenth street where i used to play pinochle of afternoons with the third rate actors and that smell drove my troubles through me and clinched em at the back i began to long for my country and feel sentiments about it and i said words about salvador that you wouldn t think could come legitimate out of an ice factory and while i was sitting there down through the blazing sunshine in his clean white clothes comes maximilian jones an american interested in rubber and rosewood great carrambos says i when he stepped in for i was in a bad temper didn t i have catastrophes enough i know what you want you want to tell me that story again about johnny ammiger and the widow on the train you ve told it nine times already this month it must be the heat says jones stopping in at the door amazed poor billy he s got bugs sitting on ice and calling his best friends pseudonyms hi muchacho jones called my force of employees who was sitting in the sun playing with his toes and told him to put on his trousers and run for the doctor come back says i sit down maxy and forget it tis not ice you see nor a lunatic upon it tis only an exile full of homesickness sitting on a lump of glass that s just cost him a thousand dollars now what was it johnny said to the widow first i d like to hear it again maxy honest don t mind what i said maximilian jones and i sat down and talked he was about as sick of the country as i was for the grafters were squeezing him for half the profits of his rosewood and rubber down in the bottom of a tank of water i had a dozen bottles of sticky frisco beer and i fished these up and we fell to talking about home and the flag and hail columbia and home fried potatoes and the drivel we contributed would have sickened any man enjoying those blessings but at that time we were out of em you can t appreciate home till you ve left it money till it s spent your wife till she s joined a woman s club nor old glory till you see it hanging on a broomstick on the shanty of a consul in a foreign town and sitting there me and maximilian jones scratching at our prickly heat and kicking at the lizards on the floor became afflicted with a dose of patriotism and affection for our country there was me billy casparis reduced from a capitalist to a pauper by over addiction to my glass in the lump declares my troubles off for the present and myself to be an uncrowned sovereign of the greatest country on earth and maximilian jones pours out whole drug stores of his wrath on oligarchies and potentates in red trousers and calico shoes and we issues a declaration of interference in which we guarantee that the fourth day of july shall be celebrated in salvador with all the kinds of salutes explosions honours of war oratory and liquids known to tradition yes neither me nor jones breathed with soul so dead there shall be rucuses in salvador we say and the monkeys had better climb the tallest cocoanut trees and the fire department get out its red sashes and two tin buckets about this time into the factory steps a native man incriminated by the name of general mary esperanza dingo he was some pumpkin both in politics and colour and the friend of me and jones he was full of politeness and a kind of intelligence having picked up the latter and managed to preserve the former during a two years residence in philadelphia studying medicine for a salvadorian he was not such a calamitous little man though he always would play jack queen king ace deuce for a straight general mary sits with us and has a bottle while he was in the states he had acquired a synopsis of the english language and the art of admiring our institutions by and by the general gets up and tiptoes to the doors and windows and other stage entrances remarking hist at each one they all do that in salvador before they ask for a drink of water or the time of day being conspirators from the cradle and matinee idols by proclamation hist says general dingo again and then he lays his chest on the table quite like gaspard the miser good friends senores

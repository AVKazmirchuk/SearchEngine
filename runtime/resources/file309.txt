then i thought i saw an expectant look on ileen s face as she glanced toward me i had a wild sudden impulse to dare fate and tell her of all the beautiful handiwork of the great artificer she was the most exquisite that she was a flawless pearl gleaming pure and serene in a setting of black mud and emerald prairies that she was a a corker and as for mine i cared not if she were as crtiel as a serpent s tooth to her fond parents or if she couldn t tell a plugged dollar from a bridle buckle if i might sing chant praise glorify and worship her peerless and wonderful beauty but i refrained i feared the fate of a flatterer i had witnessed her delight at the crafty and discreet words of bud and jacks no miss hinkle was not one to be beguiled by the plated silver tongue of a flatterer so i joined the ranks of the candid and honest at once i became mendacious and didactic in all ages miss hinkle said i in spite of the poetry and romance of each intellect in woman has been admired more than beauty even in cleopatra herself men found more charm in her queenly mind than in her looks well i should think so said ileen i ve seen pictures of her that weren t so much she had an awfully long nose if i may say so i went on you remind me of cleopatra miss ileen why my nose isn t so long said she opening her eyes wide and touching that comely feature with a dimpled forefinger why er i mean said i i mean as to mental endowments oh said she and then i got my smile just as bud and jacks had got theirs thank every one of you she said very very sweetly for being so frank and honest with me that s the way i want you to be always just tell me plainly and truthfully what you think and we ll all be the best friends in the world and now because you ve been so good to me and understand so well how i dislike people who do nothing but pay me exaggerated compliments i ll sing and play a little for you of course we expressed our thanks and joy but we would have been better pleased if ileen had remained in her low rocking chair face to face with us and let us gaze upon her for she was no adelina patti not even on the fare wellest of the diva s farewell tours she had a cooing little voice like that of a turtle dove that could almost fill the parlor when the windows and doors were closed and betty was not rattling the lids of the stove in the kitchen she had a gamut that i estimate at about eight inches on the piano and her runs and trills sounded like the clothes bubbling in your grandmother s iron wash pot believe that she must have been beautiful when i tell you that it sounded like music to us she must have been beautiful when i tell you that it sounded like music to us ileen s musical taste was catholic she would sing through a pile of sheet music on the left hand top of the piano laying each slaughtered composition on the right hand top the next evening she would sing from right to left her favorites were mendelssohn and moody and sankey by request she always wound up with sweet violets and when the leaves begin to turn when we left at ten o clock the three of us would go down to jacks little wooden station and sit on the platform swinging our feet and trying to pump one another for dews as to which way miss ileen s inclinations seemed to lean that is the way of rivals they do not avoid and glower at one another they convene and converse and construe striving by the art politic to estimate the strength of the enemy one day there came a dark horse to paloma a young lawyer who at once flaunted his shingle and himself spectacularly upon the town his name was c vincent vesey you could see at a glance that he was a recent graduate of a southwestern law school his prince albert coat light striped trousers broad brimmed soft black hat and narrow white muslin bow tie proclaimed that more loudly than any diploma could vesey was a compound of daniel webster lord chesterfield beau brummell and little jack horner his coming boomed paloma the next day after he arrived an addition to the town was surveyed and laid off in lots of course vesey to further his professional fortunes must mingle with the citizenry and outliers of paloma and as well as with the soldier men he was bound to seek popularity with the gay dogs of the place so jacks and bud cunningham and i came to be honored by his acquaintance the doctrine of predestination would have been discredited had not vesey seen ileen hinkle and become fourth in the tourney magnificently he boarded at the yellow pine hotel instead of at the parisian restaurant but he came to be a formidable visitor in the hinkle parlor his competition reduced bud to an inspired increase of profanity drove jacks to an outburst of slang so weird that it sounded more horrible than the most trenchant of bud s imprecations and made me dumb with gloom for vesey had the rhetoric words flowed from him like oil from a gusher hyperbole compliment praise appreciation honeyed gallantry golden opinions eulogy and unveiled panegyric vied with one another for pre eminence in his speech we had small hopes that ileen could resist his oratory and prince albert but a day came that gave us courage about dusk one evening i was sitting

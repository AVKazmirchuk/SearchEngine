from an ex war governor and loyal as he remained to the old regime his faith and admiration were billy s as valet to a hero and a member of the family he may have had superior opportunities for judging jeff was the first one to whom bill revealed the news when he reached home for supper jeff took his plug hat and smoothed it before hanging it upon the hall rack dar now said the old man i knowed it was er comin i knowed it was gwine ter happen er judge you says mars william dem yankees done made you er judge it s high time sah dey was doin somep n to make up for dey rascality endurin

have to live there most of the time of course said billy i wonder what de gubnor gwine say bout dat speculated jeff billy wondered too after supper when the two sat in the library according to their habit the governor smoking his clay pipe and billy his cigar the son dutifully confessed to having been tendered the appointment for a long time the governor sat smoking without making any comment billy reclined in his favourite rocker waiting perhaps still flushed with satisfaction over the tender that had come to him unsolicited in his dingy little office above the heads of the intriguing time serving clamorous multitude at last the governor spoke and though his words were seemingly irrelevant they were to the point his voice had a note of martyrdom running through its senile quaver my rheumatism has been growing steadily worse these past months william i am sorry father said billy gently and i am nearly seventy eight i am getting to be an old man i can recall the names of but two or three who were in public life during my administration what did you say is the nature of this position that is offered you william a federal judgeship father i believe it is considered to be a somewhat flattering tender it is outside of politics and wire pulling you know no doubt no doubt few of the pembertons have engaged in professional life for nearly a century none of them have ever held federal positions they have been land holders slave owners and planters on a large scale one of two of the derwents your mother s family were in the law have you decided to accept this appointment william i am thinking it over said billy slowly regarding the ash of his cigar you have been a good son to me continued the governor stirring his pipe with the handle of a penholder i ve been your son all my life said billy darkly i am often gratified piped the governor betraying a touch of complacency by being congratulated upon having a son with such sound and sterling qualities especially in this our native town is your name linked with mine in the talk of our citizens i never knew anyone to forget the vindculum murmured billy unintelligibly whatever prestige pursued the parent i may be possessed of by virtue of my name and services to the state has been yours to draw upon freely i have not hesitated to exert it in your behalf whenever opportunity offered and you have deserved it william you ve been the best of sons and now this appointment comes to take you away from me i have but a few years left to live i am almost dependent upon others now even in walking and dressing what would i do without you my son the governor s pipe dropped to the floor a tear trickled from his eye his voice had risen and crumbled to a weakling falsetto and ceased he was an old old man about to be bereft of a son that cherished him billy rose and laid his hand upon the governor s shoulder don t worry father he said cheerfully i m not going to accept elmville is good enough for me i ll write to night and decline it at the next interchange of devoirs between the governor and general deffenbaugh on lee avenue his excellency with a comfortable air of self satisfaction spoke of the appointment that had been tendered to billy the general whistled that s a plum for billy he shouted who d have thought that billy but confound it it s been in him all the time it s a boost for elmville it ll send real estate up it s an honour to our state it s a compliment to the south we ve all been blind about billy when does he leave we must have a reception great gatlings that job s eight thousand a year there s been a car load of lead pencils worn to stubs figuring on those appointments think of it our little wood sawing mealy mouthed billy angel unawares doesn t begin to express it elmville is disgraced forever until she lines up in a hurry for ratification and apology the venerable moloch smiled fatuously he carried the fire with which to consume all these tributes to billy the smoke of which would ascend as an incense to himself william said the governor with modest pride has declined the appointment he refuses to leave me in my old age he is a good son the general swung round and laid a large forefinger upon the bosom of his friend much of the general s success had been due to his dexterity in establishing swift lines of communication between cause and effect governor he said with a keen look in his big ox like eyes you ve been complaining to billy about your rheumatism my dear

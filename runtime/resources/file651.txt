to her speech i m going to have a purple dress a tailor made purple dress for thanksgiving oh are you said grace putting away some gloves into the box well it s me for red you see more red on fifth avenue and the men all seem to like it i like purple best said maida and old schlegel has promised to make it for it s going to be lovely i m going to have a plaited skirt and a blouse coat trimmed with a band of galloon under a white cloth collar with two rows of sly boots said grace with an educated wink soutache braid over a surpliced white vest and a plaited basque and sly boots sly boots repeated grace plaited gigot sleeves with a drawn velvet ribbon over an inside cuff what do you mean by saying that you think mr ramsay likes purple i heard him say yesterday he thought some of the dark shades of red were stunning i don t care said maida i prefer purple and them that don t like it can just take the other side of the street which suggests the thought that after all the followers of purple may be subject to slight delusions danger is near when a maiden thinks she can wear purple regardless of complexions and opinions and when emperors think their purple robes will wear forever maida had saved after eight months of economy and this had bought the goods for the purple dress and paid schlegel on the making of it on the day before thanksgiving she would have just enough to pay the remaining and then for a holiday in a new dress can earth offer anything more enchanting old bachman the proprietor of the bee hive store always gave a thanksgiving dinner to his employees on every one of the subsequent days excusing sundays he would remind them of the joys of the past banquet and the hopes of the coming ones thus inciting them to increased enthusiasm in work the dinner was given in the store on one of the long tables in the middle of the room they tacked wrapping paper over the front windows and the turkeys and other good things were brought in the back way from the restaurant on the corner you will perceive that the bee hive was not a fashionable department store with escalators and pompadours it was almost small enough to be called an emporium and you could actually go in there and get waited on and walk out again and always at the thanksgiving dinners mr ramsay oh bother i should have mentioned mr ramsay first of all he is more important than purple or green or even the red cranberry sauce mr ramsay was the head clerk and as far as i am concerned i am for him he never pinched the girls arms when he passed them in dark corners of the store and when he told them stories when business was dull and the girls giggled and said oh pshaw it wasn t g bernard they meant at all besides being a gentleman mr ramsay was queer and original in other ways he was a health crank and believed that people should never eat anything that was good for them he was violently opposed to anybody being comfortable and coming in out of snow storms or wearing overshoes or taking medicine or coddling themselves in any way every one of the ten girls in the store had little pork chop and fried onion dreams every night of becoming mrs ramsay for next year old bachman was going to take him in for a partner and each one of them knew that if she should catch him she would knock those cranky health notions of his sky high before the wedding cake indigestion was over mr ramsay was master of ceremonies at the dinners always they had two italians in to play a violin and harp and had a little dance in the store and here were two dresses being conceived to charm ramsay one purple and the other red of course the other eight girls were going to have dresses too but they didn t count very likely they d wear some shirt waist and black skirt affairs nothing as resplendent as purple or red grace had saved her money too she was going to buy her dress ready made oh what s the use of bothering with a tailor when you ve got a figger it s easy to get a fit the ready made are intended for a perfect figger except i have to have em all taken in at the waist the average figger is so large waisted the night before thanksgiving came maida hurried home keen and bright with the thoughts of the blessed morrow her thoughts were of purple but they were white themselves the joyous enthusiasm of the young for the pleasures that youth must have or wither she knew purple would become her and for the thousandth time she tried to assure herself that it was purple mr ramsay said he liked and not red she was going home first to get the wrapped in a piece of tissue paper in the bottom drawer of her dresser and then she was going to pay schlegel and take the dress home herself grace lived in the same house she occupied the hall room above maida s at home maida found clamor and confusion the landlady s tongue clattering sourly in the halls like a churn dasher dabbing in buttermilk and then grace come down to her room crying with eyes as red as any dress she says i ve got to get out said grace the old beast because i owe her she s put my trunk in the hall and locked the door i can t go anywhere else i haven t got a cent of money you had some

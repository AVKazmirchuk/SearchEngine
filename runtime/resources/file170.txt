custodian in front of an attractive refined saloon i made a dead ahead scramble for the doors whining like a dog in the press despatches that lets the family know that little alice is bogged while gathering lilies in the brook why darn my eyes says the old man with a grin darn my eyes if the saffron coloured son of a seltzer lemonade ain t asking me in to take a drink lemme see how long s it been since i saved shoe leather by keeping one foot on the foot rest i believe i ll i knew i had him hot scotches he took sitting at a table for an hour he kept the campbells coming i sat by his side rapping for the waiter with my tail and eating free lunch such as mamma in her flat never equalled with her homemade truck bought at a delicatessen store eight minutes before papa comes home when the products of scotland were all exhausted except the rye bread the old man unwound me from the table leg and played me outside like a fisherman plays a salmon out there he took off my collar and threw it into the street poor doggie says he good doggie she shan t kiss you any more s a darned shame good doggie go away and get run over by a street car and be happy i refused to leave i leaped and frisked around the old man s legs happy as a pug on a rug you old flea headed woodchuck chaser i said to him you moon baying rabbit pointing eggstealing old beagle can t you see that i don t want to leave you can t you see that we re both pups in the wood and the missis is the cruel uncle after you with the dish towel and me with the flea liniment and a pink bow to tie on my tail why not cut that all out and be pards forever more maybe you ll say he didn t understand maybe he didn t but he kind of got a grip on the hot scotches and stood still for a minute thinking doggie says he finally we don t live more than a dozen lives on this earth and very few of us live to be more than if i ever see that flat any more i m a flat and if you do you re flatter and that s no flattery i m offering to that westward ho wins out by the length of a dachshund there was no string but i frolicked along with my master to the twenty third street ferry and the cats on the route saw reason to give thanks that prehensile claws had been given them on the jersey side my master said to a stranger who stood eating a currant bun me and my doggie we are bound for the rocky mountains but what pleased me most was when my old man pulled both of my ears until i howled and said you common monkey headed rat tailed sulphur coloured son of a door mat do you know what i m going to call you i thought of lovey and i whined dolefully i m going to call you pete says my master and if i d had five tails i couldn t have done enough wagging to do justice to the occasion the love philtre of ikey schoenstein the blue light drug store is downtown between the bowery and first avenue where the distance between the two streets is the shortest the blue light does not consider that pharmacy is a thing of bric a brac scent and ice cream soda if you ask it for pain killer it will not give you a bonbon the blue light scorns the labour saving arts of modern pharmacy it macerates its opium and percolates its own

titled the terror of the border had been a member of the gang about three months one night while they were in camp on the san miguel water hole a solitary horseman on the regulation fiery steed dashed in among them the newcomer was of a portentous and devastating aspect a beak like nose with a predatory curve projected above a mass of bristling blue black whiskers his eye was cavernous and fierce he was spurred sombreroed booted garnished with revolvers abundantly drunk and very much unafraid few people in the country drained by the rio bravo would have cared thus to invade alone the camp of bud king but this fell bird swooped fearlessly upon them and demanded to be fed hospitality in the prairie country is not limited even if your enemy pass your way you must feed him before you shoot him you must empty your larder into him before you empty your lead so the stranger of undeclared intentions was set down to a mighty feast a talkative bird he was full of most marvellous loud tales and exploits and speaking a language at times obscure but never colourless he was a new sensation to bud king s men who rarely encountered new types they hung delighted upon his vainglorious boasting the spicy strangeness of his lingo his contemptuous familiarity with life the world and remote places and the extravagant frankness with which he conveyed his sentiments to their guest the band of outlaws seemed to be nothing more than a congregation of country bumpkins whom he was stringing for grub just as he would have told his stories at the back door of a farmhouse to wheedle a meal and indeed his ignorance was not without excuse for the bad man of the southwest does not run to extremes those brigands might justly have been taken for a little party of peaceable rustics assembled for a fish fry or pecan gathering gentle of manner slouching of gait soft voiced unpicturesquely clothed not one of them presented to the eye any witness of the desperate records they had earned for two days the glittering stranger within the camp was feasted then by common consent he was invited to become a member of the band he consented presenting for enrollment the prodigious name of captain montressor this name was immediately overruled by the band and piggy substituted as a compliment to the awful and insatiate appetite of its owner thus did the texas border receive the most spectacular brigand that ever rode its chaparral for the next three months bud king conducted business as usual escaping encounters with law officers and being content with reasonable profits the band ran off some very good companies of horses from the ranges and a few bunches of fine cattle which they got safely across the rio grande and disposed of to fair advantage often the band would ride into the little villages and mexican settlements terrorizing the inhabitants and plundering for the provisions and ammunition they needed it was during these bloodless raids that piggy s ferocious aspect and frightful voice gained him a renown more widespread and glorious than those other gentle voiced and sad faced desperadoes could have acquired in a lifetime the mexicans most apt in nomenclature first called him the black eagle and used to frighten the babes by threatening them with tales of the dreadful robber who carried off little children in his great beak soon the name extended and black eagle the terror of the border became a recognized factor in exaggerated newspaper reports and ranch gossip the country from the nueces to the rio grande was a wild but fertile stretch given over to the sheep and cattle ranches range was free the inhabitants were few the law was mainly a letter and the pirates met with little opposition until the flaunting and garish piggy gave the band undue advertisement then mckinney s ranger company headed for those precincts and bud king knew that it meant grim and sudden war or else temporary retirement regarding the risk to be unnecessary he drew off his band to an almost inaccessible spot on the bank of the frio wherefore as has been said dissatisfaction arose among the members and impeachment proceedings against bud were premeditated with black eagle in high favour for the succession bud king was not unaware of the sentiment and he called aside cactus taylor his trusted lieutenant to discuss it if the boys said bud ain t satisfied with me i m willing to step out they re buckin against my way of handlin em and specially because i concludes to hit the brush while sam kinney is ridin the line i saves em from bein shot or sent up on a state contract and they up and says i m no good it ain t so much that explained cactus as it is they re plum locoed about piggy they want them whiskers and that nose of his to split the wind at the head of the column there s somethin mighty seldom about piggy declared bud musingly i never yet see anything on the hoof that he exactly grades up with he can shore holler a plenty and he straddles a hoss from where you laid the chunk but he ain t never been smoked yet you know cactus we ain t had a row since he s been with us piggy s all right for skearin the greaser kids and layin waste a cross

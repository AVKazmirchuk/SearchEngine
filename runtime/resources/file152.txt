most faithful foolish fond making her mere breathed name their bond upon their bond and my glee was roused because i had caught mr kipling napping here i had found a man not made from dust one who had no narrow boasts of birthplace or country one who if he bragged at all would brag of his whole round globe against the martians and the inhabitants of the moon expression on these subjects was precipitated from e rushmore coglan by the third corner to our table while coglan was describing to me the topography along the siberian railway the orchestra glided into a medley the concluding air was dixie and as the exhilarating notes tumbled forth they were almost overpowered by a great clapping of hands from almost every table it is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be witnessed every evening in numerous cafes in the city of new york tons of brew have been consumed over theories to account for it some have conjectured hastily that all southerners in town hie themselves to cafes at nightfall this applause of the rebel air in a northern city does puzzle a little but it is not insolvable the war with spain many years generous mint and watermelon crops a few long shot winners at the new orleans race track and the brilliant banquets given by the indiana and kansas citizens who compose the north carolina society have made the south rather a fad in manhattan your manicure will lisp softly that your left forefinger reminds her so much of a gentleman s in richmond va oh certainly but many a lady has to work now the war you know when dixie was being played a dark haired young man sprang up from somewhere with a mosby guerrilla yell and waved frantically his soft brimmed hat then he strayed through the smoke dropped into the vacant chair at our table and pulled out cigarettes the evening was at the period when reserve is thawed one of us mentioned three wurzburgers to the waiter the dark haired young man acknowledged his inclusion in the order by a smile and a nod i hastened to ask him a question because i wanted to try out a theory i had would you mind telling me i began whether you are from the fist of e rushmore coglan banged the table and i was jarred into silence excuse me said he but that s a question i never like to hear asked what does it matter where a man is from is it fair to judge a man by his post office address why i ve seen kentuckians who hated whiskey virginians who weren t descended from pocahontas indianians who hadn t written a novel mexicans who didn t wear velvet trousers with silver dollars sewed along the seams funny englishmen spendthrift yankees cold blooded southerners narrow minded westerners and new yorkers who were too busy to stop for an hour on the street to watch a one armed grocer s clerk do up cranberries in paper bags let a man be a man and don t handicap him with the label of any section pardon me i said but my curiosity was not altogether an idle one i know the south and when the band plays dixie i like to observe i have formed the belief that the man who applauds that air with special violence and ostensible sectional loyalty is invariably a native of either secaucus n j or the district between murray hill lyceum and the harlem river this city i was about to put my opinion to the test by inquiring of this gentleman when you interrupted with your own larger theory i must confess and now the dark haired young man spoke to me and it became evident that his mind also moved along its own set of grooves i should like to be a periwinkle said he mysteriously on the top of a valley and sing tooralloo ralloo this was clearly too obscure so i turned again to coglan i ve been around the world twelve times said he i know an esquimau in upernavik who sends to cincinnati for his neckties and i saw a goatherder in uruguay who won a prize in a battle creek breakfast food puzzle competition i pay rent on a room in cairo egypt and another in yokohama all the year around i ve got slippers waiting for me in a tea house in shanghai and i don t have to tell em how to cook my eggs in rio de janeiro or seattle it s a mighty little old world what s the use of bragging about being from the north or the south or the old manor house in the dale or euclid avenue cleveland or pike s peak or fairfax county va or hooligan s flats or any place it ll be a better world when we quit being fools about some mildewed town or ten acres of swampland just because we happened to be born there you seem to be a genuine cosmopolite i said admiringly but it also seems that you would decry patriotism a relic of the stone age declared coglan warmly we are all brothers chinamen englishmen zulus patagonians and the people in the bend of the kaw river some day all this petty pride in one s city or state or section or country will be wiped out and we ll all be citizens of the world as we ought to be but while you are wandering in foreign lands i persisted do not your thoughts revert to some spo some dear and nary a spot interrupted e r coglan flippantly the terrestrial globular planetary hunk of matter slightly flattened at the poles and known as the earth is my abode i ve met a good many object bound citizens of this country abroad i ve seen men from chicago sit

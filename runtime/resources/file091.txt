a swim in the sea and the doctor has ordered him to remain indoors for some time smith ploughed his way through the sand to the consulate his haberdashery creating violent discord against the smooth tropical blues and greens geddie was lounging in his hammock somewhat pale of face and languid in pose on that night when the valhalla s boat had brought him ashore apparently drenched to death by the sea doctor gregg and his other friends had toiled for hours to preserve the little spark of life that remained to him the bottle with its impotent message was gone out to sea and the problem that it had provoked was reduced to a simple sum in addition one and one make two by the rule of arithmetic one by the rule of romance there is a quaint old theory that man may have two souls a peripheral one which serves ordinarily and a central one which is stirred only at certain times but then with activity and vigor while under the domination of the former a man will shave vote pay taxes give money to his family buy subscription books and comport himself on the average plan but let the central soul suddenly become dominant and he may in the twinkling of an eye turn upon the partner of his joys with furious execration he may change his politics while you could snap your fingers he may deal out deadly insult to his dearest friend he may get him instanter to a monastery or a dance hall he may elope or hang himself or he may write a song or poem or kiss his wife unasked or give his funds to the search of a microbe then the peripheral soul will return and we have our safe sane citizen again it is but the revolt of the ego against order and its effect is to shake up the atoms only that they may settle where they belong geddie s revulsion had been a mild one no more than a swim in a summer sea after so inglorious an object as a drifting bottle and now he was himself again upon his desk ready for the post was a letter to his government tendering his resignation as consul to be effective as soon as another could be appointed in his place for bernard brannigan who never did things in a half way manner was to take geddie at once for a partner in his very profitable and various enterprises and paula was happily engaged in plans for refurnishing and decorating the upper story of the brannigan house the consul rose from his hammock when he saw the conspicuous stranger at this door keep your seat old man said the visitor with an airy wave of his large hand my name s smith and i ve come in a yacht you are the consul is that right a big cool guy on the beach directed me here thought i d pay my respects to the flag sit down said geddie i ve been admiring your craft ever since it came in sight looks like a fast sailer what s her tonnage search me said smith i don t know what she weighs in at but she s got a tidy gait the rambler that s her name don t take the dust of anything afloat this is my first trip on her i m taking a squint along this coast just to get an idea of the countries where the rubber and red pepper and revolutions come from i had no idea there was so much scenery down here why central park ain t in it with this neck of the woods i m from new york they get monkeys and coconuts and parrots down here is that right we have them all said geddie i m quite sure that our fauna and flora would take a prize over central park maybe they would admitted smith cheerfully i haven t seen them yet but i guess you ve got us skinned on the animal and vegetation question you don t have much travel here do you travel queried the consul i suppose you mean passengers on steamers no very few people land in coralio an investor now and then tourists and sightseers generally go further down the coast to one of the larger towns where there is a harbor i see a ship out there loading up with bananas said smith any passengers come on her that s the karlesfin said the consul she s a tramp fruiter made her last trip to new york i believe no she brought no passengers i saw her boat come ashore and there was no one about the only exciting recreation we have here is watching steamers when they arrive and a passenger on one of them generally causes the whole town to turn out if you are going to remain in coralio a while mr smith i ll be glad to take you around to meet some people there are four or five american chaps that are good to know besides the native high fliers thanks said the yachtsman but i wouldn t put you the trouble i d like to meet the guys you speak of but i won t be here long enough to do much knocking around that cool gent on the beach spoke of a doctor can you tell me where to find him the rambler ain t quite as steady on her feet as a broadway hotel and a fellow gets a touch of seasickness now and then thought i d strike the croaker for a handful of the little sugar pills in case i need em you will be apt to find doctor gregg at the hotel said the consul you can see it from the door it s that two story building with the balcony where the orange trees are the hotel de los extranjeros

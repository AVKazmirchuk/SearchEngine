said simon sleepily nothing has happened to mr geddie he s under that tarpauling said the mate pointing to the boat and he s rather more than half drowned we seen him from the steamer nearly a mile out from shore swimmin like mad after a bottle that was floatin in the water outward bound we lowered the gig and started for him he nearly had his hand on the bottle when he gave out and went under we pulled him out in time to save him maybe but the doctor is the one to decide that a bottle said the old man rubbing his eyes he was not yet fully awake where is the bottle driftin along out there some eres said the mate jerking his thumb toward the sea get on with you simon iii smith goodwin and the ardent patriot zavalla took all the precautions that their foresight could contrive to prevent the escape of president miraflores and his companion the sent trusted messengers up the coast to solitas and alazan to warn the local leaders of the flight and to instruct them to patrol the water line and arrest the fugitives at all hazards should they reveal themselves in that territory after this was done there remained only to cover the district about coralio and await the coming of the quarry the nets were well spread the roads were so few the opportunities for embarkation so limited and the two or three probable points of exit so well guarded that it would be strange indeed if there should slip through the meshes so much of the country s dignity romance and collateral the president would without doubt move as secretly as possible and endeavor to board a vessel by stealth from some secluded point along the shore on the fourth day after the receipt of englehart s telegram the karlsefin a norwegian steamer chartered by the new orleans fruit trade anchored off coralio with three horse toots of her siren the karlesfin ws not one of the line operated by the vesuvius fruit company she was something of a dilettante doing odd jobs for a company that was scarcely important enough to figure as a rival to the vesuvius the movements of the karlesfin were dependent upon the state of the market sometimes she would ply steadily between the spanish main and new orleans in the regular transport of fruit next she would be maing erratic trips to mobile or charleston or even as far north as new york according to the distribution of the fruit supply goodwin lounged upon the beach with the susual crowd of idlers that had gathered to view the steamer now that president miraflores might be expected to reach the borders of his abjured country at any time the orders were to keep a strict and unrelenting watch every vessel that approached the shores might now be considered a possible means of escape for the fugitives and an eye was kept even on the slopes and dories that belonged to the sea going contingent of coralio goodwin and zavalla moved everywhere but without ostentation watching the loopholes of escape the customs official crowded importantly into their boat and rowed out to the karlesfin a boat from the steamer landed her purser with his papers and took out the quarantine doctor with his green umbrella and clinical thermometer next a swarm of caribs began to load upon lighters the thousands of bunches of bananas heaped upon the shore and row them out to the steamer the karlesfin had no passenger list and was soon done with the attention of the authorities the purser declared that the steamer would remain at anchor until morning taking on her fruit during the night the karlesfin had come he said from new york to which port her latest load of oranges and coconuts had been conveyed two or three of the freighter sloops were engaged to assist in the work for the captain was anxious to make a quick return in order to reap the advantage offered by a certain dearth of fruit in the states about four o clock in the afternoon another of those marine monsters not very familiar in those waters hove in sight following the fateful idalia a graceful steam yacht painted a light buff clean cut as a steel engraving the beautiful vessel hovered off shore see sawing the waves as lightly as a duck in a rain barrel a swift boat manned by a crew in uniform came ashore and a stocky built man leaped to the sands the newcomer seemed to turn a disapproving eye upon the rather motley congregation of native anchurians and made his way at once toward goodwin who was the most conspicuously anglo saxon figure present goodwin greeted him with courtesy conversation developed that the newly landed one was named smith and that he had come in a yacht a meagre biography truly for the yacht was most apparent and the smith not beyond a reasonable guess before the revelation yet to the eye of goodwin who has seen several things there was a discrepancy between smith and his yacht a bullet headed man smith was with an oblique dead eye and the moustache of a cocktail mixer and unless he had shifted costumes before putting off for shore he had affronted the deck of his correct vessel clad in a pearl gray derby a gay plaid suit and vaudeville neckwear men owning pleasure yachts generally harmonize better with them smith looked business but he was no advertiser he commented upon the scenery remarking upon its fidelity to the pictures in the geography and then inquired for the united states consul goodwin pointed out the starred and striped bunting hanging from above the little consulate which was concealed behind the orange trees mr geddie the consul will be sure to be there said goodwin he was very nearly drowned a

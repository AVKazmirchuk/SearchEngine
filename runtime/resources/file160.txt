didn t my purchaser from peoria said joe and gen pinkney are both creations of the same art but you wouldn t call it either painting or music and then they both laughed and joe began when one loves one s art no service seems but delia stopped him with her hand on his lips no she said just when one loves the coming out of maggie eevery saturday night the clover leaf social club gave a hop in the hall of the give and take athletic association on the east side in order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the give and take or if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing you must work in rhinegold s paper box factory still any clover leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance but mostly each give and take brought the paper box girl that he affected and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops maggie toole on account of her dull eyes broad mouth and left handed style of footwork in the twostep went to the dances with anna mccarty and her fellow anna and maggie worked side by side in the factory and were the greatest chums ever so anna always made jimmy burns take her by maggie s house every saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them the give and take athletic association lived up to its name the hall of the association in orchard street was fitted out with muscle making inventions with the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat between these more serious occupations the saturday night hop with the paper box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen for sometimes the tip went round and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes on saturdays rhinegold s paper box factory closed at p m on one such afternoon anna and maggie walked homeward together at maggie s door anna said as usual be ready at seven sharp mag and jimmy and me ll come by for you but what was this instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non escorted one there was to be perceived a high poised head a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye thanks anna said maggie but you and jimmy needn t bother to night i ve a gentleman friend that s coming round to escort me to the hop the comely anna pounced upon her friend shook her chided and beseeched her maggie toole catch a fellow plain dear loyal unattractive maggie so sweet as a chum so unsought for a two step or a moonlit bench in the little park how was it when did it happen who was it you ll see to night said maggie flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in cupid s vineyard he s swell all right he s two inches taller than jimmy and an up to date dresser i ll introduce him anna just as soon as we get to the hall anna and jimmy were among the first clover leafs to arrive that evening anna s eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend s catch at miss toole swept into the hall with her escort quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful jimmy oh gee cried anna mag ain t made a hit oh no swell fellow well i guess style look at um go as far as you like said jimmy with sandpaper in his voice cop him out if you want him these new guys always win out with

coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser and truly her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum he stood two inches taller than the average give and take athlete his dark hair curled his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles the young men of the clover leaf club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess

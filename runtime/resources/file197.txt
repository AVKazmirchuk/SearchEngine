do not remember he thanked her and crept back to his room the room was dead the essence that had vivified it was gone the perfume of mignonette had departed in its place was the old stale odour of mouldy house furniture of atmosphere in storage the ebbing of his hope drained his faith he sat staring at the yellow singing gaslight soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the sheets into strips with the blade of his knife he drove them tightly into every crevice around windows and door when all was snug and taut he turned out the light turned the gas full on again and laid himself gratefully upon the bed it was mrs mccool s night to go with the can for beer so she fetched it and sat with mrs purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where house keepers foregather and the worm

in white sateen ready to jump on his shoulder while he jolted their spinal columns and ribs together through a breakdown and sang sleep little one sleep as i passed the window i glanced inside and caught a glimpse of a white dress and a pair of big flashing black eyes and gleaming teeth under a dark lace mantilla when we got back to our house o connor began to walk up and down the floor and twist his moustaches did ye see her eyes bowers he asks me i did says i and i can see more than that it s all coming out according to the story books i knew there was something missing twas the love interest what is it that comes in chapter vii to cheer the gallant irish adventurer why love of course love that makes the hat go around at last we have the eyes of midnight hue and the rose flung from the barred window now what comes next the underground passage the intercepted letter the traitor in camp the hero thrown into a dungeon the mysterious message from the senorita then the outburst the fighting on the plaza the don t be a fool says o connor interrupting but that s the only woman in the world for me bowers the o connors are as quick to love as they are to fight i shall wear that rose over me heart when i lead me men into action for a good battle to be fought there must be some woman to give it power every time i agreed if you want to have a good lively scrap there s only one thing bothering me in the novels the light haired friend of the hero always gets killed think em all over that you ve read and you ll see that i m right i think i ll step down to the botica espanola and lay in a bottle of walnut stain before war is declared how will i find out her name says o connor layin his chin in his hand why don t you go across the street and ask her says i will ye never regard anything in life seriously says o connor looking down at me like a schoolmaster maybe she meant the rose for me i said whistling the spanish fandango for the first time since i d known o connor he laughed he got up and roared and clapped his knees and leaned against the wall till the tiles on the roof clattered to the noise of his lungs he went into the back room and looked at himself in the glass and began and laughed all over from the beginning again then he looked at me and repeated himself that s why i asked you if you thought an irishman had any humor he d been doing farce comedy from the day i saw him without knowing it and the first time he had an idea advanced to him with any intelligence in it he acted like two twelfths of the sextet in a floradora road company the next afternoon he comes in with a triumphant smile and begins to pull something like ticker tape out of his pocket great says i this is something like home how is amalgamated copper to day i ve got her name says o connor and he reads off something like this dona isabel antonia inez lolita carreras y buencaminos y monteleon she lives with her mother explains o connor her father was killed in the last revolution she is sure to be in sympathy with our cause and sure enough the next day she flung a little bunch of roses clear across the street into our door o connor dived for it and found a piece of paper curled around a stem with a line in spanish on it he dragged the interpreter out of his corner and got him busy the interpreter scratched his head and gave us as a translation three best bets fortune had got a face like the man fighting fortune looks like a brave man and fortune favors the brave we put our money on the last one do ye see says o connor she intends to encourage me sword to save her country it looks to me like an invitation to supper says i so every day this senorita sits behind the barred windows and exhausts a conservatory or two one posy at a time and o connor walks like a dominecker rooster and swells his chest and swears to me he will win her by feats of arms and big deeds on the gory field of battle by and by the revolution began to get ripe one day o connor takes me into the back room and tells me all bowers says he at twelve o clock one week from to day the struggle will take place it has pleased ye to find amusement and diversion in this project because ye have not sense enough to perceive that it is easily accomplished by a man of courage intelligence and historical superiority such as meself the whole world over says he the o connors have ruled men women and nations to subdue a small and indifferent country like this is a trifle ye see what little barefooted manikins the men of it are i could lick four of em single handed no doubt says i but could you lick six and suppose they hurled an army of seventeen against you listen says o connor to what will occur at noon next tuesday patriots will rise up in the towns of the republic the government will be absolutely unprepared the public buildings will be taken the regular army made prisoners and the new administration set up in the capital it will not be so easy on account of most of the army being stationed there they will occupy the president s palace and the strongly fortified government buildings and stand a siege but on the very day of the outbreak a body of our troops will begin a march to the capital from every town as soon as the local victory has been won the thing is so well planned that it is an impossibility for us to fail i meself will lead the troops from here the new president will be senor espadas now minister of finance in the present cabinet what do you get i asked twill be strange said o connor smiling if i don t have all the jobs handed to me on a silver salver to pick what i choose i ve been the brains of the scheme and when the fighting opens i guess i won t be in the rear rank who managed it so our troops could get arms smuggled into this country didn t i arrange it with a new york firm before i left there our financial agents inform me that stands of winchester rifles have been delivered a month ago at a secret place up coast and distributed among the towns i tell you bowers the game is already won well that kind of talk kind of shook my disbelief in the infallibility of the serious irish gentleman soldier of fortune it certainly seemed that the patriotic grafters had gone about the thing in a business way i looked upon o connor with more respect and began to figure on what kind of uniform i might wear as secretary of war tuesday the day set for the revolution came around according to schedule o connor said that a signal had been agreed upon for the uprising there was an old cannon on the beach near the national warehouse that had been secretly loaded and promptly at twelve o clock was to be fired off immediately the revolutionists would seize their concealed arms attack the comandante s troops in the cuartel and capture the custom house and all government property and supplies i was nervous all the morning and about eleven o clock o connor became infused with the excitement and martial spirit of murder he geared his father s sword around him and walked up and down in the back room like a lion in the zoo suffering from corns i smoked a couple of dozen cigars and decided on yellow stripes down the trouser legs of my uniform at half past eleven o connor asks me to take a short stroll through the streets to see if i could notice any signs of the uprising i was back in fifteen minutes did you hear anything he asks i did says i at first i thought it was drums but it wasn t it was snoring everybody in town s asleep o connor tears out his watch fools says he they ve set the time right at the siesta hour when everybody takes a nap but the cannon will wake em up everything will be all right depend upon it just at twelve o clock we heard the sound of a cannon boom shaking the whole town o connor loosens his sword in its scabbard and jumps for the door i went as far as the door and stood in it people were sticking their heads out of doors and windows but there was one grand sight that made the landscape look tame general tumbalo the comandante was rolling down the steps of his residential dugout waving a five foot sabre in his hand he wore his cocked and plumed hat and his dress parade coat covered with gold braid and buttons sky blue pajamas one rubber boot and one red plush slipper completed his make up the general had heard the cannon and he puffed down the sidewalk toward the soldiers barracks as fast as his rudely awakened two hundred pounds could travel o connor sees him and lets out a battle cry and draws his father s sword and rushes across the street and tackle s the enemy right there in the street he and the general gave an exhibition of blacksmithing and butchery sparks flew from their blades the general roared and o connor gave the slogan of his race and proclivities then the general s sabre broke in two and he took to his ginger colored heels crying out policios at every jump o connor chased him a block imbued with the sentiment of manslaughter and slicing buttons off the general s coat tails with the paternal weapon at the corner five barefooted policemen in cotton undershirts and straw fiats climbed over o connor and subjugated him according to the municipal statutes they brought him past the late revolutionary headquarters on the way to jail i stood in the door a policeman had him by each hand and foot and they dragged him on his back through the grass like a turtle twice they stopped and the odd policeman took another s place while he rolled a cigarette the great soldier of fortune turned his head and looked at me as they passed i blushed and lit another cigar the procession passed on and at ten minutes past twelve everybody had gone back to sleep again in the afternoon the interpreter came around and smiled as he laid his hand on the big red jar we usually kept ice water in the ice man didn t call to day says i what s the matter with everything sancho ah yes says the liver colored linguist they just tell me in the town verree bad act that senor o connor make fight with general tumbalo yes general tumbalo great soldier and big mans what ll they do to mr o connor i asks i talk little while presently with the juez de la paz what you call justice with the peace says sancho he tell me it verree bad crime that one senor americano try kill general tumbalo he say they keep senor o connor in jail six months then have trial and shoot him with guns verree sorree how about this revolution that was to be pulled off i asks oh says this sancho i think too hot weather for revolution revolution better in winter time maybe so next winter quien sabe but the cannon went off says i the signal was given that big sound says sancho grinning the boiler in ice factory he blow up boom wake everybody up from siesta verree sorree no ice mucho hot day about sunset i went over to the jail and they let me talk to o connor through the bars what s the news bowers says he have we taken the town i ve been expecting a rescue party all the afternoon i haven t heard any firing has any word been received from the capital take it easy barney says i i think there s been a change of plans there s something more important to talk about have you any money i have not says o connor the last dollar went to pay our hotel bill yesterday did our troops capture the custom house there ought be plenty of government money there segregate your mind from battles says i i ve been making inquiries you re to be shot six months from date for assault and battery i m expecting to receive fifty years at hard labor for vagrancy all they furnish you while you re a prisoner is water you depend on your friends for food i ll see what i can do i went away and found a silver chile dollar in an old vest of o connor s i took him some fried fish and rice for his supper in the morning i went down to a lagoon and had a drink of water and then went back to the jail o connor had a porterhouse steak look in his eye barney says i i ve found a pond full of the finest kind of water it s the grandest sweetest purest water in the world say the word and i ll go fetch you a bucket of it and you can throw this vile government stuff out the window i ll do anything i can for a friend has it come to this says o connor raging up and down his cell am i to be starved to death and then shot i ll make those traitors feel the weight of an o connor s hand when i get out of this and then he comes to the bars and speaks softer has nothing been heard from dona isabel he asks though every one else in the world fail says he i trust those eyes of hers she will find a way to effect my release do ye think ye could communicate with her one word from her even a rose would make me sorrow light but don t let her know except with the utmost delicacy bowers these high bred castilians are sensitive and proud well said barney says i you ve given me an idea i ll report later something s got to be pulled off quick or we ll both starve i walked out and down to hooligan alley and then on the other side of the street as i went past the window of dona isabel antonia concha regalia out flies the rose as usual and hits me on the ear the door was open and i took off my hat and walked in it wasn t very light inside but there she sat in a rocking chair by the window smoking a black cheroot and when i got closer i saw that she was about thirty nine and had never seen a straight front in her life i sat down on the arm of her chair and took the cheroot out of her mouth and stole a kiss hullo izzy i says excuse my unconventionality but i feel like i have known you for a month whose izzy is oo the lady ducked her head under her mantilla and drew in a long breath i thought she was going to scream but with all that intake of air she only came out with me likee americanos as soon as she said that i knew that o connor and me would be doing things with a knife and fork before the day was over i drew a chair beside her and inside of half an hour we were engaged then i took my hat and said i must go out for a while you come back says izzy in alarm me go bring preacher says i come back twenty minutes we marry now how you likee marry to day says izzy good i went down on the beach to the united states consul s shack he was a grizzly man eighty two pounds smoked glasses five foot eleven pickled he was playing chess with an india rubber man in white clothes excuse me for interrupting says i but can you tell me how a man could get married quick the consul gets up and fingers in a pigeonhole i believe i had a license to perform the ceremony myself a year or two ago he said i ll look and i caught hold of his arm don t look it up says i marriage is a lottery anyway i m willing to take the risk about the license if you are the consul went back to hooligan alley with me izzy called her ma to come in but the old lady was picking a chicken in the patio and begged to be excused so we stood up and the consul performed the ceremony that evening mrs bowers cooked a great supper of stewed goat tamales baked bananas fricasseed red peppers and coffee afterward i sat in the rocking chair by the front window and she sat on the floor plunking at a guitar and happy as she should be as mrs william t b all at once i sprang up in a hurry i d forgotten all about o connor i asked izzy to fix up a lot of truck for him to eat that big oogly man said izzy but all right he your friend i pulled a rose out of a bunch in a jar and took the grub basket around to the jail o connor ate like a wolf then he wiped his face with a banana peel and said have you heard nothing from dona isabel yet hist says i slipping the rose between the bars she sends you this she bids you take courage at nightfall two masked men brought it to the ruined chateau in the orange grove how did you like that goat hash barney o connor pressed the rose to his lips this is more to me than all the food in the world says he but the supper was fine where did you raise it i ve negotiated a stand off at a delicatessen but downtown i tells him rest easy if there s anything to be done i ll do it so things went along that way for some weeks izzy was a great cook and if she had had a little more poise of character and smoked a little better brand of tobacco we might have drifted into some sense of responsibility for the honor i had conferred on her but as time went on i began to hunger for the sight of a real lady standing before me in a street car all i was staying in that land of bilk and money for was because i couldn t get away and i thought it no more than decent to stay and see o connor shot one day our old interpreter drops around and after smoking an hour says that the judge of the peace sent him to request me to call on him i went to his office in a lemon grove on a hill at the edge of the town and there i had a surprise i expected to see one of the usual cinnamon colored natives in congress gaiters and one of pizzaro s cast off hats what i saw was an elegant gentleman of a slightly claybank complexion sitting in an upholstered leather chair sipping a highball and reading mrs humphry ward i had smuggled into my brain a few words of spanish by the help of izzy and i began to remark in a rich andalusian brogue buenas dias senor yo tengo yo tengo oh sit down mr bowers says he i spent eight years in your country in colleges and law schools let me mix you a highball lemon peel or not thus we got along in about half an hour i was beginning to tell him about the scandal in our family when aunt elvira ran away with a cumberland presbyterian preacher then he says to me i sent for you mr bowers to let you know that you can have your friend mr o connor now of course we had to make a show of punishing him on account of his attack on general tumbalo it is arranged that he shall be released to morrow night you and he will be conveyed on board the fruit steamer voyager bound for new york which lies in the harbor your passage will be arranged for one moment judge says i that revolution the judge lays back in his chair and howls why says he presently that was all a little joke fixed up by the boys around the court room and one or two of our cut ups and a few clerks in the stores the town is bursting its sides with laughing the boys made themselves up to be conspirators and they what you call it stick senor o connor for his money it is very funny it was says i i saw the joke all along i ll take another highball if your honor don t mind the next evening just at dark a couple of soldiers brought o connor down to the beach where i was waiting under a cocoanut tree hist says i in his ear dona isabel has arranged our escape not a word they rowed us in a boat out to a little steamer that smelled of table d hote salad oil and bone phosphate the great mellow tropical moon was rising as we steamed away o connor leaned on the taffrail or rear balcony of the ship and gazed silently at guaya at buncoville on the beach he had the red rose in his hand she will wait i heard him say eyes like hers never deceive but i shall see her again traitors cannot keep an o connor down forever you talk like a sequel says i but in volume ii please omit the light haired friend who totes the grub to the hero in his dungeon cell and thus reminiscing we came back to new york there was a little silence broken only by the familiar roar of the streets after kansas bill bowers ceased talking did o connor ever go back i asked he attained his heart s desire said bill can you walk two blocks i ll show you he led me eastward and down a flight of stairs that was covered by a curious shaped glowing pagoda like structure signs and figures on the tiled walls and supporting columns attested that we were in the grand central station of the subway hundreds of people were on the midway platform an uptown express dashed up and halted it was crowded there was a rush for it by a still larger crowd towering above every one there a magnificent broad shouldered athletic man leaped into the centre of the struggle men and women he seized in either hand and hurled them like manikins toward the open gates of the train now and then some passenger with a shred of soul and self respect left to him turned to offer remonstrance but the blue uniform on the towering figure the fierce and conquering glare of his eye and the ready impact of his ham like hands glued together the lips that would have spoken complaint when the train was full then he exhibited to all who might observe and admire his irresistible genius as a ruler of men with his knees with his elbows with his shoulders with his resistless feet he shoved crushed slammed heaved kicked flung pounded the overplus of passengers aboard then with the sounds of its wheels drowned by the moans shrieks prayers and curses of its unfortunate crew the express dashed away that s him ain t he a wonder said kansas bill admiringly that tropical country wasn t the place for him i wish the distinguished traveller writer war correspondent and playright richmond hobson davis could see him now o connor ought to be dramatized the atavism of john tom little bear o henry thought this the best of the jeff peters stories all the rest of which are included in the gentle grafter except cupid a la carte in the heart of the west the atavism of john tom little bear appeared in everybody s magazine for july i saw a light in jeff peters s room over the red front drug store i hastened toward it for i had not known that jeff was in town he is a man of the hadji breed of a hundred occupations with a story to tell when he will of each one i found jeff repacking his grip for a run down to florida to look at an orange grove for which he had traded a month before his mining claim on the yukon he kicked me a chair with the same old humorous profound smile on his seasoned countenance it had been eight months since we had met but his greeting was such as men pass from day to day time is jeff s servant and the continent is a big lot across which he cuts to his many roads for a while we skirmished along the edges of unprofitable talk which culminated in that unquiet problem of the philippines all them tropical races said jeff could be run out better with their own jockeys up the tropical man knows what he wants all he wants is a season ticket to the cock fights and a pair of western union climbers to go up the bread fruit tree the anglo saxon man wants him to learn to conjugate and wear suspenders he ll be happiest in his own way i was shocked education man i said is the watchword in time they will rise to our standard of civilization look at what education has done for the indian o ho sang jeff lighting his pipe which was a good sign yes the indian i m looking i hasten to contemplate the redman as a standard bearer of progress he s the same as the other brown boys you can t make an anglo saxon of him did i ever tell you about the time my friend john tom little bear bit off the right ear of the arts of culture and education and spun the teetotum back round to where it was when columbus was a little boy i did not john tom little bear was an educated cherokee indian and an old friend of mine when i was in the territories he was a graduate of one of them eastern football colleges that have been so successful in teaching the indian to use the gridiron instead of burning his victims at the stake as an anglo saxon john tom was copper colored in spots as an indian he was one of the whitest men i ever knew as a cherokee he was a gentleman on the first ballot as a ward of the nation he was mighty hard to carry at the primaries john tom and me got together and began to make medicine how to get up some lawful genteel swindle which we might work in a quiet way so as not to excite the stupidity of the police or the cupidity of the larger corporations we had close upon between us and we pined to make it grow as all respectable capitalists do so we figured out a proposition which seems to be as honorable as a gold mine prospectus and as profitable as a church raffle and inside of thirty days you find us swarming into kansas with a pair of fluent horses and a red camping wagon on the european plan john tom is chief wish heap dough the famous indian medicine man and samaritan sachem of the seven tribes mr peters is business manager and half owner we needed a third man so we looked around and found j conyngham binkly leaning against the want column of a newspaper this binkly has a disease for shakespearian roles and an hallucination about a nights run on the new york stage but he confesses that he never could earn the butter to spread on his william s roles so he is willing to drop to the ordinary baker s kind and be satisfied with a mile run behind the medicine ponies besides richard iii he could do twenty seven coon songs and banjo specialties and was willing to cook and curry the horses we carried a fine line of excuses for taking money one was a magic soap for removing grease spots and quarters from clothes one was a sum wah tah the great indian remedy made from a prairie herb revealed by the great spirit in a dream to his favorite medicine men the great chiefs mcgarrity and siberstein bottlers chicago and the other was a frivolous system of pick pocketing the kansasters that had the department stores reduced to a decimal fraction look ye a pair of silk garters a dream book one dozen clothespins a gold tooth and when knighthood was in flower all wrapped up in a genuine japanese silkarina handkerchief and handed to the handsome lady by mr peters for the trivial sum of fifty cents while professor binkly entertains us in a three minute round with the banjo twas an eminent graft we had we ravaged peacefully through the state determined to remove all doubt as to why twas called bleeding kansas john tom little bear in full indian chief s costume drew crowds away from the parchesi sociables and government ownership conversaziones while at the football college in the east he had acquired quantities of rhetoric and the art of calisthenics and sophistry in his classes and when he stood up in the red wagon and explained to the farmers eloquent about chilblains and hyperaesthesia of the cranium jeff couldn t hand out the indian remedy fast enough for em one night we was camped on the edge of a little town out west of salina we always camped near a stream and put up a little tent sometimes we sold out of the remedy unexpected and then chief wish heap dough would have a dream in which the manitou commanded him to fill up a few bottles of sum wah tah at the most convenient place twas about ten o clock and we d just got in from a street performance i was in the tent with the lantern figuring up the day s profits john tom hadn t taken off his indian make up and was sitting by the campfire minding a fine sirloin steak in the pan for the professor till he finished his hair raising scene with the trained horses all at once out of dark bushes comes a pop like a firecracker and john tom gives a grunt and digs out of his bosom a little bullet that has dented itself against his collar bone john tom makes a dive in the direction of the fireworks and comes back dragging by the collar a kid about nine or ten years young in a velveteen suit with a little nickel mounted rifle in his hand about as big as a fountain pen here you pappoose says john tom what are you gunning for with that howitzer you might hit somebody in the eye come out jeff and mind the steak don t let it burn while i investigate this demon with the pea shooter cowardly redskin says the kid like he was quoting from a favorite author dare to burn me at the stake and the paleface will sweep you from the prairies like like everything now you lemme go or i ll tell mamma john tom plants the kid on a camp stool and sits down by him now tell the big chief he says why you try to shoot pellets into your uncle john s system didn t you know it was loaded are you a indian asks the kid looking up cute as you please at john tom s buckskin and eagle feathers i am says john tom well then that s why answers the boy swinging his feet i nearly let the steak burn watching the nerve of that youngster o ho says john tom i see you re the boy avenger and you ve sworn to rid the continent of the savage redman is that about the way of it son the kid halfway nodded his head and then he looked glum twas indecent to wring his secret from his bosom before a single brave had fallen before his parlor rifle now tell us where your wigwam is pappoose says john tom where you live your mamma will be worrying about you being out so late tell me and i ll take you home the kid grins i guess not he says i live thousands and thousands of miles over there he gyrated his hand toward the horizon i come on the train he says by myself i got off here because the conductor said my ticket had ex pirated he looks at john tom with sudden suspicion i bet you ain t a indian he says you don t talk like a indian you look like one but all a indian can say is heap good and paleface die say i bet you are one of them make believe indians that sell medicine on the streets i saw one once in quincy you never mind says john tom whether i m a cigar sign or a tammany cartoon the question before the council is what s to be done with you you ve run away from home you ve been reading howells you ve disgraced the profession of boy avengers by trying to shoot a tame indian and never saying die dog of a redskin you have crossed the path of the boy avenger nineteen times too often what do you mean by it the kid thought for a minute i guess i made a mistake he says i ought to have gone farther west they find em wild out there in the canyons he holds out his hand to john tom the little rascal please excuse me sir says he for shooting at you i hope it didn t hurt you but you ought to be more careful when a scout sees a indian in his war dress his rifle must speak little bear give a big laugh with a whoop at the end of it and swings the kid ten feet high and sets him on his shoulder and the runaway fingers the fringe and the eagle feathers and is full of the joy the white man knows when he dangles his heels against an inferior race it is plain that little bear and that kid are chums from that on the little renegade has already smoked the pipe of peace with the savage and you can see in his eye that he is figuring on a tomahawk and a pair of moccasins children s size we have supper in the tent the youngster looks upon me and the professor as ordinary braves only intended as a background to the camp scene when he is seated on a box of sum wah tah with the edge of the table sawing his neck and his mouth full of beefsteak little bear calls for his name roy says the kid with a sirloiny sound to it but when the rest of it and his post office address is referred to he shakes his head i guess not he says you ll send me back i want to stay with you i like this camping out at home we fellows had a camp in our back yard they called me roy the red wolf i guess that ll do for a name gimme another piece of beefsteak please we had to keep that kid we knew there was a hullabaloo about him somewheres and that mamma and uncle harry and aunt jane and the chief of police were hot after finding his trail but not another word would he tell us in two days he was the mascot of the big medicine outfit and all of us had a sneaking hope that his owners wouldn t turn up when the red wagon was doing business he was in it and passed up the bottles to mr peters as proud and satisfied as a prince that s abjured a two hundred dollar crown for a million dollar parvenuess once john tom asked him something about his papa i ain t got any papa he says he runned away and left us he made my mamma cry aunt lucy says he s a shape a what somebody asks him a shape says the kid some kind of a shape lemme see oh yes a feendenuman shape i don t know what it means john tom was for putting our brand on him and dressing him up like a little chief with wampum and beads but i vetoes it somebody s lost that kid is my view of it and they may want him you let me try him with a few stratagems and see if i can t get a look at his visiting card so that night i goes up to mr roy blank by the camp fire and looks at him contemptuous and scornful snickenwitzel says i like the word made me sick snickenwitzel bah before i d be named snickenwitzel what s the matter with you jeff says the kid opening his eyes wide snickenwitzel i repeats and i spat the word out i saw a man to day from your town and he told me your name i m not surprised you was ashamed to tell it snickenwitzel whew ah here now says the boy indignant and wriggling all over what s the matter with you that ain t my name it s conyers what s the matter with you and that s not the worst of it i went on quick keeping him hot and not giving him time to think we thought you was from a nice well to do family here s mr little bear a chief of the cherokees entitled to wear nine otter tails on his sunday blanket and professor binkly who plays shakespeare and the banjo and me that s got hundreds of dollars in that black tin box in the wagon and we ve got to be careful about the company we keep that man tells me your folks live way down in little old hencoop alley where there are no sidewalks and the goats eat off the table with you that kid was almost crying now taint so he splutters he he don t know what he s talking about we live on poplar av noo i don t sociate with goats what s the matter with you poplar avenue says i sarcastic poplar avenue that s a street to live on it only runs two blocks and then falls off a bluff you can throw a keg of nails the whole length of it don t talk to me about poplar avenue it s it s miles long says the kid our number s and there s lots of houses after that what s the matter with aw you make me tired jeff well well now says i i guess that man made a mistake maybe it was some other boy he was talking about if i catch him i ll teach him to go around slandering people and after supper i goes up town and telegraphs to mrs conyers poplar avenue quincy ill that the kid is safe and sassy with us and will be held for further orders in two hours an answer comes to hold him tight and she ll start for him by next train the next train was due at p m the next day and me and john tom was at the depot with the kid you might scour the plains in vain for the big chief wish heap dough in his place is mr little bear in the human habiliments of the anglo saxon sect and the leather of his shoes is patented and the loop of his necktie is copyrighted for these things john tom had grafted on him at college along with metaphysics and the knockout guard for the low tackle but for his complexion which is some yellowish and the black mop of his straight hair you might have thought here was an ordinary man out of the city directory that subscribes for magazines and pushes the lawn mower in his shirt sleeves of evenings then the train rolled in and a little woman in a gray dress with sort of illuminating hair slides off and looks around quick and the boy avenger sees her and yells mamma and she cries o and they meet in a clinch and now the pesky redskins can come forth from their caves on the plains without fear any more of the rifle of roy the red wolf mrs conyers comes up and thanks me an john tom without the usual extremities you always look for in a woman she says just enough in a way to convince and there is no incidental music by the orchestra i made a few illiterate requisitions upon the art of conversation at which the lady smiles friendly as if she had known me a week and then mr little bear adorns the atmosphere with the various idioms into which education can fracture the wind of speech i could see the kid s mother didn t quite place john tom but it seemed she was apprised in his dialects and she played up to his lead in the science of making three words do the work of one that kid introduced us with some footnotes and explanations that made things plainer than a week of rhetoric he danced around and punched us in the back and tried to climb john tom s leg this is john tom mamma says he he s a indian he sells medicine in a red wagon i shot him but he wasn t wild the other one s jeff he s a fakir too come on and see the camp where we live won t you mamma it is plain to see that the life of the woman is in that boy she has got him again where her arms can gather him and that s enough she s ready to do anything to please him she hesitates the eighth of a second and takes another look at these men i imagine she says to herself about john tom seems to be a gentleman if his hair don t curl and mr peters she disposes of as follows no ladies man but a man who knows a lady so we all rambled down to the camp as neighborly as coming from a wake and there she inspects the wagon and pats the place with her hand where the kid used to sleep and dabs around her eyewinkers with her handkerchief and professor binkly gives us trovatore on one strong of the banjo and is about to slide off into hamlet s monologue when one of the horses gets tangled in his rope and he must go look after him and says something about foiled again when it got dark me and john tom walked back up to the corn exchange hotel and the four of us had supper there i think the trouble started at that supper for then was when mr little bear made an intellectual balloon ascension i held on to the tablecloth and listened to him soar that redman if i could judge had the gift of information he took language and did with it all a roman can do with macaroni his vocal remarks was all embroidered over with the most scholarly verbs and prefixes and his syllables was smooth and fitted nicely to the joints of his idea i thought i d heard him talk before but i hadn t and it wasn t the size of his words but the way they come and twasn t his subjects for he spoke of common things like cathedrals and football and poems and catarrh and souls and freight rates and sculpture mrs conyers understood his accents and the elegant sounds went back and forth between em and now and then jefferson d peters would intervene a few shop worn senseless words to have the butter passed or another leg of the chicken yes john tom little bear appeared to be inveigled some in his bosom about that mrs conyers she was of the kind that pleases she had the good looks and more i ll tell you you take one of these cloak models in a big store they strike you as being on the impersonal system they are adapted for the eye what they run to is inches around and complexion and the art of fanning the delusion that the sealskin would look just as well on the lady with the warts and the pocket book now if one of them models was off duty and you took it and it would say charlie when you pressed it and sit up at the table why then you would have something similar to mrs conyers i could see how john tom could resist any inclination to hate that white squaw the lady and the kid stayed at the hotel in the morning they say they will start for home me and little bear left at eight o clock and sold indian remedy on the courthouse square till nine he leaves me and the professor to drive down to camp while he stays up town i am not enamored with that plan for it shows john tom is uneasy in his composures and that leads to firewater and sometimes to the green corn dance and costs not often does chief wish heap dough get busy with the firewater but whenever he does there is heap much doing in the lodges of the palefaces who wear blue and carry the club at half past nine professor binkly is rolled in his quilt snoring in blank verse and i am sitting by the fire listening to the frogs mr little bear slides into camp and sits down against a tree there is no symptoms of firewater jeff says he after a long time a little boy came west to hunt indians well then says i for i wasn t thinking as he was and he bagged one says john tom and twas not with a gun and he never had on a velveteen suit of clothes in his life and then i began to catch his smoke i know it says i and i ll bet you his pictures are on valentines and fool men are his game red and white you win on the red says john tom calm jeff for how many ponies do you think i could buy mrs conyers scandalous talk i replies tis not a paleface custom john tom laughs loud and bites into a cigar no he answers tis the savage equivalent for the dollars of the white man s marriage settlement oh i know there s an eternal wall between the races if i could do it jeff i d put a torch to every white college that a redman has ever set foot inside why don t you leave us alone he says to our own ghost dances and dog feasts and our dingy squaws to cook our grasshopper soup and darn our moccasins now you sure don t mean disrespect to the perennial blossom entitled education says i scandalized because i wear it in the bosom of my own intellectual shirt waist i ve had education says i and never took any harm from it you lasso us goes on little bear not noticing my prose insertions and teach us what is beautiful in literature and in life and how to appreciate what is fine in men and women what have you done to me says he you ve made me a cherokee moses you ve taught me to hate the wigwams and love the white man s ways i can look over into the promised land and see mrs conyers but my place is on the reservation little bear stands up in his chief s dress and laughs again but white man jeff he goes on the paleface provides a recourse tis a temporary one but it gives a respite and the name of it is whiskey and straight off he walks up the path to town again now says i in my mind may the manitou move him to do only bailable things this night for i perceive that john tom is about to avail himself of the white man s solace maybe it was as i sat smoking when i hear pit a pats on the path and here comes mrs conyers running her hair twisted up any way and a look on her face that says burglars and mice and the flour s all out rolled in one oh mr peters she calls out as they will oh oh i made a quick think and i spoke the gist of it out loud now says i we ve been brothers me and that indian but i ll make a good one of him in two minutes if no no she says wild and cracking her knuckles i haven t seen mr little bear tis my husband he s stolen my boy oh she says just when i had him back in my arms again that heartless villain every bitterness life knows she says he s made me drink my poor little lamb that ought to be warm in his bed carried of by that fiend how did all this happen i ask let s have the facts i was fixing his bed she explains and roy was playing on the hotel porch and he drives up to the steps i heard roy scream and ran out my husband had him in the buggy then i begged him for my child this is what he gave me she turns her face to the light there is a crimson streak running across her cheek and mouth he did that with his whip she says come back to the hotel says i and we ll see what can be done on the way she tells me some of the wherefores when he slashed her with the whip he told her he found out she was coming for the kid and he was on the same train mrs conyers had been living with her brother and they d watched the boy always as her husband had tried to steal him before i judge that man was worse than a street railway promoter it seems he had spent her money and slugged her and killed her canary bird and told it around that she had cold feet at the hotel we found a mass meeting of five infuriated citizens chewing tobacco and denouncing the outrage most of the town was asleep by ten o clock i talks the lady some quiet and tells her i will take the one o clock train for the next town forty miles east for it is likely that the esteemed mr conyers will drive there to take the cars i don t know i tells her but what he has legal rights but if i find him i can give him an illegal left in the eye and tie him up for a day or two anyhow on a disturbal of the peace proposition mrs conyers goes inside and cries with the landlord s wife who is fixing some catnip tea that will make everything all right for the poor dear the landlord comes out on the porch thumbing his one suspender and says to me ain t had so much excitements in town since bedford steegall s wife swallered a spring lizard i seen him through the winder hit her with the buggy whip and everything what s that suit of clothes cost you you got on pears like we d have some rain don t it say doc that indian of yorn s on a kind of a whizz to night ain t he he comes along just before you did and i told him about this here occurrence he gives a cur us kind of a hoot and trotted off i guess our constable ll have him in the lock up fore morning i thought i d sit on the porch and wait for the one o clock train i wasn t feeling saturated with mirth here was john tom on one of his sprees and this kidnapping business losing sleep for me but then i m always having trouble with other people s troubles every few minutes mrs conyers would come out on the porch and look down the road the way the buggy went like she expected to see that kid coming back on a white pony with a red apple in his hand now wasn t that like a woman and that brings up cats i saw a mouse go in this hole says mrs cat you can go prize up a plank over there if you like i ll watch this hole about a quarter to one o clock the lady comes out again restless crying easy as females do for their own amusement and she looks down that road again and listens now ma am says i there s no use watching cold wheel tracks by this time they re halfway to hush she says holding up her hand and i do hear something coming flip flap in the dark and then there is the awfulest war whoop ever heard outside of madison square garden at a buffalo bill matinee and up the steps and on to the porch jumps the disrespectable indian the lamp in the hall shines on him and i fail to recognize mr j t little bear alumnus of the class of what i see is a cherokee brave and the warpath is what he has been travelling firewater and other things have got him going his buckskin is hanging in strings and his feathers are mixed up like a frizzly hen s the dust of miles is on his moccasins and the light in his eye is the kind the aborigines wear but in his arms he brings that kid his eyes half closed with his little shoes dangling and one hand fast around the indian s collar pappoose says john tom and i notice that the flowers of the white man s syntax have left his tongue he is the original proposition in bear s claws and copper color me bring says he and he lays the kid in his mother s arms run fifteen mile says john tom ugh catch white man bring pappoose the little woman is in extremities of gladness she must wake up that stir up trouble youngster and hug him and make proclamation that he is his mamma s own precious treasure i was about to ask questions but i looked at mr little bear and my eye caught the sight of something in his belt now go to bed ma am says i and this gadabout youngster likewise for there s no more danger and the kidnapping business is not what it was earlier in the night i inveigled john tom down to camp quick and when he tumbled over asleep i got that thing out of his belt and disposed of it where the eye of education can t see it for even the football colleges disapprove of the art of scalp taking in their curriculums it is ten o clock next day when john tom wakes up and looks around i am glad to see the nineteenth century in his eyes again what was it jeff he asks heap firewater says i john tom frowns and thinks a little combined says he directly with the interesting little physiological shake up known as reversion to type i remember now have they gone yet on the train i answers ugh says john tom better so paleface bring big chief wish heap dough a little bromo seltzer and then he ll take up the redman s burden again helping the other fellow originally published in munsey s magazine december but can thim that helps others help thimselves mulvaney this is the story that william trotter told me on the beach at aguas frescas while i waited for the gig of the captain of the fruit steamer andador which was to take me abroad reluctantly i was leaving the land of always afternoon william was remaining and he favored me with a condensed oral autobiography as we sat on the sands in the shade cast by the bodega nacional as usual i became aware that the man from bombay had already written the story but as he had compressed it to an eight word sentence i have become an expansionist and have quoted his phrase above with apologies to him and best regards to terence ii don t you ever have a desire to go back to the land of derby hats and starched collars i asked him you seem to be a handy man and a man of action i continued and i am sure i could find you a comfortable job somewhere in the states ragged shiftless barefooted a confirmed eater of the lotos william trotter had pleased me much and i hated to see him gobbled up by the tropics i ve no doubt you could he said idly splitting the bark from a section of sugar cane i ve no doubt you could do much for me if every man could do as much for himself as he can for others every country in the world would be holding millenniums instead of centennials there seemed to be pabulum in w t s words and then another idea came to me i had a brother in chicopee falls who owned manufactories cotton or sugar or a a sheetings or something in the commercial line lie was vulgarly rich and therefore reverenced art the artistic temperament of the family was monopolized at my birth i knew that brother james would honor my slightest wish i would demand from him a position in cotton sugar or sheetings for william trotter something say at two hundred a month or thereabouts i confided my beliefs and made

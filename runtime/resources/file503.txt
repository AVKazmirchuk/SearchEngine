went for a little run on the other side while pottering around in italy and switzerland they happened one day to hear of a monastery in the swiss alps that promised something outside of the ordinary tourist beguiling attractions the monastery was almost inaccessible to the average sightseer being on an extremely rugged and precipitous spur of the mountains the attractions it possessed but did not advertise were first an exclusive and divine cordial made by the monks that was said to far surpass benedictine and chartreuse next a huge brass bell so purely and accurately cast that it had not ceased sounding since it was first rung three hundred years ago finally it was asserted that no englishman had ever set foot within its walls eyres and gilliam decided that these three reports called for investigation it took them two days with the aid of two guides to reach the monastery of st gondrau it stood upon a frozen wind swept crag with the snow piled about it in treacherous drifting masses they were hospitably received by the brothers whose duty it was to entertain the infrequent guest they drank of the precious cordial finding it rarely potent and reviving they listened to the great ever echoing bell and learned that they were pioneer travelers in those gray stone walls over the englishman whose restless feet have trodden nearly every corner of the earth at three o clock on the afternoon they arrived the two young gothamites stood with good brother cristofer in the great cold hallway of the monastery to watch the monks march past on their way to the refectory they came slowly pacing by twos with their heads bowed treading noiselessly with sandaled feet upon the rough stone flags as the procession slowly filed past eyres suddenly gripped gilliam by the arm look he whispered eagerly at the one just opposite you now the one on this side with his hand at his waist if that isn t johnny bellchambers then i never saw him gilliam saw and recognized the lost glass of fashion what the deuce said he wonderingly is old bell doing here tommy it surely can t be he never heard of bell having a turn for the religious fact is i ve heard him say things when a four in hand didn t seem to tie up just right that would bring him up for court martial before any church it s bell without a doubt said eyres firmly or i m pretty badly in need of an oculist but think of johnny bellchambers the royal high chancellor of swell togs and the mahatma of pink teas up here in cold storage doing penance in a snuff colored bathrobe i can t get it straight in my mind let s ask the jolly old boy that s doing honors brother cristofer was appealed to for information by that time the monks had passed into the refectory he could not tell to which one they referred bellchambers ah the brothers of st gondrau abandoned their worldly names when they took the vows did the gentlemen wish to speak with one of the brothers if they would come to the refectory and indicate the one they wished to see the reverend abbot in authority would doubtless permit it eyres and gilliam went into the dining hall and pointed out to brother cristofer the man they had seen yes it was johnny bellchambers they saw his face plainly now as he sat among the dingy brothers never looking up eating broth from a coarse brown bowl permission to speak to one of the brothers was granted to the two travelers by the abbot and they waited in a reception room for him to come when he did come treading softly in his sandals both eyres and gilliam looked at him in perplexity and astonishment it was johnny bellchambers but he had a different look upon his smooth shaven face was an expression of ineffable peace of rapturous attainment of perfect and complete happiness his form was proudly erect his eyes shone with a serene and gracious light he was as neat and well groomed as in the old new york days but how differently was he clad now he seemed clothed in but a single garment a long robe of rough brown cloth gathered by a cord at the waist and falling in straight loose folds nearly to his feet he shook hands with his visitors with his old ease and grace of manner if there was any embarrassment in that meeting it was not manifested by johnny bellchambers the room had no seats they stood to converse glad to see you old man said eyres somewhat awkwardly wasn t expecting to find you up here not a bad idea though after all society s an awful sham must be a relief to shake the giddy whirl and retire to er contemplation and er prayer and hymns and those things oh cut that tommy said bellchambers cheerfully don t be afraid that i ll pass around the plate i go through these thing um bobs with the rest of these old boys because they are the rules i m brother ambrose here you know i m given just ten minutes to talk to you fellows that s rather a new design in waistcoats you have on isn t it gilliam are they wearing those things on broadway now it s the same old johnny said gilliam joyfully what the devil i mean why oh confound it what did you do it for old man peel the bathrobe pleaded eyres almost tearfully and go back with us the old crowd ll go wild to see you this isn t in your line bell i know half a dozen girls that wore the willow on the quiet when you shook us in that unaccountable way hand in your resignation or get a dispensation or whatever you have

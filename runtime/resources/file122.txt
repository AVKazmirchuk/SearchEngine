a look of calm and sinister resolve beelzebub had been floundering in the sea of improbability holding by a slender life line to the respectable world that had cast him overboard he must have felt that with this ultimate shock the line had snapped and have experienced the welcome ease of the drowning swimmer who has ceased to struggle blythe walked to the next corner and stood there while he brushed the sand from his garments and repolished his glasses i ve got to do it oh i ve got to do it he told himself aloud if i had a quart of rum i believe i could stave it off yet for a little while but there s no more rum for beelzebub as they call me by the flames of tartarus if i m to sit at the right hand of satan somebody has got to pay the court expenses you ll have to pony up mr frank goodwin you re a good fellow but a gentleman must draw the line at being kicked into the gutter blackmail isn t a pretty word but it s the next station on the road i m travelling with purpose in his steps blythe now moved rapidly through the town by way of its landward environs he passed through the squalid quarters of the improvident negroes and on beyond the picturesque shacks of the poorer mestizos from many points along his course he could see through the umbrageous glades the house of frank goodwin on its wooded hill and as he crossed the little bridge over the lagoon he saw the old indian galvez scrubbing at the wooden slab that bore the name of miraflores beyond the lagoon the lands of goodwin began to slope gently upward a grassy road shaded by a munificent and diverse array of tropical flora wound from the edge of an outlying banana grove to the dwelling blythe took this road with long and purposeful strides goodwin was seated on his coolest gallery dictating letters to his secretary a sallow and capable native youth the household adhered to the american plan of breakfast and that meal had been a thing of the past for the better part of an hour the castaway walked to the steps and flourished a hand good morning blythe said goodwin looking up come in and have a chair anything i can do for you i want to speak to you in private goodwin nodded at his secretary who strolled out under a mango tree and lit a cigarette blythe took the chair that he had left vacant i want some money he began doggedly i m sorry said goodwin with equal directness but you can t have any you re drinking yourself to death blythe your friends have done all they could to help you to brace up you won t help yourself there s no use furnishing you with money to ruin yourself with any longer dear man said blythe tilting back his chair it isn t a question of social economy now it s past that i like you goodwin and i ve come to stick a knife between your ribs i was kicked out of espada s saloon this morning and society owes me reparation for my wounded feelings i didn t kick you out no but in a general way you represent society and in a particular way you represent my last chance i ve had to come down to it old man i tried to do it a month ago when losada s man was here turning things over but i couldn t do it then now it s different i want a thousand dollars goodwin and you ll have to give it to me only last week said goodwin with a smile a silver dollar was all you were asking for an evidence said blythe flippantly that i was still virtuous though under heavy pressure the wages of sin should be something higher than a peso worth forty eight cents let s talk business i am the villain in the third act and i must have my merited if only temporary triumph i saw you collar the late president s valiseful of boodle oh i know it s blackmail but i m liberal about the price i know i m a cheap villain one of the regular sawmill drama kind but you re one of my particular friends and i don t want to stick you hard suppose you go into the details suggested goodwin calmly arranging his letters on the table all right said beelzebub i like the way you take it i despise histrionics so you will please prepare yourself for the facts without any red fire calcium or grace notes on the saxophone on the night that his fly by night excellency arrived in town i was very drunk you will excuse the pride with which i state that fact but it was quite a feat for me to attain that desirable state somebody had left a cot out under the orange trees in the yard of madama ortiz s hotel i stepped over the wall laid down upon it and fell asleep i was awakened by an orange that dropped from the tree upon my nose and i laid there for a while cursing sir isaac newton or

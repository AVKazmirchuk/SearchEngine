that per plexity your deliverance depends upon yourself come he led his companion up the stairway halfway up lorison caught him by the sleeve remember he gasped i love that woman you desired to know i

increased as they neared it the stairs shook with the mellow vibrations lorison stopped breathing when he set foot upon the highest step for the priest stood aside and motioned him to look through the glass of the door his eye accustomed to the darkness met first a blind ing glare and then he made out the faces and forms of many people amid an extravagant display of splendid robings billowy laces brilliant hued finery ribbons silks and misty drapery and then he caught the mean ing of that jarring hum and he saw the tired pale happy face of his wife bending as were a score of others over her sewing machine toiling toiling here was the folly she pursued and the end of his quest but not his deliverance though even then remorse struck him his shamed soul fluttered once more before it retired to make room for the other and better one for to temper his thrill of joy the shine of the satin and the glimmer of ornaments recalled the disturbing figure of the bespangled amazon and the base

and beg her forgiveness sir said the priest do you owe me nothing be quiet it seems so often that heaven lets fall its choicest gifts into hands that must be taught to hold them listen again you forgot that repentant sin must not comprom ise but look up for redemption to the purest and best you went to her with the fine spun sophistry that peace could be found in a mutual guilt and she

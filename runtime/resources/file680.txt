broadway and there her heart leaped to see the sign fox otter stretching entirely across the front of a tall building it was as though an unseen guide had led her to it through the by ways of her fruitless search for work she hurried into the store and sent in to mr otter by a clerk her name and the letter he had written her father she was shown directly into his private office mr otter arose from his desk as elsie entered and took both hands with a hearty smile of welcome he was a slightly corpulent man of nearly middle age a little bald gold spectacled polite well dressed radiating well well and so this is beatty s little daughter your father was one of our most efficient and valued employees he left nothing well well i hope we have not forgotten his faithful services i am sure there

hawkins came miss hawkins said mr otter bring for miss beatty to try on one of those russian sable coats and let s see one of those latest model black tulle hats with white tips elsie stood before the full length mirror with pink cheeks and quick breath her eyes shone like faint stars she was beautiful alas she was beautiful i wish i could stop this story here confound it i will no it s got to run it out i didn t make it up i m just repeating it i d like to throw bouquets at the wise cop and the lady who rescues girls from jobs and the prohibitionist who is trying to crush brandy balls and the sky pilot who objects to costumes for stage people there are others and all the thousands of good people who are at work protecting young people from the pitfalls of a great city and then wind up by pointing out how they were the means of elsie reaching her father s benefactor and her kind friend and rescuer from poverty this would make a fine elsie story of the old sort i d like to do this but there s just a word or two to follow while elsie was admiring herself in the mirror mr otter went to the telephone booth and called up some number don t ask me what it was oscar said he i want you to reserve the same table for me this evening what why the one in the moorish room to the left of the shrubbery yes two yes the usual brand and the johannisburger with the roast if it isn t the right temperature i ll break your neck no not her no indeed a new one a peacherino oscar a peacherino tired and tiresome reader i will conclude if you please with a paraphrase of a few words that you will remember were written by him by him of gad s hill before whom if you doff not your hat you shall stand with a covered pumpkin aye sir a pumpkin lost your excellency lost associations and societies lost right reverends and wrong reverends of every order lost reformers and lawmakers born with heavenly compassion in your hearts but with the reverence of money in your souls and lost thus around us every day the voice of the city the voice of the city twenty five years ago the school children used to chant their lessons the manner of their delivery was a singsong recitative between the utterance of an episcopal minister and the drone of a tired sawmill i mean no disrespect we must have lumber and sawdust i remember one beautiful and instructive little lyric that emanated from the physiology class the most striking line of it was this the shin bone is the long est bone in the hu man bod y what an inestimable boon it would have been if all the corporeal and spiritual facts pertaining to man bad thus been tunefully and logically inculcated in our youthful minds but what we gained in anatomy music and philosophy was meagre the other day i became confused i needed a ray of light i turned back to those school days for aid but in all the nasal harmonies we whined forth from those bard benches i could not recall one that treated of the voice of agglomerated mankind in other words of the composite vocal message of massed humanity in other words of the voice of a big city now the individual voice is not lacking we can understand the song of the poet the ripple of the brook the meaning of the man who wants until next monday the inscriptions on the tombs of the pharaohs the language of flowers the step lively of the conductor and the prelude of the milk cans at a m certain large eared ones even assert that they are wise to the vibrations of the tympanum pro need by concussion of the air emanating from mr h james but who can comprehend the meaning of the voice of the city i went out for to see first i asked aurelia she wore white swiss and a bat with flowers on it and ribbons and ends of things fluttered here and there tell me i said stammeringly for i have no voice of my own what does this big er enormous er whopping city say it must have a voice of some kind does it ever speak to you how do you interpret its meaning it is a tremen dous

as the vulgarians say money was lacking to pay mr magister and herr rosenstock their prices when one loves one s art no service seems too hard so delia said she must give music lessons to keep the chafing dish bubbling for two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils one evening she came home elated joe dear she said gleefully i ve a pupil and oh the loveliest people general general a b pinkney s daughter on seventy first street such a splendid house joe you ought to see the front door byzantine i think you would call it and inside oh joe i never saw anything like it before my pupil is his daughter clementina i dearly love her already she s a delicate thing dresses always in white and the sweetest simplest manners only eighteen years old i m to give three lessons a week and just think joe a lesson i don t mind it a bit for when i get two or three more pupils i can resume my lessons with herr rosenstock now smooth out that wrinkle between your brows dear and let s have a nice supper that s all right for you dele said joe attacking a can of peas with a carving knife and a hatchet but how about me do you think i m going to let you hustle for wages while i philander in the regions of high art not by the bones of benvenuto cellini i guess i can sell papers or lay cobblestones and bring in a dollar or two delia came and hung about his neck joe dear you are silly you must keep on at your studies it is not as if i had quit my music and gone to work at something else while i teach i learn i am always with my music and we can live as happily as millionaires on a week you mustn t think of leaving mr magister all right said joe reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable dish but i hate for you to be giving lessons it isn t art but you re a trump and a dear to do it when one loves one s art no service seems too hard said delia magister praised the sky in that sketch i made in the park said joe and tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his window i may sell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees them i m sure you will said delia sweetly and now let s be thankful for gen pinkney and this veal roast during all of the next week the larrabees had an early breakfast joe was enthusiastic about some morning effect sketches he was doing in central park and delia packed him off breakfasted coddled praised and kissed at o clock art is an engaging mistress it was most times o clock when he returned in the evening at the end of the week delia sweetly proud but languid triumphantly tossed three five dollar bills on the x inches centre table of the x feet flat parlour sometimes she said a little wearily clementina tries me i m afraid she doesn t practise enough and i have to tell her the same things so often and then she always dresses entirely in white and that does get monotonous but gen pinkney is the dearest old man i wish you could know him joe he comes in sometimes when i am with clementina at the piano he is a widower you know and stands there pulling his white goatee and how are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers progressing he always asks i wish you could see the wainscoting in that drawing room joe and those astrakhan rug portieres and clementina has such a funny little cough i hope she is stronger than she looks oh i really am getting attached to her she is so gentle and high bred gen pinkney s brother was once minister to bolivia and then joe with the air of a monte cristo drew forth a ten a five a two and a one all legal tender notes and laid them beside delia s earnings sold that watercolour of the obelisk to a man from peoria he announced overwhelmingly don t joke with me said delia not from peoria all the way i wish you could see him dele fat man with a woollen muffler and a quill toothpick he saw the sketch in tinkle s window and thought it was a windmill at first he was game though and bought it anyhow he ordered another an oil sketch of the lackawanna freight depot to take back with him music lessons oh i guess art is still in it i m so glad you ve kept on said delia heartily you re bound to win dear thirty three dollars we never had so much to spend before we ll have oysters to night and filet mignon with champignons said joe were is the olive fork on the next saturday evening joe reached home first he spread his on the parlour table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his hands half an hour later delia arrived her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle of wraps and bandages how is this asked joe after the usual greetings delia laughed but not very joyously clementina she explained insisted upon a welsh rabbit after her lesson she is such a queer girl welsh rabbits at in the afternoon the general was there you should have seen him run for the chafing dish joe just as if there wasn t a servant in the house i know clementina isn t in good health she is so nervous in serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot of it boiling hot over my hand and wrist it hurt awfully joe and the dear girl was so sorry but gen pinkney joe that old man nearly went distracted he rushed downstairs and sent somebody they said the furnace man or somebody in the basement out to a drug store for some oil and things to bind it up with it doesn t hurt so much now what s this asked joe taking the hand tenderly and pulling at some white strands beneath the bandages it s something soft said delia that had oil on it oh joe did you sell another sketch she had seen the money on the table did i said joe just ask the man from peoria he got his depot to day and he isn t sure but he thinks he wants another parkscape and a view on the hudson what time this afternoon did you burn your hand dele five o clock i think said dele plaintively the iron i mean the rabbit came off the fire about that time you ought to have seen gen pinkney joe when sit down here a moment dele said joe he drew her to the couch sat beside her and put his arm across her shoulders what have you been doing for the last two weeks dele he asked she braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness and murmured a phrase or two vaguely of gen pinkney but at length down went her head and out came the truth and tears i couldn t get any pupils she confessed and i couldn t bear to have you give up your lessons and i got a place ironing shirts in that big twentyfourth street laundry and i think i did very well to make up both general pinkney and clementina don t you joe and when a girl in the laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this afternoon i was all the way home making up that story about the welsh rabbit you re not angry are you joe and if i hadn t got the work you mightn t have sold your sketches to that man from peoria he wasn t from peoria said joe slowly well it doesn t matter where he was from how clever you are joe and kiss me joe and what made you ever suspect that i wasn t giving music lessons to clementina i didn t said joe until to night and i wouldn t have then only i sent up this cotton waste and oil from the engine room this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a smoothing iron i ve been firing the engine in that laundry for the last two weeks and then you didn t my purchaser from peoria said joe and gen pinkney are both creations of the same art but you wouldn t call it either painting or music and then they both laughed and joe began when one loves one s art no service seems but delia stopped him with her hand on his lips no she said just when one loves the coming out of maggie eevery saturday night the clover leaf social club gave a hop in the hall of the give and take athletic association on the east side in order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the give and take or if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing you must work in rhinegold s paper box factory still any clover leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance but mostly each give and take brought the paper box girl that he affected and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops maggie toole on account of her dull eyes broad mouth and left handed style of footwork in the twostep went to the dances with anna mccarty and her fellow anna and maggie worked side by side in the factory and were the greatest chums ever so anna always made jimmy burns take her by maggie s house every saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them the give and take athletic association lived up to its name the hall of the association in orchard street was fitted out with muscle making inventions with the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat between these more serious occupations the saturday night hop with the paper box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen for sometimes the tip went round and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes on saturdays rhinegold s paper box factory closed at p m on one such afternoon anna and maggie walked homeward together at maggie s door anna said as usual be ready at seven sharp mag and jimmy and me ll come by for you but what was this instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non escorted one there was to be perceived a high poised head a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye thanks anna said maggie but you and jimmy needn t bother to night i ve a gentleman friend that s coming round to escort me to the hop the comely anna pounced upon her friend shook her chided and beseeched her maggie toole catch a fellow plain dear loyal unattractive maggie so sweet as a chum so unsought for a two step or a moonlit bench in the little park how was it when did it happen who was it you ll see to night said maggie flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in cupid s vineyard he s swell all right he s two inches taller than jimmy and an up to date dresser i ll introduce him anna just as soon as we get to the hall anna and jimmy were among the first clover leafs to arrive that evening anna s eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend s catch at miss toole swept into the hall with her escort quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful jimmy oh gee cried anna mag ain t made a hit oh no swell fellow well i guess style look at um go as far as you like said jimmy with sandpaper in his voice cop him out if you want him these new guys always win out with the push don t mind me he don t squeeze all the limes i guess huh shut up jimmy you know what i mean i m glad for mag first fellow she ever had oh here they come across the floor maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser and truly her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum he stood two inches taller than the average give and take athlete his dark hair curled his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles the young men of the clover leaf club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess its achievements in hand to hand conflicts and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it the member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ beau brummel airs they were not considered honourable methods of warfare the swelling biceps the coat straining at its buttons over the chest the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of cupid these were the approved arms and ammunition of the clover leaf gallants they viewed then genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle a friend of mine mr terry o sullivan was maggie s formula of introduction she led him around the room presenting him to each new arriving clover leaf almost was she pretty now with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse maggie toole s got a fellow at last was the word that went round among the paper box girls pipe mag s floor walker thus the give and takes expressed their indifferent contempt usually at the weekly hops maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back she felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished she had even grown used to noticing anna joggle the reluctant jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two step but to night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six terry o sullivan was a victorious prince charming and maggie toole winged her first butterfly flight and though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose crowned melody of maggie s one perfect night the girls besieged her for introductions to her fellow the clover leaf young men after two years of blindness suddenly perceived charms in miss toole they flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance thus she scored but to terry o sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast he shook his curls he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day he danced like a faun he introduced manner and style and atmosphere his words came trippingly upon his tongue and he waltzed twice in succession with the paper box girl that dempsey donovan brought dempsey was the leader of the association he wore a dress suit and could chin the bar twice with one hand he was one of big mike o sullivan s lieutenants and was never troubled by trouble no cop dared to arrest him whenever be broke a pushcart man s head or shot a member of the heinrick b sweeney outing and literary association in the kneecap an officer would drop around and say the cap n d like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time dempsey me boy but there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars and somebody would tell a funny story and then dempsey would go back and work half an hour with the sixpound dumbbells so doing a tight rope act on a wire stretched across niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with dempsey donovan s paper box girl at o clock the jolly round face of big mike o sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene he always looked in for five minutes smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys dempsey donovan was at his elbow instantly talking rapidly big mike looked carefully at the dancers smiled shook his head and departed the music stopped the dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls terry o sullivan with his entrancing bow relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find maggie dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor some fine instinct that rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena two or three give and takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer one moment mr o sullivan said dempsey i hope you re enjoying yourself where did you say you live the two gladiators were well matched dempsey had perhaps ten pounds of weight to give away the o sullivan had breadth with quickness dempsey had a glacial eye a dominating slit of a mouth an indestructible jaw a complexion like a belle s and the coolness of a champion the visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer they were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten they were each too splendid too mighty too incomparable to divide pre eminence one only must survive i live on grand said o sullivan insolently and no trouble to find me at home where do you live dempsey ignored the question you say your name s o sullivan he went on well big mike says he never saw you before lots of things he never saw said the favourite of the hop as a rule went on dempsey huskily sweet o sullivans in this district know one another you escorted one of our lady members here and we want chance to make good if you ve got a family tree let s see a few historical o sullivan buds come out on it or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots suppose you mind your own business suggested o sullivan blandly dempsey s eye brightened he held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him i ve got it now he said cordially it was just a little mistake you ain t no o sullivan you are a ring tailed monkey excuse us for not recognising you at first o sullivan s eye flashed he made a quick movement but andy geoghan was ready and caught his arm dempsey nodded at andy and william mcmahan the secretary of the club and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall two other members of the give and take association swiftly joined the little group terry o sullivan was now in the hands of the board of rules and social referees they spoke to him briefly and softly and conducted him out through the same door at the rear this movement on the part of the clover leaf members requires a word of elucidation back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club in this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled man to man with the weapons of nature under the supervision of the board no lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a clover leaf hop in several years its gentlemen members guaranteed that so easily and smoothly had dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating o sullivan s social triumph among these was maggie she looked about for her escort smoke up said rose cassidy wasn t you on demps donovan picked a scrap with your lizzie boy and they ve waltzed out to the slaughter room with him how s my hair look done up this way mag maggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist gone to fight with dempsey she said breathlessly they ve got to be stopped dempsey donovan can t fight him why he ll he ll kill him ah what do you care said rosa don t some of em fight every hop but maggie was off darting her zig zag way through the maze of dancers she burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat it gave way and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene the board standing about with open watches dempsey donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing light footed with the wary grace of the modern pugilist within easy reach of his adversary terry o sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes and without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of o sullivan that was suddenly uplifted and to whisk from it the long bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom the knife fell and rang upon the floor cold steel drawn in the rooms of the give and take association such a thing had never happened before every one stood motionless for a minute andy geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning and then o sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth dempsey and the board exchanged looks and then dempsey looked at o sullivan without anger as one looks at a stray dog and nodded his head in the direction of the door the back stairs giuseppi he said briefly somebody pitch your hat down after you maggie walked up to dempsey donovan there was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks down which slow tears were running but she looked him bravely in the eye i knew it dempsey she said as her eyes grew dull even in their tears i knew he was a guinea his name s tony spinelli i hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin them guineas always carries knives but you don t understand dempsey i never had a fellow in my life i got tired of comin with anna and jimmy every night so i fixed it with him to call himself o sullivan and brought him along i knew there d be nothin doin for him if he came as a dago i guess i ll resign from the club now dempsey turned to andy geoghan chuck that cheese slicer out of the window he said and tell em inside that mr o sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to tammany hall and then he turned back to maggie say mag he said i ll see you home and how about next saturday night will you come to the hop with me if i call around for you it was remarkable how quickly maggie s eyes could change from dull to a shining brown with you dempsey she stammered say will a duck swim man about town there were two or three things that i wanted to know i do not care about a mystery so i began to inquire it took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases and then i began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces this serious query was at first received with suspicion because it sounded like a conundrum i was at last assured that its double form of construction was designed to make lighter the burden of woman who makes up beds i was so foolish as to persist begging to know why then they were not made in two equal pieces whereupon i was shunned the third draught that i craved from the fount of knowledge was enlightenment concerning the character known as a man about town he was more vague in my mind than a type should be we must have a concrete idea of anything even if it be an imaginary idea before we can comprehend it now i have a mental picture of john doe that is as clear as a steel engraving his eyes are weak blue he wears a brown vest and a shiny black serge coat he stands always in the sunshine chewing something and he keeps half shutting his pocket knife and opening it again with his thumb and if the man higher up is ever found take my assurance for it he will be a large pale man with blue wristlets showing under his cuffs and he will be sitting to have his shoes polisbed within sound of a bowling alley and there will be somewhere about him turquoises but the canvas of my imagination when it came to limning the man about town was blank i fancied that he bad a detachable sneer like the smile of the cheshire cat and attached cuffs and that was all whereupon i asked a newspaper reporter about him why said he a man about town something between a rounder and a clubman he isn t exactly well he fits in between mrs fish s receptions and private boxing bouts he doesn t well he doesn t belong either to the lotos club or to the jerry mcgeogheghan galvanised iron workers apprentices left hook chowder association i don t exactly know how to describe him to you you ll see him everywhere there s anything doing yes i suppose he s a type dress clothes every evening knows the ropes calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first names no he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives you generally see him alone or with another man my friend the reporter left me and i wandered further afield by this time the electric lights on the rialto were alight people passed but they held me not paphian eyes rayed upon me and left me unscathed diners heimgangers shop girls confidence men panhandlers actors highwaymen millionaires and outlanders hurried skipped strolled sneaked swaggered and scurried by me but i took no note of them i knew them all i had read their hearts they had served i wanted my man about town he was a type and to drop him would be an error a typograph but no let us continue let us continue with a moral digression to see a family reading the sunday paper gratifies the sections have been separated papa is earnestly scanning the page that pictures the young lady exercising before an open window and bending but there there mamma is interested in trying to guess the missing letters in the word nw yok the oldest girls are eagerly perusing the financial reports for a certain young man remarked last sunday night that he had taken a flyer in q x z willie the eighteen year old son who attends the new york public school is absorbed in the weekly article describing how to make over an old skirt for he hopes to take a prize in sewing on graduation day grandma is holding to the comic supplement with a two hours grip and little tottie the baby is rocking along the best she can with the real estatc transfers this view is intended to be reassuring for it is desirable that a few lines of this story be skipped for it introduces strong drink i went into a cafe to and while it was being mixed i asked the man who grabs up your hot scotch spoon as soon as you lay it down what he undcrstood by the term epithet description designation characterisation or appellation viz a man about town why said he carefully it means a fly guy that s wise to the all night push see it s a hot sport that you can t bump to the rail anywhere between the flatirons see i guess that s about what it means i thanked him and departed on the sidewalk a salvation lassie shook her contribution receptacle gently against my waistcoat pocket would you mind telling me i asked her if you ever meet with the character commonly denominated as a man about town during your daily wanderings i think i know whom you mean she answered with a gentle smile we see them in the same places night after night they are the devil s body guard and if the soldiers of any army are as faithful as they are their commanders are well served we go among them diverting a few pennies from their wickedness to the lord s service she shook the box again and i dropped a dime into it in front of a glittering hotel a friend of mine a critic was climbing from a cab he seemed at leisure and i put my question to him he answered me conscientiously as i was sure he would there is a type of man about town in new york he answered the term is quite familiar to me but i don t think i was ever called upon to define the character before it would be difficult to point you out an exact specimen i would say offhand that it is a man who had a hopeless case of the peculiar new york disease of wanting to see and know at o clock each day life begins with him he follows rigidly the conventions of dress and manners but in the business of poking his nose into places where he does not belong he could give pointers to a civet cat or a jackdaw he is the man who has chased bohemia about the town from rathskeller to roof garden and from hester street to harlem until you can t find a place in the city where they don t cut their spaghetti with a knife your man about town has done that he is always on the scent of something new he is curiosity impudence and omnipresence hansoms were made for him and gold banded cigars and the curse of music at dinner there are not so many of him but his minority report is adopted everywhere i m glad you brought up the subject i ve felt the influence of this nocturnal blight upon our city but i never thought to analyse it before i can see now that your man about town should havc been classified long ago in his wake spring up wine agents and cloak models and the orchestra p ays let s all go up to maud s for him by request instead of handel he makes his rounds every evening while you and i see the elephant once a week when the cigar store is raided he winks at the officer familiar with his ground and walks away immune while you and i search among the presidents for names and among the stars for addresses to give the desk sergeant my friend the critic paused to acquire breath for fresh eloquence i seized my advantage you have classified him i cried with joy you have painted his portrait in the gallery of city types but i must meet one face to face i must study the man about town at first hand where shall i find him how shall i know him without seeming to hear me the critic went on and his cab driver was waiting for his fare too he is the sublimated essence of butt in the refined intrinsic extract of rubber the concentrated purified irrefutable unavoidable spirit of curiosity and inquisitiveness a new sensation is the breath in his nostrils when his experience is exhausted he explores new fields with the indefatigability of a excuse me i interrupted but can you produce one of this type it is a new thing to me i must study it i will search the town over until i find one its habitat must be here on broadway i am about to dine here said my friend come inside and if there is a man about town present i will point him out to you i know most of the regular patrons here i am not dining yet i said to him you will excuse me i am going to find my man about town this night if i have to rake new york from the battery to little coney island i left the hotel and walked down broadway the pursuit of my type gave a pleasant savour of life and interest to the air i breathed i was glad to be in a city so great so complex and diversified leisurely and with something of an air i strolled along with my heart expanding at the thought that i was a citizen of great gotham a sharer in its magnificence and pleasures a partaker in its glory and prestige i turned to cross the street i heard something buzz like a bee and then i took a long pleasant ride with santos dumont when i opened my eyes i remembered a smell of gasoline and i said aloud hasn t it passed yet a hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow that was not at all fevered a young doctor came along grinned and handed me a morning newspaper want to see how it happened he asked cheerily i read the article its headlines began where i heard the buzzing leave off the night before it closed with these lines bellevue hospital where it was said that his injuries were not serious he appeared to be a typica man about town the cop and the anthem on his bench in madison square soapy moved uneasily when wild geese honk high of nights and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands and when soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park you may know that winter is near at hand a dead leaf fell in soapy s lap that was jack frost s card jack is kind to the regular denizens of madison square and gives fair warning of his annual call at the corners of four streets he hands his pasteboard to the north wind footman of the mansion of all outdoors so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready soapy s mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him to resolve himself into a singular committee of ways and means to provide against the coming rigour and therefore he moved uneasily on his bench the hibernatorial ambitions of soapy were not of the highest in them there were no considerations of mediterranean cruises of soporific southern skies drifting in the vesuvian bay three months on the island was what his soul craved three months of assured board and bed and congenial company safe from boreas and bluecoats seemed to soapy the essence of things desirable for years the hospitable blackwell s had been his winter quarters just as his more fortunate fellow new yorkers had bought their tickets to palm beach and the riviera each winter so soapy had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the island and now the time was come on the previous night three sabbath newspapers distributed beneath his coat about his ankles and over his lap had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square so the island loomed big and timely in soapy s mind he scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the city s dependents in soapy s opinion the law was more benign than philanthropy there was an endless round of institutions municipal and eleemosynary on which he might set out and receive lodging and food accordant with the simple life but to one of soapy s proud spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered if not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy as caesar had his brutus every bed of charity must have its toll of a bath every loaf of bread its compensation of a private and personal inquisition wherefore it is better to be a guest of the law which though conducted by rules does not meddle unduly with a gentleman s private affairs soapy having decided to go to the island at once set about accomplishing his desire there were many easy ways of doing this the pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive restaurant and then after declaring insolvency be handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman an accommodating magistrate would do the rest soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of asphalt where broadway and fifth avenue flow together up broadway he turned and halted at a glittering cafe where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the grape the silkworm and the protoplasm soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest upward he was shaven and his coat was decent and his neat black ready tied four in hand had been presented to him by a lady missionary on thanksgiving day if he could reach a table in the restaurant unsuspected success would be his the portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter s mind a roasted mallard duck thought soapy would be about the thing with a bottle of chablis and then camembert a demi tasse and a cigar one dollar for the cigar would be enough the total would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the cafe management and yet the meat would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge but as soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter s eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of the menaced mallard soapy turned off broadway it seemed that his route to the coveted island was not to be an epicurean one some other way of entering limbo must be thought of at a corner of sixth avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed wares behind plate glass made a shop window conspicuous soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass people came running around the corner a policeman in the lead soapy stood still with his hands in his pockets and smiled at the sight of brass buttons where s the man that done that inquired the officer excitedly don t you figure out that i might have had something to do with it said soapy not without sarcasm but friendly as one greets good fortune the policeman s mind refused to accept soapy even as a clue men who smash windows do not remain to parley with the law s minions they take to their heels the policeman saw a man half way down the block running to catch a car with drawn club he joined in the pursuit soapy with disgust in his heart loafed along twice unsuccessful on the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great pretensions it catered to large appetites and modest purses its crockery and atmosphere were thick its soup and napery thin into this place soapy took his accusive shoes and telltale trousers without challenge at a table he sat and consumed beefsteak flapjacks doughnuts and pie and then to the waiter be betrayed the fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers now get busy and call a cop said soapy and don t keep a gentleman waiting no cop for youse said the waiter with a voice like butter cakes and an eye like the cherry in a manhattan cocktail hey con neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched soapy he arose joint by joint as a carpenter s rule opens and beat the dust from his clothes arrest seemed but a rosy dream the island seemed very far away a policeman who stood before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the street five blocks soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo capture again this time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself a cinch a young woman of a modest and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands and two yards from the window a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water plug it was soapy s design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated masher the refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm that would insure his winter quarters on the right little tight little isle soapy straightened the lady missionary s readymade tie dragged his shrinking cuffs into the open set his hat at a killing cant and sidled toward the young woman he made eyes at her was taken with sudden coughs and hems smiled smirked and went brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of the masher with half an eye soapy saw that the policeman was watching him fixedly the young woman moved away a few steps and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving mugs soapy followed boldly stepping to her side raised his hat and said ah there bedelia don t you want to come and play in my yard the policeman was still looking the persecuted young woman had but to beckon a finger and soapy would be practically en route for his insular haven already he imagined he could feel the cozy warmth of the station house the young woman faced him and stretching out a hand caught soapy s coat sleeve sure mike she said joyfully if you ll blow me to a pail of suds i d have spoke to you sooner but the cop was watching with the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak soapy walked past the policeman overcome with gloom he seemed doomed to liberty at the next corner he shook off his companion and ran he halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets hearts vows and librettos women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air a sudden fear seized soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest the thought brought a little of panic upon it and when he came upon another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of disorderly conduct on the sidewalk soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice he danced howled raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin the policeman twirled his club turned his back to soapy and remarked to a citizen tis one of them yale lads celebratin the goose egg they give to the hartford college noisy but no harm we ve instructions to lave them be disconsolate soapy ceased his unavailing racket would never a policeman lay hands on him in his fancy the island seemed an unattainable arcadia he buttoned his thin coat against the chilling wind in a cigar store he saw a well dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light his silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering soapy stepped inside secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it slowly the man at the cigar light followed hastily my umbrella he said sternly oh is it sneered soapy adding insult to petit larceny well why don t you call a policeman i took it your umbrella why don t you call a cop there stands one on the corner the umbrella owner slowed his steps soapy did likewise with a presentiment that luck would again run against him the policeman looked at the two curiously of course said the umbrella man that is well you know how these mistakes occur i if it s your umbrella i hope you ll excuse me i picked it up this morning in a restaurant if you recognise it as yours why i hope you ll of course it s mine said soapy viciously the ex umbrella man retreated the policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements he hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation he muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs because he wanted to fall into their clutches they seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong at length soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil was but faint he set his face down this toward madison square for the homing instinct survives even when the home is a park bench but on an unusually quiet corner soapy came to a standstill here was an old church quaint and rambling and gabled through one violet stained window a soft light glowed where no doubt the organist loitered over the keys making sure of his mastery of the coming sabbath anthem for there drifted out to soapy s ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence the moon was above lustrous and serene vehicles and pedestrians were few sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves for a little while the scene might have been a country churchyard and the anthem that the organist played cemented soapy to the iron fence for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars the conjunction of soapy s receptive state of mind and the influences about the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul he viewed with swift horror the pit into which he had tumbled the degraded days unworthy desires dead hopes wrecked faculties and base motives that made up his existence and also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood an instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate he would pull himself out of the mire he would make a man of himself again he would conquer the evil that had taken possession of him there was time he was comparatively young yet he would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him to morrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and find work a fur importer had once offered him a place as driver he would find him to morrow and ask for the position he would be somebody in the world he would soapy felt a hand laid on his arm he looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman what are you doin here asked the officer nothin said soapy then come along said the policeman three months on the island said the magistrate in the police court the next morning an adjustment of nature in an art exhibition the other day i saw a painting that had been sold for the painter was a young scrub out of the west named kraft who had a favourite food and a pet theory his pabulum was an unquenchable belief in the unerring artistic adjustment of nature his theory was fixed around corned beef hash with poached egg there was a story behind the picture so i went home and let it drip out of a fountain pen the idea of kraft but that is not the beginning of the story three years ago kraft bill judkins a poet and i took our meals at cypher s on eighth avenue i say took when we had money cypher got it off of us as he expressed it we had no credit we went in called for food and ate it we paid or we did not pay we had confidence in cypher s sullenness end smouldering ferocity deep down in his sunless soul he was either a prince a fool or an artist he sat at a worm eaten desk covered with files of waiters checks so old that i was sure the bottomest one was for clams that hendrik hudson had eaten and paid for cypher had the power in common with napoleon iii and the goggle eyed perch of throwing a film over his eyes rendering opaque the windows of his soul once when we left him unpaid with egregious excuses i looked back and saw him shaking with inaudible laughter behind his film now and then we paid up back scores but the chief thing at cypher s was milly milly was a waitress she was a grand example of kraft s theory of the artistic adjustment of nature she belonged largely to waiting as minerva did to the art of scrapping or venus to the science of serious flirtation pedestalled and in bronze she might have stood with the noblest of her heroic sisters as liver and bacon enlivening the world she belonged to cypher s you expected to see her colossal figure loom through that reeking blue cloud of smoke from frying fat just as you expect the palisades to appear through a drifting hudson river fog there amid the steam of vegetables and the vapours of acres of ham and the crash of crockery the clatter of steel the screaming of short orders the cries of the hungering and all the horrid tumult of feeding man surrounded by swarms of the buzzing winged beasts bequeathed us by pharaoh milly steered her magnificent way like some great liner cleaving among the canoes of howling savages our goddess of grub was built on lines so majestic that they could be followed only with awe her sleeves were always rolled above her elbows she could have taken us three musketeers in her two hands and dropped us out of the window she had seen fewer years than any of us but she was of such superb evehood and simplicity that she mothered us from the beginning cypher s store of eatables she poured out upon us with royal indifference to price and quantity as from a cornucopia that knew no exhaustion her voice rang like a great silver bell her smile was many toothed and frequent she seemed like a yellow sunrise on mountain tops i never saw her but i thought of the yosemite and yet somehow i could never think of her as existing outside of cypher s there nature had placed her and she had taken root and grown mightily she seemed happy and took her few poor dollars on saturday nights with the flushed pleasure of a child that receives an unexpected donation it was kraft who first voiced the fear that each of us must have held latently it came up apropos of course of certain questions of art at which we were hammering one of us compared the harmony existing between a haydn symphony and pistache ice cream to the exquisite congruity between milly and cypher s there is a certain fate hanging over milly said kraft and if it overtakes her she is lost to cypher s and to us she will grow fat asked judkins fearsomely she will go to night school and become refined i ventured anxiously it is this said kraft punctuating in a puddle of spilled coffee with a stiff forefinger caesar had his brutus the cotton has its boliworm the chorus girl has her pittsburger the summer boarder has his poison ivy the hero has his carnegie medal art has its morgan the rose has its speak i interrupted much perturbed you do not think that milly will begin to lace one day concluded kraft solemnly there will come to cypher s for a plate of beans a millionaire lumberman from wisconsin and he will marry milly never exclaimed judkins and t in horror a lumberman repeated kraft hoarsely and a millionaire lumberman i sighed despairingly from wisconsin groaned judkins we agreed that the awful fate seemed to menace her few things were less improbable milly like some vast virgin stretch of pine woods was made to catch the lumberman s eye and well we knew the habits of the badgers once fortune smiled upon them straight to new york they hie and lay their goods at the feet of the girl who serves them beans in a beanery why the alphabet itself connives the sunday newspaper s headliner s work is cut for him winsome waitress wins wealthy wisconsin woodsman for a while we felt that milly was on the verge of being lost to us it was our love of the unerring artistic adjustment of nature that inspired us we could not give her over to a lumberman doubly accursed by wealth and provincialism we shuddered to think of milly with her voice modulated and her elbows covered pouring tea in the marble teepee of a tree murderer no in cypher s she belonged in the bacon smoke the cabbage perfume the grand wagnerian chorus of hurled ironstone china and rattling casters our fears must have been prophetic for on that same evening the wildwood discharged upon us milly s preordained confiscator our fee to adjustment and order but alaska and not wisconsin bore the burden of the visitation we were at our supper of beef stew and dried apples when he trotted in as if on the heels of a dog team and made one of the mess at our table with the freedom of the camps he assaulted our ears and claimed the fellowship of men lost in the wilds of a hash house we embraced him as a specimen and in three minutes we had all but died for one another as friends he was rugged and bearded and wind dried he had just come off the trail he said at one of the north river ferries i fancied i could see the snow dust of chilcoot yet powdering his shoulders and then he strewed the table with the nuggets stuffed ptarmigans bead work and seal pelts of the returned kiondiker and began to prate to us of his millions bank drafts for two millions was his summing up and a thousand a day piling up from my claims and now i want some beef stew and canned peaches i never got off the train since i mushed out of seattle and i m hungry the stuff the niggers feed you on pullmans don t count you gentlemen order what you want and then milly loomed up with a thousand dishes on her bare arm loomed up big and white and pink and awful as mount saint elias with a smile like day breaking in a gulch and the kiondiker threw down his pelts and nuggets as dross and let his jaw fall half way and stared at her you could almost see the diamond tiaras on milly s brow and the hand embroidered silk paris gowns that he meant to buy for her at last the bollworm had attacked the cotton the poison ivy was reaching out its tendrils to entwine the summer boarder the millionaire lumberman thinly disguised as the alaskan miner was about to engulf our milly and upset nature s adjustment kraft was the first to act he leaped up and pounded the klondiker s back come out and drink he shouted drink first and eat afterward judkins seized one arm and i the other gaily roaringly irresistibly in jolly good fellow style we dragged him from the restaurant to a cafe stuffing his pockets with his embalmed birds and indigestible nuggets there he rumbled a roughly good humoured protest that s the girl for my money he declared she can eat out of my skillet the rest of her life why i never see such a fine girl i m going back there and ask her to marry me i guess she won t want to sling hash any more when she sees the pile of dust i ve got you ll take another whiskey and milk now kraft persuaded with satan s smile i thought you up country fellows were better sports kraft spent his puny store of coin at the bar and then gave judkins and me such an appealing look that we went down to the last dime we had in toasting our guest then when our ammunition was gone and the klondiker still somewhat sober began to babble again of milly kraft whispered into his ear such a polite barbed insult relating to people who were miserly with their funds that the miner crashed down handful after handful of silver and notes calling for all the fluids in the world to drown the imputation thus the work was accomplished with his own guns we drove him from the field and then we had him carted to a distant small hotel and put to bed with his nuggets and baby seal skins stuffed around him he will never find cypher s again said kraft he will propose to the first white apron he sees in a dairy restaurant to morrow and milly i mean the natural adjustment is saved and back to cypher s went we three and finding customers scarce we joined hands and did an indian dance with milly in the centre this i say happened three years ago and about that time a little luck descended upon us three and we were enabled to buy costlier and less wholesome food than cypher s our paths separated and i saw kraft no more and judkins

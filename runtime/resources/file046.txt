first class up where they belong wouldn t you shake these by products of the animal kingdom long enough to take a walk with a common human who never was on a programme in his life mame gave a sort of sly glance around and i knew what that meant oh says i i hate to tell you but the curiosity that lives on wind has flew the coop he just crawled out under the tent by this time he has amalgamated himself with half the delicatessen truck in town you mean ed collier says mame i do i answers and a pity it is that he has gone back to crime again i met him outside the tent and he exposed his intentions of devastating the food crop of the world tis enormously sad when one s ideal descends from his pedestal to make a seventeen year locust of himself mame looked me straight in the eye until she had corkscrewed my reflections jeff says she it isn t quite like you to talk that way i don t care to hear ed collier ridiculed a man may do ridiculous things but they don t look ridiculous to the girl he does em for that was one man in a hundred he stopped eating just to please me i d be hard hearted and ungrateful if i didn t feel kindly toward him could you do what he did i know says i seeing the point i m condemned i can t help it the brand of the consumer is upon my brow mrs eve settled that business for me when she made the dicker with the snake i fell from the fire into the frying pan i guess i m the champion feaster of the universe i spoke humble and mame mollified herself a little ed collier and i are good friends she said the same as me and you i gave him the same answer i did you no marrying for me i liked to be with ed and talk with him there was something mighty pleasant to me in the thought that here was a man who never used a knife and fork and all for my sake wasn t you in love with him i asks all injudicious wasn t there a deal on for you to become mrs curiosity all of us do it sometimes all of us get jostled out of the line of profitable talk now and then mame put on that little lemon glace smile that runs between ice and sugar and says much too pleasant you re short on credentials for asking that question mr peters suppose you do a forty nine day fast just to give you ground to stand on and then maybe i ll answer it so even after collier was kidnapped out of the way by the revolt of his appetite my own prospects with mame didn t seem to be improved and then business played out in guthrie i had stayed too long there the brazilians i had sold commenced to show signs of wear and the kindler refused to light up right frequent on wet mornings there is always a time in my business when the star of success says move on to the next town i was travelling by wagon at that time so as not to miss any of the small towns so i hitched up a few days later and went down to tell mame good bye i wasn t abandoning the game i intended running over to oklahoma city and work it for a week or two then i was coming back to institute fresh proceedings against mame what do i find at the dugans but mame all conspicuous in a blue travelling dress with her little trunk at the door it seems that sister lottie bell who is a typewriter in terre haute is going to be married next thursday and mame is off for a week s visit to be an accomplice at the ceremony mame is waiting for a freight wagon that is going to take her to oklahoma but i condemns the freight wagon with promptness and scorn and offers to deliver the goods myself ma dugan sees no reason why not as mr freighter wants pay for the job so thirty minutes later mame and i pull out in my light spring wagon with white canvas cover and head due south that morning was of a praiseworthy sort the breeze was lively and smelled excellent of flowers and grass and the little cottontail rabbits entertained themselves with skylarking across the road my two kentucky bays went for the horizon until it come sailing in so fast you wanted to dodge it like a clothesline mame was full of talk and rattled on like a kid about her old home and her school pranks and the things she liked and the hateful ways of those johnson girls just across the street way up in indiana not a word was said about ed collier or victuals or such solemn subjects about noon mame looks and finds that the lunch she had put up in a basket had been left behind i could have managed quite a collation but mame didn t seem to be grieving over nothing to eat so i made no lamentations it was a sore subject with me and i ruled provender in all its branches out of my conversation i am minded to touch light on explanations how i came to lose the way the road was dim and well grown with grass and there was mame by my side confiscating my intellects and attention the excuses are good or they are not as they may appear to you but i lost it and at dusk that afternoon when we should have been in oklahoma city we were seesawing along the edge of nowhere in some undiscovered river bottom and the rain was

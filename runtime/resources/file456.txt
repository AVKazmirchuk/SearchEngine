i met you turn to the left as you enter the hall and keep straight on out i made a low bow to signify that the interview was at an end and withdrew immiediately i had no difficulty in leaving the building as soon as i was outside i hurried downtown in order to obtain refreshments at some place where viands had been placed upon the free list i shall not describe my journey back to austin i lost my return ticket somewhere in the white house and was forced to return home in a manner not especially beneficial to my shoes everybody was well in washington when i left and all send their love an unfinished christmas story probably begun several years before his death published as it here appears in short stories january now a christmas story should be one for a good many years the ingenious writers have been putting forth tales for the holiday numbers that employed every subtle evasive indirect and strategic scheme they could invent to disguise the christmas flavor so far has this new practice been carried that nowadays when you read a story in a holiday magazine the only way you can tell it is a christmas story is to look at the footnote which reads the incidents in the above story happened on december th ed there is progress in this but it is all very sad there are just as many real christmas stories as ever if we would only dig em up me i am for the scrooge and marley christmas story and the annie and willie s prayer poem and the long lost son coming home on the stroke of twelve to the poorly thatched cottage with his arms full of talking dolls and popcorn balls and zip you hear the second mortgage on the cottage go flying off it into the deep snow so this is to warn you that there is no subterfuge about this story and you might come upon stockings hung to the mantel and plum puddings and hark the chimes and wealthy misers loosening up and handing over penny whistles to lame newsboys if you read further once i knocked at a door i have so many things to tell you i keep on losing sight of the story it was the front door of a furnished room house in west teenth street i was looking for a young illustrator named paley originally and irrevocably from terre haute paley doesn t enter even into the first serial rights of this christmas story i mention him simply in explaining why i came to knock at the door some people have so much curiosity the door was opened by the landlady i had seen hundreds like her and i had smelled before that cold dank furnished draught of air that hurried by her to escape immurement in the furnished house she was stout and her face and lands were as white as though she had been drowned in a barrel of vinegar one hand held together at her throat a buttonless flannel dressing sacque whose lines had been cut by no tape or butterick known to mortal woman beneath this a too long flowered black sateen skirt was draped about her reaching the floor in stiff wrinkles and folds the rest of her was yellow her hair in some bygone age had been dipped in the fountain of folly presided over by the merry nymph hydrogen but now except at the roots it had returned to its natural grim and grizzled white her eyes and teeth and finger nails were yellow her chops hung low and shook when she moved the look on her face was exactly that smileless look of fatal melancholy that you may have seen on the countenance of a hound left sitting on the doorstep of a deserted cabin i inquired for paley after a long look of cold suspicion the landlady spoke and her voice matched the dingy roughness of her flannel sacque paley was i sure that was the name and wasn t it likely mr sanderson i meant in the third floor rear no it was paley i wanted again that frozen shrewd steady study of my soul from her pale yellow unwinking eyes trying to penetrate my mask of deception and rout out my true motives from my lying lips there was a mr tompkins in the front hall bedroom two flights up perhaps it was he i was seeking he worked of nights he never came in till seven in the morning or if it was really mr tucker thinly disguised as paley that i was hunting i would have to call between five and but no i held firmly to paley there was no such name among her lodgers click the door closed swiftly in my face and i heard through the panels the clanking of chains and bolts i went down the steps and stopped to consider the number of this house was i was sure paley had said or perhaps it was or i decided to try the second house farther along i rang the bell the door opened and there stood the same woman i wasn t confronted by just a resemblance it was the same woman holding together the same old sacque at her throat and looking at me with the same yellow eyes as if she had never seen me before on earth i saw on the knuckle of her second finger the same red and black spot made probably by a recent burn against a hot stove i stood speechless and gaping while one with moderate haste might have told fifty i couldn t have spoken paley s name even if i had remembered it i did the only thing that a brave man who believes there are mysterious forces in nature that we do not yet fully comprehend could have done in the circumstances i backed down the

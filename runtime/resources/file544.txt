cleary drifted casually to the trysting place ten minutes later he ll maybe not croak said brick and he won t tell of course but dutch mike did he told the police he was tired of having his place shot up it s unhandy just now because tim corrigan s in europe for a week s end with kings he ll be back on the kaiser williams next friday you ll have to duck out of sight till then tim ll fix it up all right for us when he comes back this goes to explain why cork mcmanus went into rooney s one night and there looked upon the bright stranger face of romance for the first time in his precarious career until tim corrigan should return from his jaunt among kings and princes and hold up his big white finger in private offices it was unsafe for cork in any of the old haunts of his gang so he lay perdu in the high rear room of a capulet reading pink sporting sheets and cursing the slow paddle wheels of the kaiser wilhelm it was on thursday evening that cork s seclusion became intolerable to him never a hart panted for water fountain as he did for the cool touch of a drifting stein for the firm security of a foot rail in the hollow of his shoe and the quiet hearty challenges of friendship and repartee along and across the shining bars but he must avoid the district where he was known the cops were looking for him everywhere for news was scarce and the newspapers were harping again on the failure of the police to suppress the gangs if they got him before corrigan came back the big white finger could not be uplifted it would be too late then but corrigan would be home the next day so he felt sure there would be small danger in a little excursion that night among the crass pleasures that represented life to him at half past twelve mcmanus stood in a darkish cross town street looking up at the name rooney s picked out by incandescent lights against a signboard over a second story window he had heard of the place as a tough hang out with its frequenters and its locality he was unfamiliar guided by certain unerring indications common to all such resorts he ascended the stairs and entered the large room over the caf e here were some twenty or thirty tables at this time about half filled with rooney s guests waiters served drinks at one end a human pianola with drugged eyes hammered the keys with automatic and furious unprecision at merciful intervals a waiter would roar or squeak a song songs full of mr jonsons and babes and coons historical word guaranties of the genuineness of african melodies composed by red waistcoated young gentlemen natives of the cotton fields and rice swamps of west twenty eighth street for one brief moment you must admire rooney with me as he receives seats manipulates and chaffs his guests he is twenty nine he has wellington s nose dante s chin the cheek bones of an iroquois the smile of talleyrand corbett s foot work and the pose of an eleven year old east side central park queen of the may he is assisted by a lieutenant known as frank a pudgy easy chap swell dressed who goes among the tables seeing that dull care does not intrude now what is there about rooney s to inspire all this pother it is more respectable by daylight stout ladies with children and mittens and bundles and unpedigreed dogs drop up of afternoons for a stein and a chat even by gaslight the diversions are melancholy i the mouth drink and rag time and an occasional surprise when the waiter swabs the suds from under your sticky glass there is an answer transmigration the soul of sir walter raleigh has traveled from beneath his slashed doublet to a kindred home under rooney s visible plaid waistcoat rooney s is twenty years ahead of the times rooney has removed the embargo rooney has spread his cloak upon the soggy crossing of public opinion and any elizabeth who treads upon it is as much a queen as another attend to the revelation of the secret in rooney s ladies may smoke mcmanus sat down at a vacant table he paid for the glass of beer that he ordered tilted his narrow brimmed derby to the back of his brick dust head twined his feet among the rungs of his chair and heaved a sigh of contentment from the breathing spaces of his innermost soul for this mud honey was clarified sweetness to his taste the sham gaiety the hectic glow of counterfeit hospitality the self conscious joyless laughter the wine born warmth the loud music retrieving the hour from frequent whiles of awful and corroding silence the presence of well clothed and frank eyed beneficiaries of rooney s removal of the restrictions laid upon the weed the familiar blended odors of soaked lemon peel flat beer and peau d espagne all these were manna to cork mcmanus hungry for his week in the desert of the capulet s high rear room a girl alone entered rooney s glanced around with leisurely swiftness and sat opposite mcmanus at his table her eyes rested upon him for two seconds in the look with which woman reconnoitres all men whom she for the first time confronts in that space of time she will decide upon one of two things either to scream for the police or that she may marry him later on her brief inspection concluded the girl laid on the table a worn red morocco shopping bag with the inevitable top gallant sail of frayed lace handkerchief flying from a corner of it after she had ordered a small beer from the immediate waiter she took from her bag

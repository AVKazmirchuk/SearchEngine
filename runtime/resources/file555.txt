sailor fitbad the tailor the beautiful persian the one eyed calenders ali baba and forty robbers on every block and the barber and his six brothers and all the old arabian gang easily but let us revenue to our lamb chops old tom crowley was a caliph he had in preferred stocks and bonds with solid gold edges in these times to be called a caliph you must have money the old style caliph business as conducted by mr rashid is not safe if you hold up a person nowadays in a bazaar or a turkish bath or a side street and inquire into his private and personal affairs the police court ll get you old tom was tired of clubs theatres dinners friends music money and everything that s what makes a caliph you must get to despise everything that money can buy and then go out and try to want something that you can t pay for i ll take a little trot around town all by myself thought old tom and try if i can stir up anything new let s see it seems i ve read about a king or a cardiff giant or something in old times who used to go about with false whiskers on making persian dates with folks he hadn t been introduced to that don t listen like a bad idea i certainly have got a case of humdrumness and fatigue on for the ones i do know that old cardiff used to pick up cases of trouble as he ran upon em and give em gold sequins i think it was and make em marry or got em good government jobs now i d like something of that sort my money is as good as his was even if the magazines do ask me every month where i got it yes i guess i ll do a little cardiff business to night and see how it goes plainly dressed old tom crowley left his madison avenue palace and walked westward and then south as he stepped to the sidewalk fate who holds the ends of the strings in the central offices of all the enchanted cities pulled a thread and a young man twenty blocks away looked at a wall clock and then put on his coat james turner worked in one of those little hat cleaning establishments on sixth avenue in which a fire alarms rings when you push the door open and where they clean your hat while you wait two days james stood all day at an electric machine that turned hats around faster than the best brands of champagne ever could have done overlooking your mild impertinence in feeling a curiosity about the personal appearance of a stranger i will give you a modified description of him weight complexion hair and brain light height five feet six age about twenty three dressed in a suit of greenish blue serge pockets containing two keys and sixty three cents in change but do not misconjecture because this description sounds like a general alarm that james was either lost or a dead one allons james stood all day at his work his feet were tender and extremely susceptible to impositions being put upon or below them all day long they burned and smarted causing him much suffering and inconvenience but he was earning twelve dollars per week which he needed to support his feet whether his feet would support him or not james turner had his own conception of what happiness was just as you and i have ours your delight is to gad about the world in yachts and motor cars and to hurl ducats at wild fowl mine is to smoke a pipe at evenfall and watch a badger a rattlesnake and an owl go into their common prairie home one by one james turner s idea of bliss was different but

old tom the caliph sauntered by his discerning eye made keen by twenty years experience in the manufacture of laundry soap save the wrappers recognized instantly the poor and discerning scholar a worthy object of his caliphanous mood he descended the two shallow stone steps that led from the sidewalk and addressed without hesitation the object of his designed munificence his first words were no worse than salutatory and tentative james turner looked up coldly with sartor resartus in one hand and a mad marriage in the other beat it said he i don t want to buy any coat hangers or town lots in hankipoo new jersey run along now and play with your teddy bear young man said the caliph ignoring the flippancy of the hat cleaner i observe that you are of a studious disposition learning is one

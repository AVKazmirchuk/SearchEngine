and was lulled into blissful peace with the other fortunate mariners in one day he acquired his table and his waiter and the fear lest the panting chasers after repose that kept broadway warm should pounce upon and destroy this contiguous but covert haven after dinner on the next day after the arrival of harold farrington madame beaumont dropped her handkerchief in passing out mr farrington recov ered and returned it without the effusiveness of a seeker after acquaintance perhaps there was a mystic freemasonry between the discriminating guests of the lotus perhaps they were drawn one to another by the fact of their common good fortune in discovering the acme of sum mer resorts in a broadway hotel words delicate in courtesy and tentative in departure from formality passed between the two and as if in the expedient atmosphere of a real summer resort an acquaintance grew flowered and fructified on the spot as does the mystic plant of the conjuror for a few moments they stood on a balcony upon which the corridor ended and tossed the feathery ball of conversation one tires of the old resorts said madame beau mont with a faint but sweet smile what is the use to fly to the mountains or the seashore to escape noise and dust when the very people that make both follow us there even on the ocean remarked farrington sadly the philistines be upon you the most exclusive steamers are getting to be scarcely more than ferry boats heaven help us when the summer resorter dis covers that the lotus is further away from broadway than thousand islands or mackinac i hope our secret will be safe for a week any how said madame with a sigh and a smile i do not know where i would go if they should descend upon the dear lotus i know of but one place so de lightful in summer and that is the castle of count polinski in the ural mountains i hear that baden baden and cannes are almost deserted this season said farrington year by year the old resorts fall in disrepute perhaps many others like ourselves are seeking out the quiet nooks that are overlooked by the majority i promise myself three days more of this delicious rest said madame beaumont on monday the cedric sails harold farrington s eyes proclaimed his regret i too must leave on monday he said but i do not go abroad madame beaumont shrugged one round shoulder in a foreign gesture one cannot bide here forever charming though it may be the chateau has been in preparation for me longer than a month those house parties that one must give what a nuisance but i shall never for get my week in the hotel lotus nor shall i said farrington in a low voice and i shall never forgive the cedric on sunday evening three days afterward the two sat at a little table on the same balcony a discreet waiter brought ices and small glasses of claret cup madame beaumont wore the same beautiful even ing gown that she had worn each day at dinner she seemed thoughtful near her hand on the table lay a small chatelaine purse after she had eaten her ice she opened the purse and took out a one dollar bill mr farrington she said with the smile that had won the hotel lotus i want to tell you some thing i m going to leave before breakfast in the morning because i ve got to go back to my work i m behind the hosiery counter at casey s mammoth store and my vacation s up at eight o clock to morrow that paper dollar is the last cent i ll see till i draw my eight dollars salary next saturday night you re a real gentleman and you ve been good to me and i wanted to tell you before i went i ve been saving up out of my wages for a year just for this vacation i wanted to spend one week like a lady if i never do another one i wanted to get up when i please instead of having to crawl out at seven every morning and i wanted to live on the best and be waited on and ring bells for things just like rich folks do now i ve done it and i ve had the happiest time i ever expect to have in my life i m going back to my work and my little hall bedroom satisfied for another year i wanted to tell you about it mr farrington because i i thought you kind of liked me and i i liked you but oh i couldn t help deceiving you up till now for it was all just like a fairy tale to me so i talked about europe and the things i ve read about in other countries and made you think i was a great lady this dress i ve got on it s the only one i have that s fit to wear i bought from o dowd levin sky on the instalment plan seventy five dollars is the price and it was made to measure i paid down and they re to collect a week till it s paid for that ll be about all i have to say mr farrington except that my name is mamie siviter instead of madame beaumont and i thank you for your attentions this dollar will pay the instalment due on the dress to morrow i guess i ll go up to my room now harold farrington listened to the recital of the lotus s loveliest guest with an impassive countenance when she had concluded he drew a small book like a checkbook from his coat pocket he wrote upon a blank form in this with a stub of pencil tore out the leaf tossed it over to his companion and took up the paper dollar i ve got to go to work too in the morning he said and i might as well begin now there s a receipt for the dollar instalment i ve been a col lector for o dowd levinsky for three years funny ain t it that you and me both had the same idea about spending our vacation i ve always wanted to put up at a swell hotel and i saved up out of my twenty per and did it say mame how about a trip to coney saturday night on the boat what the face of the pseudo madame heloise d arcy beaumont beamed oh you bet i ll go mr farrington the store closes at twelve on saturdays i guess coney ll be all right even if we did spend a week with the swells below the balcony the sweltering city growled and buzzed in the july night inside the hotel lotus the tempered cool shadows reigned and the solicitous waiter single footed near the low windows ready at a nod to serve madame and her escort at the door of the elevator farrington took his leave and madame beaumont made her last ascent but before they reached the noiseless cage be said just forget that harold farrington will you mcmanus is the name james mcmanus some call me jimmy good night jimmy said madame the rathskeller and the rose miss posie carrington had earned her suc cess she began life handicapped by the family name of boggs in the small town known as cranberry corners at the age of eighteen she had acquired the name of carrington and a position in the chorus of a metropolitan burlesque company thence upward she had ascended by the legitimate and delectable steps of broiler member of the famous dickey bird octette in the successful musical comedy fudge and fellows leader of the potato bug dance in fol de rol and at length to the part of the maid toinette in the king s bath robe which captured the critics and gave her her chance and when we come to consider miss carrington she is in the heydey of flattery fame and fizz and that astute manager herr timothy goldstein has her signature to iron clad papers that she will star the coming season in dyde rich s new play paresis by gaslight promptly there came to herr timothy a capable twentieth century young character actor by the name of highsmith who besought engagement as sol haytosser the comic and chief male character part in paresis by gaslight my boy said goldstein take the part if you can get it miss carrington won t listen to any of my suggestions she has turned down half a dozen of the best imitators of the rural dub in the city she declares she won t set a foot on the stage un less haytosser is the best that can be raked up she was raised in a village you know and when a broadway orchid sticks a straw in his hair and tries to call himself a clover blossom she s on all right i asked her in a sarcastic vein if she thought den man thompson would make any kind of a show in the part oh no says she i don t want him or john drew or jim corbett or any of these swell actors that don t know a turnip from a turnstile i want the real article so my boy if you want to play i sol haytosser you will have to convince miss carrington luck be with you highsmith took the train the next day for cran berry corners he remained in that forsaken and inanimate village three days he found the boggs family and corkscrewed their history unto the third and fourth generation he amassed the facts and the local color of cranberry corners the village had not grown as rapidly as had miss carrington the actor estimated that it had suffered as few actual changes since the departure of its solitary follower of thespis as had a stage upon which four years is supposed to have elapsed he absorbed cran berry corners and returned to the city of chameleon changes it was in the rathskeller that highsmith made the hit of his histrionic career there is no need to name the place there is but one rathskeller where you could hope to find miss posie carrington after a performance of the king s bath robe there was a jolly small party at one of the tables that drew many eyes miss carrington petite mar vellous bubbling electric fame drunken shall be named first herr goldstein follows sonorous curly haired heavy a trifle anxious as some bear that had caught somehow a butterfly in his claws next a man condemned to a newspaper sad courted armed analyzing for press agent s dross every sen tence that was poured over him eating his a la new burg in the silence of greatness to conclude a youth with parted hair a name that is ochre to red journals and gold on the back of a supper check these sat at a table while the musicians played while waiters moved in the mazy performance of their duties with their backs toward all who desired their service and all was bizarre and merry because it was nine feet below the level of the sidewalk at a being entered the rathskeller the first violin perceptibly flatted a c that should have been natural the clarionet blew a bubble instead of a grace note miss carrington giggled and the youth with parted hair swallowed an olive seed exquisitely and irreproachably rural was the new entry a lank disconcerted hesitating young man it was flaxen haired gaping of mouth awkward stricken to misery by the lights and company his clothing was butternut with bright blue tie showing four inches of bony wrist and white socked ankle he upset a chair sat in another one curled a foot around a table leg and cringed at the approach of a waiter you may fetch me a glass of lager beer he said in response to the discreet questioning of the servitor the eyes of the rathskeller were upon him he was as fresh as a collard and as ingenuous as a hay rake he let his eye rove about the place as one who re gards big eyed hogs in the potato patch his gaze rested at length upon miss carrington he rose and went to her table with a lateral shining smile and a blush of pleased trepidation how re ye miss posie he said in accents not to be doubted don t ye remember me bill sum mers the summerses that lived back of the black smith shop i reckon i ve growed up some since ye left cranberry corners liza perry lowed i might see ye in the city while i was here you know liza married benny stanfield and she says ah say interrupted miss carrington brightly lize perry is never married what oh the freckles of her married in june grinned the gossip and livin in the old tatum place ham riley perfessed reli gion old mrs blithers sold her place to cap n spooner the youngest waters girl run away with a music teacher the court house burned up last march your uncle wiley was elected constable matilda hos kins died from runnin a needle in her hand and tom beedle is courtin sallie lathrop they say he don t miss a night but what he s settin on their porch the wall eyed thing exclaimed miss carring ton with asperity why tom beedle once say you folks excuse me a while this is an old friend of mine mr what was it yes mr summers mr goldstein mr ricketts mr oh what s yours johnny ll do come on over here and tell me some more she swept him to an isolated table in a corner herr goldstein shrugged his fat shoulders and beck oned to the waiter the newspaper man brightened a little and mentioned absinthe the youth with parted hair was plunged into melancholy the guests of the rathskeller laughed clinked glasses and enjoyed the comedy that posie carrington was treat ing them to after her regular performance a few cynical ones whispered press agent and smiled wisely posie carrington laid her dimpled and desirable chin upon her hands and forgot her audience a faculty that had won her laurels for her i don t seem to recollect any bill summers she said thoughtfully gazing straight into the innocent blue eyes of the rustic young man but i know the summerses all right i guess there ain t many changes in the old town you see any of my folks lately and then highsmith played his trump the part of sol haytosser called for pathos as well as comedy miss carrington should see that he could do that as well miss posie said bill summers i was up to your folkeses house jist two or three days ago no there ain t many changes to speak of the lilac bush by the kitchen window is over a foot higher and the elm in the front yard died and had to be cut down and yet it don t seem the same place that it used to be how s ma asked miss carrington she was settin by the front door crocheting a lamp mat when i saw her last said bill she s older n she was miss posie but everything in the house looked jest the same your ma asked me to set down don t touch that willow rocker william says she it ain t been moved since posie left and that s the apron she was hemmin layin over the arm of it jist as she flung it i m in hopes she goes on that posie ll finish runnin out that hem some day miss carrington beckoned peremptorily to a waiter a pint of extra dry she ordered briefly and give the check to goldstein the sun was shinin in the door went on the chronicler from cranberry and your ma was settin right in it i asked her if she hadn t better move back a little william says she when i get sot down and lookin down the road i can t bear to move never a day says she but what i set here every minute that i can spare and watch over them palin s for posie she went away down that road in the night for we seen her little shoe tracks in the dust and somethin tells me she ll come back that way ag in when she s weary of the world and begins to think about her old mother when i was comin away concluded bill i pulled this off n the bush by the front steps i thought maybe i might see you in the city and i knowed you d like somethin from the old home he took from his coat pocket a rose a drooping yellow velvet odorous rose that hung its bead in the foul atmosphere of that tainted rathskeller like a virgin bowing before the hot breath of the lions in a roman arena miss carrington s penetrating but musical laugh rose above the orcbestra s rendering of bluebells oh say she cried with glee ain t those poky places the limit i just know that two hours at cranberry corners would give me the horrors now well i m awful glad to have seen you mr summers guess i ll bustle around to the hotel now and get my beauty sleep she thrust the yellow rose into the bosom of her wonderful dainty silken garments stood up and nodded imperiously at herr goldstein her three companions and bill summers at tended her to her cab when her flounces and streamers were all safely tucked inside she dazzled them with au revoirs from her shining eyes and teeth come around to the hotel and see me bill before you leave the city she called as the glittering cab rolled away highsmith still in his make up went with herr goldstein to a cafe booth bright idea eh asked the smiling actor ought to land sol haytosser for me don t you think the little lady never once tumbled i didn t bear your conversation said goldstein but your make up and acting was k here s to your success you d better call on miss carrington early to morrow and strike her for the part i don t see how she can keep from being satisfied with your exhibition of ability at a m on the next day highsmith hand some dressed in the latest mode confident with a fuchsia in his button bole sent up his card to miss carrington in her select apartment hotel he was shown up and received by the actress s french maid i am sorree said mlle hortense but i am to say this to all it is with great regret mees car rington have cancelled all engagements on the stage and have returned to live in that how you call that town cranberry cornaire the clarion call half of this story can be found in the records of the police department the other half belong behind the business counter of a newspaper office one afternoon two weeks after millionaire nor cross was found in his apartment murdered by a bur glar the murderer while strolling serenely down broadway ran plump against detective barney woods is that you johnny kernan asked woods who had been near sighted in public for five years no less cried kernan heartily if it isn t barney woods late and early of old saint jo you ll have to show me what are you doing east do the green goods circulars get out that far said woods i ve been in new york some years i m on the city detective force well well said kernan breathing smiling joy and patting the detective s arm come into muller s said woods and let s hunt a quiet table i d like to talk to you awhile it lacked a few minutes to the hour of four the tides of trade were not yet loosed and they found a quiet corner of the cafe kernan well dressed slightly swaggering self confident seated himself op posite the little detective with his pale sandy mus tache squinting eyes and ready made cheviot suit what business are you in now asked woods you know you left saint jo a year before i did i m selling shares in a copper mine said ker nan i may establish an office here well well and so old barney is a new york detective you always had a turn that way you were on the po lice in saint jo after i left there weren t you six months said woods and now there s one more question johnny i ve followed your record pretty close ever since you did that hotel job in sara toga and i never knew you to use your gun before why did you kill norcross kernan stared for a few moments with concen trated attention at the slice of lemon in his high ball and then be looked at the detective with a sudden crooked brilliant smile how did you guess it barney he asked ad miringly i swear i thought the job was as clean and as smooth as a peeled onion did i leave a string hanging out anywhere woods laid upon the table a small gold pencil in tended for a watch charm it s the one i gave you the last christmas we were in saint jo i ve got your shaving mug yet i found this under a corner of the rug in norcross s room i warn you to be careful what you say i ve got it put on to you johnny we were old friends once but i must do my duty you ll have to go to the chair for norcross kernan laughed my luck stays with me said be who d have thought old barney was on my trail he slipped one hand inside his coat in an instant woods had a revolver against his side put it away said kernan wrinkling his nose i m only investigating aha it takes nine tailors to make a man but one can do a man up there s a hole in that vest pocket i took that pencil off my chain and slipped it in there in case of a scrap put up your gun barney and i ll tell you why i had to shoot norcross the old fool started down the hall after me popping at the buttons on the back of my coat with a peevish little and i had to stop him the old lady was a darling she just lay in bed and saw her diamond necklace go with out a chirp while she begged like a panhandler to have back a little thin gold ring with a garnet worth about guess she married old norcross for his money all right don t they hang on to the little trinkets from the man who lost out though there were six rings two brooches and a chatelaine watch fifteen thousand would cover the lot i warned you not to talk said woods oh that s all right said kernan the stuff is in my suit case at the hotel and now i ll tell you why i m talking because it s safe i m talking to a man i know you owe me a thousand dollars bar ney woods and even if you wanted to arrest me your hand wouldn t make the move i haven t forgotten said woods you counted out twenty fifties without a word i ll pay it back some day that thousand saved me and well they were piling my furniture out on the sidewalk when i got back to the house and so continued kernan you being barney woods born as true as steel and bound to play a white man s game can t lift a finger to arrest the man you re indebted to oh i have to study men as well as yale locks and window fastenings in my business now keep quiet while i ring for the waiter i ve had a thirst for a year or two that wor ries me a little if i m ever caught the lucky sleuth will have to divide honors with old boy booze but i never drink during business hours after a job i can crook elbows with my old friend barney with a clear conscience what are you taking the waiter came with the little decanters and the siphon and left them alone again you ve called the turn said woods as he rolled the little gold pencil about with a thoughtful fore finger i ve got to pass you up i can t lay a hand on you if i d a paid that money back but i didn t and that settles it it s a bad break i m making johnny but i can t dodge it you helped me once and it calls for the same i knew it said kernan raising his glass with a flushed smile of self appreciation i can judge men here s to barney for he s a jolly good fellow i don t believe went on woods quietly as if be were thinking aloud that if accounts had been square between you and me all the money in all the banks in new york could have bought you out of my hands to night i know it couldn t said kernan that s why i knew i was safe with you most people continued the detective look side ways at my business they don t class it among the fine arts and the professions but i ve always taken a kind of fool pride in it and here is where i go busted i guess i m a man first and a detective afterward i ve got to let you go and then i ve got to resign from the force i guess i can drive an ex press wagon your thousand dollars is further off than ever johnny oh you re welcome to it said kernan with a lordly air i d be willing to call the debt off but i know you wouldn t have it it was a lucky day for me when you borrowed it and now let s drop the subject i m off to the west on a morning train i know a place out there where i can negotiate the norcross sparks drink up barney and forget your troubles we ll have a jolly time while the police are knocking their heads together over the case i ve got one of my sahara thirsts on to night but i m in the bands the unofficial bands of my old friend barney and i won t even dream of a cop and then as kernan s ready finger kept the but ton and the waiter working his weak point a tre mendous vanity and arrogant egotism began to show itself he recounted story after story of his suc cessful plunderings ingenious plots and infamous transgressions until woods with all his familiarity with evil doers felt growing within him a cold ab horrence toward the utterly vicious man who had once been his benefactor i m disposed of of course said woods at length but i advise you to keep under cover for a spell the newspapers may take up this norcross affair there has been an epidemic of burglaries and manslaughter in town this summer the word sent kernan into a high glow of sullen and vindictive rage to hell with the newspapers he growled what do they spell but brag and blow and boodle in box car letters suppose they do take up a case what does it amount to the police are easy enough to fool but what do the newspapers do they send a lot of pin head reporters around to the scene and they make for the nearest saloon and have beer while they take photos of the bartender s oldest daughter in evening dress to print as the fiancee of the young man in the tenth story who thought he heard a noise below on the night of the murder that s about as near as the newspapers ever come to running down mr burglar well i don t know said woods reflecting some of the papers have done good work in that line there s the morning mars for instance it warmed up two or three trails and got the man after the police had let em get cold i ll show you said tiernan rising and expand ing his chest i ll show you what i think of news papers in general and your morning mars in par ticular three feet from their table was the telephone booth kernan went inside and sat at the instrument leaving the door open he found a number in the book took down the receiver and made his demand upon central woods sat still looking at the sneer ing cold vigilant face waiting close to the trans mitter and listened to the words that came from the thin truculent lips curved into a contemptuous smile that the morning mars i want to speak to the managing editor why tell him it s some one who wants to talk to him about the norcross murder you the editor all right i am the man who killed old norcross wait hold the wire i m not the usual crank oh there isn t the slightest danger i ve just been dis cussing it with a detective friend of mine i killed the old man at a m two weeks ago to morrow have a drink with you now hadn t you better leave that kind of talk to your funny man can t you tell whether a man s guying you or whether you re being offered the biggest scoop your dull dishrag of a paper ever had well that s so it s a bobtail scoop but you can hardly expect me to phone in my name and address why oh because i beard you make a specialty of solving mysterious crimes that stump the police no that s not all i want to tell you that your rotten lying penny sheet is of no more use in tracking an intelligent murderer or highway man than a blind poodle would be what oh no this isn t a rival newspaper office you re getting it straight i did the norcross job and i ve got the jewels in my suit case at the name of the hotel could not be learned you recog nize that phrase don t you i thought so you ve used it often enough kind of rattles you doesn t it to have the mysterious villain call up your great big all powerful organ of right and justice and good government and tell you what a helpless old gas bag you are cut that out you re not that big a fool no you don t think i m a fraud i can tell it by your voice now listen and i ll give you a pointer that will prove it to you of course you ve had this murder case worked over by your staff of bright young blockheads half of the second but ton on old mrs norcross s nightgown is broken off i saw it when i took the garnet ring off her finger i thought it was a ruby stop that it won t work kernan turned to woods with a diabolic smile i ve got him going he believes me now he didn t quite cover the transmitter with his hand when he told somebody to call up central on another phone and get our number i ll give him just one more dig and then we ll make a get away hello yes i m here yet you didn t think i d run from such a little subsidized turn coat rag of a newspaper did you have me inside of forty eight hours say will you quit being funny now you let grown men alone and at tend to your business of hunting up divorce cases and street car accidents and printing the filth and scandal that you make your living by good by old boy sorry i haven t time to call on you i d feel perfectly safe in your sanctum asinorum tra la he s as mad as a cat that s lost a mouse said kernan hanging up the receiver and coming out and now barney my boy we ll go to a show and enjoy ourselves until a reasonable bedtime four hours sleep for me and then the west bound the two dined in a broadway restaurant kernan was pleased with himself he spent money like a prince of fiction and then a weird and gorgeous musical comedy engaged their attention afterward there was a late supper in a grillroom with champagne and kernan at the height of his com placency half past three in the morning found them in a corner of an all night cafe kernan still boasting in a vapid and rambling way woods thinking moodily over the end that had come to his usefulness as an upholder of the law but as he pondered his eye brightened with a speculative light i wonder if it s possible be said to himself i won der if it s pos si ble and then outside the cafe the comparative stillness of the early morning was punctured by faint uncer tain cries that seemed mere fireflies of sound some growing louder some fainter waxing and waning amid the rumble of milk wagons and infrequent cars shrill cries they were when near well known cries that conveyed many meanings to the ears of those of the slumbering millions of the great city who waked to hear them cries that bore upon their significant small volume the weight of a world s woe and laugh ter and delight and stress to some cowering be neath the protection of a night s ephemeral cover they brought news of the hideous bright day to others wrapped in happy sleep they announced a morning that would dawn blacker than sable night to many of the rich they brought a besom to sweep away what had been theirs while the stars shone to the poor they brought another day all over the city the cries were starting up keen and sonorous heralding the chances that the slip ping of one cogwheel in the machinery of time had made apportioning to the sleepers while they lay at the mercy of fate the vengeance profit grief reward and doom that the new figure in the calen dar had brought them shrill and yet plaintive were the cries as if the young voices grieved that so much evil and so little good was in their irresponsible hands thus echoed in the streets of the helpless city the transmission of the latest decrees of the gods the cries of the newsboys the clarion call of the press woods flipped a dime to the waiter and said get me a morning mars when the paper came he glanced at its first page and then tore a leaf out of his memorandum book and began to write on it with the little old pencil what s the news yawned kernan woods flipped over to him the piece of writing the new york morning mars please pay to the order of john kernan the one thousand dollars reward coming to me for his arrest and conviction barnard woods i kind of thought they would do that said woods when you were jollying them so hard now johnny you ll come to the police station with me extradited from bohemia from near the village of harmony at the foot of the green mountains came miss medora martin to new york with her color box and easel miss medora resembled the rose which the autum nal frosts had spared the longest of all her sister blossoms in harmony when she started alone to the wicked city to study art they said she was a mad reckless headstrong girl in new york when she first took her seat at a west side boardinghouse table the boarders asked who is the nice looking old maid medora took heart a cheap hall bedroom and two art lessons a week from professor angelini a retired barber who had studied his profession in a harlem dancing academy there was no one to set her right for here in the big city they do it unto all of us how many of us are badly shaved daily and taught the two step imperfectly by ex pupils of bastien le page and gerome the most pathetic sight in new york except the manners of the rush hour crowds is the dreary march of the hopeless army of me diocrity here art is no benignant goddess but a circe who turns her wooers into mewing toms and tabbies who linger about the doorsteps of her abode unmindful of the flying brickbats and boot jacks of the critics some of us creep back to our native vil lages to the skim milk of i told you so but most of us prefer to remain in the cold courtyard of our mistress s temple snatching the scraps that fall from her divine table d hote but some of us grow weary at last of the fruitless service and then there are two fates open to us we can get a job driving a grocer s wagon or we can get swallowed up in the vortex of bohemia the latter sounds good but the former really pans out better for when the grocer pays us off we can rent a dress suit and the cap italized system of humor describes it best get bo hemia on the run miss medora chose the vortex and thereby fur nishes us with our little story professor angelini praised her sketches excessively once when she had made a neat study of a horse chestnut tree in the park he declared she would be come a second rosa bonheur again a great art ist has his moods he would say cruel and cutting things for example medora had spent an after noon patiently sketching the statue and the archi tecture at columbus circle tossing it aside with a sneer the professor informed her that giotto had once drawn a perfect circle with one sweep of his hand one day it rained the weekly remittance from har mony was overdue medora had a headache the pro fessor had tried to borrow two dollars from her her art dealer had sent back all her water colors unsold and mr binkley asked her out to dinner mr binkley was the gay boy of the boarding house he was forty nine and owned a fishstall in a downtown market but after six o clock he wore an evening suit and whooped things up connected with the beaux arts the young men said he was an indian he was supposed to be an accomplished habitue of the inner circles of bohemia it was no secret that he had once loaned to a young man who had had a drawing printed in puck often has one thus obtained his entree into the charmed circle while the other obtained both his entree and roast the other boarders enviously regarded medora as she left at mr binkley s side at nine o clock she was as sweet as a cluster of dried autumn grasses in her pale blue oh er that very thin stuff in her pale blue comstockized silk waist and box pleated voile skirt with a soft pink glow on her thin cheeks and the tiniest bit of rouge powder on her face with her handkerchief and room key in her brown walrus pebble grain band bag and mr binkley looked imposing and dashing with his red face and gray mustache and his tight dress coat that made the back of his neck roll up just like a successful novelist s they drove in a cab to the cafe terence just off the most glittering part of broadway which as every one knows is one of the most popular and widely patronized jealously exclusive bohemian re sorts in the city down between the rows of little tables tripped medora of the green mountains after her escort thrice in a lifetime may woman walk upon clouds once when she trippeth to the altar once when she first enters bohemian halls the last when she marches back across her first garden with the dead hen of her neighbor in her band there was a table set with three or four about it a waiter buzzed around it like a bee and silver and glass shone upon it and preliminary to the meal as the prehistoric granite strata heralded the pro tozoa the bread of gaul compounded after the for mula of the recipe for the eternal bills was there set forth to the hand and tooth of a long suffering city while the gods lay beside their nectar and home made biscuits and smiled and the dentists leaped for joy in their gold leafy dens the eye of binkley fixed a young man at his table with the bobemian gleam which is a compound of the look of the basilisk the shine of a bubble of wurzburger the inspiration of genius and the plead ing of a panhandler the young man sprang to his feet hello bink old boy be shouted don t tell me you were go ing to pass our table join us unless you ve an other crowd on hand don t mind old chap said binkley of the fish stall you know how i like to butt up against the fine arts mr vandyke mr madder er miss martin one of the elect also in art er the introduction went around there were also miss elise and miss toinette perhaps they were models for they chattered of the st regis decora tions and henry james and they did it not badly medora sat in transport music wild intoxi eating music made by troubadours direct from a rear basement room in elysium set her thoughts to dancing here was a world never before penetrated by her warmest imagination or any of the lines con trolled by harriman with the green mountains external calm upon her she sat her soul flaming in her with the fire of andalusia the tables were filled with bohemia the room was full of the fragrance of flowers both mille and cauli questions and corks popped laughter and silver rang champagne flashed in the pail wit flashed in the pan vandyke ruffled his long black locks disarranged his careless tie and leaned over to madder say maddy he whispered feelingly some times i m tempted to pay this philistine his ten dol lars and get rid of him madder ruffled his long sandy locks and disar ranged his careless tie don t think of it vandy he replied we are short and art is long medora ate strange viands and drank elderberry wine that they poured in her glass it was just the color of that in the vermont home the waiter poured something in another glass that seemed to be boiling but when she tasted it it was not hot she had never felt so light hearted before she thought lovingly of the green mountain farm and its fauna she leaned smiling to miss elise if i were at home she said beamingly i could show you the cutest little calf nothing for you in the white lane said miss elise why don t you pad the orchestra played a wailing waltz that medora had learned from the hand organs she followed the air with nodding head in a sweet soprano hum madder looked across the table at her and wondered in what strange waters binkley had caught her in his seine she smiled at him and they raised glasses and drank of the wine that boiled when it was cold binkley had abandoned art and was prating of the unusual spring catch of shad miss elise arranged the palette and maul stick tie pin of mr vandyke a philistine at some distant table was maundering volubly either about jerome or gerome a famous actress was discoursing excitably about monogrammed hosiery a hose clerk from a department store was loudly proclaiming his opinions of the

medora to the board ing bouse and left her with a society bow at the foot of the hall stairs she went up to her room and lit the gas and then as suddenly as the dreadful genie arose in vapor from the copper vase of the fisherman arose in that room the formidable shape of the new england conscience the terrible thing that medora had done was revealed to her in its full enormity she had sat in the

you forever i have loved you too well to blight your career by bringing into it my guilty and sin stained life i have succumbed to the insidious wiles of this wicked world and have been drawn into the vortex of bohemia there is scarcely any depth of glittering iniquity that i have not sounded it is hopeless to combat my decision there is no rising from the depths to which i have sunk endeavor to forget me i am lost forever in the fair but brutal maze of awful bohemia farewell once your medora on the next day medora formed her resolutions beelzebub flung from heaven was no more cast down between her and the apple blossoms of harmony there was a fixed gulf flaming cherubim warded her from the gates of her lost paradise in one evening by the aid of binkley and mumm bohemia had gathered her into its awful midst there remained to her but one thing a life of brilliant but irremediable error vermont was a shrine that she never would dare to approach again but she would not sink there

she could not bear to think of the life she had once desired a peaceful one in the shadow of the green mountains with beriah at her side and orders for expensive oil paintings coming in by each mail from new york her one fatal misstep had shattered that dream on the fourth day medora powdered her face and rouged her lips once she had seen carter in zaza she stood before the mirror in a reckless attitude and cried zut zut she rhymed it with nut but with the lawless word harmony seemed to pass away forever the vortex had her she belonged to bohemia for evermore and never would beriah the door opened and beriah walked in dory said he what s all that chalk and pink stuff on your face honey medora extended an arm too late she said solemnly the die is cast i belong in another world curse me if

long dark narrow hallway they went and then through a shining and spotless kitchen that opened directly upon a back yard the walls of houses hemmed three sides of the yard a high board fence surrounded by cats the other a wash of clothes was suspended high upon a line stretched from diagonal corners those were property clothes and were never taken in by tonio they were there that wits

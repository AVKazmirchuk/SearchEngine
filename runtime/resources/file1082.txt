approves it opened its social gates to him and shut him in on a close cropped formal lawn with the select herd of rumi nants in dress habits manners provincialism routine and narrowness he acquired that charming in solence that irritating completeness that sophisti cated crassness that overbalanced poise that makes the manhattan gentleman so delightfully small in his greatness one of the up state rural counties pointed with pride to the successful young metropolitan lawyer as a product of its soil six years earlier this county had removed the wheat straw from between its huckle berry stained teeth and emitted a derisive and bucolic laugh as old man walmsley s freckle faced bob abandoned the certain three per diem meals of the one horse farm for the discontinuous quick lunch counters of the three ringed metropolis at the end of the six years no murder trial coaching party au tomobile accident or cotillion was complete in which the name of robert walmsley did not figure tailors waylaid him in the street to get a new wrinkle from the cut of his unwrinkled trousers hyphenated fel lows in the clubs and members of the oldest subpoenaed families were glad to clap him on the back and allow him three letters of his name but the matterhorn of robert walmsley s success was not scaled until be married alicia van der pool i cite the matterhorn for just so high and cool and white and inaccessible was this daughter of the old burghers the social alps that ranged about her over whose bleak passes a thousand climbers struggled reached only to her knees she towered in her own atmosphere serene chaste prideful wading in no fountains dining no monkeys breeding no dogs for bench shows she was a van der pool fountains were made to play for her monkeys were made for other people s ancestors dogs she understood were created to be companions of blind persons and objec tionable characters who smoked pipes this was the matterhorn that robert walmsley accomplished if he found with the good poet with the game foot and artificially curled hair that he who ascends to mountain tops will find the loftiest peaks most wrapped in clouds and snow he concealed his chilblains beneath a brave and smiling exterior he was a lucky man and knew it even though he were imitating the spartan boy with an ice cream freezer beneath his doublet frappeeing the region of his heart after a brief wedding tour abroad the couple re turned to create a decided ripple in the calm cistern so placid and cool and sunless it is of the best so ciety they entertained at their red brick mausoleum of ancient greatness in an old square that is a ceme tery of crumbled glory and robert walmsley was proud of his wife although while one of his hands shook his guests the other held tightly to his alpen stock and thermometer one day alicia found a letter written to robert by his mother it was an unerudite letter full of crops and motherly love and farm notes it chronicled the health of the pig and the recent red calf and asked concerning robert s in return it was a letter direct from the soil straight from home full of biographies of bees tales of turnips peaans of new laid eggs neg lected parents and the slump in dried apples why have i not been shown your mother s let ters asked alicia there was always something in her voice that made you think of lorgnettes of ac counts at tiffany s of sledges smoothly gliding on the trail from dawson to forty mile of the tinkling of pendant prisms on your grandmothers chandeliers of snow lying on a convent roof of a police sergeant refusing bail your mother continued alicia invites us to make a visit to the farm i have never seen a farm we will go there for a week or two robert we will said robert with the grand air of an associate supreme justice concurring in an opinion i did not lay the invitation before you because i thought you would not care to go i am much pleased at your decision i will write to her myself answered alicia with a faint foreshadowing of enthusiasm felice shall pack my trunks at once seven i think will be enough i do not suppose that your mother entertains a great deal does she give many house parties robert arose and as attorney for rural places filed a demurrer against six of the seven trunks he en deavored to define picture elucidate set forth and describe a farm his own words sounded strange in his ears he had not realized how thoroughly urbsi dized he had become a week passed and found them landed at the little country station five hours out from the city a grin ning stentorian sarcastic youth driving a mule to a spring wagon hailed robert savagely hallo mr walmsley found your way back at last have you sorry i couldn t bring in the auto mobile for you but dad s bull tonguing the ten acre clover patch with it to day guess you ll excuse my not wearing a dress suit over to meet you it ain t six o clock yet you know i m glad to see you tom said robert grasp ing his brother s band yes i ve found my way at last you ve a right to say at last it s been over two years since the last time but it will be oftener after this my boy alicia cool in the summer beat as an arctic wraith white as a norse snow maiden in her flimsy muslin and fluttering lace parasol came round the corner of the station and tom was stripped of his assurance he became chiefly eyesight clothed in blue jeans and on the homeward drive to the mule alone did he confide in language the inwardness of his thoughts they drove homeward the low sun dropped a spendthrift flood of gold upon the fortunate fields of wheat the cities were far away the road lay curl ing around wood and dale and bill like a ribbon lost from the robe of careless summer the wind followed like a whinnying colt in the track of phoebus s steeds by and by the farmhouse peeped gray out of its faithful grove they saw the long lane with its convoy of walnut trees running from the road to the house they smelled the wild rose and the breath of cool damp willows in the creek s bed and then in unison all the voices of the soil began a chant addressed to the soul of robert walmsley out of the tilted aisles of the dim wood they came hollowly they chirped and buzzed from the parched grass they trilled from the ripples of the creek ford they floated up in clear pan s pipe notes from the dimming meadows the whippoorwills joined in as they pursued midges in the upper air slow going cow bells struck out a homely accompaniment and this was what each one said you ve found your way back at last have you the old voices of the soil spoke to him leaf and bud and blossom conversed with him in the old vocabu lary of his careless youth the inanimate things the familiar stones and rails the gates and furrows and roofs and turns of the road had an eloquence too and a power in the transformation the country had smiled and he had felt the breath of it and his heart was drawn as if in a moment back to his old love the city was far away this rural atavism then seized robert walmsley and possessed him a queer thing he noticed in con nection with it was that alicia sitting at his side suddenly seemed to him a stranger she did not be long to this recurrent phase never before had she seemed so remote so colorless and high so intan gible and unreal and yet he had never admired her more than when she sat there by him in the rickety spring wagon chiming no more with his mood and with her environment than the matterhorn chimes with a peasant s cabbage garden that night when the greetings and the supper were over the entire family including buff the yellow dog bestrewed itself upon the front porch alicia not haughty but silent sat in the shadow dressed in an exquisite pale gray tea gown robert s mother dis coursed to her happily concerning marmalade and lumbago tom sat on the top step sisters millie and pam on the lowest step to catch the lightning bugs mother had the willow rocker father sat in the big armchair with one of its arms gone buff sprawled in the middle of the porch in everybody s way the twilight pixies and pucks stole forth un seen and plunged other poignant shafts of memory into the heart of robert a rural madness entered his soul the city was far away father sat without his pipe writhing in his heavy boots a sacrifice to rigid courtesy robert shouted no you don t he fetched the pipe and lit it he seized the old gentleman s boots and tore them off the last one slipped suddenly and mr robert walmsley of washington square tumbled off the porch backward with buff on top of him bowling fearfully tom laughed sarcastically robert tore off his coat and vest and hurled them into a lilac bush come out here you landlubber be cried to tom and i ll put grass seed on your back i think you called me a dude a while ago come along and cut your capers tom understood the invitation and accepted it with delight three times they wrestled on the grass side holds even as the giants of the mat and twice was tom forced to bite grass at the hands of the distinguished lawyer dishevelled panting each still boasting of his own prowess they stumbled back to the porch millie cast a pert reflection upon the qualities of a city brother in an instant robert had secured a horrid katydid in his fingers and bore down upon her screaming wildly she fled up the lane pursued by the avenging glass of form a quarter of a mile and they returned she full of apology to the victorious dude the rustic mania possessed him unabatedly i can do up a cowpenful of you slow hayseeds he proclaimed vaingloriously bring on your bull dogs your hired men and your log rollers he turned handsprings on the grass that prodded tom to envious sarcasm and then with a whoop he clattered to the rear and brought back uncle like a battered colored retainer of the family with his banjo and strewed sand on the porch and danced chicken in the bread tray and did buck and wing wonders for half an hour longer incredibly wild and boisterous things he did he sang he told stories that set all but one shrieking he played the yokel the humorous clodhopper he was mad and with the revival of the old life in his blood he became so extravagant that once his mother sought gently to reprove him then alicia moved as though she were about to speak but she did not through it all she sat immovable a slim white spirit in the dusk that no man might question or read by and by she asked permission to ascend to her room saying that she was tired on her way she passed robert he was standing in the door the figure of vulgar comedy with ruffled hair reddened face and unpardonable confusion of attire no trace there of the immaculate robert walmsley the courted clubman and ornament of select circles he was do ing a conjuring trick with some household utensils and the family now won over to him without excep tion was beholding him with worshipful admiration as alicia passed in robert started suddenly he had forgotten for the moment that she was present without a glance at him she went on upstairs after that the fun grew quiet an hour passed in talk and then robert went up himself she was standing by the window when he entered their room she was still clothed as when they were on the porch outside and crowding against the window was a giant apple tree full blossomed robert sighed and went near the window he was ready to meet his fate a confessed vulgarian he foresaw the verdict of justice in the shape of that whiteclad form he knew the rigid lines that a van der pool would draw he was a peasant gam bolling indecorously in the valley and the pure cold white unthawed summit of the matterhorn could not but frown on him he had been unmasked by his own actions all the polish the poise the form that the city had given him had fallen from him like an ill fitting mantle at the first breath of a country breeze dully be awaited the approaching condemna tion robert said the calm cool voice of his judge i thought i married a gentleman yes it was coming and yet in the face of it robert walmsley was eagerly regarding a certain branch of the apple tree upon which be used to climb out of that very window he believed he could do it now he wondered bow many blossoms there were on the tree ten millions but here was some one speaking again i thought i married a gentleman the voice went on but why had she come and was standing so close by his side but i find that i have married was this alicia talking something better a man bob dear kiss me won t you the city was far away the shocks of doom here is an aristocracy of the public parks and even of the vagabonds who use them for their private apartments vallance felt rather than knew this but when he stepped down out of his world into chaos his feet brought him directly to madison square raw and astringent as a schoolgirl of the old order young may breathed austerely among the budding trees vallance buttoned his coat lighted his last cigarette and took his seat upon a bench for three minutes be mildly regretted the last hundred of his last thousand that it had cost him when the bicycle cop put an end to his last automobile ride then he felt in every pocket and found not a single penny he had given up his apartment that morning his furniture had gone toward certain debts his clothes save what were upon him had descended to his man servant for back wages as he sat there was not in the whole city for him a bed or a broiled lobster or a street car fare or a carnation for buttonhole unless be should obtain them by spong on his friends or by false pretenses therefore lie had chosen the park and all this was because an uncle had disinherited him and cut down his allowance from liberality to nothing and all that was because his nephew had disobeyed him concerning a certain girl who comes not into this story therefore all readers who brush their hair toward its roots may be warned to read no further there was another nephew of a different branch who had once been the prospective heir and favorite being without grace or hope he had long ago disappeared in the mire now drag nets were out for him he was to be rehabilitated and restored and so vallance fell grandly as lucifer to the lowest pit joining the tattered ghosts in the little park sitting there he leaned far back on the hard bench and laughed a jet of cigarette smoke up to the lowest tree branches the sudden severing of all his life s ties had brought him a free thrilling almost joyous elation he felt precisely the sensation of the aero naut when he cuts loose his parachute and lets his balloon drift away the hour was nearly ten not many loungers were on the benches the park dweller though a stubborn fighter against autumnal coolness is slow to attack the advance line of spring s chilly cohorts then arose one from a seat near the leaping foun tain and came and sat himself at vallance s side he was either young or old cheap lodging houses had flavored him mustily razors and combs had passed him by in him drink had been bottled and sealed in the devil s bond he begged a match which is the form of introduction among park benchers and then he began to talk you re not one of the regulars he said to val lance i know tailored clothes when i see em you just stopped for a moment on your way through the park don t mind my talking to you for a while i ve got to be with somebody i m afraid i m afraid i ve told two or three of those bummers over about it they think i m crazy say let tell you all i ve had to eat to day was a couple pretzels and an apple to morrow i ll stand in to inherit three millions and that restaurant you ee over there with the autos around it will be too for me to eat in don t believe it do you without the slightest trouble said vallance with a laugh i lunched there yesterday to night i couldn t buy a five cent cup of coffee you don t look like one of us well i guess those things happen i used to be a high flyer myself years ago what knocked you out of the game i oh i lost my job said vallance it s undiluted hades this city went on the other one day you re eating from china the next you are eating in china a chop suey joint i ve had more than my share of hard luck for five years i ve been little better than a panhandler i was raised up to live expensively and do nothing say i don t mind telling you i ve got to talk to somebody you see because i m afraid i m afraid my name s ide you wouldn t think that old paulding one of the millionaires on riverside drive was my uncle would you well he is i lived in his house once and had all the money i wanted say haven t you got the price of a couple of drinks about you er what s your name dawson said vallance no i m sorry to say that i m all in financially i ve been living for a week in a coal cellar on division street went on ide with a crook they called blinky morris i didn t have anywhere else to go while i was out to day a chap with some pa pers in his pocket was there asking for me i didn t know but what he was a fly cop so i didn t go around again till after dark there was a letter there be had left for me say dawson it was from a big downtown lawyer mead i ve seen his sign on ann street paulding wants me to play the prodigal nephew wants me to come back and be his heir again and blow in his money i m to call at the lawyer s office at ten to morrow and step into my old shoes again heir to three million dawson and a year pocket money and i m afraid i m afraid the vagrant leaped to his feet and raised both trembling arms above his bead he caught his breath and moaned hysterically vallance seized his arm and forced him back to the bench be quiet he commanded with something like disgust in his tones one would think you had lost a fortune instead of being about to acquire one of what are you afraid ide cowered and shivered on the bench he clung to vallance s sleeve and even in the dim glow of the broadway lights the latest disinherited one could see drops on the other s brow wrung out by some strange terror why i m afraid something will happen to me be fore morning i don t know what something to keep me from coming into that money i m afraid a tree will fall on me i m afraid a cab will run over me or a stone drop on me from a housetop or some thing i never was afraid before i ve sat in this park a hundred nights as calm as a graven image without knowing where my breakfast was to come from but now it s different i love money daw son i m happy as a god when it s trickling through my fingers and people are bowing to me with the music and the flowers and fine clothes all around as long as i knew i was out of the game i didn t mind i was even happy sitting here ragged and hungry listening to the fountain jump and watching the carriages go up the avenue but it s in reach of my hand again now almost and i can t stand it to wait twelve hours dawson i can t stand it there are fifty things that could happen to me i could go blind i might be attacked with heart disease the world might come to an end before i could ide sprang to his feet again with a shriek peo ple stirred on the benches and began to look val lance took his arm come and walk he said soothingly and try to calm yourself there is no need to become ex cited or alarmed nothing is going to happen to you one night is like another that s right said ide stay with me daw son that s a good fellow walk around with me awhile i never went to pieces like this before and i ve had a good many hard knocks do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch old man i m afraid my nerve s too far gone to try any panhandling vallance led his companion up almost deserted fifth avenue and then westward along the thirties toward broadway wait here a few minutes he said leaving ide in a quiet and shadowed spot he entered a familiar hotel and strolled toward the bar quite in his old assured way there s a poor devil outside jimmy he said to the bartender who says he s hungry and looks it you know what they do when you give them money fix up a sandwich or two for him and i ll see that he doesn t throw it away certainly mr vallance said the bartender they ain t all fakes don t like to see anybody go hungry ide folded a liberal supply of the free lunch into a napkin vallance went with it and joined his com panion ide pounced upon the food ravenously i haven t had any free lunch as good as this in a year be said aren t you going to eat any dawson i m not hungry thanks said vallance we ll go back to the square said ide the cops won t bother us there i ll roll up the rest of this ham and stuff for our breakfast i won t eat any more i m afraid i ll get sick suppose i d die of cramps or something to night and never get to touch that money again it s eleven hours yet till time to see that lawyer you won t leave me will you dawson i m afraid something might happen you haven t any place to go have you no said vallance nowhere to night i ll have a bench with you you take it cool said ide if you ve told it to me straight i should think a man put on the bum from a good job just in one day would be tearing his hair i believe i ve already remarked said vallance laughing that i would have thought that a man who was expecting to come into a fortune on the next day would be feeling pretty easy and quiet it s funny business philosophized ide about the way people take things anyhow here s your bench dawson right next to mine the light don t shine in your eyes here say dawson i ll get the old man to give you a letter to somebody about a job when i get back home you ve helped me a lot to night i don t believe i could have gone through the night if i hadn t struck you thank you said vallance do you lie down or sit up on these when you sleep for hours vallance gazed almost without winking at the stars through the branches of the trees and listened to the sharp slapping of horses hoofs on the sea of asphalt to the south his mind was active but his feelings were dormant every emotion seemed to have been eradicated ide felt no regrets no fears no pain or discomfort even when be thought of the girl it was as of an inhabitant of one of those remote stars at which be gazed he re membered the absurd antics of his companion and laughed softly yet without a feeling of mirth soon the daily army of milk wagons made of the city a roaring drum to which they marched vallance fell asleep on his comfortless bench at ten o clock on the next day the two stood at the door of lawyer mead s office in ann street ide s nerves fluttered worse than ever when the hour approached and vallance could not decide to leave him a possible prey to the dangers he dreaded when they entered the office lawyer mead looked at them wonderingly he and vallance were old friends after his greeting he turned to ide who stood with white face and trembling limbs before the expected crisis i sent a second letter to your address last night mr ide he said i learned this morning that you were not there to receive it it will inform you that mr paulding has reconsidered his offer to take you back into favor he has decided not to do so and desires you to understand that no change will be made in the relations existing between you and him ide s trembling suddenly ceased the color came back to his face and be straightened his back his jaw went forward half an inch and a gleam came into his eye he pushed back his battered bat with one hand and extended the other with levelled fin gers toward the lawyer he took a long breath and then laughed sardonically tell old paulding he may go to the devil he said loudly and clearly and turned and walked out of the office with a firm and lively step lawyer mead turned on his heel to vallance and smiled i am glad you came in he said genially your uncle wants you to return home at once he is reconciled to the situation that led to his hasty action and desires to say that all will be as hey adams cried lawyer mead breaking his sentence and calling to his clerk bring a glass of water mr vallance has fainted the plutonian fire there are a few editor men with whom i am privi leged to come in contact it has not been long since it was their habit to come in contact with me there is a difference they tell me that with a large number of the manuscripts that are submitted to them come advices in the way of a boost from the author asseverating that the incidents in the story are true the des tination of such contributions depends wholly upon the question of the enclosure of stamps some are returned the rest are thrown on the floor in a corner on top of a pair of gum shoes an overturned statu ette of the winged victory and a pile of old maga zines containing a picture of the editor in the act of reading the latest copy of le petit journal right side up you can tell by the illustrations it is only a legend that there are waste baskets in editors offices thus is truth held in disrepute but in time truth and science and nature will adapt themselves to art things will happen logically and the villain be dis comfited instead of being elected to the board of directors but in the meantime fiction must not only be divorced from fact but must pay alimony and be awarded custody of the press despatches this preamble is to warn you off the grade cross ing of a true story being that it shall be told sim ply with conjunctions substituted for adjectives wherever possible and whatever evidences of style may appear in it shall be due to the linotype man it is a story of the literary life in a great city and it should be of interest to every author within a mile radius of gosport ind whose desk holds a ms story beginning thus while the cheers following his nomination were still ringing through the old courthouse harwood broke away from the congrat ulating handclasps of his henchmen and hurried to judge creswell s house to find ida pettit came up out of alabama to write fiction the southern papers had printed eight of his stories under an editorial caption identifying the author as the son of the gallant major pettingill pettit our former county attorney and hero of the battle of lookout mountain pettit was a rugged fellow with a kind of shame faced culture and my good friend his father kept a general store in a little town called hosea pettit had been raised in the pine woods and broom sedge fields adjacent thereto he had in his gripsack two manuscript novels of the adventures in picardy of one gaston laboulaye vicompte de montrepos in the year that s nothing we all do that and some day when we make a hit with the little sketch about a newsy and his lame dog the editor prints the other one for us or on us as the say ing is and then and then we have to get a big valise and peddle those patent air draft gas burners at everybody should have em i took pettit to the red brick house which was to appear in an article entitled literary landmarks of old new york some day when we got through with it he engaged a room there drawing on the general store for his expenses i showed new york to him and he did not mention how much narrower broadway is than lee avenue in hosea this seemed a good sign so i put the final test suppose you try your band at a descriptive arti cle i suggested giving your impressions of new york as seen from the brooklyn bridge the fresh point of view the don t be a fool said pettit let s go have some beer on the whole i rather like the city we discovered and enjoyed the only true bohemia every day and night we repaired to one of those palaces of marble and glass and tilework where goes on a tremendous and sounding epic of life valhalla itself could not be more glorious and sonorous the classic marble on which we ate the great light flooded vitreous front adorned with snow white scrolls the grand wagnerian din of clanking cups and bowls the flashing staccato of brandishing cut lery the piercing recitative of the white aproned grub maidens at the morgue like banquet tables the recurrent lied motif of the cash register it was a gigantic triumphant welding of art and sound a deafening soul uplifting pageant of heroic and em blematic life and the beans were only ten cents we wondered why our fellow artists cared to dine at sad little tables in their so called bohemian restau rants and we shuddered lest they should seek out our resorts and make them conspicuous with their pres ence pettit wrote many stories which the editors re turned to him he wrote love stories a thing i have always kept free from holding the belief that the well known and popular sentiment is not properly a matter for publication but something to be privately handled by the alienists and florists but the editors had told him that they wanted love stories because they said the women read them now the editors are wrong about that of course women do not read the love stories in the magazines they read the poker game stories and the recipes for cucumber lotion the love stories are read by fat cigar drummers and little ten year old girls i am not criticising the judgment of editors they are mostly very fine men but a man can be but one man with individual opinions and tastes i knew two associate editors of a magazine who were won derfully alike in almost everything and yet one of them was very fond of flaubert while the other preferred gin pettit brought me his returned manuscripts and we looked them over together to find out why they were not accepted they seemed to me pretty fair stories written in a good style and ended as they should at the bottom of the last page they were well constructed and the events were marshalled in orderly and logical sequence but i thought i detected a lack of living substance it was much as if i gazed at a symmetrical array of presentable clamshells from which the succulent and vital inhabitants had been removed i intimated that the author might do well to get better acquainted with his theme you sold a story last week said pettit about a gun fight in an arizona mining town in which the hero drew his colt s and shot seven bandits as fast as they came in the door now if a six shooter could oh well said i that s different arizona is a long way from new york i could have a man stabbed with a lariat or chased by a pair of chap arreras if i wanted to and it wouldn t be noticed until the usual error sharp from around mcadams junction isolates the erratum and writes in to the pa pers about it but you are up against another proposition this thing they call love is as common around new york as it is in sheboygan during the young onion season it may be mixed here with a little commercialism they read byron but they look up bradstreet s too while they re among the b s and brigham also if they have time but it s pretty much the same old internal disturbance every where you can fool an editor with a fake picture of a cowboy mounting a pony with his left hand on the saddle horn but you can t put him up a tree with a love story so you ve got to fall in love and then write the real thing pettit did i never knew whether he was taking my advice or whether be fell an accidental victim there was a girl be had met at one of these studio contrivances a glorious impudent lucid open minded girl with hair the color of culmbacher and a good natured way of despising you she was a new york girl well as the narrative style permits us to say in frequently pettit went to pieces all those pains those lover s doubts those heart burnings and tremors of which be had written so unconvincingly were his talk about shylock s pound of flesh twenty five pounds cupid got from pettit which is the usurer one night pettit came to my room exalted pale and haggard but exalted she had given him a jonquil old hoss said he with a new smile flickering around his mouth i believe i could write that story to night the one you know that is to win out i can feel it i don t know whether it will come out or not but i can feel it i pushed him out of my door go to your room and write it i ordered else i can see your fin ish i told you this must come first write it to night and put it under my door when it is done put it under my door to night when it is finished don t keep it until to morrow i was reading my bully old pal montaigne at two o clock when i beard the sheets rustle under my door i gathered them up and read the story the hissing of geese the languishing cooing of doves the braying of donkeys the chatter of irre sponsible sparrows these were in my mind s ear as i read suffering sappho i exclaimed to myself is this the divine fire that is supposed to ignite genius and make it practicable and wage earning the story was sentimental drivel full of whim pering softheartedness and gushing egoism all the art that pettit had acquired was gone a pe rusal of its buttery phrases would have made a cynic of a sighing chambermaid in the morning pettit came to my room i read him his doom mercilessly he laughed idiotically all right old hoss he said cheerily make cigar lighters of it what s the difference i m going to take her to lunch at claremont to day there was about a month of it and then pettit came to me bearing an invisible mitten with the forti tude of a dish rag he talked of the grave and south america and prussic acid and i lost an after noon getting him straight i took him out and saw that large and curative doses of whiskey were ad ministered to him i warned you this was a true story ware your white ribbons if only follow this tale for two weeks i fed him whiskey and omar and read to him regularly every evening the column in the evening paper that reveals the secrets of fe male beauty i recommend the treatment after pettit was cured be wrote more stories he recovered his old time facility and did work just short of good enough then the curtain rose on the third act a little dark eyed silent girl from new hamp shire who was studying applied design fell deeply in love with him she was the intense sort but ex ternally glace such as new england sometimes fools us with pettit liked her mildly and took her about a good deal she worshipped him and now and then ignored him there came a climax when she tried to jump out of a window and he had to save her by some perfunc tary unmeant wooing even i was shaken by the depths of the absorbing affection she showed home friends traditions creeds went up like thistle down in the scale against her love it was really discom posing one night again pettit sauntered in yawning as he had told me before he said he felt that he could do a great story and as before i hunted him to his room and saw him open his inkstand at one o clock the sheets of paper slid under my door i read that story and i jumped up late as it was with a whoop of joy old pettit had done it just as though it lay there red and bleeding a woman s heart was written into the lines you couldn t see the joining but art exquisite art and pulsing na ture had been combined into a love story that took you by the throat like the quinsy i broke into pettit s room and beat him on the back and called him name names high up in the galaxy of the im mortals that we admired and pettit yawned and begged to be allowed to sleep on the morrow i dragged him to an editor the great man read and rising gave pettit his hand that was a decoration a wreath of bay and a guar antee of rent and then old pettit smiled slowly i call him gen tleman pettit now to myself it s a miserable name to give a man but it sounds better than it looks in print i see said old pettit as he took up his story and began tearing it into small strips i see the game now you can t write with ink and you can t write with your own heart s blood but you can write with the heart s blood of some one else you have to be a cad before you can be an artist well i am for old alabam and the major s store have you got a light old hoss i went with pettit to the depot and died hard shakespeare s sonnets i blurted making a last stand how about him a cad said pettit they give it to you and you sell it love you know i d rather sell ploughs for father but i protested you are reversing the de cision of the world s greatest good by old hoss said pettit critics i continued but say if the major can use a fairly good salesman and book keeper down there in the store let me know will you nemesis and the candy man we sail at eight in the morning on the celtic said honoria plucking a loose thread from her lace sleeve i heard so said young ives dropping his hat and muffing it as he tried to catch it and i came around to wish you a pleasant voyage of course you heard it said honoria coldly sweet since we have had no opportunity of inform ing you ourselves ives looked at her pleadingly but with little hope outside in the street a high pitched voice chanted not unmusically a commercial gamut of cand de ee ee s nice fresh cand ee ee ee ees d it s our old candy man said honoria leaning out the window and beckoning i want some of his motto kisses there s nothing in the broadway shops half so good the candy man stopped his pushcart in front of the old madison avenue home he had a holiday and festival air unusual to street peddlers his tie was new and bright red and a horseshoe pin almost life size glittered speciously from its folds his brown thin face was crinkled into a semi foolish smile striped cuffs with dog head buttons covered the tan on his wrists i do believe he s going to get married said honoria pityingly i never saw him taken that way before and to day is the first time in months that he has cried his wares i am sure ives threw a coin to the sidewalk the candy man knows his customers he filled a paper bag climbed the old fashioned stoop and banded it in i remember said ives wait said honoria she took a small portfolio from the drawer of a writing desk and from the portfolio a slip of flimsy paper one quarter of an inch by two inches in size this said honoria inflexibly was wrapped about the first one we opened it was a year ago apologized ives as he held out his hand for it as long as skies above are blue to you my love i will be true this he read from the slip of flimsy paper we were to have sailed a fortnight ago said honoria gossipingly it has been such a warm summer the town is quite deserted there is no where to go yet i am told that one or two of the roof gardens are amusing the singing and the dancing on one or two seem to have met with ap proval ives did not wince when you are in the ring you are not surprised when your adversary taps you on the ribs i followed the candy man that time said ives irrelevantly and gave him five dollars at the corner of broadway he reached for the paper bag in honoria s lap took out one of the square wrapped confections and slowly unrolled it sara chillingworth s father said honoria has given her an automobile read that said ives handing over the slip that had been wrapped around the square of candy life teaches us how to live love teaches us to forgive honoria s checks turned pink honoria cried ives starting up from his chair miss clinton corrected honoria rising like venus from the head on the surf i warned you not to speak that name again honoria repeated ives you must bear me i know i do not deserve your forgiveness but i must have it there is a madness that possesses one some times for which his better nature is not responsible i throw everything else but you to the winds i strike off the chains that have bound me i re nounce the siren that lured me from you let the bought verse of that street peddler plead for me it is you only whom i can love let your love forgive and i swear to you that mine will be true as long as skies above are blue on the west side between sixth and seventh ave nues an alley cuts the block in the middle it per ishes in a little court in the centre of the block the district is theatrical the inhabitants the bubbling froth of half a dozen nations the atmosphere is bohemian the language polyglot the locality pre carious in the court at the rear of the alley lived the candy man at seven o clock be pushed his cart into the narrow entrance rested it upon the irregular stone slats and sat upon one of the handles to cool himself there was a great draught of cool wind through the alley there was a window above the spot where be al ways stopped his pushcart in the cool of the after noon mlle adele drawing card of the aerial roof garden sat at the window and took the air gen erally her ponderous mass of dark auburn hair was down that the breeze might have the felicity of aid ing sidonie the maid in drying and airing it about her shoulders the point of her that the pho tographers always made the most of was loosely draped a heliotrope scarf her arms to the elbow were bare there were no sculptors there to rave over them but even the stolid bricks in the walls of the alley should not have been so insensate as to disapprove while she sat thus fe ice another maid anointed and bathed the small feet that twinkled and so charmed the nightly aerial audiences gradually mademoiselle began to notice the candy man stopping to mop his brow and cool himself be neath her window in the hands of her maids she was deprived for the time of her vocation the charming and binding to her chariot of man to lose time was displeasing to mademoiselle here was the candy man no fit game for her darts truly but of the sex upon which she had been born to make war after casting upon him looks of unseeing coldness for a dozen times one afternoon she suddenly thawed and poured down upon him a smile that put to shame the sweets upon his cart candy man she said cooingly while sidonie followed her impulsive dive brushing the heavy auburn hair don t you think i am beautiful the candy man laughed harshly and looked up with his thin jaw set while he wiped his forehead with a red and blue handkerchief yer d make a dandy magazine cover he said grudgingly beautiful or not is for them that cares it s not my line if yer lookin for bou quets apply elsewhere between nine and twelve i think we ll have rain truly fascinating a candy man is like killing rab bits in a deep snow but the hunter s blood is widely diffused mademoiselle tugged a great coil of hair from sidonie s bands and let it fall out the window candy man have you a sweetheart anywhere with hair as long and soft as that and with an arm so round she flexed an arm like galatea s after the miracle across the window sill the candy man cackled shrilly as he arranged a stock of butter scotch that had tumbled down smoke up said he vulgarly nothin doin in the complimentary line i m too wise to be bam boozled by a switch of hair and a newly massaged arm oh i guess you ll make good in the calcium all right with plenty of powder

or in the air good evenin and he trundled his pushcart down the alley and back to the musty court where he lived incredibly to him who has not learned woman mademoiselle sat at the window each day and spread her nets for the ignominious game once she kept a grand cavalier waiting in her reception chamber for half an hour while she battered in vain the candy man s tough philosophy his rough laugh chafed her vanity to its core daily he sat on his cart in the breeze of the alley while her hair was being ministered to and daily the shafts of her beauty rebounded from his dull bosom pointless and ineffectual un worthy pique brightened her eyes pride hurt she glowed upon him in a way that would have sent her higher adorers into an egoistic paradise the candy man s hard eyes looked upon her with a half con cealed derision that urged her to the use of the sharp est arrow in her beauty s quiver one afternoon she leaned far over the sill and she did not challenge and torment him as usual candy man said she stand up and look into my eyes he stood up and looked into her eyes with his harsh laugh like the sawing of wood he took out his pipe fumbled with it and put it back into big pocket with a trembling band that will do said mademoiselle with a slow smile i must go now to my masseuse good evening the next evening at seven the candy man came and rested his cart under the window but was it the candy man his clothes were a bright new check his necktie was a flaming red adorned by a glit tering horseshoe pin almost life size his shoes were polished the tan of his cheeks had paled his hands had been washed the window was empty and he waited under it with his nose upward like a hound hoping for a bone mademoiselle came with sidonie carrying her load of hair she looked at the candy man and smiled a slow smile that faded away into ennui instantly she knew that the game was bagged and so quickly she wearied of the chase she began to talk to sidonie been a fine day said the candy man hollowly first time in a month i ve felt first class hit it up down old madison hollering out like i useter think it ll rain to morrow mademoiselle laid two round arms on the cushion on the window sill and a dimpled chin upon them candy man said she softly do you not love me the candy man stood up and leaned against the brick wall lady said be chokingly i ve got saved up did i say you wasn t beautiful take it every bit of it and buy a collar for your dog with it a sound as of a hundred silvery bells tinkled in the room of mademoiselle the laughter filled the alley and trickled back into the court as strange a thing to enter there as sunlight itself mademoiselle was amused sidonie a wise echo added a sepulchral but faithful contralto the laughter of the two seemed at last to penetrate the candy man he fumbled with his horseshoe pin at length mademoiselle ex hausted turned her flushed beautiful face to the win dow candy man said she go away when i laugh sidonie pulls my hair i can but laugh while you remain there here is a note for mademoiselle said fe ice coming to the window in the room there is no justice said the candy man lift ing the handle of his cart and moving away three yards he moved and stopped loud shriek after shriek came from the window of mademoiselle quickly he ran back he heard a body thumping upon the floor and a sound as though heels beat alter nately upon it what is it be called sidonie s severe head came into the window mademoiselle is overcome by bad news she said one whom she loved with all her soul has gone you may have beard of him he is monsieur ives he sails across the ocean to morrow oh you men squaring the circle at the hazard of wearying you this tale of vehe ment emotions must be prefaced by a discourse on geometry nature moves in circles art in straight lines the natural is rounded the artificial is made up of angles a man lost in the snow wanders in spite of himself in perfect circles the city man s feet denaturalized by rectangular streets and floors carry him ever away from himself the round eyes of childhood typify innocence the narrowed line of the flirt s optic proves the in vasion of art the horizontal mouth is the mark of determined cunning who has not read nature s most spontaneous lyric in lips rounded for the candid kiss beauty is nature in perfection circularity is its chief attribute behold the full moon the enchant ing golf ball the domes of splendid temples the huckleberry pie the wedding ring the circus ring the ring for the waiter and the round of drinks on the other hand straight lines show that na ture has been deflected imagine venus s girdle transformed into a straight front when we begin to move in straight lines and turn sharp corners our natures begin to change the consequence is that nature being more adaptive than art tries to conform to its sterner regulations the result is often a rather curious product for in stance a prize chrysanthemum wood alcohol whis key a republican missouri cauliflower au gratin and a new yorker nature is lost quickest in a big city the cause is geometrical not moral the straight lines of its streets and architecture the rectangularity of its laws and social customs the undeviating pavements the hard severe depressing uncompromising rules of all its ways even of its recreation and sports coldly exhibit a sneering defiance of the curved line of nature wherefore it may be said that the big city has demonstrated the problem of squaring the circle and it may be added that this mathematical intro duction precedes an account of the fate of a kentucky feud that was imported to the city that has a habit of making its importations conform to its angles the feud began in the cumberland mountains be tween the folwell and the harkness families the first victim of the homespun vendetta was a possum dog belonging to bill harkness the harkness family evened up this dire loss by laying out the chief of the folwell clan the folwells were prompt at repartee they oiled up their squirrel rifles and made it feasible for bill harkness to follow his dog to a land where the possums come down when treed without the stroke of an ax the feud flourished for forty years harknesses were shot at the plough through their lamp lit cabin windows coming from camp meeting asleep in duello sober and otherwise singly and in family groups prepared and unprepared folwells had the branches of their family tree lopped off in similar ways as the traditions of their country prescribed and authorized by and by the pruning left but a single member of each family and then cal harkness probably reasoning that further pursuance of the controversy would give a too decided personal flavor to the feud suddenly disappeared from the relieved cumberlands baulking the avenging hand of sam the ultimate op posing folwell a year afterward sam folwell learned that his hereditary unsuppressed enemy was living in new york city sam turned over the big iron wash pot in the yard scraped off some of the soot which he mixed with lard and shined his boots with the com pound he put on his store clothes of butternut dyed black a white shirt and collar and packed a carpet sack with spartan lingerie he took his squirrel rifle from its hooks but put it back again with a sigh however ethical and plausible the habit might be in the cumberlands perhaps new york would not swallow his pose of hunting squirrels among the skyscrapers along broadway an ancient but reliable colt s revolver that he resurrected from a bureau drawer seemed to proclaim itself the pink of weapons for metropolitan adventure and vengeance this and a hunting knife in a leather sheath sam packed in the carpet

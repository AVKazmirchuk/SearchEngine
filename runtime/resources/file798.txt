one time at least in the heart of the supernumerary there rose the killing instinct for one moment he joined the force of combatants orally what are you waiting for sam i said in a whisper let him have it now sam gave a melancholy sigh you don t understand but he does he said he knows mr tenderfoot there s a rule out here among white men in the nation that you can t shoot a man when he s with a woman i never knew it to be broke yet you can t do it you ve got to get him in a gang of men or by himself that s why he knows it too we all know so that s mr ben tatum one of the pretty men i ll cut him out of the herd before they leave the hotel and regulate his account after supper the flying pair disappeared quickly although sam haunted lobby and stairway and halls half the night in some mysterious way the fugitives eluded him and in the morning the veiled lady in the brown dress with the accordion plaited skirt and the dapper young man with the close clipped hair and the buckboard with the prancing nags were gone it is a monotonous story that of the ride so it shall be curtailed once again we overtook them on a road we were about fifty yards behind they turned in the buckboard and looked at us then drove on without whipping up their horses their safety no longer lay in speed ben tatum knew he knew that the only rock of safety left to him was the code there is no doubt that had he been alone the matter would have been settled quickly with sam durkee in the usual way but he had something at his side that kept still the trigger finger of both it seemed likely that he was no coward so you may perceive that woman on occasions may postpone instead of precipitating conflict between man and man but not willingly or consciously she is oblivious of codes five miles farther we came upon the future great western city of chandler the horses of pursuers and pursued were starved and weary there was one hotel that offered danger to man and entertainment to beast so the four of us met again in the dining room at the ringing of a bell so resonant and large that it had cracked the welkin long ago the dining room was not as large as the one at guthrie just as we were eating apple pie how ben davises and tragedy impinge upon each other i noticed sam looking with keen intentness at our quarry where they were seated at a table across the room the girl still wore the brown dress with lace collar and cuffs and the veil drawn down to her nose the man bent over his plate with his close cropped head held low there s a code i heard sam say either to me or to himself that won t let you shoot a man in the company of a woman but by thunder there ain t one to keep you from killing a woman in the company of a man and quicker than my mind could follow his argument he whipped a colt s automatic from under his left arm and pumped six bullets into the body that the brown dress covered the brown dress with the lace collar and cuffs and the accordion plaited skirt the young person in the dark sack suit from whose head and from whose life a woman s glory had been clipped laid her head on her arms stretched upon the table while people came running to raise ben tatum from the floor in his feminine masquerade that had given sam the opportunity to set aside technically the obliga tions of the code suite homes and their romance few young couples in the big city of bluff began their married existence with greater promise of happiness than did mr and mrs claude turpin they felt no especial animosity toward each other they were comfort ably established in a handsome apartment house that had a name and accommodations like those of a sleeping car they were living as expensively as the couple on the next floor above who had twice their income and their marriage had occurred on a wager a ferry boat and first acquaintance thus securing a sensational newspaper notice with their names attached to pictures of the queen of roumania and m santos dumont turpin s income was per month on pay day after calculating the amounts due for rent instalments on furniture and piano gas and bills owed to the florist confectioner milliner tailor wine merchant and cab company the turpins would find that they still had left to spend how to do this is one of the secrets of metropolitan life the domestic life of the turpins was a beautiful picture to see but you couldn t gaze upon it as you could at an oleograph of don t wake grandma or brook lyn by moonlight you had to blink when looked at it and you heard a fizzing sound just like the machine with a scope at the end of it yes there wasn t much repose about the picture of the turpins domestic life it was something like spearing salmon in the columbia river or jap anese artillery in action every day was just like another as the days are in new york in the morning turpin would take bromo seltzer his pocket change from under the clock his hat no breakfast and his departure for the office at noon mrs turpin would get out of bed and humour put on a kimono airs and the water to boil for coffee turpin lunched downtown he came home at to dress for dinner they always dined out they strayed from the chop

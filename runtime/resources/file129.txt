about to be off again scouting ahead of the slow ranks of fortune but now they would take different ways there were rumors of a promising uprising in peru and thither the martial clancy would turn his adventurous steps as for keogh he was figuring in his mind and on quires of government letter heads a scheme that dwarfed the art of misrepresenting the human countenance upon tin what suits me keogh used to say in the way of a business proposition is something diversified that looks like a longer shot than it is something in the way of a genteel graft that isn t worked enough for the correspondence schools to be teaching it by mail i take the long end but i like to have at least as good a chance to win as a man learning to play poker on an ocean steamer or running for governor of texas on the republican ticket and when i cash in my winnings i don t want to find any widows and orphans chips in my stack the grass grown globe was the green table on which keogh gambled the games he played were of his own invention he was no grubber after the diffident dollar nor did he care to follow it with horn and hounds rather he loved to coax it with egregious and brilliant flies from its habitat in the waters of strange streams yet keogh was a business man and his schemes in spite of their singularity were as solidly set as the plans of a building contractor in arthur s time sir william keogh would have been a knight of the round table in these modern days he rides abroad seeking the graft instead of the grail three days after johnny s departure two small schooners appeared off coralio after some delay a boat put off from one of them and brought a sunburned young man ashore this young man had a shrewd and calculating eye and he gazed with amazement at the strange things that he saw he found on the beach some one who directed him to the consul s office and thither he made his way at a nervous gait keogh was sprawled in the official chair drawing caricatures of his uncle s head on an official pad of paper he looked up at his visitor where s johnny atwood inquired the sunburned young man in a business tone gone said keogh working carefully at uncle sam s necktie that s just like him remarked the nut brown one leaning against the table he always was a fellow to gallivant around instead of tending to business will he be in soon don t think so said keogh after a fair amount of deliberation i s pose he s out at some of his tomfoolery conjectured the visitor in a tone of virtuous conviction johnny never would stick to anything long enough to succeed i wonder how he manages to run his business here and never be round to look after it i m looking after the business just now admitted the pro term consul are you then say where s the factory what factory asked keogh with a mildly polite interest why the factory where they use them cockleburrs lord knows what they use em for anyway i ve got the basements of both them ships out there loaded with em i ll give you a bargain in this lot i ve had every man woman and child around dalesburg that wasn t busy pickin em for a month i hired these ships to bring em over everybody thought i was crazy now you can have this lot for fifteen cents a pound delivered on land and if you want more i guess old alabam can come up to the demand johnny told me when he left home that if he struck anything down here that there was any money in he d let me in on it shall i drive the ships in and hitch a look of supreme almost incredulous delight dawned in keogh s ruddy countenance he dropped his pencil his eyes turned upon the sunburned young man with joy in them mingled with fear lest his ecstasy should prove a dream for god s sake tell me said keogh earnestly are you dink pawson my name is pinkney dawson said the cornerer of the cockleburr market billy keogh slid rapturously and gently from his chair to his favorite strip of matting on the floor there were not many sounds in coralio on that sultry afternoon among those that were may be mentioned a noise of enraptured and unrighteous laughter from a prostrate irish american while a sunburned young man with a shrewd eye looked on him with wonder and amazement also the tramp tramp tramp of many well shod feet in the streets outside also the lonesome wash of the waves that beat along the historic shores of the spanish main xiv masters of arts a two inch stub of a blue pencil was the wand with which keogh performed the preliminary acts of his magic so with this he covered paper with diagrams and figures while he waited for the united states of america to send down to coralio a successor to atwood resigned the new scheme that his mind had conceived his stout heart indorsed and his blue pencil corroborated was laid around the characteristics and human frailties of the new president ofanchuria these characteristics and the situation out of which keogh hoped to wrest a golden tribute deserve chronicling contributive to the clear order of events president losada many called him dictator was a man whose genius would have made him conspicuous even among anglo saxons had not that genius been intermixed with other traits that were petty and subversive he had some of the lofty patriotism of washington the man he most admired the force of napoleon and much of the wisdom of the

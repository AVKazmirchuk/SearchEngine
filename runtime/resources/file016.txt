in pales why yes uncle emsley i says out loud i d be awful edified to meet miss learight so uncle emsley took me out in the yard and gave us each other s entitlements i never was shy about women i never could understand why some men who can break a mustang before breakfast and shave in the dark get all left handed and full of perspiration and excuses when they see a bold of calico draped around what belongs to it inside of eight minutes me and miss willella was aggravating the croquet balls around as amiable as second cousins she gave me a dig about the quantity of canned fruit i had eaten and i got back at her flat footed about how a certain lady named eve started the fruit trouble in the first free grass pasture over in palestine wasn t it says i as easy and pat as roping a one year old that was how i acquired cordiality for the proximities of miss willella learight and the disposition grew larger as time passed she was stopping at pimienta crossing for her health which was very good and for the climate which was forty per cent hotter than palestine i rode over to see her once every week for a while and then i figured it out that if i doubled the number of trips i would see her twice as often one week i slipped in a third trip and that s where the pancakes and the pink eyed snoozer busted into the game that evening while i set on the counter with a peach and two damsons in my mouth i asked uncle emsley how miss willella was why says uncle emsley she s gone riding with jackson bird the sheep man from over at mired mule canada i swallowed the peach seed and the two damson seeds i guess somebody held the counter by the bridle while i got off and then i walked out straight ahead till i butted against the mesquite where my roan was tied she s gone riding i whisper in my bronc s ear with birdstone jack the hired mule from sheep man s canada did you get that old leather and gallops that bronc of mine wept in his way he d been raised a cow pony and he didn t care for snoozers i went back and said to uncle emsley did you say a sheep man i said a sheep man says uncle emsley again you must have heard tell of jackson bird he s got eight sections of grazing and four thousand head of the finest merinos south of the arctic circle i went out and sat on the ground in the shade of the store and leaned against a prickly pear i sifted sand into my boots with unthinking hands while i soliloquised a quantity about this bird with the jackson plumage to his name i never had believed in harming sheep men i see one one day reading a latin grammar on hossback and i never touched him they never irritated me like they do most cowmen you wouldn t go to work now and impair and disfigure snoozers would you that eat on tables and wear little shoes and speak to you on subjects i had always let em pass just as you would a jack rabbit with a polite word and a guess about the weather but no stopping to swap canteens i never thought it was worth while to be hostile with a snoozer and because i d been lenient and let em live here was one going around riding with miss willella learight an hour by sun they come loping back and stopped at uncle emsley s gate the sheep person helped her off and they stood throwing each other sentences all sprightful and sagacious for a while and then this feathered jackson flies up in his saddle and raises his little stewpot of a hat and trots off in the direction of his mutton ranch by this time i had turned the sand out of my boots and unpinned myself from the prickly pear and by the time he gets half a mile out of pimienta i singlefoots up beside him on my bronc i said that snoozer was pink eyed but he wasn t his seeing arrangement was grey enough but his eye lashes was pink and his hair was sandy and that gave you the idea sheep man he wasn t more than a lamb man anyhow a little thing with his neck involved in a yellow silk handkerchief and shoes tied up in bowknots afternoon says i to him you now ride with a equestrian who is commonly called dead moral certainty judson on account of the way i shoot when i want a stranger to know me i always introduce myself before the draw for i never did like to shake hands with ghosts ah says he just like that ah i m glad to know you mr judson i m jackson bird from over at mired mule ranch just then one of my eyes saw a roadrunner skipping down the hill with a young tarantula in his bill and the other eye noticed a rabbit hawk sitting on a dead limb in a water elm i popped over one after the other with my forty five just to show him two out of three says i birds just naturally seem to draw my fire wherever i go nice shooting says the sheep man without a flutter but don t you sometimes ever miss the third shot elegant fine rain that was last week for the young grass mr judson says he willie says i riding over close to his palfrey your infatuated parents may have denounced you by the name of jackson but you sure moulted into a twittering willie let us slough off this here analysis of rain and

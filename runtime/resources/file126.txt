alive she was gazing at the strange scenes around her with amused interest there was a faint blush upon her round cheek as she greeted her old admirer mr hemstetter shook hands with johnny in a very friendly way he was an oldish impractical man one of that numerous class of erratic business men who are forever dissatisfied and seeking a change i am very glad to see you john may i call you john he said let me thank you for your prompt answer to our postmaster s letter of inquiry he volunteered to write to you on my behalf i was looking about for something different in the way of a business in which the profits would be greater i had noticed in the papers that this coast was receiving much attention from investors i am extremely grateful for your advice to come i sold out everything that i possess and invested the proceeds in as fine a stock of shoes as could be bought in the north you have a picturesque town here john i hope business will be as good as your letter justifies me in expecting johnny s agony was abbreviated by the arrival of keogh who hurried up with the news that mrs goodwin would be much pleased to place rooms at the disposal of mr hemstetter and his daughter so there mr hemstetter and rosine were at once conducted and left to recuperate from the fatigue of the voyage while johnny went down to see that the cases of shoes were safely stored in the customs warehouse pending their examination by the officials keogh grinning like a shark skirmished about to find goodwin to instruct him not to expose to mr hemstetter the true state of coralio as a shoe market until johnny had been given a chance to redeem the situation if such a thing were possible that night the consul and keogh held a desperate consultation on the breezy porch of the consulate send em back home began keogh reading johnny s thoughts i would said johnny after a little silence but i ve been lying to you billy all right about that said keogh affably i ve told you hundreds of times said johnny slowly that i had forgotten that girl haven t i about three hundred and seventy five admitted the monument of patience i lied repeated the consul every time i never forgot her for one moment i was an obstinate ass for running away just because she said no once and i was too proud a fool to go back i talked with rosine a few minutes this evening up at goodwin s i found out one thing you remember that farmer fellow who was always after her dink pawson asked keogh pink dawson well he wasn t a hill of beans to her she says she didn t believe a word of the things be told her about me but i m sewed up now billy that tomfool letter we sent ruined whatever chance i had left she ll despise me when she finds out that her old father has been made the victim of a joke that a decent schoolboy wouldn t have been guilty of shoes why he couldn t sell twenty pairs of shoes in coralio if he kept store here for twenty years you put a pair of shoes on one of these caribs or spanish brown boys and what d he do stand on his head and squeal until he d kicked em off none of em ever wore shoes and they never will if i send em back home i ll have to tell the whole story and what ll she think of me i want that girl worse than ever billy and now when she s in reach i ve lost her forever because i tried to be funny when the thermometer was at keep cheerful said the optimistic keogh and let em open the store i ve been busy myself this afternoon we can stir up a temporary boom in foot gear anyhow i ll buy six pairs when the doors open i ve been around and seen all the fellows and explained the catastrophe they ll all buy shoes like they was centipedes frank goodwin will take cases of em the geddies want about eleven pairs between em clancy is going to invest

proposition anywhere i ll land on it if there isn t there ll be another wreck to the credit of the gorgeous tropics keogh left feeling that he could be of no use johnny laid a handful of cigars on a table and stretched himself in a steamer chair when the sudden daylight broke silvering the harbor ripples he was still sitting there then he got up whistling a little tune and took his bath at nine o clock he walked down to the dingy little cable office and hung for half an hour over a blank the result of his application was the following message which he signed and had transmitted at a cost of to

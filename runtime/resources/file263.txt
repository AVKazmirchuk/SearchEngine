seventy ninth massachusetts volunteers returned to the ninety seventh alabama zouaves the battle flag of lundy s lane which they bought at a second hand store in chelsea kept by a man named skzchnzski georgia sent the president a sixty pound watermelon and that brings us up to the time when the story begins my but that was sparring for an opening i really must brush op on my aristotle the yankee carterets went into business in new york long before the war their house as far as leather belting and mill supplies was concerned was as musty and arrogant and solid as one of those old east india tea importing concerns that you read about in dickens there were some rumors of a war behind its counters but not enough to affect the business during and after the war blandford carteret f f v lost his plantations juleps marksmanship and life he bequeathed little more than his pride to his surviving family so it came to pass that blandford carteret the fifth aged fifteen was invited by the leather and millsupplies branch of that name to come north and learn business instead of hunting foxes and boasting of the glory of his fathers on the reduced acres of his impoverished family the boy jumped at the chance and at the age of twenty five sat in the office of the firm equal partner with john the fifth of the blunderbuss and turkey branch here the story begins again the young men were about the same age smooth of face alert easy of manner and with an air that promised mental and physical quickness they were razored blue serged straw hatted and pearl stick pinned like other young new yorkers who might be millionaires or bill clerks one afternoon at four o clock in the private office of the firm blandford carteret opened a letter that a clerk had just brought to his desk after reading it he chuckled audibly for nearly a minute john looked around from his desk inquiringly it s from mother said blandford i ll read you the funny part of it she tells me all the neighborhood news first of course and then cautions me against getting my feet wet and musical comedies after that come some vital statistics about calves and pigs and an estimate of the wheat crop and now i ll quote some and what do you think old uncle jake who was seventy six last wednesday must go travelling nothing would do but he must go to new york and see his young marster blandford old as he is he has a deal of common sense so i ve let him go i couldn t refuse him he seemed to have concentrated all his hopes and desires into this one adventure into the wide world you know he was born on the plantation and has never been ten miles away from it in his life and he was your father s body servant during the war and has been always a faithful vassal and servant of the family he has often seen the gold watch the watch that was your father s and your father s father s i told him it was to be yours and he begged me to allow him to take it to you and to put it into your hands himself so he has it carefully inclosed in a buck skin case and is bringing it to you with all the pride and importance of a king s messenger i gave him money for the round trip and for a two weeks stay in the city i wish you would see to it that he gets comfortable quarters jake won t need much looking after he s able to take care of himself but i have read in the papers that african bishops and colored potentates generally have much trouble in obtaining food and lodging in the yankee metropolis that may be all right but i don t see why the best hotel there shouldn t take jake in still i suppose it s a rule i gave him full directions about finding you and packed his valise myself you won t have to bother with him but i do hope you ll see that he is made comfortable take the watch that he brings you it s almost a decoration it has been worn by true carterets and there isn t a stain upon it nor a false movement of the wheels bringing it to you is the crowning joy of old jake s life i wanted him to have that little outing and that happiness before it is too late you have often heard us talk about how jake pretty badly wounded himself crawled through the reddened grass at chancellorsville to where your father lay with the bullet in his dear heart and took the watch from his pocket to keep it from the yanks so my son when the old man comes consider him as a frail but worthy messenger from the old time life and home you have been so long away from home and so long among the people that we have always regarded as aliens that i m not sure that jake will know you when he sees you but jake has a keen perception and i rather believe that he will know a virginia carteret at sight i can t conceive that even ten years in yankee land could change a boy of mine anyhow i m sure you will know jake i put eighteen collars in his valise if he should have to buy others he wears a number please see that he gets the right ones he will be no trouble to you at all if you are not too busy i d like for you to find him a place to board where they have white meal corn bread and try to keep him from taking

your word and honour on my word and honour repeated vivienne softly at the door he turned and gazed at her happily but yet as one who scarcely trusts the foundations of his joy to morrow he said with a forefinger of reminder uplifted to morrow she repeated with a smile of truth and candour in an hour and forty minutes hartley stepped off the train at floralhurst a brisk walk of ten minutes brought him to the gate of a handsome two story cottage set upon a wide and well tended lawn halfway to the house he was met by a woman with jet black braided hair and flowing white summer gown who half strangled him without apparent cause when they stepped into the hall she said mamma s here the auto is coming for her in half an hour she came to dinner but there s no dinner i ve something to tell you said hartley i thought to break it to you gently but since your mother is here we may as well out with it he stooped and whispered something at her ear his wife screamed her mother came running

watery circle back to the same port again the truly great return at the high tide of their attainments to the simplicity of a child the billionaire sits down at his mahogany to his bowl of bread and milk when you reach the end of your career just take down the sign goal and look at the other side of it you will find beginning point there it has been reversed while you were going around the track

front door of their city house carefully deposited their cat on the sidewalk instructed the caretaker not to allow it to eat any of the ivy on the walls and whizzed away in a horse power to fishampton to stray alone the shade amaryllis not being in their class if a subscriber to the toadies magazine you have often you say you are not well you buy it at a news stand thinking that the newsdealer is not wise to you but he knows about it all he knows he knows i say that you have often seen in the toadies magazine pictures of the van plushvelts summer home so it will not be described here our business is with young haywood van plushvelt sixteen years old heir to the century of millions darling of the financial gods and great grandson of peter van plushvelt former owner of a particularly fine cabbage patch that has been ruined by an intrusive lot of downtown skyscrapers one afternoon young haywood van plushvelt strolled out between the granite gate posts of dolce far niente that s

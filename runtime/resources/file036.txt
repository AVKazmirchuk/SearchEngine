night six cowpunchers of the cibolo ranch were waiting around the door of the ranch store their ponies cropped grass near by tied in the texas fashion which is not tied at all their bridle reins had been dropped to the earth which is a more effectual way of securing them such is the power of habit and imagination than you could devise out of a half inch rope and a live oak tree these guardians of the cow lounged about each with a brown cigarette paper in his hand and gently but unceasingly cursed sam revell the storekeeper sam stood in the door snapping the red elastic bands on his pink madras shirtsleeves and looking down affectionately at the only pair of tan shoes within a forty mile radius his offence had been serious and he was divided between humble apology and admiration for the beauty of his raiment he had allowed the ranch stock of smoking to become exhausted i thought sure there was another case of it under the counter boys he explained but it happened to be catterdges you

rodgers i ll wait too the tobaccoless punchers arranged themselves comfortably on the steps of the store inside sam chopped open with a hatchet the tops of the cans of fruit the store a big white wooden building like a barn stood fifty yards from the ranch house beyond it were the horse corrals and still farther the wool sheds and the brush topped shearing pens for the rancho cibolo raised both cattle and sheep behind the store at a little distance were the grass thatched jacals of the mexicans who bestowed their allegiance upon the cibolo the ranch house was composed of four large rooms with plastered adobe walls and a two room wooden ell a twenty feet wide gallery circumvented the structure it was set in a grove of immense live oaks and water elms near a lake a long not very wide and tremendously deep lake in which at nightfall great gars leaped to the surface and plunged with the noise of hippopotamuses frolicking at their bath from the trees hung garlands and massive pendants of the melancholy grey moss of the south indeed the cibolo ranch house seemed more of the south than of the west it looked as if old kiowa truesdell might have brought it with him from the lowlands of mississippi when he came to texas with his rifle in the hollow of his arm in but though he did not bring the family mansion truesdell did bring something in the way of a family inheritance that was more lasting than brick or stone he brought one end of the truesdell curtis family feud and when a curtis bought the rancho de los olmos sixteen miles from the cibolo there were lively times on the pear flats and in the chaparral thickets off the southwest in those days truesdell cleaned the brush of many a wolf and tiger cat and mexican lion and one or two curtises fell heirs to notches on his rifle stock also he buried a brother with a curtis bullet in him on the bank of the lake at cibolo and then the kiowa indians made their last raid upon the ranches between the frio and the rio grande and truesdell at the head of his rangers rid the earth of them

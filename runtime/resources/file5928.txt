they used to powder up in and so forth downstairs we that is the san augustine social cotillion and merrymakers club had a stretcher put down in the parlor where our dance was going on willie robbins and me happened to be up in our cloak room i believe we called it when myra allison skipped through the hall on her way down stairs from the girls room willie was standing before the mirror deeply interested in smoothing down the blond grass plot on his head which seemed to give him lots of trouble myra was always full of life and devilment she stopped and stuck her head in our door she certainly was good looking but i knew how joe granberry stood with her so did willie but he kept on ba a a ing after her and following her around he had a system of persistence that didn t coincide with pale hair and light eyes hello willie says myra what are you doing to yourself in the glass i m trying to look fly says willie well you never could be fly says myra with her special laugh which was the provokingest sound i ever heard except the rattle of an empty canteen against my saddle horn i looked around at willie after myra had gone he had a kind of a lily white look on him which seemed to show that her remark had as you might say disrupted his soul i never noticed anything in what she said that sounded particularly destructive to a man s ideas of self consciousness but he was set back to an extent you could scarcely imagine after we went down stairs with our clean collars on willie never went near myra again that night after all he seemed to be a diluted kind of a skim milk sort of a chap and i never wondered that joe granberry beat him out the next day the battleship maine was blown up and then pretty soon somebody i reckon it was joe bailey or ben tillman or maybe the government declared war against spain well everybody south of mason hamlin s line knew that the north by itself couldn t whip a whole country the size of spain so the yankees commenced to holler for help and the johnny rebs answered the call we re coming father william a hundred thousand strong and then some was the way they sang it and the old party lines drawn by sherman s march and the kuklux and nine cent cotton and the jim crow street car ordinances faded away we became one undivided country with no north very little east a good sized chunk of west and a south that loomed up as big as the first foreign label on a new eight dollar suit case of course the dogs of war weren t a complete pack without a yelp from the san augustine rifles company d of the fourteenth texas regiment our company was among the first to land in cuba and strike terror into the hearts of the foe i m not going to give you a history of the war i m just dragging it in to fill out my story about willie robbins just as the republican party dragged it in to help out the election in if anybody ever had heroitis it was that willie robbins from the minute he set foot on the soil of the tyrants of castile he seemed to engulf danger as a cat laps up cream he certainly astonished every man in our company from the captain up you d have expected him to gravitate naturally to the job of an orderly to the colonel or typewriter in the commissary but not any he created the part of the flaxen haired boy hero who lives and gets back home with the goods instead of dying with an important despatch in his hands at his colonel s feet our company got into a section of cuban scenery where one of the messiest and most unsung portions of the campaign occurred we were out every day capering around in the bushes and having little skirmishes with the spanish troops that looked more like kind of tired out feuds than anything else the war was a joke to us and of no interest to them we never could see it any other way than as a howling farce comedy that the san augustine rifles were actually fighting to uphold the stars and stripes and the blamed little senors didn t get enough pay to make them care whether they were patriots or traitors now and then somebody would get killed it seemed like a waste of life to me i was at coney island when i went to new york once and one of them down hill skidding apparatuses they call roller coasters flew the track and killed a man in a brown sack suit whenever the spaniards shot one of our men it struck me as just about as unnecessary and regrettable as that was but i m dropping willie robbins out of the conversation he was out for bloodshed laurels ambition medals recommendations and all other forms of military glory and he didn t seem to be afraid of any of the recognized forms of military danger such as spaniards cannon balls canned beef gunpowder or nepotism he went forth with his pallid hair and china blue eyes and ate up spaniards like you would sardines a la canopy wars and rumbles of wars never flustered him he would stand guard duty mosquitoes hardtack treat and fire with equally perfect unanimity no blondes in history ever come in comparison distance of him except the jack of diamonds and queen catherine of russia i remember one time a little caballard of spanish men sauntered out from behind a patch of sugar cane and shot bob turner the first sergeant of our company while we were eating dinner as required by the army regulations we fellows went through the usual tactics of falling into line saluting the enemy and loading and firing kneeling that wasn t the texas way of scrapping but being a very important addendum and annex to the regular army the san augustine rifles had to conform to the red tape system of getting even by the time we had got out our upton s tactics turned to page fifty seven said one two three one two three a couple of times and got blank cartridges into our springfields the spanish outfit had smiled repeatedly rolled and lit cigarettes by squads and walked away contemptuously i went straight to captain floyd and says to him sam i don t think this war is a straight game you know as well as i do that bob turner was one of the whitest fellows that ever threw a leg over a saddle and now these wirepullers in washington have fixed his clock he s politically and ostensibly dead it ain t fair why should they keep this thing up if they want spain licked why don t they turn the san augustine rifles and joe seely s ranger company and a car load of west texas deputy sheriffs onto these spaniards and let us exonerate them from the face of the earth i never did says i care much about fighting by the lord chesterfield ring rules i m going to hand in my resignation and go home if anybody else i am personally acquainted with gets hurt in this war if you can get somebody in my place sam says i i ll quit the first of next week i don t want to work in an army that don t give its help a chance never mind my wages says i let the secretary of the treasury keep em well ben says the captain to me your allegations and estimations of the tactics of war government patriotism guard mounting and democracy are all right but i ve looked into the system of international arbitration and the ethics of justifiable slaughter a little closer maybe than you have now you can hand in your resignation the first of next week if you are so minded but if you do says sam i ll order a corporal s guard to take you over by that limestone bluff on the creek and shoot enough lead into you to ballast a submarine air ship i m captain of this company and i ve swore allegiance to the amalgamated states regardless of sectional secessional and congressional differences have you got any smoking tobacco winds up sam mine got wet when i swum the creek this morning the reason i drag all this non ex parte evidence in is because willie robbins was standing there listening to us i was a second sergeant and he was a private then but among us texans and westerners there never was as much tactics and subordination as there was in the regular army we never called our captain anything but sam except when there was a lot of major generals and admirals around so as to preserve the discipline and says willie robbins to me in a sharp construction of voice much unbecoming to his light hair and previous record you ought to be shot ben for emitting any such sentiments a man that won t fight for his country is worse than a horse thief if i was the cap i d put you in the guard house for thirty days on round steak and tamales war says willie is great and glorious i didn t know you were a coward i m not says i if i was i d knock some of the pallidness off of your marble brow i m lenient with you i says just as i am with the spaniards because you have always reminded me of something with mushrooms on the side why you little lady of shalott says i you underdone leader of cotillions you glassy fashion and moulded form you white pine soldier made in the cisalpine alps in germany for the late new year trade do you know of whom you are talking to we ve been in the same social circle says i and i ve put up with you because you seemed so meek and self un satisfying i don t understand why you have so sudden taken a personal interest in chivalrousness and murder your nature s undergone a complete revelation now how is it well you wouldn t understand ben says willie giving one of his refined smiles and turning away come back here says i catching him by the tail of his khaki coat you ve made me kind of mad in spite of the aloofness in which i have heretofore held you you are out for making a success in this hero business and i believe i know what for you are doing it either because you are crazy or because you expect to catch some girl by it now if it s a girl i ve got something here to show you i wouldn t have done it but i was plumb mad i pulled a san augustine paper out of my hip pocket and showed him an item it was a half a column about the marriage of myra allison and joe granberry willie laughed and i saw i hadn t touched him oh says he everybody knew that was going to happen i heard about that a week ago and then he gave me the laugh again all right says i then why do you so recklessly chase the bright rainbow of fame do you expect to be elected president or do you belong to a suicide club and then captain sam interferes you gentlemen quit jawing and go back to your quarters says he or i ll have you escorted to the guard house now scat both of you before you go which one of you has got any chewing tobacco we re off sam says i it s supper time anyhow but what do you think of what we was talking about i ve noticed you throwing out a good many grappling hooks for this here balloon called fame what s ambition anyhow what does a man risk his life day after day for do you know of anything he gets in the end that can pay him for the trouble i want to go back home says i i don t care whether cuba sinks or swims and i don t give a pipeful of rabbit tobacco whether queen sophia christina or charlie culberson rules these fairy isles and i don t want my name on any list except the list of survivors but i ve noticed you sam says i seeking the bubble notoriety in the cannon s larynx a number of times now what do you do it for is it ambition business or some freckle faced pheebe at home that you are heroing for well ben says sam kind of hefting his sword out from between his knees as your superior officer i could court martial you for attempted cowardice and desertion but i won t and i ll tell you why i m trying for promotion and the usual honors of war and conquest a major gets more pay than a captain and i need the money correct for you says i i can understand that your system of fame seeking is rooted in the deepest soil of patriotism but i can t comprehend says i why willie robbins whose folks at home are well off and who used to be as meek and undesirous of notice as a cat with cream on his whiskers should all at once develop into a warrior bold with the most fire eating kind of proclivities and the girl in his case seems to have been eliminated by marriage to another fellow i reckon says i it s a plain case of just common ambition he wants his name maybe to go thundering down the coroners of time it must be that well without itemizing his deeds willie sure made good as a hero he simply spent most of his time on his knees begging our captain to send him on forlorn hopes and dangerous scouting expeditions in every fight he was the first man to mix it at close quarters with the don alfonsos he got three or four bullets planted in various parts of his autonomy once he went off with a detail of eight men and captured a whole company of spanish he kept captain floyd busy writing out recommendations of his bravery to send in to head quarters and he began to accumulate medals for all kinds of things heroism and target shooting and valor and tactics and uninsubordination and all the little accomplishments that look good to the third assistant secretaries of the war department finally cap floyd got promoted to be a major general or a knight commander of the main herd or something like that he pounded around on a white horse all desecrated up with gold leaf and hen feathers and a good templar s hat and wasn t allowed by the regulations to speak to us and willie robbins was made captain of our company and maybe he didn t go after the wreath of fame then as far as i could see it was him that ended the war he got eighteen of us boys friends of his too killed in battles that he stirred up himself and that didn t seem to me necessary at all one night he took twelve of us and waded through a little nil about a hundred and ninety yards wide and climbed a couple of mountains and sneaked through a mile of neglected shrubbery and a couple of rock quarries and into a rye straw village and captured a spanish general named as they said benny veedus benny seemed to me hardly worth the trouble being a blackish man without shoes or cuffs and anxious to surrender and throw himself on the commissary of his foe but that job gave willie the big boost he wanted the san augustine news and the galveston st louis new york and kansas city papers printed his picture and columns of stuff about him old san augustine simply went crazy over its gallant son the news had an editorial tearfully begging the government to call off the regular army and the national guard and let willie carry on the rest of the war single handed it said that a refusal to do so would be regarded as a proof that the northern jealousy of the south was still as rampant as ever if the war hadn t ended pretty soon i don t know to what heights of gold braid and encomiums willie would have climbed but it did there was a secession of hostilities just three days after he was appointed a colonel and got in three more medals by registered mail and shot two spaniards while they were drinking lemonade in an ambuscade our company went back to san augustine when the war was over there wasn t anywhere else for it to go and what do you think the old town notified us in print by wire cable special delivery and a nigger named saul sent on a gray mule to san antone that they was going to give us the biggest blow out complimentary alimentary and elementary that ever disturbed the kildees on the sand flats outside of the immediate contiguity of the city i say we but it was all meant for ex private captain de facto and colonel elect willie robbins the town was crazy about him they notified us that the reception they were going to put up would make the mardi gras in new orleans look like an afternoon tea in bury st edmunds with a curate s aunt well the san augustine rifles got back home on schedule time everybody was at the depot giving forth roosevelt democrat they used to be called rebel yells there was two brass bands and the mayor and schoolgirls in white frightening the street car horses by throwing cherokee roses in the streets and well maybe you ve seen a celebration by a town that was inland and out of water they wanted brevet colonel willie to get into a carriage and be drawn by prominent citizens and some of the city aldermen to the armory but he stuck to his company and marched at the head of it up sam houston avenue the buildings on both sides was covered with flags and audiences and everybody hollered robbins or hello willie as we marched up in files of fours i never saw a illustriouser looking human in my life than willie was he had at least seven or eight medals and diplomas and decorations on the breast of his khaki coat he was sunburnt the color of a saddle and he certainly done himself proud they told us at the depot that the courthouse was to be illuminated at half past seven and there would be speeches and chili con came at the palace hotel miss delphine thompson was to read an original poem by james whitcomb ryan and constable hooker had promised us a salute of nine guns from chicago that he had arrested that day after we had disbanded in the armory willie says to me want to walk out a piece with me why yes says i if it ain t so far that we can t hear the tumult and the shouting die away i m hungry myself says i and i m pining for some home grub but i ll go with you willie steered me down some side streets till we came to a little white cottage in a new lot with a twenty by thirty foot lawn decorated with brickbats and old barrel staves halt and give the countersign says i to willie don t you know this dugout it s the bird s nest that joe granberry built before he married myra allison what you going there for but willie already had the gate open he walked up the brick walk to the steps and i went with him myra was sitting in a rocking chair on the porch sewing her hair was smoothed back kind of hasty and tied in a knot i never noticed till then that she had freckles joe was at one side of the porch in his shirtsleeves with no collar on and no signs of a shave trying to scrape out a hole among the brickbats and tin cans to plant a little fruit tree in he looked up but never said a word and neither did myra willie was sure dandy looking in his uniform with medals strung on his breast and his new gold handled sword you d never have taken him for the little white headed snipe that the girls used to order about and make fun of he just stood there for a minute looking at myra with a peculiar little smile on his face and then he says to her slow and kind of holding on to his words with his teeth oh i don t know maybe i could if i tried that was all that was said willie raised his hat and we walked away and somehow when he said that i remembered all of a sudden the night of that dance and willie brushing his hair before the looking glass and myra sticking her head in the door to guy him when we got back to sam houston avenue willie says well so long ben i m going down home and get off my shoes and take a rest you says i what s the matter with you ain t the court house jammed with everybody in town waiting to honor the hero and two brass bands and recitations and flags and jags and grub to follow waiting for you willie sighs all right ben says he darned if i didn t forget all about that and that s why i say concluded ben granger that you can t tell where ambition begins any more than you can where it is going to wind up the head hunter when the war between spain and george dewey was over i went to the philippine islands there i remained as bushwhacker correspondent for my paper until its managing editor notified me that an eight hundred word cablegram describing the grief of a pet carabao over the death of an infant moro was not considered by the office to be war news so i resigned and came home on board the trading vessel that brought me back i pondered much upon the strange things i had sensed in the weird archipelago of the yellow brown people the manoeuvres and skirmishings of the petty war interested me not i was spellbound by the outlandish and unreadable countenance of that race that had turned its expressionless gaze upon us out of an unguessable past particularly during my stay in mindanao had i been fascinated and attracted by that delightfully original tribe of heathen known as the head hunters those grim flinty relentless little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed presence paralleling the trail of their prey through unmapped forests across perilous mountain tops adown bottomless chasms into uninhabitable jungles always near with the invisible hand of death uplifted betraying their pursuit only by such signs as a beast or a bird or a gliding serpent might make a twig crackling in the awful sweat soaked night a drench of dew showering from the screening foliage of a giant tree a whisper at even from the rushes of a water level a hint of death for every mile and every hour they amused me greatly those little fellows of one idea when you think of it their method is beautifully and almost hilariously effective and simple you have your hut in which you live and carry out the destiny that was decreed for you spiked to the jamb of your bamboo doorway is a basket made of green withes plaited from time to time as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move you you creep forth with your snickersnee and take up the silent trail back from it you come triumphant bearing the severed gory head of your victim which you deposit with pardonable pride in the basket at the side of your door it may be the head of your enemy your friend or a stranger according as competition jealousy or simple sportiveness has been your incentive to labor in any case your reward is certain the village men in passing stop to congratulate you as your neighbor on weaker planes of life stops to admire and praise the begonias in your front yard your particular brown maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft tiger s eyes at the evidence of your love for her you chew betel nut and listen content to the intermittent soft drip from the ends of the severed neck arteries and you show your teeth and grunt like a water buffalo which is as near as you can come to laughing at the thought that the cold acephalous body of your door ornament is being spotted by wheeling vultures in the mindanaoan wilds truly the life of the merry head hunter captivated me he had reduced art and philosophy to a simple code to take your adversary s head to basket it at the portal of your castle to see it lying there a dead thing with its cunning and stratagems and power gone is there a better way to foil his plots to refute his arguments to establish your superiority over his skill and wisdom the ship that brought me home was captained by an erratic swede who changed his course and deposited me with genuine compassion in a small town on the pacific coast of one of the central american republics a few hundred miles south of the port to which he had engaged to convey me but i was wearied of movement and exotic fancies so i leaped contentedly upon the firm sands of the village of mojada telling myself i should be sure to find there the rest that i craved after all far better to linger there i thought lulled by the sedative plash of the waves and the rustling of palm fronds than to sit upon the horsehair sofa of my parental home in the east and there cast down by currant wine and cake and scourged by fatuous relatives drivel into the ears of gaping neighbors sad stories of the death of colonial governors when i first saw chloe greene she was standing all in white in the doorway of her father s tile roofed dobe house she was polishing a silver cup with a cloth and she looked like a pearl laid against black velvet she turned on me a flatteringly protracted but a wiltingly disapproving gaze and then went inside humming a light song to indicate the value she placed upon my existence small wonder for dr stamford the most disreputable professional man between juneau and valparaiso and i were zigzagging along the turfy street tunelessly singing the words of auld lang syne to the air of muzzer s little coal black coon we had come from the ice factory which was mojada s palace of wickedness where we had been playing billiards and opening black bottles white with frost that we dragged with strings out of old sandoval s ice cold vats i turned in sudden rage to dr stamford as sober as the verger of a cathedral in a moment i had become aware that we were swine cast before a pearl you beast i said this is half your doing and the other half is the fault of this cursed country i d better have gone back to sleepy town and died in a wild orgy of currant wine and buns than to have had this happen stamford filled the empty street with his roaring laughter you too he cried and all as quick as the popping of a cork well she does seem to strike agreeably upon the retina but don t burn your fingers all mojada will tell you that louis devoe is the man we will see about that said i and perhaps whether he is a man as well as the man i lost no time in meeting louis devoe that was easily accomplished for the foreign colony in mojada numbered scarce a dozen and they gathered daily at a half decent hotel kept by a turk where they managed to patch together the fluttering rags of country and civilization that were left them i sought devoe before i did my pearl of the doorway because i had learned a little of the game of war and knew better than to strike for a prize before testing the strength of the enemy a sort of cold dismay something akin to fear filled me when i had estimated him i found a man so perfectly poised so charming so deeply learned in the world s rituals so full of tact courtesy and hospitality so endowed with grace and ease and a kind of careless haughty power that i almost overstepped the bounds in probing him in turning him on the spit to find the weak point that i so craved for him to have but i left him whole i had to make bitter acknowledgment to myself that louis devoe was a gentleman worthy of my best blows and i swore to give him them he was a great merchant of the country a wealthy importer and exporter all day he sat in a fastidiously appointed office surrounded by works of art and evidences of his high culture directing through glass doors and windows the affairs of his house in person he was slender and hardly tall his small well shaped head was covered with thick brown hair trimmed short and he wore a thick brown beard also cut close and to a fine point his manners were a pattern before long i had become a regular and a welcome visitor at the greene home i shook my wild habits from me like a worn out cloak i trained for the conflict with the care of a prize fighter and the self denial of a brahmin as for chloe greene i shall weary you with no sonnets to her eyebrow she was a splendidly feminine girl as wholesome as a november pippin and no more mysterious than a windowpane she had whimsical little theories that she had deduced from life and that fitted the maxims of epictetus like princess gowns i wonder after all if that old duffer wasn t rather wise chloe had a father the reverend homer greene and an intermittent mother who sometimes palely presided over a twilight teapot the reverend homer was a burr like man with a life work he was writing a concordance to the scriptures and had arrived as far as kings being presumably a suitor for his daughter s hand i was timber for his literary outpourings i had the family tree of israel drilled into my head until i used to cry aloud in my sleep and aminadab begat jay eye see and so forth until he had tackled another book i once made a calculation that the reverend homer s concordance would be worked up as far as the seven vials mentioned in revelations about the third day after they were opened louis devoe as well as i was a visitor and an intimate friend of the greenes it was there i met him the oftenest and a more agreeable man or a more accomplished i have never hated in my life luckily or unfortunately i came to be accepted as a boy my appearance was youthful and i suppose i had that pleading and homeless air that always draws the motherliness that is in women and the cursed theories and hobbies of pater familiases chloe called me tommy and made sisterly fun of my attempts to woo her with devoe she was vastly more reserved he was the man of romance one to stir her imagination and deepest feelings had her fancy leaned toward him i was closer to her but standing in no glamour i had the task before me of winning her in what seems to me the american way of fighting with cleanness and pluck and everyday devotion to break away the barriers of friendship that divided us and to take her if i could between sunrise and dark abetted by neither moonlight nor music nor foreign wiles chloe gave no sign of bestowing her blithe affections upon either of us but one day she let out to me an inkling of what she preferred in a man it was tremendously interesting to me but not illuminating as to its application i had been tormenting her for the dozenth time with the statement and catalogue of my sentiments toward her tommy said she i don t want a man to show his love for me by leading an army against another country and blowing people off the earth with cannons if you mean that the opposite way i answered as they say women do i ll see what i can do the papers are full of this diplomatic row in russia my people know some big people in washington who are right next to the army people and i could get an artillery commission and i m not that way interrupted chloe i mean what i say it isn t the big things that are done in the world tommy that count with a woman when the knights were riding abroad in their armor to slay dragons many a stay at home page won a lonesome lady s hand by being on the spot to pick up her glove and be quick with her cloak when the wind blew the man i am to like best whoever he shall be must show his love in little ways he must never forget after hearing it once that i do not like to have any one walk at my left side that i detest bright colored neckties that i prefer to sit with my back to a light that i like candied violets that i must not be talked to when i am looking at the moonlight shining on water and that i very very often long for dates stuffed with english walnuts frivolity i said with a frown any well trained servant would be equal to such details and he must remember went on chloe to remind me of what i want when i do not know myself what i want you re rising in the scale i said what you seem to need is a first class clairvoyant and if i say that i am dying to hear a beethoven sonata and stamp my foot when i say it he must know by that that what my soul craves is salted almonds and he will have them ready in his pocket now said i i am at a loss i do not know whether your soul s affinity is to be an impresario or a fancy grocer chole turned her pearly smile upon me take less than half of what i said as a jest she went on and don t think too lightly of the little things boy be a paladin if you must but don t let it show on you most women are only very big children and most men are only very little ones please us don t try to overpower us when we want a hero we can make one out of even a plain grocer the third time he catches our handkerchief before it falls to the ground that evening i was taken down with pernicious fever that is a kind of coast fever with improvements and high geared attachments your temperature goes up among the threes and fours and remains there laughing scornfully and feverishly at the cinchona trees and the coal tar derivatives pernicious fever is a case for a simple mathematician instead of a doctor it is merely this formula vitality the desire to live the duration of the fever the result i took to my bed in the two roomed thatched hut where i had been comfortably established and sent for a gallon of rum that was not for myself drunk stamford was the best doctor between the andes and the pacific he came sat at my bedside and drank himself into condition my boy said he my lily white and reformed romeo medicine will do you no good but i will give you quinine which being bitter will arouse in you hatred and anger two stimulants that will add ten per cent to your chances you are as strong as a caribou calf and you will get well if the fever doesn t get in a knockout blow when you re off your guard for two weeks i lay on my back feeling like a hindoo widow on a burning ghat old atasca an untrained indian nurse sat near the door like a petrified statue of what s the use attending to her duties which were mainly to see that time went by without slipping a cog sometimes i would fancy myself back in the philippines or at worse times sliding off the horsehair sofa in sleepytown one afternoon i ordered atasca to vamose and got up and dressed carefully i took my temperature which i was pleased to find i paid almost dainty attention to my dress choosing solicitously a necktie of a dull and subdued hue the mirror showed that i was looking little the worse from my illness the fever gave brightness to my eyes and color to my face and while i looked at my reflection my color went and came again as i thought of chloe greene and the millions of eons that had passed since i d seen her and of louis devoe and the time he had gained on me i went straight to her house i seemed to float rather than walk i hardly felt the ground under my feet i thought pernicious fever must be a great boon to make one feel so strong i found chloe and louis devoe sitting under the awning in front of the house she jumped up and met me with a double handshake i m glad glad glad to see you out again she cried every word a pearl strung on the string of her sentence you are well tommy or better of course i wanted to come to see you but they wouldn t let me oh yes said i carelessly it was nothing merely a little fever i am out again as you see we three sat there and talked for half an hour or so then chloe looked out yearningly and almost piteously across the ocean i could see in her sea blue eyes some deep and intense desire devoe curse him saw it too what is it we asked in unison cocoanut pudding said chloe pathetically i ve wanted some oh so badly for two days it s got beyond a wish it s an obsession the cocoanut season is over said devoe in that voice of his that gave thrilling interest to his most commonplace words i hardly think one could be found in mojada the natives never use them except when they are green and the milk is fresh they sell all the ripe ones to the fruiterers wouldn t a broiled lobster or a welsh rabbit do as well i remarked with the engaging idiocy of a pernicious fever convalescent chloe came as near to pouting as a sweet disposition and a perfect profile would allow her to come the reverend homer poked his ermine lined face through the doorway and added a concordance to the conversation sometimes said he old campos keeps the dried nuts in his little store on the hill but it would be far better my daughter to restrain unusual desires and partake thankfully of the daily dishes that the lord has set before us stuff said i how was that asked the reverend homer sharply i say it s tough said i to drop into the vernacular that miss greene should be deprived of the food she desires a simple thing like kalsomine pudding perhaps i continued solicitously some pickled walnuts or a fricassee of hungarian butternuts would do as well every one looked at me with a slight exhibition of curiosity louis devoe arose and made his adieus i watched him until he had sauntered slowly and grandiosely to the corner around which he turned to reach his great warehouse and store chloe made her excuses and went inside for a few minutes to attend to some detail affecting the seven o clock dinner she was a passed mistress in housekeeping i had tasted her puddings and bread with beatitude when all had gone i turned casually and saw a basket made of plaited green withes hanging by a nail outside the door jamb with a rush that made my hot temples throb there came vividly to my mind recollections of the head hunters those grim flinty relentless little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed presence from time to time as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move him one creeps forth with his snickersnee and takes up the silent trail back he comes triumphant bearing the severed gory head of his victim his particular brown or white maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft tiger s eyes at the evidence of his love for her i stole softly from the house and returned to my hut from its supporting nails in the wall i took a machete as heavy as a butcher s cleaver and sharper than a safety razor and then i chuckled softly to myself and set out to the fastidiously appointed private office of monsieur louis devoe usurper to the hand of the pearl of the pacific he was never slow at thinking he gave one look at my face and another at the weapon in my hand as i entered his door and then he seemed to fade from my sight i ran to the back door kicked it open and saw him running like a deer up the road toward the wood that began two hundred yards away i was after him with a shout i remember hearing children and women screaming and seeing them flying from the road he was fleet but i was stronger a mile and i had almost come up with him he doubled cunningly and dashed into a brake that extended into a small canon i crashed through this after him and in five minutes had him cornered in an angle of insurmountable cliffs there his instinct of self preservation steadied him as it will steady even animals at bay he turned to me quite calm with a ghastly smile oh rayburn he said with such an awful effort at ease that i was impolite enough to laugh rudely in his face oh rayburn said he come let s have done with this nonsense of course i know it s the fever and you re not yourself but collect yourself man give me that ridiculous weapon now and let s go back and talk it over i will go back said i carrying your head with me we will see how charmingly it can discourse when it lies in the basket at her door come said he persuasively i think better of you than to suppose that you try this sort of thing as a joke but even the vagaries of a fever crazed lunatic come some time to a limit what is this talk about heads and baskets get yourself together and throw away that absurd cane chopper what would miss greene think of you he ended with the silky cajolery that one would use toward a fretful child listen said i at last you have struck upon the right note what would she think of me listen i repeated there are women i said who look upon horsehair sofas and currant wine as dross to them even the calculated modulation of your well trimmed talk sounds like the dropping of rotten plums from a tree in the night they are the maidens who walk back and forth in the villages scorning the emptiness of the baskets at the doors of the young men who would win them one such as they i said is waiting only a fool would try to win a woman by drooling like a braggart in her doorway or by waiting upon her whims like a footman they are all daughters of herodias and to gain their hearts one must lay the heads of his enemies before them with his own hands now bend your neck louis devoe do not be a coward as well as a chatterer at a lady s tea table there there said devoe falteringly you know me don t you rayburn oh yes i said i know you i know you i know you but the basket is empty the old men of the village and the young men and both the dark maidens and the ones who are as fair as pearls walk back and forth and see its emptiness will you kneel now or must we have a scuffle it is not like you to make things go roughly and with bad form but the basket is waiting for your head with that he went to pieces i had to catch him as he tried to scamper past me like a scared rabbit i stretched him out and got a foot on his chest but he squirmed like a worm although i appealed repeatedly to his sense of propriety and the duty he owed to himself as a gentleman not to make a row but at last he gave me the chance and i swung the machete it was not hard work he flopped like a chicken during the six or seven blows that it took to sever his head but finally he lay still and i tied his head in my handkerchief the eyes opened and shut thrice while i walked a hundred yards i was red to my feet with the drip but what did that matter with delight i felt under my hands the crisp touch of his short thick brown hair and close trimmed beard i reached the house of the greenes and dumped the head of louis devoe into the basket that still hung by the nail in the door jamb i sat in a chair under the awning and waited the sun was within two hours of setting chloe came out and looked surprised where have you been tommy she asked you were gone when i came out look in the basket i said rising to my feet she looked and gave a little scream of delight i was pleased to note oh tommy she said it was just what i wanted you to do it s leaking a little but that doesn t matter wasn t i telling you it s the little things that count and you remembered little things she held the ensanguined head of louis devoe in her white apron tiny streams of red widened on her apron and dripped upon the floor her face was bright and tender little things indeed i thought again the head hunters are right these are the things that women like you to do for them chloe came close to me there was no one in sight she looked tip at me with sea blue eyes that said things they had never said before you think of me she said you are the man i was describing you think of the little things and they are what make the world worth living in the man for me must consider my little wishes and make me happy in small ways he must bring me little red peaches in december if i wish for them and then i will love him till june i will have no knight in armor slaying his rival or killing dragons for me you please me very well tommy i stooped and kissed her then a moisture broke out on my forehead and i began to feel weak i saw the red stains vanish from chloe s apron and the head of louis devoe turn to a brown dried cocoanut there will be cocoanut pudding for dinner tommy boy said chloe gayly and you must come i must go in for a little while she vanished in a delightful flutter dr stamford tramped up hurriedly he seized my pulse as though it were his own property that i had escaped with you are the biggest fool outside of any asylum he said angrily why did you leave your bed and the idiotic things you ve been doing and no wonder with your pulse going like a sledge hammer name some of them said i devoe sent for me said stamford he saw you from his window go to old campos store chase him up the hill with his own yardstick and then come back and make off with his biggest cocoanut it s the little things that count after all said i it s your little bed that counts with you just now said the doctor you come with me at once or i ll throw up the case you re as loony as a loon so i got no cocoanut pudding that evening but i conceived a distrust as to the value of the method of the head hunters perhaps for many centuries the maidens of the villages may have been looking wistfully at the heads in the baskets at the doorways longing for other and lesser trophies no story to avoid having this book hurled into corner of the room by the suspicious reader i will assert in time that this is not a newspaper story you will encounter no shirt sleeved omniscient city editor no prodigy cub reporter just off the farm no scoop no story no anything but if you will concede me the setting of the first scene in the reporters room of the morning beacon i will repay the favor by keeping strictly my promises set forth above i was doing space work on the beacon hoping to be put on a salary some one had cleared with a rake or a shovel a small space for me at the end of a long table piled high with exchanges congressional records and old files there i did my work i wrote whatever the city whispered or roared or chuckled to me on my diligent wanderings about its streets my income was not regular one day tripp came in and leaned on my table tripp was something in the mechanical department i think he had something to do with the pictures for he smelled of photographers supplies and his hands were always stained and cut up with acids he was about twenty five and looked forty half of his face was covered with short curly red whiskers that looked like a door mat with the welcome left off he was pale and unhealthy and miserable and fawning and an assiduous borrower of sums ranging from twenty five cents to a dollar one dollar was his limit he knew the extent of his credit as well as the chemical national bank knows the amount of h that collateral will show on analysis when he sat on my table he held one hand with the other to keep both from shaking whiskey he had a spurious air of lightness and bravado about him that deceived no one but was useful in his borrowing because it was so pitifully and perceptibly assumed this day i had coaxed from the cashier five shining silver dollars as a grumbling advance on a story that the sunday editor had reluctantly accepted so if i was not feeling at peace with the world at least an armistice had been declared and i was beginning with ardor to write a description of the brooklyn bridge by moonlight well tripp said i looking up at him rather impatiently how goes it he was looking to day more miserable more cringing and haggard and downtrodden than i had ever seen him he was at that stage of misery where he drew your pity so fully that you longed to kick him have you got a dollar asked tripp with his most fawning look and his dog like eyes that blinked in the narrow space between his high growing matted beard and his low growing matted hair i have said i and again i said i have more loudly and inhospitably and four besides and i had hard work corkscrewing them out of old atkinson i can tell you and i drew them i continued to meet a want a hiatus a demand a need an exigency a requirement of exactly five dollars i was driven to emphasis by the premonition that i was to lose one of the dollars on the spot i don t want to borrow any said tripp and i breathed again i thought you d like to get put onto a good story he went on i ve got a rattling fine one for you you ought to make it run a column at least it ll make a dandy if you work it up right it ll probably cost you a dollar or two to get the stuff i don t want anything out of it myself i became placated the proposition showed that tripp appreciated past favors although he did not return them if he had been wise enough to strike me for a quarter then he would have got it what is the story i asked poising my pencil with a finely calculated editorial air i ll tell you said tripp it s a girl a beauty one of the howlingest amsden s junes you ever saw rosebuds covered with dew violets in their mossy bed and truck like that she s lived on long island twenty years and never saw new york city before i ran against her on thirty fourth street she d just got in on the east river ferry i tell you she s a beauty that would take the hydrogen out of all the peroxides in the world she stopped me on the street and asked me where she could find george brown asked me where she could find george brown in new york city what do you think of that i talked to her and found that she was going to marry a young farmer named dodd hiram dodd next week but it seems that george brown still holds the championship in her youthful fancy george had greased his cowhide boots some years ago and came to the city to make his fortune but he forgot to remember to show up again at greenburg and hiram got in as second best choice but when it comes to the scratch ada her name s ada lowery saddles a nag and rides eight miles to the railroad station and catches the a m train for the city looking for george you know you understand about women george wasn t there so she wanted him well you know i couldn t leave her loose in wolftown on the hudson i suppose she thought the first person she inquired of would say george brown why yes lemme see he s a short man with light blue eyes ain t he oh yes you ll find george on one hundred and twenty fifth street right next to the grocery he s bill clerk in a saddle and harness store that s about how innocent and beautiful she is you know those little long island water front villages like greenburg a couple of duck farms for sport and clams and about nine summer visitors for industries that s the kind of a place she comes from but say you ought to see her what could i do i don t know what money looks like in the morning and she d paid her last cent of pocket money for her railroad ticket except a quarter which she had squandered on gum drops she was eating them out of a paper bag i took her to a boarding house on thirty second street where i used to live and hocked her she s in soak for a dollar that s old mother mcginnis price per day i ll show you the house what words are these tripp said i i thought you said you had a story every ferryboat that crosses the east river brings or takes away girls from long island the premature lines on tripp s face grew deeper he frowned seriously from his tangle of hair he separated his hands and emphasized his answer with one shaking forefinger can t you see he said what a rattling fine story it would make you could do it fine all about the romance you know and describe the girl and put a lot of stuff in it about true love and sling in a few stickfuls of funny business joshing the long islanders about being green and well you know how to do it you ought to get fifteen dollars out of it anyhow and it ll cost you only about four dollars you ll make a clear profit of eleven how will it cost me four dollars i asked suspiciously one dollar to mrs mcginnis tripp answered promptly and two dollars to pay the girl s fare back home and the fourth dimension i inquired making a rapid mental calculation one dollar to me said tripp for whiskey are you on i smiled enigmatically and spread my elbows as if to begin writing again but this grim abject specious subservient burr like wreck of a man would not be shaken off his forehead suddenly became shiningly moist don t you see he said with a sort of desperate calmness that this girl has got to be sent home to day not to night nor to morrow but to day i can t do anything for her you know i m the janitor and corresponding secretary of the down and out club i thought you could make a newspaper story out of it and win out a piece of money on general results but anyhow don t you see that she s got to get back home before night and then i began to feel that dull leaden soul depressing sensation known as the sense of duty why should that sense fall upon one as a weight and a burden i knew that i was doomed that day to give up the bulk of my store of hard wrung coin to the relief of this ada lowery but i swore to myself that tripp s whiskey dollar would not be forthcoming

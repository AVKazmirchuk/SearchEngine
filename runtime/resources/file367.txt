to the doors and windows and other stage entrances remarking hist at each one they all do that in salvador before they ask for a drink of water or the time of day being conspirators from the cradle and matinee idols by proclamation hist says general dingo again and then he lays his chest on the table quite like gaspard the miser good friends senores to morrow will be the great day of liberty and independence the hearts of americans and salvadorians should beat together of your history and your great washington i know is it not so now me and jones thought that nice of the general to remember when the fourth came it made us feel good he must have heard the news going round in philadelphia about that disturbance we had with england yes says me and maxy together we knew it we were talking about it when you came in and you can bet your bottom concession that there ll be fuss and feathers in the air to morrow we are few in numbers but the welkin may as well reach out to push the button for it s got to ring i too shall assist says the general thumping his collar bone i too am on the side of liberty noble americans we will make the day one to be never forgotten for us american whisky says jones none of your scotch smoke or anisada or three star hennessey to morrow we ll borrow the consul s flag old man billfinger shall make orations and we ll have a barbecue on the plaza fireworks says i will be scarce but we ll have all the cartridges in the shops for our guns i ve got two navy sixes i brought from denver there is one cannon said the general one big cannon that will go boom and three hundred men with rifles to shoot oh say says jones generalissimo you re the real silk elastic we ll make it a joint international celebration please general get a white horse and a blue sash and be grand marshal with my sword says the general rolling his eyes i shall ride at the head of the brave men who gather in the name of liberty and you might we suggest see the commandante and advise him that we are going to prize things up a bit we americans you know are accustomed to using municipal regulations for gun wadding when we line up to help the eagle scream he might suspend the rules for one day we don t want to get in the calaboose for spanking his soldiers if they get in our way do you see hist says general mary the commandant is with us heart and soul he will aid us he is one of us we made all the arrangements that afternoon there was a buck coon from georgia in salvador who had drifted down there from a busted up coloured colony that had been started on some possumless land in mexico as soon as he heard us say barbecue he wept for joy and groveled on the ground he dug his trench on the plaza and got half a beef on the coals for an all night roast me and maxy went to see the rest of the americans in the town and they all sizzled like a seidlitz with joy at the idea of solemnizing an old time fourth there were six of us all together martin dillard a coffee planter henry barnes a railroad man old man billfinger an educated tintype taker me and jonesy and jerry the boss of the barbecue there was also an englishman in town named sterrett who was there to write a book on domestic architecture of the insect world we felt some bashfulness about inviting a britisher to help crow over his own country but we decided to risk it out of our personal regard for him we found sterrett in pajamas working at his manuscript with a bottle of brandy for a paper weight englishman says jones let us interrupt your disquisition on bug houses for a moment to morrow is the

old ragged stars and stripes hanging over his shack you re all kinds of a fool billy casparis i said to myself and of all your crimes against sense it does look like this idea of celebrating the fourth should receive the award of demerit your business is busted up your thousand dollars is gone into the kitty of this corrupt country on that last bluff you made you ve got just fifteen chili dollars left worth forty six cents each at bedtime last night and steadily going down to day you ll blow in your last cent hurrahing for that flag and to morrow you ll be living on bananas from the stalk and screwing your drinks out of your friends what s the flag done for you while you were

but piratical gentleman in charge pointed proudly to two objects on the counter reposing in a couple of vases and said they were i then told him i feared there was some mistake as no buttonhole bouquets had been ordered but he insisted on his former declaration and so i brought them away and sent them to their respective destinations i thought it a pity to spoil a good deck of cards by

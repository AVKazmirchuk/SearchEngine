and here s a couple of pounds of vers de societe that i got at a rate from the clever magazines that s the stuff that people everywhere want and now here s a writeup with photographs at the ages of four twelve twenty two and thirty of george b mcclellan it s a prognostication he s bound to be elected mayor of new york it make a big hit all over the country he i beg your pardon said colonel telfair stiffening in his chair what was the name oh i see said thacker with half a grin yes he s a son of the general we ll pass that manuscript up but if you ll excuse me colonel it s a magazine we re trying to make go off not the first gun at fort sumter now here s a thing that s bound to get next to you it s an original poem by james whitcomb riley j w himself you know what that means to a magazine i won t tell you what i had to pay for that poem but i ll tell you this riley can make more money writing with a fountain pen than you or i can with one that lets the ink run i ll read you the last two stanzas pa lays around n loafs all day n reads and makes us leave him be he lets me do just like i please n when i m in bad he laughs at me n when i holler loud n say bad words n then begin to tease the cat n pa just smiles ma s mad n gives me jesse crost her knees i always wondered why that wuz i guess it s cause pa never does n after all the lights are out i m sorry bout it so i creep out of my trundle bed to ma s n say i love her a whole heap n kiss her n i hug her tight n it s too dark to see her eyes but every time i do i know she cries n cries n cries n cries i always wondered why that wuz i guess it s cause pa never does that s the stuff continued thacker what do you think of that i am not unfamiliar with the works of mr riley said the colonel deliberately i believe he lives in indiana for the last ten years i have been somewhat of a literary recluse and am familiar with nearly all the books in the cedar heights library i am also of the opinion that a magazine should contain a certain amount of poetry many of the sweetest singers of the south have already contributed to the pages of the rose of dixie i myself have thought of translating from the original for publication in its pages the works of the great italian poet tasso have you ever drunk from the fountain of this immortal poet s lines mr thacker not even a demi tasso said thacker now let s come to the point colonel telfair i ve already invested some money in this as a flyer that bunch of manuscripts cost me my object was to try a number of them in the next issue i believe you make up less than a month ahead and see what effect it has on the circulation i believe that by printing the best stuff we can get in the north south east or west we can make the magazine go you have there the letter from the owning company asking you to co operate with me in the plan let s chuck out some of this slush that you ve been publishing just because the writers are related to the skoopdoodles of skoopdoodle county are you with me as long as i continue to be the editor of the rose said colonel telfair with dignity i shall be its editor but i desire also to conform to the wishes of its owners if i can do so conscientiously that s the talk said thacker briskly now how much of this stuff i ve brought can we get into the january number we want to begin right away there is yet space in the january number said the editor for about eight thousand words roughly estimated great said thacker it isn t much but it ll give the readers some change from goobers governors and gettysburg i ll leave the selection of the stuff i brought to fill the space to you as it s all good i ve got to run back to new york and i ll be down again in a couple of weeks colonel telfair slowly swung his eye glasses by their broad black ribbon the space in the january number that i referred to said he measuredly has been held open purposely pending a decision that i have not yet made a short time ago a contribution was submitted to the rose of dixie that is one of the most remarkable literary efforts that has ever come under my observation none but a master mind and talent could have produced it it would just fill the space that i have reserved for its possible use thacker looked anxious what kind of stuff is it he asked eight thousand words sounds suspicious the oldest families must have been collaborating is there going to be another secession the author of the article continued the colonel ignoring thacker s allusions is a writer of some reputation he has also distinguished himself in other ways i do not feel at liberty to reveal to you his name at least not until i have decided whether or not to accept his contribution well said thacker nervously is it a continued story or an account of the unveiling of the new town pump in whitmire south carolina or a revised list of general lee s body servants or what you are disposed to be facetious said colonel telfair calmly the article is from the pen of a thinker a philosopher a lover of mankind a student and a rhetorician of high degree it must have been written by a syndicate said thacker but honestly colonel you want to go slow i don t know of any eight thousand word single doses of written matter that are read by anybody these days except supreme court briefs and reports of murder trials you haven t by any accident gotten hold of a copy of one of daniel webster s speeches have you colonel telfair swung a little in his chair and looked steadily from under his bushy eyebrows at the magazine promoter mr thacker he said gravely i am willing to segregate the somewhat crude expression of your sense of humor from the solicitude that your business investments undoubtedly have conferred upon you but i must ask you to cease your jibes and derogatory comments upon the south and the southern people they sir will not be tolerated in the office of the rose of dixie for one moment and before you proceed with more of your covert insinuations that i the editor of this magazine am not a competent judge of the merits of the matter submitted to its consideration i beg that you will first present some evidence or proof that you are my superior in any way shape or form relative to the question in hand oh come colonel said thacker good naturedly i didn t do anything like that to you it sounds like an indictment by the fourth assistant attorney general let s get back to business what s this to shot about the article said colonel telfair acknowledging the apology by a slight bow covers a wide area of knowledge it takes up theories and questions that have puzzled the world for centuries and disposes of them logically and concisely one by one it holds up to view the evils of the world points out the way of eradicating them and then conscientiously and in detail comments the good there is hardly a phase of human life that it does not discuss wisely calmly and equitably the great policies of governments the duties of private citizens the obligations of home life law ethics morality all these important subjects are handled with a calm wisdom and confidence that i must confess has captured my admiration it must be a crackerjack said thacker impressed it is a great contribution to the world s wisdom said the colonel the only doubt remaining in my mind as to the tremendous advantage it would be to us to give it publication in the rose of dixie is that i have not yet sufficient information about the author to give his work publicity in our magazine i thought you said he is a distinguished man said thacker he is replied the colonel both in literary and in other more diversified and extraneous fields but i am extremely careful about the matter that i accept for publication my contributors are people of unquestionable repute and connections which fact can be verified at any time as i said i am holding this article until i can acquire more information about its author i do not know whether i will publish it or not if i decide against it i shall be much pleased mr thacker to substitute the matter that you are leaving with me in its place thacker was somewhat at sea i don t seem to gather said he much about the gist of this inspired piece of literature it sounds more like a dark horse than pegasus to me it is a human document said the colonel editor confidently from a man of great accomplishments who in my opinion has obtained a stronger grasp on the world and its outcomes than that of any man living to day thacker rose to his feet excitedly say he said it isn t possible that you ve cornered john d rockefeller s memoirs is it don t tell me that all at once no sir said colonel telfair i am speaking of mentality and literature not of the less worthy intricacies of trade well what s the trouble about running the article asked thacker a little impatiently if the man s well known and has got the stuff colonel telfair sighed mr thacker said he for once i have been tempted nothing has yet appeared in the rose of dixie that has not been from the pen of one of its sons or daughters i know little about the author of this article except that he has acquired prominence in a section of the country that has always been inimical to my heart and mind but i recognize his genius and as i have told you i have instituted an investigation of his personality perhaps it will be futile but i shall pursue the inquiry until that is finished i must leave open the question of filling the vacant space in our january number thacker arose to leave all right colonel he said as cordially as he could you use your own judgment if you ve really got a scoop or something that will make em sit up run it instead of my stuff i ll drop in again in about two weeks good luck colonel telfair and the magazine promoter shook hands returning a fortnight later thacker dropped off a very rocky pullman at toombs city he found the january number of the magazine made up and the forms closed the vacant space that had been yawning for type was filled by an article that was headed thus second message to congress written for the rose of dixie by a member of the well known bulloch family of georgia t roosevelt the third ingredient the so called vallambrosa apartment house is not an apartment house it is composed of two old fashioned brownstone front residences welded into one the parlor floor of one side is gay with the wraps and head gear of a modiste the other is lugubrious with the sophistical promises and grisly display of a painless dentist you may have a room there for two dollars a week or you may have one for twenty dollars among the vallambrosa s roomers are stenographers musicians brokers shop girls space rate writers art students wire tappers and other people who lean far over the banister rail when the door bell rings this treatise shall have to do with but two of the vallambrosians though meaning no disrespect to the others at six o clock one afternoon hetty pepper came back to her third floor rear room in the vallambrosa with her nose and chin more sharply pointed than usual to be discharged from the department store where you have been working four years and with only fifteen cents in your purse does have a tendency to make your features appear more finely chiseled and now for hetty s thumb nail biography while she climbs the two flights of stairs she walked into the biggest store one morning four years before with seventy five other girls applying for a job behind the waist department counter the phalanx of wage earners formed a bewildering scene of beauty carrying a total mass of blond hair sufficient to have justified the horseback gallops of a hundred lady godivas the capable cool eyed impersonal young bald headed man whose task it was to engage six of the contestants was aware of a feeling of suffocation as if he were drowning in a sea of frangipanni while white clouds hand embroidered floated about him and then a sail hove in sight hetty pepper homely of countenance with small contemptuous green eyes and chocolate colored hair dressed in a suit of plain burlap and a common sense hat stood before him with every one of her twenty nine years of life unmistakably in sight you re on shouted the bald headed young man and was saved and that is how hetty came to be employed in the biggest store the story of her rise to an eight dollar a week salary is the combined stories of hercules joan of arc una job and little red riding hood you shall not learn from me the salary that was paid her as a beginner there is a sentiment growing about such things and i want no millionaire store proprietors climbing the fire escape of my tenement house to throw dynamite bombs into my skylight boudoir the story of hetty s discharge from the biggest store is so nearly a repetition of her engagement as to be monotonous in each department of the store there is an omniscient omnipresent and omnivorous person carrying always a mileage book and a red necktie and referred to as a buyer the destinies of the girls in his department who live on see bureau of victual statistics so much per week are in his hands this particular buyer was a capable cool eyed impersonal young bald headed man as he walked along the aisles of his department lie seemed to be sailing on a sea of frangipanni while white clouds machine embroidered floated around him too many sweets bring surfeit he looked upon hetty pepper s homely countenance emerald eyes and chocolate colored hair as a welcome oasis of green in a desert of cloying beauty in a quiet angle of a counter he pinched her arm kindly three inches above the elbow she slapped him three feet away with one good blow of her muscular and not especially lily white right so now you know why hetty pepper came to leave the biggest store at thirty minutes notice with one dime and a nickel in her purse this morning s quotations list the price of rib beef at six cents per butcher s pound but on the day that hetty was released by the b s the price was seven and one half cents that fact is what makes this story possible otherwise the extra four cents would have but the plot of nearly all the good stories in the world is concerned with shorts who were unable to cover so you can find no fault with this one hetty mounted with her rib beef to her third floor back one hot savory beef stew for supper a night s good sleep and she would be fit in the morning to apply again for the tasks of hercules joan of arc una job and little red riding hood in her room she got the granite ware stew pan out of the x foot china er i mean earthenware closet and began to dig down in a rats nest of paper bags for the potatoes and onions she came out with her nose and chin just a little sharper pointed there was neither a potato nor an onion now what kind of a beef stew can you make out of simply beef you can make oyster soup without oysters turtle soup without turtles coffee cake without coffee but you can t make beef stew without potatoes and onions but rib beef alone in an emergency can make an ordinary pine door look like a wrought iron gambling house portal to the wolf with salt and pepper and a tablespoonful of flour first well stirred in a little cold water twill serve tis not so deep as a lobster a la newburg nor so wide as a church festival doughnut but twill serve hetty took her stew pan to the rear of the third floor hall according to the advertisements of the vallambrosa there was running water to be found there between you and me and the water meter it only ambled or walked through the faucets but technicalities have no place here there was also a sink where housekeeping roomers often met to dump their coffee grounds and glare at one another s kimonos at this sink hetty found a girl with heavy gold brown artistic hair and plaintive eyes washing two large irish potatoes hetty knew the vallambrosa as well as any one not owning double hextra magnifying eyes could compass its mysteries the kimonos were her encyclopedia her who s what her clearinghouse of news of goers and comers from a rose pink kimono edged with nile green she had learned that the girl with the potatoes was a miniature painter living in a kind of attic or studio as they prefer to call it on the top floor hetty was not certain in her mind what a miniature was but it certainly wasn t a house because house painters although they wear splashy overalls and poke ladders in your face on the street are known to indulge in a riotous profusion of food at home the potato girl was quite slim and small and handled her potatoes as an old bachelor uncle handles a baby who is cutting teeth she had a dull shoemaker s knife in her right hand and she had begun to peel one of the potatoes with it hetty addressed her in the punctiliously formal tone of one who intends to be cheerfully familiar with you in the second round beg pardon she said for butting into what s not my business but if you peel them potatoes you lose out they re new bermudas you want to scrape em lemme show you she took a potato and the knife and began to demonstrate oh thank you breathed the artist i didn t know and i did hate to see the thick peeling go it seemed such a waste but i thought they always had to be peeled when you ve got only potatoes to eat the peelings count you know say kid said hetty staying her knife you ain t up against it too are you the miniature artist smiled starvedly i suppose i am art or at least the way i interpret it doesn t seem to be much in demand i have only these potatoes for my dinner but they aren t so bad boiled and hot with a little butter and salt child said hetty letting a brief smile soften her rigid features fate has sent me and you together i ve had it handed to me in the neck too but i ve got a chunk of meat in my room as big as a lap dog and i ve done everything to get potatoes except pray for em let s me and you bunch our commissary departments and make a stew of em we ll cook it in my room if we only had an onion to go in it say kid you haven t got a couple of pennies that ve slipped down into the lining of your last winter s sealskin have you i could step down to the corner and get one at old giuseppe s stand a stew without an onion is worse n a matinee without candy you may call me cecilia said the artist no i spent my last penny three days ago then we ll have to cut the onion out instead of slicing it in said hetty i d ask the janitress for one but i don t want em hep just yet to the fact that i m pounding the asphalt for another job but i wish we did have an onion in the shop girl s room the two began to prepare their supper cecilia s part was to sit on the couch helplessly and beg to be allowed to do something in the voice of a cooing ring dove hetty prepared the rib beef putting it in cold salted water in the stew pan and setting it on the one burner gas stove i wish we had an onion said hetty as she scraped the two potatoes on the wall opposite the couch was pinned a flaming gorgeous advertising picture of one of the new ferry boats of the p u f f railroad that had been built to cut down the time between los angeles and new york city one eighth of a minute hetty turning her head during her continuous monologue saw tears running from her guest s eyes as she gazed on the idealized presentment of the speeding foam girdled transport why say cecilia kid said hetty poising her knife is it as bad art as that i ain t a critic but i thought it kind of brightened up the room of course a manicure painter could tell it was a bum picture in a minute i ll take it down if you say so i wish to the holy saint potluck we had an onion but the miniature miniature painter had tumbled down sobbing with her nose indenting the hard woven drapery of the couch something was here deeper than the artistic temperament offended at crude lithography hetty knew she had accepted her role long ago how scant the words with which we try to describe a single quality of a human being when we reach the abstract we are lost the nearer to nature that the babbling of our lips comes the better do we understand figuratively let us say some people are bosoms some are hands some are heads some are muscles some are feet some are backs for burdens hetty was a shoulder hers was a sharp sinewy shoulder but all her life people had laid their heads upon it metaphorically or actually and had left there all or half their troubles looking at life anatomically which is as good a way as any she was preordained to be a shoulder there were few truer collar bones anywhere than hers hetty was only thirty three and she had not yet outlived the little pang that visited her whenever the head of youth and beauty leaned upon her for consolation but one glance in her mirror always served as an instantaneous pain killer so she gave one pale look into the crinkly old looking glass on the wall above the gas stove turned down the flame a little lower from the bubbling beef and potatoes went over to the couch and lifted cecilia s head to its confessional go on and tell me honey she said i know now that it ain t art that s worrying you you met him on a ferry boat didn t you go on cecilia kid and tell your your aunt hetty about it but youth and melancholy must first spend the surplus of sighs and tears that waft and float the barque of romance to its harbor in the delectable isles presently through the stringy tendons that formed the bars of the confessional the penitent or was it the glorified communicant of the sacred flame told her story without art or illumination it was only three days ago i was coming back on the ferry from jersey city old mr schrum an art dealer told me of a rich man in newark who wanted a miniature of his daughter painted i went to see him and showed him some of my work when i told him the price would be fifty dollars he laughed at me like a hyena he said an enlarged crayon twenty times the size would cost him only eight dollars i had just enough money to buy my ferry ticket back to new york i felt as if i didn t want to live another day i must have looked as i felt for i saw him on the row of seats opposite me looking at me as if he understood he was nice looking but oh above everything else he looked kind when one is tired or unhappy or hopeless kindness counts more than anything else when i got so miserable that i couldn t fight against it any longer i got up and walked slowly out the rear door of the ferry boat cabin no one was there and i slipped quickly over the rail and dropped into the water oh friend hetty it was cold cold for just one moment i wished i was back in the old vallambrosa starving and hoping and then i got numb and didn t care and then i felt that somebody else was in the water close by me holding me up he had followed me and jumped in to save me somebody threw a thing like a big white doughnut at us and he made me put my arms through the hole then the ferry boat backed and they pulled us on board oh hetty i was so ashamed of my wickedness in trying to drown myself and besides my hair had all tumbled down and was sopping wet and i was such a sight and then some men in blue clothes came around and he gave them his card and i heard him tell them he had seen me drop my purse on the edge of the boat outside the rail and in leaning over to get it i had fallen overboard and then i remembered having read in the papers that people who try to kill themselves are locked up in cells with people who try to kill other people and i was afraid but some ladies on the boat took me downstairs to the furnace room and got me nearly dry and did up my hair when the boat landed he came and put me in a cab he was all dripping himself but laughed as if he thought it was all a joke he begged me but i wouldn t tell him my name nor where i lived i was so ashamed you were a fool child said hetty kindly wait till i turn the light up a bit i wish to heaven we had an onion then he raised his hat went on cecilia and said very well but i ll find you anyhow i m going to claim my rights of salvage then he gave money to the cab driver and told him to take me where i wanted to go and walked away what is salvage hetty the edge of a piece of goods that ain t hemmed said the shop girl you must have looked pretty well frazzled out to the little hero boy it s been three days moaned the miniature painter and he hasn t found me yet extend the time said hetty this is a big town think of how many girls he might have to see soaked in water with their hair down before he would recognize you the stew s getting on fine but oh for an onion i d even use a piece of garlic if i had it the beef and potatoes bubbled merrily exhaling a mouth watering savor that yet lacked something leaving a hunger on the palate a haunting wistful desire for some lost and needful ingredient i came near drowning in that awful river said cecilia shuddering it ought to have more water in it said hetty the stew i mean i ll go get some at the sink it smells good said the artist that nasty old north river objected hetty it smells to me like soap factories and wet setter dogs oh you mean the stew well i wish we had an onion for it did he look like he had money first he looked kind said cecilia i m sure he was rich but that matters so little when he drew out his bill folder to pay the cab man you couldn t help seeing hundreds and thousands of dollars in it and i looked over the cab doors and saw him leave the ferry station in a motor car and the chauffeur gave him his bearskin to put on for he was sopping wet and it was only three days ago what a fool said hetty shortly oh the chauffeur wasn t wet breathed cecilia and he drove the car away very nicely i mean you said hetty for not giving him your address i never give my address to chauffeurs said cecilia haughtily i wish we had one said hetty disconsolately what for for the stew of course oh i mean an onion hetty took a pitcher and started to the sink at the end of the hall a young man came down the stairs from above just as she was opposite the lower step he was decently dressed but pale and haggard his eyes were dull with the stress of some burden of physical or mental woe in his hand he bore an onion a pink smooth solid shining onion as large around as a ninety eight cent alarm clock hetty stopped so did the young man there was something joan of arc ish herculean and una ish in the look and pose of the shoplady she had cast off the roles of job and little red riding hood the young man stopped at the foot of the stairs and coughed distractedly he felt marooned held up attacked assailed levied upon sacked assessed panhandled browbeaten though he knew not why it was the look in hetty s eyes that did it in them he saw the jolly roger fly to the masthead and an able seaman with a dirk between his teeth scurry up the ratlines and nail it there but as yet he did not know that the cargo he carried was the thing that had caused him to be so nearly blown out of the water without even a parley beg your pardon said hetty as sweetly as her dilute acetic acid tones permitted but did you find that onion on the stairs there was a hole in the paper bag and i ve just come out to look for it the young man coughed for half a minute the interval may have given him the courage to defend his own property also he clutched his pungent prize greedily and with a show of spirit faced his grim waylayer no he said huskily i didn t find it on the stairs it was given to me by jack bevens on the top floor if you don t believe it ask him i ll wait until you do i know about bevens said hetty sourly he writes books and things up there for the paper and rags man we can hear the postman guy him all over the house when he brings them thick envelopes back say do you live in the vallambrosa i do not said the young man i come to see bevens sometimes he s my friend i live two blocks west what are you going to do with the onion begging your pardon said hetty i m going to eat it raw yes as soon as i get home haven t you got anything else to eat with it the young man considered briefly no he confessed there s not another scrap of anything in my diggings to eat i think old jack is pretty hard up for grub in his shack too he hated to give up the onion but i worried him into parting with it man said hetty fixing him with her world sapient eyes and laying a bony but impressive finger on his sleeve you ve known trouble too haven t you lots said the onion owner promptly but this onion is my own property honestly come by if you will excuse me i must be going listen said hetty paling a little with anxiety raw onion is a mighty poor diet and so is a beef stew without one now if you re jack bevens friend i guess you re nearly right there s a little lady a friend of mine in my room there at the end of the hall both of us are out of luck and we had just potatoes and meat between us they re stewing now but it ain t got any soul there s something lacking to it there s certain things in life that are naturally intended to fit and belong together one is pink cheese cloth and green roses and one is ham and eggs and one is irish and trouble and the other one is beef and potatoes with onions and still another one is people who are up against it and other people in the same fix the young man went into a protracted paroxysm of coughing with one hand he hugged his onion to his bosom no doubt no doubt said he at length but as i said i must be going because hetty clutched his sleeve firmly don t be a dago little brother don t cat raw onions chip it in toward the dinner and line yourself inside with the best stew you ever licked a spoon over must two ladies knock a young gentleman down and drag him inside for the honor of dining with em no harm shall befall you little brother loosen up and fall into line the young man s pale face relaxed into a grin believe i ll go you he said brightening if my onion is good as a credential i ll accept the invitation gladly it s good as that but better as seasoning said hetty you come and stand outside the door till i ask my lady friend if she has any objections and don t run away with that letter of recommendation before i come out hetty went into her room and closed the door the young man waited outside cecilia kid said the shop girl oiling the sharp saw of her voice as well as she could there s an onion outside with a young man attached i ve asked him in to dinner you ain t going to kick are you oh dear said cecilia sitting up and patting her artistic hair she cast a mournful glance at the ferry boat poster on the wall nit said hetty it ain t him you re up against real life now i believe you said your hero friend had money and automobiles this is a poor skeezicks that s got nothing to eat but an onion but he s easy spoken and not a freshy i imagine he s been a gentleman he s so low down now and we need the onion shall i bring him in i ll guarantee his behavior hetty dear sighed cecilia i m so hungry what difference does it make whether he s a prince or a burglar i don t care bring him in if he s got anything to eat with him hetty went back into the hall the onion man was gone her heart missed a beat and a gray look settled over her face except on her nose and cheek bones and then the tides of life flowed in again for she saw him leaning out of the front window at the other end of the hall she hurried there he was shouting to some one below the noise of the street overpowered the sound of her footsteps she looked down over his shoulder saw whom he was speaking to and heard his words he pulled himself in from the window sill and saw her standing over him hetty s eyes bored into him like two steel gimlets don t lie to me she said calmly what were you going to do with that onion the young man suppressed a cough and faced her resolutely his manner was that of one who had been bearded sufficiently i was going to eat it said he with emphatic slowness just as i told you before and you have nothing else to eat at home not a thing what kind of work do you do i am not working at anything just now then why said hetty with her voice set on its sharpest edge do you lean out of windows and give orders to chauffeurs in green automobiles in the street below the young man flushed and his dull eyes began to sparkle because madam said he in accelerando tones i pay the chauffeur s wages and i own the automobile and also this onion this onion madam he flourished the onion within an inch of hetty s nose the shop lady did not retreat a hair s breadth then why do you eat onions she said with biting contempt and nothing else i never said i did retorted the young man heatedly i said i had nothing else to eat where i live i am not a delicatessen store keeper then why pursued hetty inflexibly were you going to eat a raw onion my mother said the young man always made me eat one for a cold pardon my referring to a physical infirmity but you may have noticed that i have a very very severe cold i was going to eat the onion and go to bed i wonder why i am standing here and apologizing to you for it how did you catch this cold went on hetty suspiciously the young man seemed to have arrived at some extreme height of feeling there were two modes of descent open to him a burst of rage or a surrender to the ridiculous he chose wisely and the empty hall echoed his hoarse laughter you re a dandy said he and i don t blame you for being careful i don t mind telling you i got wet i was on a north river ferry a few days ago when a girl jumped overboard of course i hetty extended her hand interrupting his story give me the onion she said the young man set his jaw a trifle harder give me the onion she repeated he grinned and laid it in her hand then hetty s infrequent grim melancholy smile showed itself she took the young man s arm and pointed with her other hand to the door of her room little brother she said go in there the little fool you fished out of the river is there waiting for you go on in i ll give you three minutes before i come potatoes is in there waiting go on in onions after he had tapped at the door and entered hetty began to peel and wash the onion at the sink she gave a gray look at the gray roofs outside and the smile on her face vanished by little jerks and twitches but it s us she said grimly to herself it s us that furnishes the beef the hiding of black bill a lank strong red faced man with a wellington beak and small fiery eyes tempered by flaxen lashes sat on the station platform at los pinos swinging his legs to and fro at his side sat another man fat melancholy and seedy who seemed to be his friend they had the appearance of men to whom life had appeared as a reversible coat seamy on both sides ain t seen you in about four years ham said the seedy man which way you been travelling texas said the red faced man it was too cold in alaska for me and i found it warm in texas i ll tell you about one hot spell i went through there one morning i steps off the international at a water tank and lets it go on without me twas a ranch country and fuller of spite houses than new york city only out there they build em twenty miles away so you can t smell what they ve got for dinner instead of running em up two inches from their neighbors windows there wasn t any roads in sight so i footed it cross country the grass was shoe top deep and the mesquite timber looked just like a peach orchard it was so much like a gentleman s private estate that every minute you expected a kennelful of bulldogs to run out and bite you but i must have walked twenty miles before i came in sight of a ranch house it was a little one about as big as an elevated railroad station there was a little man in a white shirt and brown overalls and a pink handkerchief around his neck rolling cigarettes under a tree in front of the door greetings says i any refreshment welcome emoluments or even work for a comparative stranger oh come in says he in a refined tone sit down on that stool please i didn t hear your horse coming he isn t near enough yet says i i walked i don t want to be a burden but i wonder if you have three or four gallons of water handy you do look pretty dusty says he but our bathing arrangements it s a drink i want says i never mind the dust that s on the outside he gets me a dipper of water out of a red jar hanging up and then goes on do you want work for a time says i this is a rather quiet section of the country isn t it it is says he sometimes so i have been told one sees no human being pass for weeks at a time i ve been here only a month i bought the ranch from an old settler who wanted to move farther west it suits me says i quiet and retirement are good for a man sometimes and i need a job i can tend bar salt mines lecture float stock do a little middle weight slugging and play the piano can you herd sheep asks the little ranch man do you mean have i heard sheep says i can you herd em take charge of a flock of em says he oh says i now i understand you mean chase em around and bark at em like collie dogs well i might says i i ve never exactly done any sheep herding but i ve often seen em from car windows masticating daisies and they don t look dangerous i m short a herder says the ranchman you never can depend on the mexicans i ve only got two flocks you may take out my bunch of muttons there are only eight hundred of em in the morning if you like the pay is twelve dollars a month and your rations furnished you camp in a tent on the prairie with your sheep you do your own cooking but wood and water are brought to your camp it s an easy job i m on says i i ll take the job even if i have to garland my brow and hold on to a crook and wear a loose effect and play on a pipe like the shepherds do in pictures so the next morning the little ranchman helps me drive the flock of muttons from the corral to about two miles out and let em graze on a little hillside on the prairie he gives me a lot of instructions about not letting bunches of them stray off from the herd and driving em down to a water hole to drink at noon i ll bring out your tent and camping outfit and rations in the buckboard before night says he fine says i and don t forget the rations nor the camping outfit and be sure to bring the tent your name s zollicoffer ain t it my name says he is henry ogden all right mr ogden says i mine is mr percival saint clair i herded sheep for five days on the rancho chiquito and then the wool entered my soul that getting next to nature certainly got next to me i was lonesomer than crusoe s goat i ve seen a lot of persons more entertaining as companions than those sheep were i d drive em to the corral and pen em every evening and then cook my corn bread and mutton and coffee and lie down in a tent the size of a table cloth and listen to the coyotes and whippoorwills singing around the camp the fifth evening after i had corralled my costly but uncongenial muttons i walked over to the ranch house and stepped in the door mr ogden says i you and me have got to get sociable sheep are all very well to dot the landscape and furnish eight dollar cotton suitings for man but for table talk and fireside companions they rank along with five o clock teazers if you ve got a deck of cards or a parcheesi outfit or a game of authors get em out and let s get on a mental basis i ve got to do something in an intellectual line if it s only to knock somebody s brains out this henry ogden was a peculiar kind of ranchman he wore finger rings and a big gold watch and careful neckties and his face was calm and his nose spectacles was kept very shiny i saw once in muscogee an outlaw hung for murdering six men who was a dead ringer for him but i knew a preacher in arkansas that you would have taken to be his brother i didn t care much for him either way what i wanted was some fellowship and communion with holy saints or lost sinners anything sheepless would do well saint clair says he laying down the book he was reading i guess it must be pretty lonesome for you at first and i don t deny that it s monotonous for me are you sure you corralled your sheep so they won t stray out they re shut up as tight as the jury of a millionaire murderer says i and i ll be back with them long before they ll need their trained nurse so ogden digs up a deck of cards and we play casino after five days and nights of my sheep camp it was like a toot on broadway when i caught big casino i felt as excited as if i had made a million in trinity and when h o loosened up a little and told the story about the lady in the pullman car i laughed for five minutes that showed what a comparative thing life is a man may see so much that he d be bored to turn his head to look at a fire or joe weber or the adriatic sea but let him herd sheep for a spell and you ll see him splitting his ribs laughing at curfew shall not ring to night or really enjoying himself playing cards with ladies by and by ogden gets out a decanter of bourbon and then there is a total eclipse of sheep do you remember reading in the papers about a month ago says he about a train hold up on the m k t the express agent was shot through the shoulder and about in currency taken and it s said that only one man did the job seems to me i do says i but such things happen so often they don t linger long in the human texas mind did they overtake overhaul seize or lay hands upon the despoiler he escaped says ogden and i was just reading in a paper to day that the officers have tracked him down into this part of the country it seems the bills the robber got were all the first issue of currency to the second national bank of espinosa city and so they ve followed the trail where they ve been spent and it leads this way ogden pours out some more bourbon and shoves me the bottle i imagine says i after ingurgitating another modicum of the royal boose that it wouldn t be at all a disingenuous idea for a train robber to run down into this part of the country to hide for a spell a sheep ranch now says i would be the finest kind of a place who d ever expect to find such a desperate character among these song birds and muttons and wild flowers and by the way says i kind of looking h ogden over was there any description mentioned of this single handed terror was his lineaments or height and thickness or teeth fillings or style of habiliments set forth in print why no says ogden they say nobody got a good sight of him because he wore a mask but they know it was a train robber called black bill because he always works alone and because he dropped a handkerchief in the express car that had his name on it all right says i i approve of black bill s retreat to the sheep ranges i guess they won t find him there s one thousand dollars reward for his capture says ogden i don t need that kind of money says i looking mr sheepman straight in the eye the twelve dollars a month you pay me is enough i need a rest and i can save up until i get enough to pay my fare to texarkana where my widowed mother lives if black bill i goes on looking significantly at ogden was to have come down this way say a month ago and bought a little sheep ranch and stop says ogden getting out of his chair and looking pretty vicious do you mean to insinuate nothing says i no insinuations i m stating a hypodermical case i say if black bill had come down here and bought a sheep ranch and hired me to little boy blue em and treated me square and friendly as you ve done he d never have anything to fear from me a man is a man regardless of any complications he may have with sheep or railroad trains now you know where i stand ogden looks black as camp coffee for nine seconds and then he laughs amused you ll do saint clair says he if i was black bill i wouldn t be afraid to trust you let s have a game or two of seven up to night that is if you don t mind playing with a train robber i ve told you says i my oral sentiments and there s no strings to em while i was shuffling after the first hand i asks ogden as if the idea was a kind of a casualty where he was from oh says he from the mississippi valley that s a nice little place says i i ve often stopped over there but didn t you find the sheets a little damp and the food poor now i hail says i from the pacific slope ever put up there too draughty says ogden but if you ve ever in the middle west just mention my name and you ll get foot warmers and dripped coffee well says i i wasn t exactly fishing for your private telephone number and the middle name of your aunt that carried off the cumberland presbyterian minister it don t matter i just want you to know you are safe in the hands of your shepherd now don t play hearts on spades and don t get nervous still harping says ogden laughing again don t you suppose that if i was black bill and thought you suspected me i d put a winchester bullet into you and stop my nervousness if i had any not any says i a man who s got the nerve to hold up a train single handed wouldn t do a trick like that i ve knocked about enough to know that them are the kind of men who put a value on a friend not that i can claim being a friend of yours mr ogden says i being only your sheep herder but under more expeditious circumstances we might have been forget the sheep temporarily i beg says ogden and cut for deal about four days afterward while my muttons was nooning on the water hole and i deep in the interstices of making a pot of coffee up rides softly on the grass a mysterious person in the garb of the being he wished to represent he was dressed somewhere between a kansas city detective buffalo bill and the town dog catcher of baton rouge his chin and eye wasn t molded on fighting lines so i knew he was only a scout herdin sheep he asks me well says i to a man of your evident gumptional endowments i wouldn t have the nerve to state that i am engaged in decorating old bronzes or oiling bicycle sprockets you don t talk or look like a sheep herder to me says he but you talk like what you look like to me says i and then he asks me who i was working for and i shows him rancho chiquito two miles away in the shadow of a low hill and he tells me he s a deputy sheriff there s a train robber called black bill supposed to be somewhere in these parts says the scout he s been traced as far as san antonio and maybe farther have you seen or heard of any strangers around here during the past month i have not says i except a report of one over at the mexican quarters of loomis ranch on the frio what do you know about him asks the deputy he s three days old says i what kind of a looking man is the man you work for he asks does old george ramey own this place yet he s run sheep here for the last ten years but never had no success the old man has sold out and gone west i tells him another sheep fancier bought him out about a month ago what kind of a looking man is he asks the deputy again oh says i a big fat kind of a dutchman with long whiskers and blue specs i don t think he knows a sheep from a ground squirrel i guess old george soaked him pretty well on the deal says i after indulging himself in a lot more non communicative information and two thirds of my dinner the deputy rides away that night i mentions the matter to ogden they re drawing the tendrils of the octopus around black bill says i and then i told him about the deputy sheriff and how i d described him to the deputy and what the deputy said about the matter oh well says ogden let s don t borrow any of black bill s troubles we ve a few of our own get the bourbon out of the cupboard and we ll drink to his health unless says he with his little cackling laugh you re prejudiced against train robbers i ll drink says i to any man who s a friend to a friend and i believe that black bill i goes on would be that so here s to black bill and may he have good luck and both of us drank about two weeks later comes shearing time the sheep had to be driven up to the ranch and a lot of frowzy headed mexicans would snip the fur off of them with back action scissors so the afternoon before the barbers were to come i hustled my underdone muttons over the hill across the dell down by the winding brook and up to the ranch house where i penned em in a corral and bade em my nightly adieus i went from there to the ranch house i find h ogden esquire lying asleep on his little cot bed i guess he had been overcome by anti insomnia or diswakefulness or some of the diseases peculiar to the sheep business his mouth and vest were open and he breathed like a second hand bicycle pump i looked at him and gave vent to just a few musings imperial caesar says i asleep in such a way might shut his mouth and keep the wind away a man asleep is certainly a sight to make angels weep what good is all his brain muscle backing nerve influence and family connections he s at the mercy of his enemies and more so of his friends and he s about as beautiful as a cab horse leaning against the metropolitan opera house at a m dreaming of the plains of arabia now a woman asleep you regard as different no matter how she looks you know it s better for all hands for her to be that way well i took a drink of bourbon and one for ogden and started in to be comfortable while he was taking his nap he had some books on his table on indigenous subjects such as japan and drainage and physical culture and some tobacco which seemed more to the point after i d smoked a few and listened to the sartorial breathing of h o i happened to look out the window toward the shearing pens where there was a kind of a road coming up from a kind of a road across a kind of a creek farther away i saw five men riding up to the house all of em carried guns across their saddles and among em was the deputy that had talked to me at my camp they rode up careful in open formation with their guns ready i set apart with my eye the one i opinionated

tend to him he s learning bad habits from the men it ll be the only chance he ll have to get any christmas the men went outside and conferred with bobby trinidad pictured the glories of the christmas tree and presents in lively colours and moreover my young friend added the judge santa claus himself will personally distribute the offerings that will typify the gifts conveyed by the shepherds of bethlehem to aw come off said the boy squinting his small eyes i ain t no kid there ain t any santa claus it s your folks that buys toys and sneaks em in when you re asleep and they make marks in the soot in the chimney with the tongs to look like santa s sleigh tracks that might be so argued trinidad but christmas trees ain t no fairy tale this one s goin to look like the ten cent store in albuquerque all strung up in a redwood there s tops and drums and noah s arks and oh rats said bobby wearily i cut them out long ago i d like to have a rifle not a target one a real one to shoot wildcats with but i guess you won t have any of them on your old tree well i can t say for sure said trinidad diplomatically it might be you go along with us and see the hope thus held out though faint won the boy s hesitating consent to go with this solitary beneficiary for cherokee s holiday bounty the canvassers spun along the homeward road in yellowhammer the empty storeroom had been transformed into what might have passed as the bower of an arizona fairy the ladies had done their work well a tall christmas tree covered to the topmost branch with candles spangles and toys sufficient for more than a score of children stood in the centre of the floor near sunset anxious eyes had begun to scan the street for the returning team of the child providers at noon that day cherokee had dashed into town with his new sleigh piled high with bundles and boxes and bales of all sizes and shapes so intent was he upon the arrangements for his altruistic plans that the dearth of children did not receive his notice no one gave away the humiliating state of yellowhammer for the efforts of trinidad and the judge were expected to supply the deficiency when the sun went down cherokee with many wings and arch grins on his seasoned face went into retirement with the bundle containing the santa claus raiment and a pack containing special and undisclosed gifts when the kids are rounded up he instructed the volunteer arrangement committee light up the candles on the tree and set em to playin pussy wants a corner and king william when they get good and at it why old santa ll slide in the door i reckon there ll be plenty of gifts to go round the ladies were flitting about the tree giving it final touches that were never final the spangled sisters were there in costume as lady violet de vere and marie the maid in their new drama the miner s bride the theatre did not open until nine and they were welcome assistants of the christmas tree committee every minute heads would pop out the door to look and listen for the approach of trinidad s team and now this became an anxious function for night had fallen and it would soon be necessary to light the candles on the tree and cherokee was apt to make an irruption at any time in his kriss kringle garb at length the wagon of the child rustlers rattled down the street to the door the ladies with little screams of excitement flew to the lighting of the candles the men of yellowhammer passed in and out restlessly or stood about the room in embarrassed groups trinidad and the judge bearing the marks of protracted travel entered conducting between them a single impish boy who stared with sullen pessimistic eyes at the gaudy tree where are the other children asked the assayer s wife the acknowledged leader of all social functions ma am said trinidad with a sigh prospectin for kids at christmas time is like huntin in a limestone for silver this parental business is one that i haven t no chance to comprehend it seems that fathers and mothers are willin for their offsprings to be drownded stole fed on poison oak and et by catamounts days in the year but on christmas day they insists on enjoyin the exclusive mortification of their company this here young biped ma am is all that washes out of our two days manoeuvres oh the sweet little boy cooed miss erma trailing her de vere robes to centre of stage aw shut up said bobby with a scowl who s a kid you ain t you bet fresh brat breathed miss erma beneath her enamelled smile we done the best we could said trinidad it s tough on cherokee but it can t be helped then the door opened and cherokee entered in the conventional dress of saint nick a white rippling beard and flowing hair covered his face almost to his dark and shining eyes over his shoulder he carried a pack no one stirred as he came in even the spangler sisters ceased their coquettish poses and stared curiously at the tall figure bobby stood with his hands in his pockets gazing gloomily at the effeminate and childish tree cherokee put down his pack and looked wonderingly about the room perhaps he fancied that a bevy of eager children were being herded somewhere to be loosed upon his entrance he went up to bobby and extended his red mittened hand merry christmas little boy said cherokee anything on the tree you want they ll get it down for you won t you

property through our advertisement out of that number something like thirty hundred will expect to give you in exchange if they should win you the carcass of a lazy and mercenary loafer a failure in life a swindler and contemptible fortune seeker me and andy says i propose to teach these preyers upon society a lesson it was with difficulty says i that me and andy could refrain from forming a corporation under the title of the great moral and millennial malevolent matrimonial agency does that satisfy you it does mr peters says she i might have known you wouldn t have gone into anything that wasn t opprobrious but what will my duties be do i have to reject personally these ramscallions you speak of or can i throw them out in bunches your job mrs trotter says i will be practically a cynosure you will live at a quiet hotel and will have no work to do andy and i will attend to all the correspondence and business end of it of course says i some of the more ardent and impetuous suitors who can raise the railroad fare may come to cairo to personally press their suit or whatever fraction of a suit they may be wearing in that case you will be probably put to the inconvenience of kicking them out face to face we will pay you per week and hotel expenses give me five minutes says mrs trotter to get my powder rag and leave the front door key with a neighbor and you can let my salary begin so i conveys mrs trotter to cairo and establishes her in a family hotel far enough away from mine and andy s quarters to be unsuspicious and available and i tell andy great says andy and now that your conscience is appeased as to the tangibility and proximity of the bait and leaving mutton aside suppose we revenoo a noo fish so we began to insert our advertisement in newspapers covering the country far and wide one ad was all we used we couldn t have used more without hiring so many clerks and marcelled paraphernalia that the sound of the gum chewing would have disturbed the postmaster general we placed in a bank to mrs trotter s credit and gave her the book to show in case anybody might question the honesty and good faith of the agency i knew mrs trotter was square and reliable and it was safe to leave it in her name with that one ad andy and me put in twelve hours a day answering letters about one hundred a day was what came in i never knew there was so many large hearted but indigent men in the country who were willing to acquire a charming widow and assume the burden of investing her money most of them admitted that they ran principally to whiskers and lost jobs and were misunderstood by the world but all of em were sure that they were so chock full of affection and manly qualities that the widow would be making the bargain of her life to get em every applicant got a reply from peters tucker informing him that the widow had been deeply impressed by his straightforward and interesting letter and requesting them to write again stating more particulars and enclosing photograph if convenient peters tucker also informed the applicant that their fee for handing over the second letter to their fair client would be enclosed therewith there you see the simple beauty of the scheme about per cent of them domestic foreign noblemen raised the price somehow and sent it in that was all there was to it except that me and andy complained an amount about being put to the trouble of slicing open them envelopes and taking the money out some few clients called in person we sent em to mrs trotter and she did the rest except for three or four who came back to strike us for carfare after the letters began to get in from the r f d districts andy and me were taking in about a day one afternoon when we were busiest and i was stuffing the two and ones into cigar boxes and andy was whistling no wedding bells for her a small slick man drops in and runs his eye over the walls like he was on the trail of a lost gainesborough painting or two as soon as i saw him i felt a glow of pride because we were running our business on the level i see you have quite a large mail to day says the man i reached and got my hat come on says i we ve been expecting you i ll show you the goods how was teddy when you left washington i took him down to the riverview hotel and had him shake hands with mrs trotter then i showed him her bank book with the to her credit it seems to be all right says the secret service it is says i and if you re not a married man i ll leave you to talk a while with the lady we won t mention the two dollars thanks says he if i wasn t i might good day mrs peters toward the end of three months we had taken in something over and we saw it was time to quit we had a good many complaints made to us and mrs trotter seemed to be tired of the job a good many suitors had been calling to see her and she didn t seem to like that so we decides to pull out and i goes down to mrs trotter s hotel to pay her last week s salary and say farewell and get her check for the when i got there i found her crying like a kid that don t want to go to school now now says

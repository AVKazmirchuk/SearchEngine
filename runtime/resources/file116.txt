twenty four dollars first cabin and ate at table with the officer crowd down on the lower deck was a gang of second class passengers about forty of them seemin to be dagoes and the like i wondered what so many of them were goin along for well then in three days we sailed alongside that guatemala twas a blue country and not yellow as tis miscolored on the map we landed at a town on the coast where a train of cars was waitin for us on a dinky little railroad the boxes on the steamer were brought ashore and loaded on the cars the gang of dagoes got aboard too the general and me in the front car yes me and general de vega headed the revolution as it pulled out of the seaport town that train travelled about as fast as a policeman goin to a riot it penetrated the most conspicuous lot of fuzzy scenery ever seen outside a geography we run some forty miles in seven hours and the train stopped there was no more railroad twas a sort of camp in a damp gorge full of wildness and melancholies they was grading and choppin out the forests ahead to continue the road here says i to myself is the romantic haunt of the revolutionists here will clancy by the virtue that is in a superior race and the inculcation of fenian tactics strike a tremendous blow for liberty they unloaded the boxes from the train and begun to knock the tops off from the first one that was open i saw general de vega take the winchester rifles and pass them around to a squad of morbid soldiery the other boxes was opened next and believe me or not divil another gun was to be seen every other box in the load was full of pickaxes and spades and then sorrow be upon them tropics the proud clancy and the dishonored dagoes each one of them had to shoulder a pick or a spade and march away to work on that dirty little railroad yes twas that the dagoes shipped for and twas that the filibusterin clancy signed for though unbeknownst to himself at the time in after days i found out about it it seems twas hard to get hands to work on that road the intelligent natives of the country was too lazy to work indeed the saints know twas unnecessary by stretchin out one hand they could seize the most delicate and costly fruits of the earth and by stretchin out the other they could sleep for days at a time without hearin a seven o clock whistle or the footsteps of the rent man upon the stairs so regular the steamers travelled to the united states to seduce labor usually the imported spade slingers died in two or three months from eatin the over ripe water and breathing the violent tropical scenery wherefore they made them sign contracts for a year when they hired them and put an armed guard over the poor devils to keep them from runnin away twas thus i was double crossed by the tropics through a family failing of goin out of the way to hunt disturbances they gave me a pick and i took it meditating an insurrection on the spot but there was the guards handling the winchesters careless and i come to the conclusion that discretion was the best part of filibusterin there was about a hundred of us in the gang starting out to work and the word was given to move i steps out of the ranks and goes up to that general de vega man who was smokin a cigar and gazin upon the scene with satisfactions and glory he smiles at me polite and devilish plenty work says he for big strong mans in guatemala yes thirty dollars in the month good pay ah yes you strong brave man bimeby we push those railroad in the capital very quick they want you go work now adios strong mans monseer says i lingerin will you tell a poor little irishman this when i set foot on your cockroachy steamer and breathed liberal and revolutionary sentiments into your sour wine did you think i was conspirin to sling a pick on your contemptuous little railroad and when you answered me with patriotic recitations humping up the star spangled cause of liberty did you have meditations of reducin me to the ranks of the stump grubbin dagoes in the chain gangs of your vile and grovelin country the general man expanded his rotundity and laughed considerable yes he laughed very long and loud and i clancy stood and waited comical mans he shouts at last so you will kill me from the laughing yes it is hard to find the brave strong mans to aid my country revolutions did i speak of r r revolutions not one word i say big strong man is need in guatemala so the mistake is of you you have looked in those one box containing those gun for the guard you think all boxes is contain gun no there is not war in guatemala but work yes good thirty dollar in the month you shall shoulder one pickaxe senor and dig for the liberty and prosperity of guatemala off to your work the guard waits for you little fat poodle dog of a brown man says i quiet but full of indignations and discomforts things shall happen to you maybe not right away but as soon as j clancy can formulate somethin in the way of repartee the boss of the gang orders us to work i tramps off with the dagoes and i hears the distinguished patriot and kidnapper laughin hearty as we go tis a sorrowful fact for eight weeks i built railroads for that misbehavin country i filibustered twelve hours a day with a heavy pick and a spade choppin away the

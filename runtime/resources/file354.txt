box car and closed the door stretched luxuriously upon the excelsior with the black bottle clasped closely to his breast his eyes closed and a foolish happy smile upon his terrible features chicken ruggles started upon his return trip undisturbed with the band of desperate bandits lying motionless awaiting the signal to attack the train pulled out from espina as its speed increased and the black

reformation a guard came to the prison shoe shop where jimmy valentine was assiduously stitching uppers and escorted him to the front office there the warden handed jimmy his pardon which had been signed that morning by the governor jimmy took it in a tired kind of way he had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence he had expected to stay only about three months at the longest when a man with as many friends on the outside as jimmy valentine had is received in the stir it is hardly worth while to cut his hair now valentine said the warden you ll go out in the morning brace up and make a man of yourself you re not a bad fellow at heart stop cracking safes and live straight me said jimmy in surprise why i never cracked a safe in my life oh no laughed the warden of course not let s see now how was it you happened to get sent up on that springfield job was it because you wouldn t prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high toned society or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you it s always one or the other with you innocent victims me said jimmy still blankly virtuous why warden i never was in springfield in my life take him back cronin said the warden and fix him up with outgoing clothes unlock him at seven in the morning and let him come to the bull pen better think over my advice valentine at a quarter past seven on the next morning jimmy stood in the warden s outer office he had on a suit of the villainously fitting ready made clothes and a pair of the stiff squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its

gave him a cigar and shook hands valentine was chronicled on the books pardoned by governor and mr james valentine walked out into the sunshine disregarding the song of the birds the waving green trees and the smell of the flowers jimmy headed straight for a restaurant there he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him from there he proceeded leisurely to the depot he tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door and boarded his train three hours set him down in a little town near the state line he went to the cafe of one mike dolan and shook hands with mike who was alone behind the bar sorry we couldn t make it sooner jimmy me boy said mike but we had that protest from springfield to buck against and the governor nearly balked feeling all right fine said jimmy got my key he got his key and went upstairs unlocking the door of a

himself in which he took pride over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at a place where they make such things for the profession in half an hour jimmy went down stairs and through the cafe he was now dressed in tasteful and well fitting clothes and carried his dusted and cleaned suit case in his hand got anything on asked mike dolan genially me said jimmy in a puzzled tone i don t understand i m representing the new york amalgamated short snap biscuit cracker and frazzled wheat company this statement delighted mike to such an extent that jimmy had to take a seltzer and milk on

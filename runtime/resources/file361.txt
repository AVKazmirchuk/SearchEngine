greeting to dorsey had been hello perry haven t skipped out with the boodle yet i see turner s way of counting the cash had been different too he would finger the packages of bills in a tired kind of way and then go into the vault and kick over a few sacks of silver and the thing was done halves and quarters and dimes not for sam turner no chicken feed for me he would say when they were set before him i m not in the agricultural department but then turner was a texan an old friend of the bank s president and had known dorsey since he was a baby while the examiner was counting the cash major thomas b kingman known to every one as major tom the president of the first national drove up to the side door with his old dun horse and buggy and came inside he saw the examiner busy with the money and going into the little pony corral as he called it in which his desk was railed off he began to look over his letters earlier a little incident had occurred that even the sharp eyes of the examiner had failed to notice when he had begun his work at the cash counter mr edlinger had winked significantly at roy wilson the youthful bank messenger and nodded his head slightly toward the front door roy understood got his hat and walked leisurely out with his collector s book under his arm once outside he made a bee line for the stockmen s national that bank was also getting ready to open no customers had as yet presented themselves say you people cried roy with the familiarity of youth and long acquaintance you want to get a move on you there s a new bank examiner over at the first and he s a stem winder he s counting nickles on perry and he s got the whole outfit bluffed mr edlinger gave me the tip to let you know mr buckley president of the stockmen s national a stout elderly man looking like a farmer dressed for sunday heard roy from his private office at the rear and called him has major kingman come down to the bank yet he asked of the boy yes sir he was just driving up as i left said roy i want you to take him a note put it into his own hands as soon as you get back mr buckley sat down and began to write roy returned and handed to major kingman the envelope containing the note the major read it folded it and slipped it into his vest pocket he leaned back in his chair for a few moments as if he were meditating deeply and then rose and went into the vault he came out with the bulky old fashioned leather note case stamped on the back in gilt letters bills discounted in this were the notes due the bank with their attached securities and the major in his rough way dumped the lot upon his desk and began to sort them over by this time nettlewick had finished his count of the cash his pencil fluttered like a swallow over the sheet of paper on which he had set his figures he opened his black wallet which seemed to be also a kind of secret memorandum book made a few rapid figures in it wheeled and transfixed dorsey with the glare of his spectacles that look seemed to say you re safe this time but cash all correct snapped the examiner he made a dash for the individual bookkeeper and for a few minutes there was a fluttering of ledger leaves and a sailing of balance sheets through the air how often do you balance your pass books he demanded suddenly er once a month faltered the individual bookkeeper wondering how many years they would give him all right said the examiner turning and charging upon the general bookkeeper who had the statements of his foreign banks and their reconcilement memoranda ready everything there was found to be all right then the stub book of the certificates of deposit flutter flutter zip zip check all right list of over drafts please thanks h m m unsigned bills of the bank next all right then came the cashier s turn and easy going mr edlinger rubbed his nose and polished his glasses nervously under the quick fire of questions concerning the circulation undivided profits bank real estate and stock ownership presently nettlewick was aware of a big man towering above him at his elbow a man sixty years of age rugged and hale with a rough grizzled beard a mass of gray hair and a pair of penetrating blue eyes that confronted the formidable glasses of the examiner without a flicker er major kingman our president er mr nettlewick said the cashier two men of very different types shook hands one was a finished product of the world of straight lines conventional methods and formal affairs the other was something freer wider and nearer to nature tom kingman had not been cut to any pattern he had been mule driver cowboy ranger soldier sheriff prospector and cattleman now when he was bank president his old comrades from the prairies of the saddle tent and trail found no change in him he had made his fortune when texas cattle were at the high tide of value and had organized the first national bank of san rosario in spite of his largeness of heart and sometimes unwise generosity toward his old friends the bank had prospered for major tom kingman knew men as well as he knew cattle of late years the cattle business had known a depression and the major s bank was one of the few whose losses had not been great and now said the examiner briskly pulling out his watch the last thing is the loans

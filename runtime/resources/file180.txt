of dante s imagination it is not an extravagant theory that the cabby s singleness of purpose and concentrated view of life are the results of the hansom s peculiar construction the cock of the roost sits aloft like jupiter on an unsharable seat holding your fate between two thongs of inconstant leather helpless ridiculous confined bobbing like a toy mandarin you sit like a rat in a trap you before whom butlers cringe on solid land and must squeak upward through a slit in your peripatetic sarcophagus to make your feeble wishes known then in a cab you are not even an occupant you are contents you are a cargo at sea and the cherub that sits up aloft has davy jones s street and number by heart one night there were sounds of revelry in the big brick tenement house next door but one to mcgary s family cafe the sounds seemed to emanate from the apartments of the walsh family the sidewalk was obstructed by an assortment of interested neighbours who opened a lane from time to time for a hurrying messenger bearing from mcgary s goods pertinent to festivity and diversion the sidewalk contingent was engaged in comment and discussion from which it made no effort to eliminate the news that norah walsh was being married in the fulness of time there was an eruption of the merry makers to the sidewalk the uninvited guests enveloped and permeated them and upon the night air rose joyous cries congratulations laughter and unclassified noises born of mcgary s oblations to the hymeneal scene close to the curb stood jerry o donovan s cab night hawk was jerry called but no more lustrous or cleaner hansom than his ever closed its doors upon point lace and november violets and jerry s horse i am within bounds when i tell you that he was stuffed with oats until one of those old ladies who leave their dishes unwashed at home and go about having expressmen arrested would have smiled yes smiled to have seen him among the shifting sonorous pulsing crowd glimpses could be had of jerry s high hat battered by the winds and rains of many years of his nose like a carrot battered by the frolicsome athletic progeny of millionaires and by contumacious fares of his brass buttoned green coat admired in the vicinity of mcgary s it was plain that jerry had usurped the functions of his cab and was carrying a load indeed the figure may be extended and he be likened to a bread waggon if we admit the testimony of a youthful spectator who was heard to remark jerry has got a bun from somewhere among the throng in the street or else out of the thin stream of pedestrians a young woman tripped and stood by the cab the professional hawk s eye of jerry caught the movement he made a lurch for the cab overturning three or four onlookers and himself no he caught the cap of a water plug and kept his feet like a sailor shinning up the ratlins during a squall jerry mounted to his professional seat once he was there mcgary s liquids were baffled he seesawed on the mizzenmast of his craft as safe as a steeple jack rigged to the flagpole of a skyscraper step in lady said jerry gathering his lines the young woman stepped into the cab the doors shut with a bang jerry s whip cracked in the air the crowd in the gutter scattered and the fine hansom dashed away crosstown when the oat spry horse had hedged a little his first spurt of speed jerry broke the lid of his cab and called down through the aperture in the voice of a cracked megaphone trying to please where now will ye be drivin to anywhere you please came up the answer musical and contented tis drivin for pleasure she is thought jerry and then he suggested as a matter of course take a thrip around in the park lady twill be ilegant cool and fine just as you like answered the fare pleasantly the cab headed for fifth avenue and sped up that perfect street jerry bounced and swayed in his seat the potent fluids of mcgary were disquieted and they sent new fumes to his head he sang an ancient song of killisnook and brandished his whip like a baton inside the cab the fare sat up straight on the cushions looking to right and left at the lights and houses even in the shadowed hansom her eyes shone like stars at twilight when they reached fifty ninth street jerry s head was bobbing and his reins were slack but his horse turned in through the park gate and began the old familiar nocturnal round and then the fare leaned back entranced and breathed deep the clean wholesome odours of grass and leaf and bloom and the wise beast in the shafts knowing his ground struck into his by the hour gait and kept to the right of the road habit also struggled successfully against jerry s increasing torpor he raised the hatch of his storm tossed vessel and made the inquiry that cabbies do make in the park like shtop at the cas sino lady gezzer r freshm s n lish n the music ev body shtops i think that would be nice said the fare they reined up with a plunge at the casino entrance the cab doors flew open the fare stepped directly upon the floor at once she was caught in a web of ravishing music and dazzled by a panorama of lights and colours some one slipped a little square card into her hand on which was

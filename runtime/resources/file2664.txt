old friend and he liked him he persuaded him to drink a cocktail i take the horehound tea said greenbrier for old times sake but i d prefer whiskey straight they re on you right said merritt now run your eye down that bill of fare and see if it seems to hitch on any of these items lay me on my lava bed said greenbrier with bulging eyes all these specimens of nutriment in the grub wagon what s this horse with the heaves i pass but look along here s truck for twenty roundups all spelled out in different directions wait till i see the viands ordered merritt turned to the wine list this medoc isn t bad he suggested you re the doc said greenbrier i d rather have whiskey straight it s on you greenbrier looked around the room the waiter brought things and took dishes away he was observing he saw a new york restaurant crowd enjoying itself how was the range when you left the gila asked merritt fine said greenbrier you see that lady in the red speckled silk at that table well she could warm over her beans at my campfire yes the range was good she looks as nice as a white mustang i see once on black river when the coffee came greenbrier put one foot on the seat of the chair next to him you said it was a comfortable town longy he said meditatively yes it s a comfortable town it s different from the plains in a blue norther what did you call that mess in the crock with the handle longy oh yes squabs in a cash roll they re worth the roll that white mustang had just such a way of turning his head and shaking his mane look at her longy if i thought i could sell out my ranch at a fair price i believe i d gyar song he suddenly cried in a voice that paralyzed every knife and fork in the restaurant the waiter dived toward the table two more of them cocktail drinks ordered greenbrier merritt looked at him and smiled significantly they re on me said greenbrier blowing a puff of smoke to the ceiling the unknown quantity the poet longfellow or was it confucius the inventor of wisdom remarked life is real life is earnest and things are not what they seem as mathematics are or is thanks old subscriber the only just rule by which questions of life can be measured let us by all means adjust our theme to the straight edge and the balanced column of the great goddess two and two makes four figures unassailable sums in addition shall be set over against whatever oposing element there may be a mathematician after scanning the above two lines of poetry would say ahem young gentlemen if we assume that x plus that is that life is real then things all of which life includes are real anything that is real is what it seems then if we consider the proposition that things are not what they seem why but this is heresy and not poesy we woo the sweet nymph algebra we would conduct you into the presence of the elusive seductive pursued satisfying mysterious x not long before the beginning of this century septimus kinsolving an old new yorker invented an idea he originated the discovery that bread is made from flour and not from wheat futures perceiving that the flour crop was short and that the stock exchange was having no perceptible effect on the growing wheat mr kinsolving cornered the flour market the result was that when you or my landlady before the war she never had to turn her hand to anything southerners accomodated bought a five cent load of bread you laid down an additional two cents which went to mr kinsolving as a testimonial to his perspicacity a second result was that mr kinsolving quit the game with prof er rake off mr kinsolving s son dan was at college when the mathematical experiment in breadstuffs was made dan came home during vacation and found the old gentleman in a red dressing gown reading little dorrit on the porch of his estimable red brick mansion in washington square he had retired from business with enough extra two cent pieces from bread buyers to reach if laid side by side fifteen times around the earth and lap as far as the public debt of paraguay dan shook hands with his father and hurried over to greenwich village to see his old high school friend kenwitz dan had always admired kenwitz kenwitz was pale curly haired intense serious mathematical studious altruistic socialistic and the natural foe of oligarchies kenwitz had foregone college and was learning watch making in his father s jewelry store dan was smiling jovial easy tempered and tolerant alike of kings and ragpickers the two foregathered joyously being opposites and then dan went back to college and kenwitz to his mainsprings and to his private library in the rear of the jewelry shop four years later dan came back to washington square with the accumulations of b a and two years of europe thick upon him he took a filial look at septimus kinsolving s elaborate tombstone in greenwood and a tedious excursion through typewritten documents with the family lawyer and then feeling himself a lonely and hopeless millionaire hurried down to the old jewelry store across sixth avenue kenwitz unscrewed a magnifying glass from his eye routed out his parent from a dingy rear room and abandoned the interior of watches for outdoors he went with dan and they sat on a bench in washington square dan had not changed much he was stalwart and had a dignity that was inclined to relax into a grin kenwitz was more serious more intense more learned philosophical and socialistic i know about it now said dan finally i pumped it out of the eminent legal lights that turned over to me poor old dad s collections of bonds and boodle it amounts to ken and i am told that he squeezed it out of the chaps that pay their pennies for loaves of bread at little bakeries around the corner you ve studied economics dan and you know all about monopolies and the masses and octopuses and the rights of laboring people i never thought about those things before football and trying to be white to my fellowman were about the extent of my college curriculum but since i came back and found out how dad made his money i ve been thinking i d like awfully well to pay back those chaps who had to give up too much money for bread i know it would buck the line of my income for a good many yards but i d like to make it square with em is there any way it can be done old ways and means kenwitz s big black eyes glowed fierily his thin intellectual face took on almost a sardonic cast he caught dan s arm with the grip of a friend and a judge you can t do it he said emphatically one of the chief punishments of you men of ill gotten wealth is that when you do repent you find that you have lost the power to make reparation or restitution i admire your good intentions dan but you can t do anything those people were robbed of their precious pennies it s too late to remedy the evil you can t pay them back of course said dan lighting his pipe we couldn t hunt up every one of the duffers and hand em back the right change there s an awful lot of em buying bread all the time funny taste they have i never cared for bread especially except for a toasted cracker with the roquefort but we might find a few of em and chuck some of dad s cash back where it came from i d feel better if i could it seems tough for people to be held up for a soggy thing like bread one wouldn t mind standing a rise in broiled lobsters or deviled crabs get to work and think ken i want to pay back all that money i can there are plenty of charities said kenwitz mechanically easy enough said dan in a cloud of smoke i suppose i could give the city a park or endow an asparagus bed in a hospital but i don t want paul to get away with the proceeds of the gold brick we sold peter it s the bread shorts i want to cover ken the thin fingers of kenwitz moved rapidly do you know how much money it would take to pay back the losses of consumers during that corner in flour he asked i do not said dan stoutly my lawyer tells me that i have two millions if you had a hundred millions said kenwitz vehemently you couldn t repair a thousandth part of the damage that has been done you cannot conceive of the accumulated evils produced by misapplied wealth each penny that was wrung from the lean purses of the poor reacted a thousandfold to their harm you do not understand you do not see how hopeless is your desire to make restitution not in a single instance can it be done back up philosopher said dan the penny has no sorrow that the dollar cannot heal not in one instance repeated kenwitz i will give you one and let us see thomas boyne had a little bakery over there in varick street he sold bread to the poorest people when the price of flour went up he had to raise the price of bread his customers were too poor to pay it boyne s business failed and he lost his capital all he had in the world dan kinsolving struck the park bench a mighty blow with his fist i accept the instance he cried take me to boyne i will repay his thousand dollars and buy him a new bakery write your check said kenwitz without moving and then begin to write checks in payment of the train of consequences draw the next one for boyne went insane after his failure and set fire to the building from which he was about to be evicted the loss amounted to that much boyne died in an asylum stick to the instance said dan i haven t noticed any insurance companies on my charity list draw your next check for went on kenwitz boyne s son fell into bad way after the bakery closed and was accused of murder he was acquitted last week after a three years legal battle and the state draws upon taxpayers for that much expense back to the bakery exclaimed dan impatiently the government doesn t need to stand in the bread line the last item of the instance is come and i will show you said kenwitz rising the socialistic watchmaker was happy he was a millionaire baiter by nature and a pessimist by trade kenwitz would assure you in one breath that money was but evil and corruption and that your brand new watch needed cleaning and a new ratchet wheel he conducted kinsolving southward out of the square and into ragged poverty haunted varick street up the narrow stairway of a squalid brick tenement he led the penitent offspring of the octupus he knocked on a door and a clear voice called to them to enter in that almost bare room a young woman sat sewing at a machine she nodded to kenwitz as to a familiar acquaintance one little stream of sunlight through the dingy window burnished her heavy hair to the color of an ancient tuscan s shield she flashed a rippling smile at kenwitz and a look of somewhat flustered inquiry kinsolving stood regarding her clear and pathetic beauty in heart throbbing silence thus they came into the presence of the last item of the instance how many this week miss mary asked the watchmaker a mountain of coarse gray shirts lay upon the floor nearly thirty dozen said the young woman cheerfully i ve made almost i m improving mr kenwitz i hardly know what to do with so much money her eyes turned brightly soft in the direction of dan a little pink spot came out on her round pale cheek kenwitz chuckled like a diabolic raven miss boyne he said let me present mr kinsolving the son of the man who put bread up five years ago he thinks he would like to do something to aid those who where inconvenienced by that act the smile left the young woman s face she rose and pointed her forefinger toward the door this time she looked kinsolving straight in the eye but it was not a look that gave delight the two men went down varick street kenwitz letting all his pessimism and rancor and hatred of the octopus come to the surface gibed at the moneyed side of his friend in an acrid torrent of words dan appeared to be listening and then turned to kenwitz and shook hands with him warmly i m obliged to you ken old man he said vaguely a thousand times obliged mein gott you are crazy cried the watchmaker dropping his spectacles for the first time in years two months afterward kenwitz went into a large bakery on lower broadway with a pair of gold rimmed eyeglasses that he had mended for the proprietor a lady was giving an order to a clerk as kenwitz passed her these loaves are ten cents said the clerk i always get them at eight cents uptown said the lady you need not fill the order i will drive by there on my way home the voice was familiar the watchmaker paused mr kenwitz cried the lady heartily how do you do kenwitz was trying to train his socialistic and economic comprehension on her wonderful fur boa and the carriage waiting outside why miss boyne he began mrs kinsolving she corrected dan and i were married a month ago the thing s the play being acquainted with a newspaper reporter who had a couple of free passes i got to see the performance a few nights ago at one of the popular vaudeville houses one of the numbers was a violin solo by a striking looking man not much past forty but with very gray thick hair not being afflicted with a taste for music i let the system of noises drift past my ears while i regarded the man there was a story about that chap a month or two ago said the reporter they gave me the assignment it was to run a column and was to be on the extremely light and joking order the old man seems to like the funny touch i give to local happenings oh yes i m working on a farce comedy now well i went down to the house and got all the details but i certainly fell down on that job i went back and turned in a comic write up of an east side funeral instead why oh i couldn t seem to get hold of it with my funny hooks somehow maybe you could make a one act tragedy out of it for a curtain raiser i ll give you the details after the performance my friend the reporter recited to me the facts over w urzburger i see no reason said i when he had concluded why that shouldn t make a rattling good funny story those three people couldn t have acted in a more absurd and preposterous manner if they had been real actors in a real theatre i m really afraid that all the stage is a world anyhow and all the players men and women the thing s the play is the way i quote mr shakespeare try it said the reporter i will said i and i did to show him how he could have made a humorous column of it for his paper there stands a house near abingdon square on the ground floor there has been for twenty five years a little store where toys and notions and stationery are sold one night twenty years ago there was a wedding in the rooms above the store the widow mayo owned the house and store her daughter helen was married to frank barry john delaney was best man helen was eighteen and her picture had been printed in a morning paper next to the headlines of a wholesale female murderess story from butte mont but after your eye and intelligence had rejected the connection you seized your magnifying glass and read beneath the portrait her description as one of a series of prominent beauties and belles of the lower west side frank barry and john delaney were prominent young beaux of the same side and bosom friends whom you expected to turn upon each other every time the curtain went up one who pays his money for orchestra seats and fiction expects this that is the first funny idea that has turned up in the story yet both had made a great race for helen s hand when frank won john shook his hand and congratulated him honestly he did after the ceremony helen ran upstairs to put on her hat she was getting married in a traveling dress she and frank were going to old point comfort for a week downstairs the usual horde of gibbering cave dwellers were waiting with their hands full of old congress gaiters and paper bags of hominy then there was a rattle of the fire escape and into her room jumps the mad and infatuated john delaney with a damp curl drooping upon his forehead and made violent and reprehensible love to his lost one entreating her to flee or fly with him to the riviera or the bronx or any old place where there are italian skies and dolce far niente it would have carried blaney off his feet to see helen repulse him with blazing and scornful eyes she fairly withered him by demanding whatever he meant by speaking to respectable people that way in a few moments she had him going the manliness that had possessed him departed he bowed low and said something about irresistible impulse and forever carry in his heart the memory of and she suggested that he catch the first fire escape going down i will away said john delaney to the furthermost parts of the earth i cannot remain near you and know that you are another s i will to africa and there amid other scenes strive to for for goodness sake get out said helen somebody might come in he knelt upon one knee and she extended him one white hand that he might give it a farewell kiss girls was this choice boon of the great little god cupid ever vouchsafed you to have the fellow you want hard and fast and have the one you don t want come with a damp curl on his forehead and kneel to you and babble of africa and love which in spite of everything shall forever bloom an amaranth in his heart to know your power and to feel the sweet security of your own happy state to send the unlucky one broken hearted to foreign climes while you congratulate yourself as he presses his last kiss upon your knuckles that your nails are well manicured say girls it s galluptious don t ever let it get by you and then of course how did you guess it the door opened and in stalked the bridegroom jealous of slow tying bonnet strings the farewell kiss was imprinted upon helen s hand and out of the window and down the fire escape sprang john delaney africa bound a little slow music if you please faint violin just a breath in the clarinet and a touch of the cello imagine the scene frank white hot with the cry of a man wounded to death bursting from him helen rushing and clinging to him trying to explain he catches her wrists and tears them from his shoulders once twice thrice he sways her this way and that the stage manager will show you how and throws her from him to the floor a huddled crushed moaning thing never he cries will he look upon her face again and rushes from the house through the staring groups of astonished guests and now because it is the thing instead of the play the audience must stroll out into the real lobby of the world and marry die grow gray rich poor happy or sad during the intermission of twenty years which must precede the rising of the curtain again mrs barry inherited the shop and the house at thirty eight she could have bested many an eighteen year old at a beauty show on points and general results only a few people remembered her wedding comedy but she made of it no secret she did not pack it in lavender or moth balls nor did she sell it to a magazine one day a middle aged money making lawyer who bought his legal cap and ink of her asked her across the counter to marry him i m really much obliged to you said helen cheerfully but i married another man twenty years ago he was more a goose than a man but i think i love him yet i have never seen him since about half an hour after the ceremony was it copying ink that you wanted or just writing fluid the lawyer bowed over the counter with old time grace and left a respectful kiss on the back of her hand helen sighed parting salutes however romantic may be overdone here she was at thirty eight beautiful and admired and all that she seemed to have got from her lovers were approaches and adieus worse still in the last one she had lost a customer too business languished and she hung out a room to let card two large rooms on the third floor were prepared for desirable tenants roomers came and went regretfully for the house of mrs barry was the abode of neatness comfort and taste one day came ramonti the violinist and engaged the front room above the discord and clatter uptown offended his nice ear so a friend had sent him to this oasis in the desert of noise ramonti with his still youthful face his dark eyebrows his short pointed foreign brown beard his distinguished head of gray hair and his artist s temperament revealed in his light gay and sympathetic manner was a welcome tenant in the old house near abingdon square helen lived on the floor above the store the architecture of it was singular and quaint the hall was large and almost square up one side of it and then across the end of it ascended an open stairway to the floor above this hall space she had furnished as a sitting room and office combined there she kept her desk and wrote her business letters and there she sat of evenings by a warm fire and a bright red light and sewed or read ramonti found the atmosphere so agreeable that he spent much time there describing to mrs barry the wonders of paris where he had studied with a particularly notorious and noisy fiddler next comes lodger no a handsome melancholy man in the early s with a brown mysterious beard and strangely pleading haunting eyes he too found the society of helen a desirable thing with the eyes of romeo and othello s tongue he charmed her with tales of distant climes and wooed her by respectful innuendo from the first helen felt a marvelous and compelling thrill in the presence of this man his voice somehow took her swiftly back to the days of her youth s romance this feeling grew and she gave way to it and it led her to an instinctive belief that he had been a factor in that romance and then with a woman s reasoning oh yes they do sometimes she leaped over common syllogism and theory and logic and was sure that her husband had come back to her for she saw in his eyes love which no woman can mistake and a thousand tons of regret and remorse which aroused pity which is perilously near to love requited which is the sine qua non in the house that jack built but she made no sign a husband who steps around the corner for twenty years and then drops in again should not expect to find his slippers laid out too conveniently near nor a match ready lighted for his cigar there must be expiation explanation and possibly execration a little purgatory and then maybe if he were properly humble he might be trusted with a harp and crown and so she made no sign that she knew or suspected and my friend the reporter could see nothing funny in this sent out on an assignment to write up a roaring hilarious brilliant joshing story of but i will not knock a brother let us go on with the story one evening ramonti stopped in helen s hall office reception room and told his love with the tenderness and ardor of the enraptured artist his words were a bright flame of the divine fire that glows in the heart of a man who is a dreamer and doer combined but before you give me an answer he went on before she could accuse him of suddenness i must tell you that ramonti is the only name i have to offer you my manager gave me that i do not know who i am or where i came from my first recollection is of opening my eyes in a hospital i was a young man and i had been there for weeks my life before that is a blank to me they told me that i was found lying in the street with a wound on my head and was brought there in an ambulance they thought i must have fallen and struck my head upon the stones there was nothing to show who i was i have never been able to remember after i was discharged from the hospital i took up the violin i have had success mrs barry i do not know your name except that i love you the first time i saw you i realized that you were the one woman in the world for me and oh a lot of stuff like that helen felt young again first a wave of pride and a sweet little thrill of vanity went all over her and then she looked ramonti in the eyes and a tremendous throb went through her heart she hadn t expected that throb it took her by surprise the musician had become a big factor in her life and she hadn t been aware of it mr ramonti she said sorrowfully this was not on the stage remember it was in the old home near abingdon square i m awfully sorry but i m a married woman and then she told him the sad story of her life as a heroine must do sooner or later either to a theatrical manager or to a reporter ramonti took her hand bowed low and kissed it and went up to his room helen sat down and looked mournfully at her hand well she might three suitors had kissed it mounted their red roan steeds and ridden away in an hour entered the mysterious stranger with the haunting eyes helen was in the willow rocker knitting a useless thing in cotton wool he ricocheted from the stairs and stopped for a chat sitting across the table from her he also poured out his narrative of love and then he said helen do you not remember me i think i have seen it in your eyes can you forgive the past and remember the love that has lasted for twenty years i wronged you deeply i was afraid to come back to you but my love overpowered my reason can you will you forgive me helen stood up the mysterious stranger held one of her hands in a strong and trembling clasp there she stood and i pity the stage that it has not acquired a scene like that and her emotions to portray for she stood with a divided heart the fresh unforgettable virginal love for her bridegroom was hers the treasured sacred honored memory of her first choice filled half her soul she leaned to that pure feeling honor and faith and sweet abiding romance bound her to it but the other half of her heart and soul was filled with something else a later fuller nearer influence and so the old fought against the new and while she hesitated from the room above came the soft racking petitionary music of a violin the hag music bewitches some of the noblest the daws may peck upon one s sleeve without injury but whoever wears his heart upon his tympanum gets it not far from the neck this music and the musician caller her and at her side honor and the old love held her back forgive me he pleaded twenty years is a long time to remain away from the one you say you love she declared with a purgatorial touch how could i tell he begged i will conceal nothing from you that night when he left i followed him i was mad with jealousy on a dark street i struck him down he did not rise i examined him his head had struck a stone i did not intend to kill him i was mad with love and jealousy i hid near by and saw an ambulance take him away although you married him helen who are you cried the woman with wide open eyes snatching her hand away don t you remember me helen the one who has always loved you best i am john delaney if you can forgive but she was gone leaping stumbling hurrying flying up the stairs toward the music and him who had forgotten but who had known her for his in each of his two existences and as she climbed up she sobbed cried and sang frank frank frank three mortals thus juggling with years as though they were billiard balls and my friend the reporter couldn t see anything funny in it a ramble in aphasia my wife and i parted on that morning in precisely our usual manner she left her second cup of tea to follow me to the front door there she plucked from my lapel the invisible strand of lint the universal act of woman to proclaim ownership and bade me to take care of my cold i had no cold next came her kiss of parting the lever kiss of domesticity flavored with young hyson there was no fear of the extemporaneous of variety spicing her infinite custom with the deft touch of long malpractice she dabbed awry my well set scarf pin and then as i closed the door i heard her morning slippers pattering back to her cooling tea when i set out i had no thought or premonition of what was to occur the attack came suddenly for many weeks i had been toiling almost night and day at a famous railroad law case that i won triumphantly but a few days previously in fact i had been digging away at the law almost without cessation for many years once or twice good doctor volney my friend and physician had warned me if you don t slacken up belford he said you ll go suddenly to pieces either your nerves or your brain will give way tell me does a week pass in which you do not read in the papers of a case of aphasia of some man lost wandering nameless with his past and his identity blotted out and all from that little brain clot made by overwork or worry i always thought said i that the clot in those instances was really to be found on the brains of the newspaper reporters doctor volney shook his head the disease exists he said you need a change or a rest court room office and home there is the only route you travel for recreation you read law books better take warning in time on thursday nights i said defensively my wife and i play cribbage on sundays she reads to me the weekly letter from her mother that law books are not a recreation remains yet to be established that morning as i walked i was thinking of doctor volney s words i was feeling as well as i usually did possibly in better spirits than usual i woke with stiff and cramped muscles from having slept long on the incommodious seat of a day coach i leaned my head against the seat and tried to think after a long time i said to myself i must have a name of some sort i searched my pockets not a card not a letter not a paper or monogram could i find but i found in my coat pocket nearly in bills of large denomination i must be some one of course i repeated to myself and began again to consider the car was well crowded with men among whom i told myself there must have been some common interest for they intermingled freely and seemed in the best good humor and spirits one of them a stout spectacled gentleman enveloped in a decided odor of cinnamon and aloes took the vacant half of my seat with a friendly nod and unfolded a newspaper in the intervals between his periods of reading we conversed as travelers will on current affairs i found myself able to sustain the conversation on such subjects with credit at least to my memory by and by my companion said you are one of us of course fine lot of men the west sends in this time i m glad they held the convention in new york i ve never been east before my name s r p bolder bolder son of hickory grove missouri though unprepared i rose to the emergency as men will when put to it now must i hold a christening and be at once babe parson and parent my senses came to the rescue of my slower brain the insistent odor of drugs from my compainion supplied one idea a glance at his newspaper where my eye met a conspicuous advertisement assisted me further my name said i glibly is edward pinkhammer i am a druggist and my home is in cornopolis kansas i knew you were a druggist said my fellow traveler affably i saw the callous spot on your right forefinger where the handle of the pestle rubs of course you are a delegate to our national convention are all these men druggists i asked wonderingly they are this car came through from the west and they re your old time druggists too none of your patent tablet and granule pharmashootists that use slot machines instead of a prescription desk we percolate our own paregoric and roll our own pills and we ain t above handling a few garden seeds in the spring and carrying a side line of confectionery and shoes i tell you hampinker i ve got an idea to spring on this convention new ideas is what they want now you know the shelf bottles of tartar emetic and rochelle salt ant et pot tart and sod et pot tart one s poison you know and the other s harmless it s easy to mistake one label for the other where do druggists mostly keep em why as far apart as possible on different shelves that s wrong i say keep em side by side so when you want one you can always compare it with the other and avoid mistakes do you catch the idea it seems to me a very good one i said all right when i spring it on the convention you back it up we ll make some of these eastern orange phosphate and massage cream professors that think they re the only lozenges in the market look like hypodermic tablets if i can be of any aid i said warming the two bottles of er tartrate of antimony and potash and tartrate of soda and potash shall henceforth sit side by side i concluded firmly now there s another thing said mr bolder for an excipient in manipulating a pill mass which do you prefer the magnesia carbonate or the pulverised glycerrhiza radix the er magnesia i said it was easier to say than the other word mr bolder glanced at me distrustfully through his spectacles give me the glycerrhiza said he magnesia cakes here s another one of these fake aphasia cases he said presently handing me his newspaper and laying his finger upon an article i don t believe in em i put nine out of ten of em down as frauds a man gets sick of his business and his folks and wants to have a good time he skips out somewhere and when they find him he pretends to have lost his memory don t know his own name and won t even recognize the strawberry mark on his wife s left shoulder aphasia tut why can t they stay at home and forget i took the paper and read after the pungent headlines the following denver june elwyn c belford a prominent lawyer is mysteriously missing from his home since three days ago and all efforts to locate him have been in vain mr bellford is a well known citizen of the highest standing and has enjoyed a large and lucrative law practice he is married and owns a fine home and the most extensive private library in the state on the day of his disappearance he drew quite a large sum of money from his bank no one can be found who saw him after he left the bank mr bellford was a man of singularly quiet and domestic tastes and seemed to find his happiness in his home and profession if any clue at all exists to his strange disappearance it my be found in the fact that for some months he has been deeply absorbed in an important law case in connection with the q y and z railroad company it is feared that overwork may have affected his mind every effort is being made to discover the whereabouts of the missing man it seems to me you are not altogether uncynical mr bolder i said after i had read the despatch this has the sound to me of a genuine case why should this man prosperous happily married and respected choose suddenly to abandon everything i know that these lapses of memory do occur and that men do find themselves adrift without a name a history or a home oh gammon and jalap said mr bolder it s larks they re after there s too much education nowadays men know about aphasia and they use it for an excuse the women are wise too when it s all over they look you in the eye as scientific as you please and say he hypnotized me thus mr bolder diverted but did not aid me with his comments and philosophy we arrived in new york about ten at night i rode in a cab to a hotel and i wrote my name edward pinkhammer in the register as i did so i felt pervade me a splendid wild intoxicating buoyancy a sense of unlimited freedom of newly attained possibilities i was just born into the world the old fetters whatever they had been were stricken from my hands and feet the future lay before me a clear road such as an infant enters and i could set out upon it equipped with a man s learning and experience i thought the hotel clerk looked at me five seconds too long i had no baggage the druggists convention i said my trunk has somehow failed to arrive i drew out a roll of money ah said he showing an auriferous tooth we have quite a number of the western delegates stopping here he struck a bell for the boy i endeavored to give color to my r ole there is an important movement on foot among us westerners i said in regard to a recommendation to the convention that the bottles containing the tartrate of antimoney and potash and the tartrate of sodium and potash be kept in a contiguous position on the shelf gentleman to three fourteen said the clerk hastily i was whisked away to my room the next day i bought a trunk and clothing and began to live the life of edward pinkhammer i did not tax my brain with endeavors to solve problems of the past it was a piquant and sparkling cup that the great island city held up to my lips i drank of it gratefully the keys of manhattan belong to him who is able to bear them you must be either the city s guest or its victim the following few days were as gold and silver edward pinkhammer yet counting back to his birth by hours only knew the rare joy of having come upon so diverting a world full fledged and unrestrained i sat entranced on the magic carpets provided in theatres and roof gardens that transported one into strange and delightful lands full of frolicsome music pretty girls and grotesque drolly extravagant parodies upon human kind i went here and there at my own dear will bound by no limits of space time or comportment i dined in weird cabarets at weirder tables d h te to the sound of hungarian music and the wild shouts of mercurial artists and sculptors or again where the night life quivers in the electric glare like a kinetoscopic picture and the millinery of the world and its jewels and the ones whom they adorn and the men who make all three possible are met for good cheer and the spectacular effect and among all these scenes that i have mentioned i learned one thing that i never knew before and that is that the key to liberty is not in the hands of license but convention holds it comity has a toll gate at which you must pay or you may not enter the land of freedom in all the glitter the seeming disorder the parade the abandon i saw this law unobtrusive yet like iron prevail therefore in manhattan you must obey these unwritten laws and then you will be freest of the free if you decline to be bound by them you put on shackles sometimes as my mood urged me i would seek the stately softly murmuring palm rooms redolent with high born life and delicate restraint in which to dine again i would go down to the waterways in steamers packed with vociferous bedecked unchecked love making clerks and shop girls to their crude pleasures on the island shores and there was always broadway glistening opulent wily varying desirable broadway growing upon one like an opium habit one afternoon as i entered my hotel a stout man with a big nose and a black mustache blocked my way in the corridor when i would have passed around him he greet me with offensive familiarity hello bellford he cried loudly what the deuce are you doing in new york didn t know anything could drag you away from that old book den of yours is mrs b along or is this a little business run alone eh you have made a mistake sir i said coldly releasing my hand from his grasp my name is pinkhammer you will excuse me the man dropped to one side apparently astonished as i walked to the clerk s desk i heard him call to a bell boy and say something about telegraph blanks you will give me my bill i said to the clerk and have my baggage brought down in half an hour i do not care to remain where i am annoyed by confidence men i moved that afternoon to another hotel a sedate old fashioned one on lower fifth avenue there was a restaurant a little way off broadway where one could be served almost al fresco in a tropic array of screening flora quiet and luxury and a perfect service made it an ideal place in which to take luncheon or refreshment one afternoon i was there picking my way to a table among the ferns when i felt my sleeve caught mr bellford exclaimed an amazingly sweet voice i turned quickly to see a lady seated alone a lady of about thirty with exceedingly handsome eyes who looked at me as though i had been her very dear friend you were about to pass me she said accusingly don t tell me you do not know me why should we not shake hands at least once in fifteen years i shook hands with her at once i took a chair opposite her at the table i summoned with my eyebrows a hovering waiter the lady was philandering with an orange ice i ordered a cr me de menthe her hair was reddish bronze you could not look at it because you could not look away from her eyes but you were conscious of it as you are conscious of sunset while you look into the profundities of a wood at twilight are you sure you know me i asked no she said smiling i was never sure of that what would you think i said a little anxiously if i were to tell you that my name is edward pinkhammer from cornopolis kansas what would i think she repeated with a merry glance why that you had not brought mrs bellford to new york with you of course i do wish you had i would have liked to see marian her voice lowered slightly you haven t changed much elwyn i felt her wonderful eyes searching mine and my face more closely yes you have she amended and there was a soft exultant note in her latest tones i see it now you haven t forgotten you haven t forgotten for a year or a day or an hour i told you you never could i poked my straw anxiously in the cr me de menthe i m sure i beg your pardon i said a little uneasy at her gaze but that is just the trouble i have forgotten i ve forgotten everything she flouted my denial she laughed deliciously at something she seemed to see in my face i ve heard of you at times she went on you re quite a big lawyer out west denver isn t it or los angeles marian must be very proud of you you knew i suppose that i married six months after you did you may have seen it in the papers the flowers alone cost two thousand dollars she had mentioned fifteen years fifteen years is a long time would it be too late i asked somewhat timorously to offer you congratulations not if you dare do it she answered with such fine intrepidity that i was silent and began to crease patterns on the cloth with my thumb nail tell me one thing she said leaning toward me rather eagerly a thing i have wanted to know for many years just from a woman s curiosity of course have you ever dared since that night to touch smell or look at white roses at white roses wet with rain and dew i took a sip of cr me de menthe it would be useless i suppose i said with a sigh for me to repeat that i have no recollection at all about these things my memory is completely at fault i need not say how much i regret it the lady rested her arms upon the table and again her eyes disdained my words and went traveling by their own route direct to my soul she laughed softly with a strange quality in the sound it was a laugh of happiness yes and of content and of misery i tried to look away from her you lie elwyn bellford she breathed blissfully oh i know you lie i gazed dully into the ferns my name is edward pinkhammer i said i came with the delegates to the druggists national convention there is a movement on foot for arranging a new position for the bottles of tartrate of antimony and tartrate of potash in which very likely you would take little interest a shining landau stopped before the entrance the lady rose i took her hand and bowed i am deeply sorry i said to her that i cannot remember i could explain but fear you would not understand you will not concede pinkhammer and i really cannot at all conceive of the the roses and other things good by mr bellford she said with her happy sorrowful smile as she stepped into her carriage i attended the theatre that night when i returned to my hotel a quiet man in dark clothes who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief appeared magically at my side mr pinkhammer he said giving the bulk of his attention to his forefinger may i request you to step aside with me for a little conversation there is a room here certainly i answered he conducted me into a small private parlor a lady and a gentleman were there the lady i surmised would have been unusually good looking had her features not been clouded by an expression of keen worry and fatigue she was of a style of figure and possessed coloring and features that were agreeable to my fancy she was in a traveling dress she fixed upon me an earnest look of extreme anxiety and pressed an unsteady hand to her bosom i think she would have started forward but the gentleman arrested her movement with an authoritative motion of his hand he then came himself to meet me he was a man of forty a little gray about the temples and with a strong thoughtful face bellford old man he said cordially i m glad to see you again of course we know everything is all right i warned you you know that you were overdoing it now you ll go back with us and be yourself again in no time i smiled ironically i havae been bellforded so often i said that it has lost its edge still in the end it may grow wearisome would you be willing at all to entertain the hypothesis that my name is edward pinkhammer and that i never saw you before in my life before the man could reply a wailing cry came from the woman she sprang past his detaining arm elwyn she sobbed and cast herself upon me and clung tight elwyn she cried again don t break my heart i am your wife call my name once just once i could see you dead rather than this way i unwound her arms respectfully but firmly madam i said severely pardon me if i suggest that you accept a resemblance too precipitately it is a pity i went on with an amused laugh as the thought occurred to me that this bellford and i could not be kept side by side upon the same shelf like tartrates of sodium and antimony for purposes of identification in order to understand the allusion i concluded airily it may be necessary for you to keep an eye on the proceedings of the druggists national convention the lady turned to her companion and grasped his arm what is it doctor volney oh what is it she moaned go to your room for a while i heard him say i will remain and talk with him his mind no i think not only a portion of the brain yes i am sure he will recover go to your room and leave me with him the lady disappeared the man in dark clothes also went outside still manicuring himself in a thoughtful way i think he waited in the hall i would like to talk with you a while mr pinkhammer if i may said the gentleman who remained very well if you care to i replied and will excuse me if i take it comfortably i am rather tired i stretched myself upon a couch by a window and lit a cigar he drew a chair nearby let us speak to the point he said soothingly your name is not pinkhammer i know that as well as you do i said coolly but a man must have a name of some sort i can assure you that i do not extravagantly admire the name of pinkhammer but when one christens one s self suddenly the fine names do not seem to suggest themselves but suppose it had been scheringhausen or scroggins i think i did very well with pinkhammer your name said the other man seriously is elwyn c bellford you are one of the first lawyers in denver you are suffering from an attack of aphasia which has caused you to forget your identity the cause of it was over application to your profession and perhaps a life too bare of natural recreation and pleasures the lady who has just left the room is your wife she is what i would call a fine looking woman i said after a judicial pause i particularly admire the shade of brown in her hair she is a wife to be proud of since your disappearance nearly two weeks ago she has scarcely closed her eyes we learned that you were in new york through a telegram sent by isidore newman a traveling man from denver he said that he had met you in a hotel here and that you did not recognize him i think i remember the occasion i said the fellow called me bellford if i am not mistaken but don t you think it about time now for you to introduce yourself i am robert volney doctor volney i have been your close friend for twenty years and your physician for fifteen i came with mrs bellford to trace you as soon as we got the telegram try elwyn old man try to remember what s the use to try i asked with a little frown you say you are a physician is aphasia curable when a man loses his memory does it return slowly or suddenly sometimes gradually and imperfectly sometimes as suddenly as it went will you undertake the treatment of my case doctor volney i asked old friend said he i ll do everything in my power and wil have done everything that science can do to cure you very well said i then you will consider that i am your patient everything is in confidence now professional confidence of course said doctor volney i got up from the couch some one had set a vase of white roses on the centre table a cluster of white roses freshly sprinkled and fragrant i threw them far out of the window and then laid myself upon the couch again it will be best bobby i said to have this cure happen suddenly i m rather tired of it all anyway you may go now and bring marian in but oh doc i said with a sigh as i kicked him on the shin good old doc it was glorious a municipal report the cities are full of pride challenging each to each this from her mountainside that from her burthened beach r kipling fancy a novel about chicago or buffalo let us say or nashville tennessee there are justthree big cities in the united states that are story cities new york of course new orleans and best of the lot san francisco frank norris east is east and west is san francisco according to californians californians are a race of people they are not merely inhabitants of a state they are the southerners of the west now chicagoans are no less loyal to their city but when you ask them why they stammer and speak of lake fish and the new odd fellows building but californians go into detail of course they have in the climate an argument that is good for half an hour while you are thinking of your coal bills and heavy underwear but as soon as they come to mistake your silence for conviction madness comes upon them and they picture the city of the golden gate as the bagdad of the new world so far as a matter of opinion no refutation is necessary but dear cousins all from adam and eve descended it is a rash one who will lay his finger on the map and say in this town there can be no romance what could happen here yes it is a bold and a rash deed to challenge in one sentence history romance and rand and mcnally nashville a city port of delivery and the capital of the state of tennessee is on the cumberland river and

it required strong self suppression for me to keep from climbing to the top of it and giving an imitation of sidney carton the vehicle was drawn by beasts of a bygone era and driven by something dark and emancipated i was sleepy and tired so when i got to the hotel i hurriedly paid it the fifty cents it demanded with approximate lagniappe i assure you i knew its habits and i did not want to hear it prate about its old marster or anything that happened befo de wah the hotel was one of the kind described as renovated that means worth of new marble pillars tiling electric lights and brass cuspidors in the lobby and a new l n time table and a lithograph of lookout mountain in each one of the great rooms above the management was without reproach the attention full of exquisite southern

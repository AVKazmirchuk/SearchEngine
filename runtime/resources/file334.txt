but as i was going to tell you when i went back to oratama i found out from manuel iquito what was in that mixture he gave me for my lost voice i told you how quick it cured me he made that stuff from the chuchula plant now look here judson tate drew an oblong white pasteboard box from his pocket for any cough he said or cold or hoarseness or bronchial affection whatsoever i have here the greatest remedy in the world you see the formula printed on the box each tablet contains licorice grains balsam tolu grain oil of anise minim oil of tar minim oleo resin of cubebs minim fluid extract of chuchula minim i am in new york went on judson tate for the purpose of organizing a company to market the greatest remedy for throat affections ever discovered at present i am introducing the lozenges in a small way i have here a box containing four dozen which i am selling for the small sum of fifty cents if you are suffering i got up and went away without a word i walked slowly up to the little park near my hotel leaving judson tate alone with his conscience my feelings were lacerated he had poured gently upon me a story that i might have used there was a little of the breath of life in it and some of the synthetic atmosphere that passes when cunningly tinkered in the marts and at the last it had proven to be a commercial pill deftly coated with the sugar of fiction the worst of it was that i could not offer it for sale advertising departments and counting rooms look down upon me and it would never do for the literary therefore i sat upon a bench with other disappointed ones until my eyelids drooped i went to my room and as my custom is read for an hour stories in my favourite magazines this was to get my mind back to art again and as i read each story i threw the magazines sadly and hopelessly one by one upon the floor each author without one exception to bring balm to my heart wrote liltingly and sprightly a story of some particular make of motor car that seemed to control the sparking plug of his genius and when the last one was hurled from me i took heart if readers can swallow so many proprietary automobiles i said to myself they ought not to strain at one of tate s compound magic chuchula bronchial lozenges and so if you see this story in print you will understand that business is business and that if art gets very far ahead of commerce she will have to get up and hustle i may as well add to make a clean job of it that you can t buy the chuchula plant in the drug stores art and the bronco out of the wilderness had come a painter genius whose coronations alone are democratic had woven a chaplet of chaparral for the brow of lonny briscoe art whose divine expression flows impartially from the fingertips of a cowboy or a dilettante emperor had chosen for a medium the boy artist of the san saba the outcome seven feet by twelve of besmeared canvas stood gilt framed in the lobby of the capitol the legislature was in session the capital city of that great western state was enjoying the season of activity and profit that the congregation of the solons bestowed the boarding houses were corralling the easy dollars of the gamesome law makers the greatest state in the west an empire in area and resources had arisen and repudiated the old libel or barbarism lawbreaking and bloodshed order reigned within her borders life and property were as safe there sir as anywhere among the corrupt cities of the effete east pillow shams churches strawberry feasts and habeas corpus flourished with impunity might the tenderfoot ventilate his stovepipe or his theories of culture the arts and sciences received nurture and subsidy and therefore it behooved the legislature of this great state to make appropriation for the purchase of lonny briscoe s immortal painting rarely has the san saba country contributed to the spread of the fine arts its sons have excelled in the solider graces in the throw of the lariat the manipulation of the esteemed the intrepidity of the one card draw and the nocturnal stimulation of towns from undue lethargy but hitherto it had not been famed as a stronghold of aesthetics lonny briscoe s brush had removed that disability here among the limestone rocks the succulent cactus and the drought parched grass of that arid valley had been born the boy artist why he came to woo art is beyond postulation beyond doubt some spore of the afflatus must have sprung up within him in spite of the desert soil of san saba the tricksy spirit of creation must have incited him to attempted expression and then have sat hilarious among the white hot sands of the valley watching its mischievous work for lonny s picture viewed as a thing of art was something to have driven away dull care from the bosoms of the critics the painting one might almost say panorama was designed to portray a typical western scene interest culminating in a central animal figure that of a stampeding steer life size wild eyed fiery breaking away in a mad rush from the herd that close ridden by a typical cowpuncher occupied a position somewhat in the right background of the picture the landscape presented fitting and faithful accessories chaparral mesquit and pear were distributed in just proportions a spanish dagger plant with its waxen blossoms in a creamy aggregation as large as a water bucket contributed floral beauty

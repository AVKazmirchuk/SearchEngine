pickens in a gig dressed in black white necktie long face sniffing his nose emitting a spurious kind of noise resembling the long meter doxology b jinks says farmer if thar ain t a preacher now it transpires that i am rev abijah green travelling over to little bethel school house for to preach next sunday the young folks will have it they must be married for pa is pursuing them with the plow mules and the buckboard so the reverend green after hesitating marries em in the farmer s parlor and farmer grins and has in cider and says b gum and farmeress sniffles a bit and pats the bride on the shoulder and parleyvoo pickens the wrong reverend writes out a marriage certificate and farmer and farmeress sign it as witnesses and the parties of the first second and third part gets in their vehicles and rides away oh that was an idyllic graft true love and the lowing kine and the sun shining on the red barns it certainly had all other impostures i know about beat to a batter so the reverend green after hesitations marries em in the farmer s parlor i suppose i happened along in time to marry buck and miss malloy at about twenty farm houses i hated to think how the romance was going to fade later on when all them marriage certificates turned up in banks where we d discounted em and the farmers had to pay them notes of hand they d signed running from to on the th day of may us three divided about miss malloy nearly cried with joy you don t often see a tenderhearted girl or one that is bent on doing right boys says she dabbing her eyes with a little handkerchief this stake comes in handier than a powder rag at a fat men s ball it gives me a chance to reform i was trying to get out of the real estate business when you fellows came along but if you hadn t taken me in on this neat little proposition for removing the cuticle of the rutabaga propagators i m afraid i d have got into something worse i was about to accept a place in one of these women s auxiliary bazars where they build a parsonage by selling a spoonful of chicken salad and a cream puff for seventy five cents and calling it a business man s lunch now i can go into a square honest business and give all them queer jobs the shake i m going to cincinnati and start a palm reading and clairvoyant joint as madame saramaloi the egyptian sorceress i shall give everybody a dollar s worth of good honest prognostication good by boys take my advice and go into some decent fake get friendly with the police and newspapers and you ll be all right so then we all shook hands and miss malloy left us me and buck also rose up and sauntered off a few hundred miles for we didn t care to be around when them marriage certificates fell due with about between us we hit that bumptious little town off the new jersey coast they call new york if there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that yaptown on the hudson cosmopolitan they call it you bet so s a piece of fly paper you listen close when they re buzzing and trying to pull their feet out of the sticky stuff little old new york s good enough for us that s what they sing there s enough reubs walk down broadway in one hour to buy up a week s output of the factory in augusta maine that makes knaughty knovelties and the little phine phun oroide gold finger ring that sticks a needle in your friend s hand you d think new york people was all wise but no they don t get a chance to learn everything s too compressed even the hayseeds are baled hayseeds but what else can you expect from a town that s shut off from the world by the

chestnut hulls he has to hand out a pint to an insectivorous cop and the hotel man charges double for everything in the bill that he sends by the patrol wagon to the altar where the duke is about to marry the heiress but old badville near coney is the ideal burg for a refined piece of piracy if you can pay the bunco duty imported grafts come pretty high the custom house officers that look after

atterbury was well dressed though he ate seldom and the synopsis of his talk would make the conversation of a siren sound like a cab driver s kick he said he used to be a member of the stock exchange

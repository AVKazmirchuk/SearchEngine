yesterday to night i couldn t buy a five cent cup of coffee you don t look like one of us well i guess those things happen i used to be a high flyer myself years ago what knocked you out of the game i oh i lost my job said vallance it s undiluted hades this city went on the other one day you re eating from china the next you are eating in china a chop suey joint i ve had more than my share of hard

but what he was a fly cop so i didn t go around again till after dark there was a letter there be had left for me say dawson it was from a big downtown lawyer mead i ve seen his sign on ann street paulding wants me to play the prodigal nephew wants me to come back and be his heir again and blow in his money i m to call at the lawyer s office at ten to morrow and step into my old shoes again heir to three million dawson and a year pocket money and i m afraid i m afraid the vagrant leaped to his feet and raised both trembling arms above his bead he caught his breath and moaned hysterically vallance seized his arm and forced him back to the bench be quiet he commanded with something like disgust in his tones one would think you had lost a fortune instead of being about to acquire one of what are you afraid ide cowered and shivered on the bench he clung to vallance s sleeve and even in the dim glow of the broadway lights the latest disinherited one could see drops on the other s brow wrung out by some strange terror why i m afraid something will happen to me be fore morning i don t know what something to keep me from coming into that money i m afraid a tree will fall on me i m afraid a cab will run over me or a stone drop on me from a housetop or some thing i never was afraid before i ve sat in this park a hundred nights as calm as a graven image without knowing where my breakfast was to come from but now it s different i love money daw son i m happy as a god when it s trickling through my fingers and people are bowing to me with the music and the flowers and fine clothes all around as long as i knew i was out of the game i didn t mind i was even happy sitting here ragged and hungry listening to the fountain jump and watching the carriages go up the avenue but it s in reach of my hand again now almost and i can t stand it to wait twelve hours dawson i can t stand it there are fifty things that could happen to me i could go blind i might be attacked with heart disease the world might come to an end before i could ide sprang to his feet again with a shriek peo ple stirred on the benches and began to look val lance took his arm come and walk he said soothingly and try to calm yourself there is no need to become ex cited or alarmed nothing is going to happen to you one night is like another that s right said ide stay with me daw son that s a good fellow walk around with me awhile i never went to pieces like this before and i ve had a good many hard knocks do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch old man i m afraid my nerve s too far gone to try any panhandling vallance led his companion up almost deserted fifth avenue and then westward along the thirties toward broadway wait here a few minutes he said leaving ide in a quiet and shadowed spot he entered a familiar hotel and strolled toward the bar quite in his old assured way there s a poor devil outside jimmy he said to the bartender who says he s hungry and looks it you know what they do when you give them money fix up a sandwich or two for him and i ll see that he doesn t throw it away certainly mr vallance said the bartender they ain t all fakes don t like to see anybody go hungry ide folded a liberal supply of the free lunch into a napkin vallance went with it and joined his com panion ide pounced upon the food ravenously i haven t had any free lunch as good as this in a year be said aren t you going to eat any dawson i m not hungry thanks said vallance we ll go back to the square said ide the cops won t bother us there i ll roll up the rest of this ham and stuff for our breakfast i won t eat any more i m afraid i ll get sick suppose i d die of cramps or something to night and never get to touch that money again it s eleven hours yet till time to see that lawyer you won t leave me will you dawson i m afraid something might happen you haven t any place to go have you no said vallance nowhere to night i ll have a bench with you you take it cool said ide if you ve told it to me straight i should think a man put on the bum from a good job just in one day would be tearing his hair i believe i ve already remarked said vallance laughing that i would have thought that a man who was expecting to come into a fortune on the next day would be feeling pretty easy and quiet it s funny business philosophized ide about the way people take things anyhow here s your bench dawson right next to mine the light don t shine in your eyes here say dawson i ll get the old man to give you a letter to somebody about a job when i get back home you ve helped me a lot to night i don t believe i could have gone through the night if i hadn t struck you thank you said vallance do you lie down or sit up on these when you sleep for hours vallance gazed almost without winking at the stars through the branches of the trees and listened to the sharp slapping of horses hoofs on the sea of asphalt to the south his mind was active but his feelings were dormant every emotion seemed to have been eradicated ide felt no regrets no fears no pain or discomfort even when be thought of the girl it was as of an inhabitant of one of those remote stars at which be gazed he re membered the absurd antics of his companion and laughed softly yet without a feeling of mirth soon the daily army of milk wagons made of the city a roaring drum to which they marched vallance fell asleep on his comfortless bench at ten o clock on the next day the two stood at the door of lawyer mead s office in ann street ide s nerves fluttered worse than ever when the hour approached and vallance could not decide to leave him a possible prey to the dangers he dreaded when they entered the office lawyer mead looked at them wonderingly he and vallance were old friends after his greeting he turned to ide who stood with white face and trembling limbs before the expected crisis i sent a second letter to your address last night mr ide he said i learned this morning that you were not there to receive it it will inform you that mr paulding has reconsidered his offer to take you back into favor he has decided not to do so and desires you to understand that no change will be made in the relations existing between you and him ide s trembling suddenly ceased the color came back to his face and be straightened his back his jaw went forward half an inch and a gleam came into his eye he pushed back his battered bat with one hand and extended the other with levelled fin gers toward the lawyer he took a long breath and then laughed sardonically tell old paulding he may go to the devil he said loudly and clearly and turned and walked out of the office with a firm and lively step lawyer mead turned on his heel to vallance and smiled i am glad you came in he said genially your uncle wants you to return home at once he is reconciled to the situation that led to his hasty action and desires to say that all will be as hey adams cried lawyer mead breaking his sentence and calling to his clerk bring a glass of water mr vallance has fainted the plutonian fire there are a few editor men with whom i am privi leged to come in contact it has not been long since it was their habit to come in contact with me there is a difference they tell me that with a large number of the manuscripts that are submitted to them come advices in the way of a boost from the author asseverating that the incidents in the story are true the des tination of such contributions depends wholly upon the question of the enclosure of stamps some are returned the rest are thrown on the floor in a corner on top of a pair of gum shoes an overturned statu ette of the winged victory and a pile of old maga zines containing a picture of the editor in the act of reading the latest copy of le petit journal right side up you can tell by the illustrations it is only a legend that there are waste baskets in editors offices thus is truth held in disrepute but in time truth and science and nature will adapt themselves to art things will happen logically and the villain be dis comfited instead of being elected to the board of directors but in the meantime fiction must not only be divorced from fact but must pay alimony and be awarded custody of the press despatches this preamble is to warn you off the grade cross ing of a true story being that it shall be told sim ply with conjunctions substituted for adjectives wherever possible and whatever evidences of style may appear in it shall be due to the linotype man it is a story of the literary life in a great city and it should be of interest to every author within a mile radius of gosport ind whose desk holds a ms story beginning thus while the cheers following his nomination were still ringing through the old courthouse harwood broke away from the congrat ulating handclasps of his henchmen and hurried to judge creswell s house to find ida pettit came up out of alabama to write fiction the southern papers had printed eight of his stories under an editorial caption identifying the author as the son of the gallant major pettingill pettit our former county attorney and hero of the battle of lookout mountain pettit was a rugged fellow with a kind of shame faced culture and my good friend his father kept a general store in a little town called hosea pettit had been raised in the pine woods and broom sedge fields adjacent thereto he had in his gripsack two manuscript novels of the adventures in picardy of one gaston laboulaye vicompte de montrepos in the year that s nothing we all do that and some day when we make a hit with the little sketch about a newsy and his lame dog the editor prints the other one for us or on us as the say ing is and then and then we have to get a big valise and peddle those patent air draft gas burners at everybody should have em i took pettit to the red brick house which was to appear in an article entitled literary landmarks of old new york some day when we got through with it he engaged a room there drawing on the general store for his expenses i showed new york to him and he did not mention how much narrower broadway is than lee avenue in hosea this seemed a good sign so i put the final test suppose you try your band at a descriptive arti cle i suggested giving your impressions of new york as seen from the brooklyn bridge the fresh point of view the don t be a fool said pettit let s go have some beer on the whole i rather like the city we discovered and enjoyed the only true bohemia every day and night we repaired to one of those palaces of marble and glass and tilework where goes on a tremendous and sounding epic of life valhalla itself could not be more glorious and sonorous the classic marble on which we ate the great light flooded vitreous front adorned with snow white scrolls the grand wagnerian din of clanking cups and bowls the flashing staccato of brandishing cut lery the piercing recitative of the white aproned grub maidens at the morgue like banquet tables the recurrent lied motif of the cash register it was a gigantic triumphant welding of art and sound a deafening soul uplifting pageant of heroic and em blematic life and the beans were only ten cents we wondered why our fellow artists cared to dine at sad little tables in their so called bohemian restau rants and we shuddered lest they should seek out our resorts and make them conspicuous with their pres ence pettit wrote many stories which the editors re turned to him he wrote love stories a thing i have always kept free from holding the belief that the well known and popular sentiment is not properly a matter for publication but something to be privately handled by the alienists and florists but the editors had told him that they wanted love stories because they said the women read them now the editors are wrong about that of course women do not read the love stories in the magazines they read the poker game stories and the recipes for cucumber lotion the love stories are read by fat cigar drummers and little ten year old girls i am not criticising the judgment of editors they are mostly very fine men but a man can be but one man with individual opinions and tastes i knew two associate editors of a magazine who were won derfully alike in almost everything and yet one of them was very fond of flaubert while the other preferred gin pettit brought me his returned manuscripts and we looked them over together to find out why they were not accepted they seemed to me pretty fair stories written in a good style and ended as they should at the bottom of the last page they were well constructed and the events were marshalled in orderly and logical sequence but i thought i detected a lack of living substance it was much as if i gazed at a symmetrical array of presentable clamshells from which the succulent and vital inhabitants had been removed i intimated that the author might do well to get better acquainted with his theme you sold a story last week said pettit about a gun fight in an arizona mining town in which the hero drew his colt s and shot seven bandits as fast as they came in the door now if a six shooter could oh well said i that s different arizona is a long way from new york i could have a man stabbed with a lariat or chased by a pair of chap arreras if i wanted to and it wouldn t be noticed until the usual error sharp from around mcadams junction isolates the erratum and writes in to the pa pers about it but you are up against another proposition this thing they call love is as common around new york as it is in sheboygan during the young onion season it may be mixed here with a little commercialism they read byron but they look up bradstreet s too while they re among the b s and brigham also if they have time but it s pretty much the same old internal disturbance every where you can fool an editor with a fake picture of a cowboy mounting a pony with his left hand on the saddle horn but you can t put him up a tree with a love story so you ve got to fall in love and then write the real thing pettit did i never knew whether he was taking my advice or whether be fell an accidental victim there was a girl be had met at one of these studio contrivances a glorious impudent lucid open minded girl with hair the color of culmbacher and a good natured way of despising you she was a new york girl well as the narrative style permits us to say in frequently pettit went to pieces all those pains those lover s doubts those heart burnings and tremors of which be had written so unconvincingly were his talk about shylock s pound of flesh twenty five pounds cupid got from pettit which is the usurer one night pettit came to my room exalted pale and haggard but exalted she had given him a jonquil old hoss said he with a new smile flickering around his mouth i believe i could write that story to night the one you know that is to win out i can feel it i don t know whether it will come out or not but i can feel it i pushed him out of my door go to your room and write it i ordered else i can see your fin ish i told you this must come first write it to night and put it under my door when it is done put it under my door to night when it is finished don t keep it until to morrow i was reading my bully old pal montaigne at two o clock when i beard the sheets rustle under my door i gathered them up and read the story the hissing of geese the languishing cooing of doves the braying of donkeys the chatter of irre sponsible sparrows these were in my mind s ear as i read suffering sappho i exclaimed to myself is this the divine fire that is supposed to ignite genius and make it practicable and wage earning the story was sentimental drivel full of whim pering softheartedness and gushing egoism all the art that pettit had acquired was gone a pe rusal of its buttery phrases would have made a cynic of a sighing chambermaid in the morning pettit came to my room i read him his doom mercilessly he laughed idiotically all right old hoss he said cheerily make cigar lighters of it what s the difference i m going to take her to lunch at claremont to day there was about a month of it and then pettit came to me bearing an invisible mitten with the forti tude of a dish rag he talked of the grave and south america and prussic acid and i lost an after noon getting him straight i took him out and saw that large and curative doses of whiskey were ad ministered to him i warned you this was a true story ware your white ribbons if only follow this tale for two weeks i fed him whiskey and omar and read to him regularly every evening the column in the evening paper that reveals the secrets of fe male beauty i recommend the treatment after pettit was cured be wrote more stories he recovered his old time facility and did work just short of good enough then the curtain rose on the third act a little dark eyed silent girl from new hamp shire who was studying applied design fell deeply in love with him she was the intense sort but ex ternally glace such as new england sometimes fools us with pettit liked her mildly and took her about a good deal she worshipped him and now and then ignored him there came a climax when she tried to jump out of a window and he had to save her by some perfunc tary unmeant wooing even i was shaken by the depths of the absorbing affection she showed home friends traditions creeds went up like thistle down in the scale against her love it was really discom posing one night again pettit sauntered in yawning as he had told me before he said he felt that he could do a great story and as before i hunted him to his room and saw him open his inkstand at one o clock the sheets of paper slid under my door i read that story and i jumped up late as it was with a whoop of joy old pettit had done it just as though it lay there red and bleeding a woman s heart was written into the lines you couldn t see the joining but art exquisite art and pulsing na ture had been combined into a love story that took you by the throat like the quinsy i broke into pettit s room and beat him on the back and called him name names high up in the galaxy of the im mortals that we admired and pettit yawned and begged to be allowed to sleep on the morrow i dragged him to an editor the great man read and rising gave pettit his hand that was a decoration a wreath of bay and a guar antee of rent and then old pettit smiled slowly i call him gen tleman pettit now to myself it s a miserable name to give a man but it sounds better than it looks in print i see said old pettit as he took up his story and began tearing it into small strips i see the game now you can t write with ink and you can t write with your own heart s blood but you can write with the heart s blood of some one else you have to be a cad before you can be an artist well i am for old alabam and the major s store have you got a light old hoss i went with pettit to the depot and died hard shakespeare s sonnets i blurted making a last stand how about him a cad said pettit they give it to you and you sell it love you know i d rather sell ploughs for father but i protested you are reversing the de cision of the world s greatest good by old hoss said pettit critics i continued but say if the major can use a fairly good salesman and book keeper down there in the store let me know will you nemesis and the candy man we sail at eight in the morning on the celtic said honoria plucking a loose thread from her lace sleeve i heard so said young ives dropping his hat and muffing it as he tried to catch it and i came around to wish you a pleasant voyage of course you heard it said honoria coldly sweet since we have had no opportunity of inform ing you ourselves ives looked at her pleadingly but with little hope outside in the street a high pitched voice chanted not unmusically a commercial gamut of cand de ee ee s nice fresh cand ee ee ee ees d it s our old candy man said honoria leaning out the window and beckoning i want some of his motto kisses there s nothing in the broadway shops half so good the candy man stopped his pushcart in front of the old madison avenue home he had a holiday and festival air unusual to street peddlers his tie was new and bright red and a horseshoe pin almost life size glittered speciously from its folds his brown thin face was crinkled into a semi foolish smile striped cuffs with dog head buttons covered the tan on his wrists i do believe he s going to get married said honoria pityingly i never saw him taken that way before and to day is the first time in months that he has cried his wares i am sure ives threw a coin to the sidewalk the candy man knows his customers he filled a paper bag climbed the old fashioned stoop and banded it in i remember said ives wait said honoria she took a small portfolio from the drawer of a writing desk and from the portfolio a slip of flimsy paper one quarter of an inch by two inches in size this said honoria inflexibly was wrapped about the first one we opened it was a year ago apologized ives as he held out his hand for it as long as skies above are blue to you my love i will be true this he read from the slip of flimsy paper we were to have sailed a fortnight ago said honoria gossipingly it has been such a warm summer the town is quite deserted there is no where to go yet i am told that one or two of the roof gardens are amusing the singing and the dancing on one or two seem to have met with ap proval ives did not wince when you are in the ring you are not surprised when your adversary taps you on the ribs i followed the candy man that time said ives irrelevantly and gave him five dollars at the corner of broadway he reached for the paper bag in honoria s lap took out one of the square wrapped confections and slowly unrolled it sara chillingworth s father said honoria has given her an automobile read that said ives handing over the slip that had been wrapped around the square of candy life teaches us how to live love teaches us to forgive honoria s checks turned pink honoria cried ives starting up from his chair miss clinton corrected honoria rising like venus from the head on the surf i warned you not to speak that name again honoria repeated ives you must bear me i know i do not deserve your forgiveness but i must have it there is a madness that possesses one some times for which his better nature is not responsible i throw everything else but you to the winds i strike off the chains that have bound me i re nounce the siren that lured me from you let the bought verse of that street peddler plead for me it is you only whom i can love let your love forgive and i swear to you that mine will be true as long as skies above are blue on the west side between sixth and seventh ave nues an alley cuts the block in the middle it per ishes in a little court in the centre of the block the district is theatrical the inhabitants the bubbling froth of half a dozen nations the atmosphere is bohemian the language polyglot the locality pre carious in the court at the rear of the alley lived the candy man at seven o clock be pushed his cart into the narrow entrance rested it upon the irregular stone slats and sat upon one of the handles to cool himself there was a great draught of cool wind through the alley there was a window above the spot where be al ways stopped his pushcart in the cool of the after noon mlle adele drawing card of the aerial roof garden sat at the window and took the air gen erally her ponderous mass of dark auburn hair was down that the breeze might have the felicity of aid ing sidonie the maid in drying and airing it about her shoulders the point of her that the pho tographers always made the most of was loosely draped a heliotrope scarf her arms to the elbow were bare there were no sculptors there to rave over them but even the stolid bricks in the walls of the alley should not have been so insensate as to disapprove while she sat thus fe ice another maid anointed and bathed the small feet that twinkled and so charmed the nightly aerial audiences gradually mademoiselle began to notice the candy man stopping to mop his brow and cool himself be neath her window in the hands of her maids she was deprived for the time of her vocation the charming and binding to her chariot of man to lose time was displeasing to mademoiselle here was the candy man no fit game for her darts truly but of the sex upon which she had been born to make war after casting upon him looks of unseeing coldness for a dozen times one afternoon she suddenly thawed and poured down upon him a smile that put to shame the sweets upon his cart candy man she said cooingly while sidonie followed her impulsive dive brushing the heavy auburn hair don t you think i am beautiful the candy man laughed harshly and looked up with his thin jaw set while he wiped his forehead with a red and blue handkerchief yer d make a dandy magazine cover he said grudgingly beautiful or not is for them that cares it s not my line if yer lookin for bou quets apply elsewhere between nine and twelve i think we ll have rain truly fascinating a candy man is like killing rab bits in a deep snow but the hunter s blood is widely diffused mademoiselle tugged a great coil of hair from sidonie s bands and let it fall out the window candy man have you a sweetheart anywhere with hair as long and soft as that and with an arm so round she flexed an arm like galatea s after the miracle across the window sill the candy man cackled shrilly as he arranged a stock of butter scotch that had tumbled down smoke up said he vulgarly nothin doin in the complimentary line i m too wise to be bam boozled by a switch of hair and a newly massaged arm oh i guess you ll make good in the calcium all right with plenty of powder and paint on and the orchestra playing under the old apple tree but don t put on your hat and chase downstairs to fly to the little church around the corner with me i ve been up against peroxide and make up boxes be fore say all joking aside don t you think we ll have rain candy man said mademoiselle softly with her lips curving and her chin dimpling don t you think i m pretty the candy man grinned savin money ain t yer said be by bein yer own press agent i smoke but i haven t seen yer mug on any of the five cent cigar boxes it d take a new brand of woman to get me goin anyway i know em from sidecombs to shoelaces gimme a good day s sales and steak and onions at seven and a pipe and an evenin paper back there in the court and i ll not trouble lillian russell herself to wink at me if you please mademoiselle pouted candy man she said softly and deeply yet you shall say that i am beautiful all men say so and so shall you the candy man laughed and pulled out his pipe well said be i must be goin in there is a story in the evenin paper that i am readin men are divin in the seas for a treasure and pirates are watchin them from behind a reef and there ain t a woman on land or water or in the air good evenin and he trundled his pushcart down the alley and back to the musty court where he lived incredibly to him who has not learned woman mademoiselle sat at the window each day and spread her nets for the ignominious game once she kept a grand cavalier waiting in her reception chamber for half an hour while she battered in vain the candy man s tough philosophy his rough laugh chafed her vanity to its core daily he sat on his cart in the breeze of the alley while her hair was being ministered to and daily the shafts of her beauty rebounded from his dull bosom pointless and ineffectual un worthy pique brightened her eyes pride hurt she glowed upon him in a way that would have sent her higher adorers into an egoistic paradise the candy man s hard eyes looked upon her with a half con cealed derision that urged her to the use of the sharp est arrow in her beauty s quiver one afternoon she leaned far over the sill and she did not challenge and torment him as usual candy man said she stand up and look into my eyes he stood up and looked into her eyes with his harsh laugh like the sawing of wood he took out his pipe fumbled with it and put it back into big pocket with a trembling band that will do said mademoiselle with a slow smile i must go now to my masseuse good evening the next evening at seven the candy man came and rested his cart under the window but was it the candy man his clothes were a bright new check his necktie was a flaming red adorned by a glit tering horseshoe pin almost life size his shoes were polished the tan of his cheeks had paled his hands had been washed the window was empty and he waited under it with his nose upward like a hound hoping for a bone mademoiselle came with sidonie carrying her load of hair she looked at the candy man and smiled a slow smile that faded away into ennui instantly she knew that the game was bagged and so quickly she wearied of the chase she began to talk to sidonie been a fine day said the candy man hollowly first time in a month i ve felt first class hit it up down old madison hollering out like i useter think it ll rain to morrow mademoiselle laid two round arms on the cushion on the window sill and a dimpled chin upon them candy man said she softly do you not love me the candy man stood up and leaned against the brick wall lady said be chokingly i ve got saved up did i say you wasn t beautiful take it every bit of it and buy a collar for your dog with it a sound as of a hundred silvery bells tinkled in the room of mademoiselle the laughter filled the alley and trickled back into the court as strange a thing to enter there as sunlight itself mademoiselle was amused sidonie a wise echo added a sepulchral but faithful contralto the laughter of the two seemed at last to penetrate the candy man he fumbled with his horseshoe pin at length mademoiselle ex hausted turned her flushed beautiful face to the win dow candy man said she go away when i laugh sidonie pulls my hair i can but laugh while you remain there here is a note for mademoiselle said fe ice coming to the window in the room there is no justice said the candy man lift ing the handle of his cart and moving away three yards he moved and stopped loud shriek after shriek came from the window of mademoiselle quickly he ran back he heard a body thumping upon the floor and a sound as though heels beat alter nately upon it what is it be called sidonie s severe head came into the window mademoiselle is overcome by bad news she said one whom she loved with all her soul has gone you may have beard of him he is monsieur ives he sails across the ocean to morrow oh you men squaring the circle at the hazard of wearying you this tale of vehe ment emotions must be prefaced by a discourse on geometry nature moves in circles art in straight lines the natural is rounded the artificial is made up of angles a man lost in the snow wanders in spite of himself in perfect circles the city man s feet denaturalized by rectangular streets and floors carry him ever away from himself the round eyes of childhood typify innocence the narrowed line of the flirt s optic proves the in vasion of art the horizontal mouth is the mark of determined cunning who has not read nature s most spontaneous lyric in lips rounded for the candid kiss beauty is nature in perfection circularity is its chief attribute behold the full moon the enchant ing golf ball the domes of splendid temples the huckleberry pie the wedding ring the circus ring the ring for the waiter and the round of drinks on the other hand straight lines show that na ture has been deflected imagine venus s girdle transformed into a straight front when we begin to move in straight lines and turn sharp corners our natures begin to change the consequence is that nature being more adaptive than art tries to conform to its sterner regulations the result is often a rather curious product for in stance a prize chrysanthemum wood alcohol whis key a republican missouri cauliflower au gratin and a new yorker nature is lost quickest in a big city the cause is geometrical not moral the straight lines of its streets and architecture the rectangularity of its laws and social customs the undeviating pavements the hard severe depressing uncompromising rules of all its ways even of its recreation and sports coldly exhibit a sneering defiance of the curved line of nature wherefore it may be said that the big city has demonstrated the problem of squaring the circle and it may be added that this mathematical intro duction precedes an account of the fate of a kentucky feud that was imported to the city that has a habit of making its importations conform to its angles the feud began in the cumberland mountains be tween the folwell and the harkness families the first victim of the homespun vendetta was a possum dog belonging to bill harkness the harkness family evened up this dire loss by laying out the chief of the folwell clan the folwells were prompt at repartee they oiled up their squirrel rifles and made it feasible for bill harkness to follow his dog to a land where the possums come down when treed without the stroke of an ax the feud flourished for forty years harknesses were shot at the plough through their lamp lit cabin windows coming from camp meeting asleep in duello sober and otherwise singly and in family groups prepared and unprepared folwells had the branches of their family tree lopped off in similar ways as the traditions of their country prescribed and authorized by and by the pruning left but a single member of each family and then cal harkness probably reasoning that further pursuance of the controversy would give a too decided personal flavor to the feud suddenly disappeared from the relieved cumberlands baulking the avenging hand of sam the ultimate op posing folwell a year afterward sam folwell learned that his hereditary unsuppressed enemy was living in new york city sam turned over the big iron wash pot in the yard scraped off some of the soot which he mixed with lard and shined his boots with the com pound he put on his store clothes of butternut dyed black a white shirt and collar and packed a carpet sack with spartan lingerie he took his squirrel rifle from its hooks but put it back again with a sigh however ethical and plausible the habit might be in the cumberlands perhaps new york would not swallow his pose of hunting squirrels among the skyscrapers along broadway an ancient but reliable colt s revolver that he resurrected from a bureau drawer seemed to proclaim itself the pink of weapons for metropolitan adventure and vengeance this and a hunting knife in a leather sheath sam packed in the carpet sack as he started muleback for the lowland railroad station the last folwell turned in his saddle and looked grimly at the little cluster of white pine slabs in the clump of cedars that marked the folwell burying ground sam folwell arrived in new york in the night still moving and living in the free circles of nature he did not perceive the formidable pitiless restless fierce angles of the great city waiting in the dark to close about the rotundity of his heart and brain and mould him to the form of its millions of re shaped victims a cabby picked him out of the whirl as sam himself had often picked a nut from a bed of wind tossed autumn leaves and whisked him away to a hotel commensurate to his boots and carpet sack on the next morning the last of the folwells made his sortie into the city that sheltered the last hark ness the colt was thrust beneath his coat and se cured by a narrow leather belt the hunting knife hung between his shoulder blades with the haft an inch below his coat collar he knew this much that cal harkness drove an express wagon some where in that town and that he sam folwell had come to kill him and as he stepped upon the side walk the red came into his eye and the feud hate into his heart the clamor of the central avenues drew him thith erward he had half expected to see cal coming down the street in his shirt sleeves with a jug and a whip in his hand just as he would have seen him in frankfort or laurel city but an hour went by and cal did not appear perhaps he was waiting in ambush to shoot him from a door or a window sam kept a sharp eye on doors and windows for a while about noon the city tired of playing with its mouse and suddenly squeezed him with its straight lines sam folwell stood where two great rectangular arteries of the city cross he looked four ways and saw the world burled from its orbit and reduced by spirit level and tape to an edged and cornered plane all life moved on tracks in grooves accord ing to system within boundaries by rote the root of life was the cube root the measure of existence was square measure people streamed by in straight rows the horrible din and crash stupefied him sam leaned against the sharp corner of a stone building those faces passed him by thousands and none of them were turned toward him a sudden fool ish fear that he had died and was a spirit and that they could not see him seized him and then the city smote him with loneliness a fat man dropped out of the stream and stood a few feet distant waiting for his car sam crept to his side and shouted above the tumult into his ear the rankinses hogs weighed more n ourn a whole passel but the mast in thar neighborhood was a fine chance better than what it was down the fat man moved away unostentatiously and bought roasted chestnuts to cover his alarm sam felt the need of a drop of mountain dew across the street men passed in and out through swinging doors brief glimpses could be had of a glistening bar and its bedeckings the feudist crossed and essayed to enter again had art eliminated the familiar circle sam s hand found no door knob it slid in vain over a rectangular brass plate and polished oak with nothing even so large as a pin s head upon which his fingers might close abashed reddened heartbroken he walked away from the bootless door and sat upon a step a locust club tickled him in the ribs take a walk for yourself said the policeman you ve been loafing around here long enough at the next corner a shrill whistle sounded in sam s ear he wheeled around and saw a black browed vil lain scowling at him over peanuts heaped on a steam ing machine he started across the street an im mense engine running without mules with the voice of a bull and the smell of a smoky lamp whizzed past grazing his knee a cab driver bumped him with a hub and explained to him that kind words were in vented to be used on other occasions a motorman clanged his bell wildly and for once in his life cor roborated a cab driver a large lady in a changeable silk waist dug an elbow into his back and a newsy pensively pelted him with banana rinds murmuring i hates to do it but if anybody seen me let it pass cal harkness his day s work over and his express wagon stabled turned the sharp edge of the build ing that by the cheek of architects is modelled upon a safety razor out of the mass of hurrying people his eye picked up three yards away the surviving bloody and implacable foe of his kith and kin he stopped short and wavered for a moment be ing unarmed and sharply surprised but the keen mountaineer s eye of sam folwell had picked him out there was a sudden spring a ripple in the stream of passersby and the sound of sam s voice crying howdy cal i m durned glad to see ye and in the angles of broadway fifth avenue and twenty third street the cumberland feudists shook hands roses ruses and romance ravenel ravenel the traveller artist and poet threw his magazine to the floor sammy brown broker s clerk who sat by the window jumped what is it ravvy he asked the critics been hammering your stock down romance is dead said ravenel lightly when ravenel spoke lightly be was generally serious he picked up the magazine and fluttered its leaves even a philistine like you sammy said rave nel seriously a tone that insured him to be speak ing lightly ought to understand now here is a magazine that once printed poe and lowell and whitman and bret harte and du maurier and lanier and well that gives you the idea the current number has this literary feast to set before you an article on the stokers and coal bunkers of battleships an expose of the methods employed in making liver wurst a continued story of a standard preferred international baking powder deal in wall street a poem on the bear that the president missed an other story by a young woman who spent a week as a spy making overalls on the east side another fiction story that reeks of the garage and a cer tain make of automobile of course the title contains the words cupid and chauffeur an article on naval strategy illustrated with cuts of the spanish armada and the new staten island ferry boats an other story of a political boss who won the love of a fifth avenue belle by blackening her eye and refusing to vote for an iniquitous ordinance it doesn t say whether it was in the street cleaning department or congress and nineteen pages by the editors brag ging about the circulation the whole thing sammy is an obituary on romance sammy brown sat comfortably in the leather arm chair by the open window his suit was a vehement brown with visible checks beautifully matched in shade by the ends of four cigars that his vest pocket poorly concealed light tan were his shoes gray his socks sky blue his apparent linen snowy and high and adamantine his collar against which a black but terfly had alighted and spread his wings sammy s face least important was round and pleasant and pinkish and in his eyes you saw no haven for fleeing romance that window of ravenel s apartment opened upon an old garden full of ancient trees and shrubbery the apartment house towered above one side of it a high brick wall fended it from the street oppo site ravenel s window an old old mansion stood half hidden in the shade of the summer foliage the house was a castle besieged the city howled and roared and shrieked and beat upon its double doors and shook white fluttering checks above the wall offering terms of surrender the gray dust settled upon the trees the siege was pressed hotter but the draw bridge was not lowered no further will the language of chivalry serve inside lived an old gentleman who loved his home and did not wish to sell it that is all the romance of the besieged castle three or four times every week came sammy brown to ravenel s apartment he belonged to the poet s club for the former browns had been con spicuous though sammy bad been vulgarized by business he had no tears for departed romance the song of the ticker was the one that reached his heart and when it came to matters equine and batting scores he was something of a pink edition he loved to sit in the leather armchair by ravenel s window and ravenel didn t mind particularly sammy seemed to enjoy his talk and then the broker s clerk was such a perfect embodiment of modernity and the day s sordid practicality that ravenel rather liked to use him as a scapegoat i ll tell you what s the matter with you said sammy with the shrewdness that business had taught him the magazine has turned down some of your poetry stunts that s why you are sore at it that would be a good guess in wall street or in a campaign for the presidency of a woman s club said ravenel quietly now there is a poem if you will allow me to call it that of my own in this number of the magazine read it to me said sammy watching a cloud of pipe smoke be had just blown out the window ravenel was no greater than achilles no one is there is bound to be a spot the somebody or other must take bold of us somewhere when she dips us in the something or other that makes us invulnerable he read aloud this verse in the magazine the four roses one rose i twined within your hair white rose that spake of worth and one you placed upon your breast red rose love s seal of birth you plucked another from its stem tea rose that means for aye and one you gave that bore for me the thorns of memory that s a crackerjack said sammy admiringly there are five more verses said ravenel pa tiently sardonic one naturally pauses at the end of each of course oh let s have the rest old man shouted sammy contritely i didn t mean to cut you off i m not much of a poetry expert you know i never saw a poem that didn t look like it ought to have terminal facilities at the end of every verse reel off the rest of it ravenel sighed and laid the magazine down all right said sammy cheerfully we ll have it next time i ll be off now got a date at five o clock he took a last look at the shaded green garden and left whistling in an off key an untuneful air from a roofless farce comedy the next afternoon ravenel while polishing a ragged line of a new sonnet reclined by the window overlooking the besieged garden of the unmercenary baron suddenly he sat up spilling two rhymes and a syllable or two through the trees one window of the old mansion could be seen clearly in its window draped in flow ing white leaned the angel of all his dreams of ro mance and poesy young fresh as a drop of dew graceful as a spray of clematis conferring upon the garden hemmed in by the roaring traffic the air of a princess s bower beautiful as any flower sung by poet thus ravenel saw her for the first time she lingered for a while and then disappeared within leaving a few notes of a birdlike ripple of song to reach his entranced ears through the rattle of cabs and the snarling of the electric cars thus as if to challenge the poet s flaunt at ro mance and to punish him for his recreancy to the undying spirit of youth and beauty this vision bad dawned upon him with a thrilling and accusive power and so metabolic was the power that in an instant the atoms of ravenel s entire world were redistrib uted the laden drays that passed the house in which she lived rumbled a deep double bass to the tune of love the newsboys shouts were the notes of singing birds that garden was the pleasance of the capulets the janitor was an ogre himself a knight ready with sword lance or lute thus does romance show herself amid forests of brick and stone when she gets lost in the city and there has to be sent out a general alarm to find her again at four in the afternoon ravenel looked out across the garden in the window of his hopes were set four small vases each containing a great full blown rose red and white and as he gazed she leaned above them shaming them with her loveliness and seeming to direct her eyes pensively toward his own window and then as though she had caught his respectful but ardent regard she melted away leaving the fragrant emblems on the window sill yes emblems he would be unworthy if be had not understood she had read his poem the four roses it had reached her heart and this was its romantic answer of course she must know that ravenel the poet lived there across her garden his picture too she must have seen in the magazines the delicate tender modest flattering message could not be ignored ravenel noticed beside the roses a small flowering pot containing a plant without shame be brought his opera glasses and employed them from the cover of his window curtain a nutmeg geranium with the true poetic instinct be dragged a book of useless information from his shelves and tore open the leaves at the language of flowers geranium nutmeg i expect a meeting so romance never does things by halves if she comes back to you she brings gifts and her knitting and will sit in your chimney corner if you will let her and now ravenel smiled the lover smiles when be thinks he has won the woman who loves ceases to smile with victory he ends a battle she begins hers what a pretty idea to set the four roses in her window for him to see she must have a sweet poetic soul and now to contrive the meeting a whistling and slamming of doors preluded the coming of sammy brown ravenel smiled again even sammy brown was shone upon by the far flung rays of the renaissance sammy with his ultra clothes his horseshoe pin his plump face his trite slang his uncomprehending admiration of ravenel the broker s clerk made an excellent foil to the new bright unseen visitor to the poet s sombre apartment sammy went to his old seat by the window and looked out over the dusty green foliage in the garden then he looked at his watch and rose hastily by grabs he exclaimed twenty after four i can t stay old man i ve got a date at why did you come then asked ravenel with sarcastic jocularity if you had an engagement at that time i thought you business men kept better account of your minutes and seconds than that sammy hesitated in the doorway and turned pinker fact is ravvy be explained as to a customer whose margin is exhausted i didn t know i had it till i came i ll tell you old man there s a dandy girl in that old house next door that i m dead gone on i put it straight we re engaged the old man says nit but that don t go he keeps her pretty close i can see edith s window from yours here she gives me a tip when she s going shopping and i meet her it s to day maybe i ought to have explained sooner but i know it s all right with you so long how do you get your tip as you call it asked ravenel losing a little spontaneity from his smile roses said sammy briefly four of em to day means four o clock at the corner of broadway and twenty third but the geranium persisted ravenel clutch ing at the end of flying romance s trailing robe means half past shouted sammy from the hall see you to morrow the city of dreadful night during the recent warmed over spell said my friend carney driver of express wagon no a good many opportunities was had of observing human nature through peekaboo waists the park commissioner

instructive to know how she lived on that amount don t care very well probably you are interested in larger amounts six dollars is a larger amount i will tell you how she lived on six dollars per week one afternoon at six when dulcie was sticking her hat pin within an eighth of an inch of her medulla oblongata she said to her chum sadie the girl that waits on you with her left side say sade i made a date for dinner this evening with piggy you never did exclaimed sadie admiringly well ain t you the lucky one piggy s an awful swell and he always takes a girl to swell places he took blanche up to the hoffman house one evening where they have swell music and you see a lot of swells you ll have a swell time dulce dulcie hurried homeward her eyes were shining and her cheeks showed the delicate pink of life s real life s approaching dawn it was friday and she had fifty cents left of her last week s wages the streets were filled with the rush hour floods of people the electric lights of broadway were glowing calling moths from miles from leagues from hundreds of leagues out of darkness around to come in and attend the singeing school men in accurate clothes with faces like those carved on cherry stones by the old salts in sailors homes turned and stared at dulcie as she sped unheeding past them manhattan the night blooming cereus was beginning to unfold its dead white heavy odoured petals dulcie stopped in a store where goods were cheap and bought an imitation lace collar with her fifty cents that money was to have been spent otherwise fifteen cents for supper ten cents for breakfast ten cents for lunch another dime was to be added to her small store of savings and five cents was to be squandered for licorice drops the kind that made your cheek look like the toothache and last as long the licorice was an extravagance almost a carouse but what is life without pleasures dulcie lived in a furnished room there is this difference between a furnished room and a

the diamond is the hardest substance known their mistake landladies know of a compound beside which the diamond is as putty they pack it in the tips of gas burners and one may stand on a chair and dig at it in vain until one s fingers are pink and bruised a hairpin will not remove it therefore let us call it immovable so dulcie lit the gas in its one fourth candlepower glow we will observe the room

patrol wagons be moved homeward with long swift strides his heart was light as be went so rode the knights back to camelot after perils and high deeds done for their ladies fair the kid s lady had com manded him and be had obeyed true it was but a peach that she had craved but it had been no small deed to glean a peach at midnight from that wintry city where yet the february snows lay like iron she had asked for a peach she was his bride in his pocket the peach was warming in his band that held it for fear that it might fall out and be lost on the way the kid turned in at an all night drug store and said to the spectacled clerk say sport i wish you d size up this rib of mine and see if it s broke i was in a little scrap and bumped down a flight or two of stairs the druggist made an examination it isn t broken was his diagnosis but you have a bruise there that looks like you d fallen off the flatiron twice that s all right said the kid let s have your clothesbrush please the bride waited in the rosy glow of the pink lamp shade the miracles were not all passed away by breathing a desire for some slight thing a flower a pomegranate a oh yes a peach she could send forth her man into the night into the world which could not withstand him and he would do her bidding and now be stood by her chair and laid the peach in her band naughty boy she said fondly did i say a peach i think i would much rather have had an orange blest be the bride the harbinger long before the springtide is felt in the dull bosom of the yokel does the city man know that the grass green goddess is upon her throne he sits at his breakfast eggs and toast begirt by stone walls opens his morning paper and sees journalism leave vernal ism at the post for whereas spring s couriers were once the evi dence of our finer senses now the associated press does the trick the warble of the first robin in hackensack the stirring of the maple sap in bennington the bud ding of the pussy willows along main street in syra cuse the first chirp of the bluebird the swan song of the blue point the annual tornado in st louis the plaint of the peach pessimist from pompton n j the regular visit of the tame wild goose with a broken leg to the pond near bilgewater junction the base attempt of the drug trust to boost the price of quinine foiled in the house by congressman jinks the first tall poplar struck by lightning and the usual stunned picknickers who had taken refuge the first crack of the ice jam in the allegheny river the finding of a violet in its mossy bed by the correspondent at round corners these are the advance signs of the burgeoning season that are wired into the wise city while the farmer sees nothing but winter upon his dreary fields but these be mere externals the true harbinger is the heart when strephon seeks his chloe and mike his maggie then only is spring arrived and the newspaper report of the five foot rattler killed in squire pettigrew s pasture confirmed ere the first violet blew mr peters mr ragsdale and mr kidd sat together on a bench in union square and conspired mr peters was the d artag nan of the loafers there he was the dingiest the laziest the sorriest brown blot against the green back ground of any bench in the park but just then he was the most important of the trio mr peters had a wife this had not heretofore affected his standing with ragsy and kidd but to day it invested him with a peculiar interest his friends having escaped matrimony had shown a disposition to deride mr peters for his venture on that troubled sea but at last they had been forced to acknowledge that either he had been gifted with a large foresight or that he was one of fortune s lucky sons for mrs peters had a dollar a whole dollar bill good and receivable by the government for customs taxes and all public dues how to get possession of that dollar was the question up for discussion by the three musty musketeers how do you know it was a dollar asked ragsy the immensity of the sum inclining him to scepticism the coalman seen her have it said mr peters she went out and done some washing yesterday and look what she give me for breakfast the heel of a loaf and a cup of coffee and her with a dollar it s fierce said ragsy say we go up and punch er and stick a towel in er mouth and cop the coin suggested kidd viciously y ain t afraid of a woman are you she might holler and have us pinched demurred ragsy i don t believe in slugging no woman in a houseful of people gent men said mr peters severely through his russet stubble remember that you are speaking of my wife a man who would lift his hand to a lady except in the way of maguire said ragsy pointedly has got his bock beer sign out if we had a dollar we could hush up said mr peters licking his lips we got to get that case note somehow boys ain t what s a man s wife s his leave it to me i ll go over to the house and get it wait here for me i ve seen em give up quick and tell you where it s hid if you kick em in the ribs said kidd no man would kick a woman said peters vir tuously a little choking just a touch on the windpipe that gets away with em and no marks left wait for me i ll bring back that dollar boys high up in a tenement house between second ave nue and the river lived the peterses in a back room so gloomy that the landlord blushed to take the rent for it mrs peters worked at sundry times doing odd jobs of scrubbing and washing mr peters had a pure unbroken record of five years without having earned a penny and yet they clung together shar ing each other s hatred and misery being creatures of habit of habit the power that keeps the earth from flying to pieces though there is some silly theory of gravitation mrs peters reposed her pounds on the safer of the two chairs and gazed stolidly out the one win dow at the brick wall opposite her eyes were red and damp the furniture could have been carried away on a pushcart but no pushcart man would have removed it as a gift the door opened to admit mr peters his fox terrier eyes expressed a wish his wife s diagnosis located correctly the seat of it but misread it hun ger instead of thirst you ll get nothing more to eat till night she said looking out of the window again take your hound dog s face out of the room mr peters s eye calculated the distance between them by taking her by surprise it might be pos sible to spring upon her overthrow her and apply the throttling tactics of which he had boasted to his waiting comrades true it had been only a boast never yet had be dared to lay violent bands upon her but with the thoughts of the delicious cool bock or culmbacher bracing his nerves he was near to upsetting his own theories of the treatment due by a gentleman to a lady but with his loafer s love for the more artistic and less strenuous way he chose diplomacy first the high card in the game the as sumed attitude of success already attained you have a dollar he said loftily but signifi cantly in the tone that goes with the lighting of a cigar when the properties are at hand i have said mrs peters producing the bill from her bosom and crackling it teasingly i am offered a position in a in a tea store said mr peters i am to begin work to morrow but it will be necessary for me to buy a pair of you are a liar said mrs peters reinterring the note no tea store nor no a b c store nor no junk shop would have you i rubbed the skin off both me hands washin jumpers and overalls to make that dollar do you think it come out of them suds to buy the kind you put into you skiddoo get your mind off of money evidently the poses of talleyrand were not worth one hundred cents on that dollar but diplomacy is dexterous the artistic temperament of mr peters lifted him by the straps of his congress gaiters and set him on new ground he called up a look of des perate melancholy to his eyes clara he said hollowly to struggle further is useless you have always misunderstood me heaven knows i have striven with all my might to keep my head above the waves of misfortune but cut out the rainbow of hope and that stuff about walkin one by one through the narrow isles of spain said mrs peters with a sigh i ve heard it so often there s an ounce bottle of carbolic on the shelf behind the empty coffee can drink hearty mr peters reflected what next the old ex pedients had failed the two musty musketeers were awaiting him hard by the ruined chateau that is to say on a park bench with rickety cast iron legs his honor was at stake he had engaged to storm the castle single handed and bring back the treas ure that was to furnish them wassail and solace and all that stood between him and the coveted dollar was his wife once a little girl whom he could aha why not again once with soft words he could as they say twist her around his little finger why not again not for years had he tried it grim poverty and mutual hatred had killed all that but ragsy and kidd were waiting for him to bring the dollar mr peters took a surreptitiously keen look at his wife her formless bulk overflowed the chair she kept her eyes fixed out the window in a strange kind of trance her eyes showed that she had been re cently weeping i wonder said mr peters to himself if there d be anything in it the window was open upon its outlook of brick walls and drab barren back yards except for the mildness of the air that entered it might have been midwinter yet in the city that turns such a frown ing face to besieging spring but spring doesn t come with the thunder of cannon she is a sapper and a miner and you must capitulate i ll try it said mr peters to himself making a wry face he went up to his wife and put his arm across her shoulders clara darling he said in tones that shouldn t have fooled a baby seal why should we have hard words ain t you my own tootsum wootsums a black mark against you mr peters in the sa red ledger of cupid charges of attempted graft are filed against you and of forgery and utterance of two of love s holiest of appellations but the miracle of spring was wrought into the back room over the back alley between the black walls had crept the harbinger it was ridiculous and yet well it is a rat trap and you madam and sir and all of us are in it red and fat and crying like niobe or niagara mrs peters threw her arms around her lord and dissolved upon him mr peters would have striven to extricate the dollar bill from its deposit vault but his arms were bound to his sides do you love me james asked mrs peters madly said james but you are ill exclaimed mrs peters why are you so pale and tired looking i feel weak said mr peters i oh wait i know what it is wait james i ll be back in a minutes with a parting bug that revived in mr peters recollections of the terrible turk his wife hurried out of the room and down the stairs mr peters hitched his thumbs under his sus penders all right he confided to the ceiling i ve got her going i hadn t any idea the old girl was soft any more under the foolish rib well sir ain t i the claude melnotte of the lower east side what it s a to shot that i get the dollar i wonder what she went out for i guess she s gone to tell mrs muldoon on the second floor that we re recon ciled i ll remember this soft soap and ragsy was talking about slugging her mrs peters came back with a bottle of sarsapa rilla i m glad i happened to have that dollar she said you re all run down boney mr peters had a tablespoonful of the stuff in serted into him then mrs peters sat on his lap and murmured call me tootsum wootsums again james he sat still held there by his materialized goddess of spring spring had come on the bench in union square mr ragsdale and mr kidd squirmed tongue parched awaiting d artagnan and his dollar i wish i had choked her at first said mr peters to himself while the auto waits promptly at the beginning of twilight came again to that quiet corner of that quiet small park the girl in gray she sat upon a bench and read a book for there was yet to come a half hour in which print could be accomplished to repeat her dress was gray and plain enough to mask its impeccancy of style and fit a large meshed veil imprisoned her turban hat and a face that shone through it with a calm and unconscious beauty she had come there at the same hour on the day previous and on the day before that and there was one who knew it the young man who knew it hovered near relying upon burnt sacrifices to the great joss luck his piety was rewarded for in turning a page her book slipped from her fingers and bounded from the bench a full yard away the young man pounced upon it with instant avid ity returning it to its owner with that air that seems to flourish in parks and public places a compound of gallantry and hope tempered with respect for the policeman on the beat in a pleasant voice be risked an inconsequent remark upon the weather that in troductory topic responsible for so much of the world s unhappiness and stood poised for a mo ment awaiting his fate the girl looked him over leisurely at his ordinary neat dress and his features distinguished by nothing particular in the way of expression you may sit down if you like she said in a full deliberate contralto really i would like to have you do so the light is too bad for reading i would prefer to talk the vassal of luck slid upon the seat by her side with complaisance do you know be said speaking the formula with which park chairmen open their meetings that you are quite the stunningest girl i have seen in a long time i had my eye on you yesterday didn t know somebody was bowled over by those pretty lamps of yours did you honeysuckle whoever you are said the girl in icy tones you must remember that i am a lady i will excuse the remark you have just made because the mistake was doubtless not an unnatural one in your circle i asked you to sit down if the invitation must con stitute me your honeysuckle consider it with drawn i earnestly beg your pardon pleaded the young ran his expression of satisfaction had changed to one of penitence and humility it was my fault you know i mean there are girls in parks you know that is of course you don t know but abandon the subject if you please of course i know now tell me about these people passing and crowding each way along these paths where are they going why do they hurry so are they happy the young man had promptly abandoned his air of coquetry his cue was now for a waiting part he could not guess the role be would be expected to play it is interesting to watch them he replied pos tulating her mood it is the wonderful drama of life some are going to supper and some to er other places one wonders what their histories are i do not said the girl i am not so inquisi tive i come here to sit because here only can i be tear the great common throbbing heart of hu manity my part in life is cast where its beats are never felt can you surmise why i spoke to you mr parkenstacker supplied the young man then be looked eager and hopeful no said the girl holding up a slender finger and smiling slightly you would recognize it im mediately it is impossible to keep one s name out of print or even one s portrait this veil and this hat of my maid furnish me with an incog you should have seen the chauffeur stare at it when he thought i did not see candidly there are five or six names that belong in the holy of holies and mine by the accident of birth is one of them i spoke to you mr stackenpot parkenstacker corrected the young man mod estly mr parkenstacker because i wanted to talk for once with a natural man one unspoiled by the despicable gloss of wealth and supposed social su periority oh you do not know how weary i am of it money money money and of the men who surround me dancing like little marionettes all cut by the same pattern i am sick of pleasure of jewels of travel of society of luxuries of all kinds i always had an idea ventured the young man hesitatingly that money must be a pretty good thing a competence is to be desired but when you leave so many millions that she concluded the sentence with a gesture of despair it is the mo otony of it she continued that palls drives dinners theatres balls suppers with the gilding of superfluous wealth over it all sometimes the very tinkle of the ice in my champagne glass nearly drives me mad mr parkenstacker looked ingenuously interested i have always liked he said to read and hear about the ways of wealthy and fashionable folks i suppose i am a bit of a snob but i like to have my information accurate now i had formed the opin ion that champagne is cooled in the bottle and not by placing ice in the glass the girl gave a musical laugh of genuine amuse ment you should know she explained in an indul gent tone that we of the non useful class depend for our amusement upon departure from precedent just now it is a fad to put ice in champagne the idea was originated by a visiting prince of tartary while dining at the waldorf it will soon give way to some other whim just as at a dinner party this week on madison avenue a green kid glove was laid by the plate of each guest to be put on and used while eating olives i see admitted the young man humbly these special diversions of the inner circle do not become familiar to the common public sometimes continued the girl acknowledging his confession of error by a slight bow i have thought that if i ever should love a man it would be one of lowly station one who is a worker and not a drone but doubtless the claims of caste and wealth will prove stronger than my inclination just now i am besieged by two one is a grand duke of a german principality i think he has or has bad a wife somewhere driven mad by his intemperance and cruelty the other is an english marquis so cold and mercenary that i even prefer the diabolism of the duke what is it that impels me to tell you these things mr packenstacker parkenstacker breathed the young man in deed you cannot know how much i appreciate your confidences the girl contemplated him with the calm imper sonal regard that befitted the difference in their sta tions what is your line of business mr parken stacker she asked a very humble one but i hope to rise in the world were you really in earnest when you said that you could love a man of lowly position indeed i was but i said might there is the grand duke and the marquis you know yes no calling could be too humble were the man what i would wish him to be i work declared mr parkenstacker in a res taurant the girl shrank slightly not as a waiter she said a little imploringly labor is noble but personal attendance you know valets and i am not a waiter i am cashier in on the street they faced that bounded the opposite side of the park was the brilliant electric sign restau rant i am cashier in that restaurant you am there the girl consulted a tiny watch set in a bracelet of rich design upon her left wrist and rose hurriedly she thrust her book into a glittering reticule sus pended from her waist for which however the book was too large why are you not at work she asked i am on the night turn said the young man it is yet an hour before my period begins may i not hope to see you again i do not know perhaps but the whim may not seize me again i must go quickly now there is a dinner and a box at the play and oh the same old round perhaps you noticed an automobile at the upper corner of the park as you came one with a white body and red running gear asked the young man knitting his brows reflectively yes i always come in that pierre waits for me there he supposes me to be shopping in the de partment store across the square conceive of the bondage of the life wherein we must deceive even our chauffeurs good night but it is dark now said mr parkenstacker and the park is full of rude men may i not walk if you have the slightest regard for my wishes said the girl firmly you will remain at this bench for ten minutes after i have left i do not mean to accuse you but you are probably aware that autos generally bear the monogram of their owner again good night swift and stately she moved away through the dusk the young man watched her graceful form as she reached the pavement at the park s edge and turned up along it toward the corner where stood the automobile then he treacherously and unhesitat ingly began to dodge and skim among the park trees and shrubbery in a course parallel to her route keep ing her well in sight when she reached the corner she turned her head to glance at the motor car and then passed it con tinuing on across the street sheltered behind a con venient standing cab the young man followed her movements closely with his eyes passing down the sidewalk of the street opposite the park she entered the restaurant with the blazing sign the place was one of those frankly glaring establishments all white paint and glass where one may dine cheaply and conspicuously the girl penetrated the restaurant to some retreat at its rear whence she quickly emerged without her bat and veil the cashier s desk was well to the front a red head girl an the stool climbed down glancing pointedly at the clock as she did so the girl in gray mounted in her place the young man thrust his hands into his pockets and walked slowly back along the sidewalk at the corner his foot struck a small paper covered volume lying there sending it sliding to the edge of the turf by its picturesque cover he recognized it as the book the girl had been reading he picked it up carelessly and saw that its title was new arabian nights the author being of the name of stevenson he dropped it again upon the grass and lounged irresolute for a minute then he stepped into the automobile reclined upon the cushions and said two words to the chauffeur club henri a comedy in rubber one may hope in spite of the metaphorists to avoid the breath of the deadly upas tree one may by great good fortune succeed in blacking the eye of the basilisk one might even dodge the attentions of cer berus and argus but no man alive or dead can es cape the gaze of the rubberer new york is the caoutchouc city there are many of course who go their ways making money without turning to the right or the left but there is a tribe abroad wonderfully composed like the martians solely of eyes and means of locomotion these devotees of curiosity swarm like flies in a moment in a struggling breathless circle about the scene of an unusual occurrence if a workman opens a manhole if a street car runs over a man from north tarrytown if a little boy drops an egg on his way home from the grocery if a casual house or two drops into the subway if a lady loses a nickel through a hole in the lisle thread if the police drag a telephone and a racing chart forth from an ibsen society reading room if senator depew or mr chuck connors walks out to take the air if any of these incidents or accidents takes place you will see the mad irresistible rush of the rubber tribe to the spot the importance of the event does not count they gaze with equal interest and absorption at a cho rus girl or at a man painting a liver pill sign they will form as deep a cordon around a man with a club foot as they will around a balked automobile they have the furor rubberendi they are optical glut tons feasting and fattening on the misfortunes of their fellow beings they gloat and pore and glare and squint and stare with their fishy eyes like goggle eyed perch at the book baited with calamity it would seem that cupid would find these ocular vampires too cold game for his calorific shafts but have we not yet to discover an immune even among the protozoa yes beautiful romance descended upon two of this tribe and love came into their hearts as they crowded about the prostrate form of a man who had been run over by a brewery wagon william pry was the first on the spot he was an expert at such gatherings with an expression of in tense happiness on his features be stood over the vic tim of the accident listening to his groans as if to the sweetest music when the crowd of spectators had swelled to a closely packed circle william saw a violent commotion in the crowd opposite him men were hurled aside like ninepins by the impact of some moving body that clove them like the rush of a tor nado with elbows umbrella hat pin tongue and fingernails doing their duty violet seymour forced her way through the mob of onlookers to the first row strong men who even had been able to secure a seat on the harlem express staggered back like chil dren as she bucked centre two large lady spectators who bad seen the duke of roxburgh married and had often blocked traffic on twenty third street fell back into the second row with ripped shirtwaists when violet had finished with them william pry loved her at first sight the ambulance removed the unconscious agent of cupid william and violet remained after the crowd had dispersed they were true rubberers people who leave the scene of an accident with the ambulance have not genuine caoutchouc in the cosmogony of their necks the delicate fine flavor of the affair is to be bad only in the after taste in gloating over the spot in gazing fixedly at the houses opposite in hovering there in a dream more exquisite than the opium eater s ecstasy william pry and violet sey mour were connoisseurs in casualties they knew bow to extract full enjoyment from every incident presently they looked at each other violet had a brown birthmark on her neck as large as a silver half dollar william fixed his eyes upon it william pry had inordinately bowed legs violet allowed her gaze to linger unswervingly upon them face to face they stood thus for moments each staring at the other etiquette would not allow them to speak but in the caoutchouc city it is permitted to gaze with out stint at the trees in the parks and at the physi cal blemishes of a fellow creature at length with a sigh they parted but cupid had been the driver of the brewery wagon and the wheel that broke a leg united two fond hearts the next meeting of the hero and heroine was in front of a board fence near broadway the day had been a disappointing one there had been no fights on the street children had kept from under the wheels of the street cars cripples and fat men in negligee shirts were scarce nobody seemed to be inclined to slip on banana peels or fall down with heart disease even the sport from kokomo ind who claims to be a cousin of ex mayor low and scatters nickels from a cab window had not put in his appearance there was nothing to stare at and william pry had premonitions of ennui but he saw a large crowd scrambling and pushing excitedly in front of a billboard sprinting for it he knocked down an old woman and a child carrying a bottle of milk and fought his way like a demon into the mass of spectators already in the inner line stood violet seymour with one sleeve and two gold fill ings gone a corset steel puncture and a sprained wrist but happy she was looking at what there was to see a man was painting upon the fence eat bricklets they fill your face violet blushed when she saw william pry william jabbed a lady in a black silk raglan in the ribs kicked a boy in the shin bit an old gentleman on the left ear and managed to crowd nearer to violet they stood for an hour looking at the man paint the letters then william s love could be repressed no longer he touched her on the arm come with me he said i know where there is a bootblack without an adam s apple she looked up at him shyly yet with unmistakable love transfiguring her countenance and you have saved it for me she asked trembling with the first dim ecstasy of a woman be loved together they hurried to the bootblack s stand an hour they spent there gazing at the malformed youth a window cleaner fell from the fifth story to the sidewalk beside them as the ambulance came clang ing up william pressed her hand joyously four ribs at least and a compound fracture he whispered swiftly you are not sorry that you met me are you dearest me said violet returning the pressure sure not i could stand all day rubbering with you the climax of the romance occurred a few days later perhaps the reader will remember the intense excitement into which the city was thrown when eliza jane a colored woman was served with a subpoena the rubber tribe encamped on the spot with his own hands william pry placed a board upon two beer kegs in the street opposite eliza jane s residence he and violet sat there for three days and nights then it occurred to a detective to open the door and serve the subpoena he sent for a kinetoscope and did so two souls with such congenial tastes could not long remain apart as a policeman drove them away with his night stick that evening they plighted their troth the seeds of love bad been well sown and had grown up hardy and vigorous into a let us call it a rub ber plant the wedding of william pry and violet seymour was set for june the big church in the middle of the block was banked high with flowers the populous tribe of rubberers the world over is ram pant over weddings they are the pessimists of the pews they are the guyers of the groom and the banterers of the bride they come to laugh at your marriage and should you escape from hymen s tower on the back of death s pale steed they will come to the funeral and sit in the same pew and cry over your luck rubber will stretch the church was lighted a grosgrain carpet lay over the asphalt to the edge of the sidewalk brides maids were patting one another s sashes awry and speaking of the bride s freckles coachmen tied white ribbons on their whips and bewailed the space of time between drinks the minister was musing over his possible fee essaying conjecture whether it would suffice to purchase a new broadcloth suit for himself and a photograph of laura jane libbey for his wife yea cupid was in the air and outside the church oh my brothers surged and heaved the rank and file of the tribe of rubberers in two bodies they were with the grosgrain carpet and cops with clubs between they crowded like cattle they fought they pressed and surged and swayed and trampled one another to see a bit of a girl in a white veil acquire license to go through a man s pockets while be sleeps but the hour for the wedding came and went and the bride and bridegroom came not and impatience gave way to alarm and alarm brought about search and they were not found and then two big police men took a band and dragged out of the furious mob of onlookers a crushed and trampled thing with a wedding ring in its vest pocket and a shredded and hysterical woman beating her way to the carpet s edge ragged bruised and obstreperous william pry and violet seymour creatures of habit had joined in the seething game of the specta tors unable to resist the overwhelming desire to gaze upon themselves entering as bride and bridegroom the rose decked church rubber will out one thousand dollars one thousand dollars repeated lawyer tolman solemnly and severely and here is the money young gillian gave a decidedly amused laugh as he fingered the thin package of new fifty dollar notes it s such a confoundedly awkward amount he explained genially to the lawyer if it had been ten thousand a fellow might wind up with a lot of fireworks and do himself credit even fifty dollars would have been less trouble you heard the reading of your uncle s will con tinued lawyer tolman professionally dry in his tones i do not know if you paid much attention to its details i must remind you of one you are required to render to us an account of the manner of expenditure of this as soon as you have dis posed of it the will stipulates that i trust that you will so far comply with the late mr gillian s wishes you may depend upon it said the young man politely in spite of the extra expense it will entail i may have to engage a secretary i was never good at accounts gillian went to his club there be hunted out one whom he called old bryson old bryson was calm and forty and sequestered he was in a corner reading a book and when he saw gillian approaching he sighed laid down his book and took off his glasses old bryson wake up said gillian i ve a funny story to tell you i wish you would tell it to some one in the billiard room said old bryson you know how i hate your stories this is a better one than usual said gillian rolling a cigarette and i m glad to tell it to you it s too sad and funny to go with the rattling of billiard bars i ve just come from my late uncle s firm of legal corsairs he leaves me an even thou sand dollars now what can a man possibly do with a thousand dollars i thought said old bryson showing as much interest as a bee shows in a vinegar cruet that the late septimus gillian was worth something like half a million he was assented gillian joyously and that s where the joke comes in he s left his whole cargo of doubloons to a microbe that is part of it goes to the man who invents a new bacillus and the rest to es tablish a hospital for doing away with it again there are one or two trifling bequests on the side the butler and the housekeeper get a seal ring and each his nephew gets you ve always had plenty of money to spend observed old bryson tons said gillian uncle was the fairygod mother as far as an allowance was concerned any other heirs asked old bryson none gillian frowned at his cigarette and kicked the upholstered leather of a divan uneasily there is a miss hayden a ward of my uncle who lived in his house she s a quiet thing musical the daughter of somebody who was unlucky enough to be his friend i forgot to say that she was in on the seal ring and joke too i wish i had been then i could have had two bottles of brut tipped the waiter with the ring and had the whole business off my bands don t be superior and insulting old bry son tell me what a fellow can do with a thousand dollars old bryson rubbed his glasses and smiled and when old bryson smiled gillian knew that be in tended to be more offensive than ever a thousand dollars lie said means much or little one man may buy a happy home with it and laugh at rockefeller another could send his wife south with it and save her life a thousand dollars would buy pure milk for one hundred babies during june july and august and save fifty of their lives you could count upon a half hour s diversion with it at faro in one of the fortified art galleries it would furnish an education to an ambitious boy i am told that a genuine corot was secured for that amount in an auction room yesterday you could move to a new hampshire town and live respectably two years on it you could rent madison square garden for one evening with it and lecture your audience if you should have one on the precariousness of the pro fession of heir presumptive people might like you old bryson said gillian always unruffled if you wouldn t moralize i asked you to tell me what i could do with a thousand dollars you said bryson with a gentle laugh why bobby gillian there s only one logical thing you could do you can go buy miss lotta lauriere a diamond pendant with the money and then take yourself off to idaho and inflict your presence upon a ranch i advise a sheep ranch as i have a particular dislike for sheep thanks said gillian rising i thought i could depend upon you old bryson you ve hit on the very scheme i wanted to chuck the money in a lump for i ve got to turn in an account for it and i hate itemizing gillian phoned for a cab and said to the driver the stage entrance of the columbine theatre miss lotta lauriere was assisting nature with a powder puff almost ready for her call at a crowded matinee when her dresser mentioned the name of mr gillian let it in said miss lauriere now what is it bobby i m going on in two minutes

it figured out second story chinks and chop suey third floor manicures and foreign mis sions fourth floor poolroom if you was think of putting up the capital oh no said gillian i merely asked from cu riosity i take you by the hour drive til i tell you to stop eight blocks down broadway gillian poked up the trap with his cane and got out a blind man sat upon a stool on the sidewalk selling pencils gillian went out and stood before him excuse me he said but would you mind tell ing me what you would do if you bad a thousand dollars you got out of that cab that just drove up didn t you asked the blind man i did said gillian guess you are all right said the pencil dealer to ride in a cab by daylight take a look at that if you like he drew a small book from his coat pocket and held it out gillian opened it and saw that it was a bank deposit book it showed a balance of to the blind man s credit gillian returned the book and got into the cab i forgot something be said you may drive to the law offices of tolman sharp at broad way lawyer tolman looked at him hostilely and in quiringly through his gold rimmed glasses i beg your pardon said gillian cheerfully but may i ask you a question it is not an im pertinent one i hope was miss hayden left any thing by my uncle s will besides the ring and the nothing said mr tolman i thank you very much sir said gillian and on he went to his cab he gave the driver the ad dress of his late uncle s home miss hayden was writing letters in the library she was small and slender and clothed in black but you would have noticed her eyes gillian drifted in with his air of regarding the world as inconsequent i ve just come from old tolman s he explained they ve been going over the papers down there they found a gillian searched his memory for a legal term they found an amendment or a post script or something to the will it seemed that the old boy loosened up a little on second thoughts and willed you a thousand dollars i was driving up this way and tolman asked me to bring you the money here it is you d better count it to see if it s right gillian laid the money beside her hand on the desk miss hayden turned white oh she said and again oh gillian half turned and looked out the window i suppose of course be said in a low voice that you know i love you i am sorry said miss hayden taking up her money there is no use asked gillian almost light heartedly i am sorry she said again may i write a note asked gillian with a smile i re seated himself at the big library table she sup plied him with paper and pen and then went back to her secretaire gillian made out his account of his expenditure of the thousand dollars i i these words paid by the black sheep robert gillian on account of the eternal happiness owed by heaven to the best and dearest woman on earth gillian slipped his writing into an envelope bowed and went his way his cab stopped again at the offices of tolman sharp i have expended the thousand dollars he said cheerily to tolman of the gold glasses and i have come to render account of it as i agreed there is quite a feeling of summer in the air do you not think so mr tolman he tossed a white envelope on the lawyer s table you will find there a memo randum sir of the modus operandi of the vanishing of the dollars without touching the envelope mr tolman went to a door and called his partner sharp together they explored the caverns of an immense safe forth they dragged as trophy of their search a big envelope sealed with wax this they forcibly invaded and wagged their venerable heads together over its con tents then tolman became spokesman mr gillian he said formally there was a codicil to your uncle s will it was intrusted to us privately with instructions that it be not opened until you had furnished us with a full account of your handling of the bequest in the will as you have fulfilled the conditions my partner and i have read the codicil i do not wish to encumber your understanding with its legal phraseology but i will acquaint you with the spirit of its contents in the event that your disposition of the demonstrates that you possess any of the qualifica tions that deserve reward much benefit will accrue to you mr sharp and i are named as the judges and i assure you that we will do our duty strictly according to justice with liberality we are not at all unfavorably disposed toward you mr gillian but let us return to the letter of the codicil if your disposal of the money in question has been prudent wise or unselflish it is in our power to hand you over bonds to the value of which have been placed in our hands for that purpose but if as our client the late mr gillian explicitly provides you have used this money as you have money in the past i quote the late mr gillian in reprehensible dissipation among disreputable associates the is to be paid to miriam hayden ward of the late mr gillian without delay now mr gillian mr sharp and i will examine your account in regard to the you submit it in writing i believe i hope you will repose confidence in our decision mr tolman reached for the envelope gillian was a little the quicker in taking it up he tore the account and its cover leisurely into strips and dropped them into his pocket it s all right he said smilingly there isn t a bit of need to bother you with this i don t suppose you d understand these itemized bets anyway i lost the thousand dollars on the races good day to you gentlemen tolman sharp shook their beads mournfully at each other when gillian left for they heard him whis tling gayly in the hallway as he waited for the elevator the defeat of the city robert walmsley s descent upon the city resulted in a kilkenny struggle he came out of the fight victor by a fortune and a reputation on the other band he was swallowed up by the city the city gave him what he demanded and then branded him with its brand it remodelled cut trimmed and stamped him to the pattern it approves it opened its social gates to him and shut him in on a close cropped formal lawn with the select herd of rumi nants in dress habits manners provincialism routine and narrowness he acquired that charming in solence that irritating completeness that sophisti cated crassness that overbalanced poise that makes the manhattan gentleman so delightfully small in his greatness one of the up state rural counties pointed with pride to the successful young metropolitan lawyer as a product of its soil six years earlier this county had removed the wheat straw from between its huckle berry stained teeth and emitted a derisive and bucolic laugh as old man walmsley s freckle faced bob abandoned the certain three per diem meals of the one horse farm for the discontinuous quick lunch counters of the three ringed metropolis at the end of the six years no murder trial coaching party au tomobile accident or cotillion was complete in which the name of robert walmsley did not figure tailors waylaid him in the street to get a new wrinkle from the cut of his unwrinkled trousers hyphenated fel lows in the clubs and members of the oldest subpoenaed families were glad to clap him on the back and allow him three letters of his name but the matterhorn of robert walmsley s success was not scaled until be married alicia van der pool i cite the matterhorn for just so high and cool and white and inaccessible was this daughter of the old burghers the social alps that ranged about her over whose bleak passes a thousand climbers struggled reached only to her knees she towered in her own atmosphere serene chaste prideful wading in no fountains dining no monkeys breeding no dogs for bench shows she was a van der pool fountains were made to play for her monkeys were made for other people s ancestors dogs she understood were created to be companions of blind persons and objec tionable characters who smoked pipes this was the matterhorn that robert walmsley accomplished if he found with the good poet with the game foot and artificially curled hair that he who ascends to mountain tops will find the loftiest peaks most wrapped in clouds and snow he concealed his chilblains beneath a brave and smiling exterior he was a lucky man and knew it even though he were imitating the spartan boy with an ice cream freezer beneath his doublet frappeeing the region of his heart after a brief wedding tour abroad the couple re turned to create a decided ripple in the calm cistern so placid and cool and sunless it is of the best so ciety they entertained at their red brick mausoleum of ancient greatness in an old square that is a ceme tery of crumbled glory and robert walmsley was proud of his wife although while one of his hands shook his guests the other held tightly to his alpen stock and thermometer one day alicia found a letter written to robert by his mother it was an unerudite letter full of crops and motherly love and farm notes it chronicled the health of the pig and the recent red calf and asked concerning robert s in return it was a letter direct from the soil straight from home full of biographies of bees tales of turnips peaans of new laid eggs neg lected parents and the slump in dried apples why have i not been shown your mother s let ters asked alicia there was always something in her voice that made you think of lorgnettes of ac counts at tiffany s of sledges smoothly gliding on the trail from dawson to forty mile of the tinkling of pendant prisms on your grandmothers chandeliers of snow lying on a convent roof of a police sergeant refusing bail your mother continued alicia invites us to make a visit to the farm i have never seen a farm we will go there for a week or two robert we will said robert with the grand air of an associate supreme justice concurring in an opinion i did not lay the invitation before you because i thought you would not care to go i am much pleased at your decision i will write to her myself answered alicia with a faint foreshadowing of enthusiasm felice shall pack my trunks at once seven i think will be enough i do not suppose that your mother entertains a great deal does she give many house parties robert arose and as attorney for rural places filed a demurrer against six of the seven trunks he en deavored to define picture elucidate set forth and describe a farm his own words sounded strange in his ears he had not realized how thoroughly urbsi dized he had become a week passed and found them landed at the little country station five hours out from the city a grin ning stentorian sarcastic youth driving a mule to a spring wagon hailed robert savagely hallo mr walmsley found your way back at last have you sorry i couldn t bring in the auto mobile for you but dad s bull tonguing the ten acre clover patch with it to day guess you ll excuse my not wearing a dress suit over to meet you it ain t six o clock yet you know i m glad to see you tom said robert grasp ing his brother s band yes i ve found my way at last you ve a right to say at last it s been over two years since the last time but it will be oftener after this my boy alicia cool in the summer beat as an arctic wraith white as a norse snow maiden in her flimsy muslin and fluttering lace parasol came round the corner of the station and tom was stripped of his assurance he became chiefly eyesight clothed in blue jeans and on the homeward drive to the mule alone did he confide in language the inwardness of his thoughts they drove homeward the low sun dropped a spendthrift flood of gold upon the fortunate fields of wheat the cities were far away the road lay curl ing around wood and dale and bill like a ribbon lost from the robe of careless summer the wind followed like a whinnying colt in the track of phoebus s steeds by and by the farmhouse peeped gray out of its faithful grove they saw the long lane with its convoy of walnut trees running from the road to the house they smelled the wild rose and the breath of cool damp willows in the creek s bed and then in unison all the voices of the soil began a chant addressed to the soul of robert walmsley out of the tilted aisles of the dim wood they came hollowly they chirped and buzzed from the parched grass they trilled from the ripples of the creek ford they floated up in clear pan s pipe notes from the dimming meadows the whippoorwills joined in as they pursued midges in the upper air slow going cow bells struck out a homely accompaniment and this was what each one said you ve found your way back at last have you the old voices of the soil spoke to him leaf and bud and blossom conversed with him in the old vocabu lary of his careless youth the inanimate things the familiar stones and rails the gates and furrows and roofs and turns of the road had an eloquence too and a power in the transformation the country had smiled and he had felt the breath of it and his heart was drawn as if in a moment back to his old love the city was far away this rural atavism then seized robert walmsley and possessed him a queer thing he noticed in con nection with it was that alicia sitting at his side suddenly seemed to him a stranger she did not be long to this recurrent phase never before had she seemed so remote so colorless and high so intan gible and unreal and yet he had never admired her more than when she sat there by him in the rickety spring wagon chiming no more with his mood and with her environment than the matterhorn chimes with a peasant s cabbage garden that night when the greetings and the supper were over the entire family including buff the yellow dog bestrewed itself upon the front porch alicia not haughty but silent sat in the shadow dressed in an exquisite pale gray tea gown robert s mother dis coursed to her happily concerning marmalade and lumbago tom sat on the top step sisters millie and pam on the lowest step to catch the lightning bugs mother had the willow rocker father sat in the big armchair with one of its arms gone buff sprawled in the middle of the porch in everybody s way the twilight pixies and pucks stole forth un seen and plunged other poignant shafts of memory into the heart of robert a rural madness entered his soul the city was far away father sat without his pipe writhing in his heavy boots a sacrifice to rigid courtesy robert shouted no you don t he fetched the pipe and lit it he seized the old gentleman s boots and tore them off the last one slipped suddenly and mr robert walmsley of washington square tumbled off the porch backward with buff on top of him bowling fearfully tom laughed sarcastically robert tore off his coat and vest and hurled them into a lilac bush come out here you landlubber be cried to tom and i ll put grass seed on your back i think you called me a dude a while ago come along and cut your capers tom understood the invitation and accepted it with delight three times they wrestled on the grass side holds even as the giants of the mat and twice was tom forced to bite grass at the hands of the distinguished lawyer dishevelled panting each still boasting of his

went with lonny to the capitol and stood there before the picture the artist pulled his beard and looked unhappy should like to have your sentiments said lonny just as they run out of the pen it s the way they ll come said the painter man i took three different kinds of medicine before dinner by the tablespoonful the taste still lingers i am primed for telling the truth you want to know if the picture is or if it isn t right said lonny is it wool or cotton should i paint some more or cut it out and ride herd a plenty i heard a rumour during pie said the artist that the state is about to pay you two thousand dollars for this picture it s passed the senate said lonny and the house rounds it up to morrow that s lucky said the pale man do you carry a rabbit s foot no said lonny but it seems i had a grandfather he s considerable mixed up in the colour scheme it took me a year to paint that picture is she entirely awful or not some says now that the steer s tail ain t badly drawed they think it s proportioned nice tell me the artist glanced at lonny s wiry figure and nut brown skin something stirred him to a passing irritation for art s sake son he said fractiously don t spend any more money for paint it isn t a picture at all it s a gun you hold up the state with it if you like and get your two thousand but don t get in front of any more canvas live under it buy a couple of hundred ponies with the money i m told they re that cheap and ride ride ride fill your lungs and eat and sleep and be happy no more pictures you look healthy that s genius cultivate it he looked at his watch twenty minutes to three four capsules and one tablet at three that s all you wanted to know isn t it at three o clock the cowpunchers rode up for lonny bringing hot tamales saddled traditions must be observed to celebrate the passage of the bill by the senate the gang must ride wildly through the town creating uproar and excitement liquor must be partaken of the suburbs shot up and the glory of the san saba country vociferously proclaimed a part of the programme had been carried out in the saloons on the way up lonny mounted hot tamales the accomplished little beast prancing with fire and intelligence he was glad to feel lonny s bowlegged grip against his ribs again lonny was his friend and he was willing to do things for him come on boys said lonny urging hot tomales into a gallop with his knees with a whoop the inspired lobby tore after him through the dust lonny led his cohorts straight for the capitol with a wild yell the gang endorsed his now evident intention of riding into it hooray for san saba up the six broad limestone steps clattered the broncos of the cowpunchers into the resounding hallway they pattered scattering in dismay those passing on foot lonny in the lead shoved hot tamales direct for the great picture at that hour a downpouring soft light from the second story windows bathed the big canvas against the darker background of the hall the painting stood out with valuable effect in spite of the defects of the art you could almost fancy that you gazed out upon a landscape you might well flinch a step from the convincing figure of the life size steer stampeding across the grass perhaps it seemed thus to hot tamales the scene was in his line perhaps he only obeyed the will of his rider his ears pricked up he snorted lonny leaned forward in the saddle and elevated his elbows wing like thus signals the cowpuncher to his steed to launch himself full speed ahead did hot tamales fancy he saw a steer red and cavorting that should be headed off and driven back to the herd there was a fierce clatter of hoofs a rush a gathering of steely flank muscles a leap to the jerk of the bridle rein and hot tamales with lonny bending low in the saddle to dodge the top of the frame ripped through the great canvas like a shell from a mortar leaving the cloth hanging in ragged sheds about a monstrous hole quickly lonny pulled up his pony and rounded the pillars spectators came running too astounded to add speech to the commotion the sergeant at arms of the house came forth frowned looked ominous and then grinned many of the legislators crowded out to observe the tumult lonny s cowpunchers were stricken to silent horror by his mad deed senator kinney happened to be among the earliest to emerge before he could speak lonny leaned in his saddle as hot tamales pranced pointed his quirt at the senator and said calmly that was a fine speech you made to day mister but you might as well let up on that propriation business i ain t askin the state to give me nothin i thought i had a picture to sell to it but it wasn t one you said a heap of things about grandfather briscoe that makes me kind of proud i m his grandson well the briscoes ain t takin presents from the state yet anybody can have the frame that wants it hit her up boys away scuttled the san saba delegation out of the hall down the steps along the dusty street halfway to the san saba country they camped that night at bedtime lonny stole away from the campfire and sought hot tamales placidly eating grass at the end of his stake rope lonny hung upon his neck and his art aspirations went forth

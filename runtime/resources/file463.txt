kidd she only had one meal and prayers a day and counted her society worth a week i found nine widows of supreme judges twelve relicts of governors and generals and twenty two ruins left by various happy colonels professors and majors who valued their aristocratic worth from to per week with weak kneed hash and dried apples on the side i admire people of fine descent but my stomach yearns for pork and beans instead of culture am i not right your words said the reporter convince me that you have uttered what you have said thanks you see how it is i am not wealthy i have only my per diem and my perquisites and i cannot afford to pay for high lineage and moldy ancestors a little corned beef goes further with me than a coronet and when i am cold a coat of arms does not warm me i greatly

in the land i am now desperate said the representative as he chewed a tack awhile thinking it was a clove i want to find a boarding house where the proprietress was an orphan found in a livery stable whose father was a dago from east austin and whose grandfather was never placed on the map i want a scrubby ornery low down snuff dipping back woodsy piebald gang who never heard of finger bowls or

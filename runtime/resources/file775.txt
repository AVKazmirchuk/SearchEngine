the emphatic type large sized active bold and debonair in demeanour vain beyond a doubt slightly swaggering ready and at ease he was well clothed but with a shade too much ornateness he was seeking a lawyer but if that fact would seem to saddle him with troubles they were not patent in his beaming eye and courageous air my name is gooch at length the lawyer admitted upon pressure he would also have confessed to the phineas c but he did not consider it good practice to volunteer information i did not receive your card he continued by way of rebuke so i i know you didn t remarked the visitor coolly and you won t just yet light up he threw a leg over an arm of his chair and tossed a handful of rich hued cigars upon the table lawyer gooch knew the brand he thawed just enough to accept the invitation to smoke you are a divorce lawyer said the cardless visitor this time there was no interrogation in his voice nor did his words constitute a simple assertion they formed a charge a denunciation as one would say to a dog you are a dog lawyer gooch was silent under the imputation you handle continued the visitor all the various ramifications of busted up connubiality you are a surgeon we might saw who extracts cupid s darts when he shoots em into the wrong parties you furnish patent incandescent lights for premises where the torch of hymen has burned so low you can t light a cigar at it am i right mr gooch i have undertaken cases said the lawyer guardedly in the line to which your figurative speech seems to refer do you wish to consult me professionally mr the lawyer paused with significance not yet said the other with an arch wave of his cigar not just yet let us approach the subject with the caution that should have been used in the original act that makes this pow wow necessary there exists a matrimonial jumble to be straightened out but before i give you names i want your honest well anyhow your professional opinion on the merits of the mix up i want you to size up the catastrophe abstractly you understand i m mr nobody and i ve got a story to tell you then you say what s what do you get my wireless you want to state a hypothetical case suggested lawyer gooch that s the word i was after apothecary was the best shot i could make at it in my mind the hypo thetical goes i ll state the case suppose there s a woman a deuced fine looking woman who has run away from her husband and home she s badly mashed on another man who went to her town to work up some real estate business now we may as well call this woman s husband thomas r billings for that s his name i m giving you straight tips on the cognomens the lothario chap is henry k jessup the billingses lived in a little town called susanville a good many miles from here now jessup leaves susanville two weeks ago the next day mrs billings follows him she s dead gone on this man jessup you can bet your law library on that lawyer gooch s client said this with such unctuous satisfaction that even the callous lawyer experienced a slight ripple of repulsion he now saw clearly in his fatuous visitor the conceit of the lady killer the egoistic complacency of the successful trifler now continued the visitor suppose this mrs billings wasn t happy at home we ll say she and her husband didn t gee worth a cent they ve got incom patibility to burn the things she likes billings wouldn t have as a gift with trading stamps it s tabby and rover with them all the time she s an educated woman in science and culture and she reads things out loud at meetings billings is not on he don t appreciate pro gress and obelisks and ethics and things of that sort old billings is simply a blink when it comes to such things the lady is out and out above his class now lawyer don t it look like a fair equalization of rights and wrongs that a woman like that should be allowed to throw down billings and take the man that can appreciate her incompatibility said lawyer gooch is undoubt edly the source of much marital discord and unhappiness where it is positively proved divorce would seem to be the equitable remedy are you excuse me is this man jessup one to whom the lady may safely trust her future oh you can bet on jessup said the client with a confident wag of his head jessup s all right he ll do the square thing why he left susanville just to keep pwple from talking about mrs billings but she fol lowed him up and now of course he ll stick to her when she gets a divorce all legal and proper jessup the proper thing and now said lawyer gooch continuing the hypo if you prefer and supposing that my services should ired in the case what the client rose impulsively to his feet oh dang the hypothetical business he exclaimed impatiently let s let her drop and get down to straight talk you ought to know who i am by this time i want that woman to have her divorce i ll pay for it the day you set mrs billings free i ll pay you five hundred dollars lawyer gooch s client banged his fist upon the table to punctuate his generosity if that is the case began the lawyer lady to see you sir bawled archibald bouncing in from his anteroom he had orders to always announce immediately any client that might come there was no sense in

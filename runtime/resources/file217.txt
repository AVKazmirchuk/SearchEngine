a taunt that you will regret when you cool off i have yet says i to shake hands with a subpoena server one summer me and andy decided to rest up a spell in a fine little town in the mountains of kentucky called grassdale we was supposed to be horse drovers and good decent citizens besides taking a summer vacation the grassdale people liked us and me and andy declared a cessation of hostilities never so much as floating the fly leaf of a rubber concession prospectus or flashing a brazilian diamond while we was there one day the leading hardware merchant of grassdale drops around to the hotel where me and andy stopped and smokes with us sociable on the side porch we knew him pretty well from pitching quoits in the afternoons in the court house yard he was a loud red man breathing hard but fat and respectable beyond all reason after we talk on all the notorious themes of the day this murkison for such was his entitlements takes a letter out of his coat pocket in a careful careless way and hands it to us to read now what do you think of that says he laughing a letter like that to me me and andy sees at a glance what it is but we pretend to read it through it was one of them old time typewritten green goods letters explaining how for you could get in bills that an expert couldn t tell from the genuine and going on to tell how they were made from plates stolen by an employee of the treasury at washington think of em sending a letter like that to me says murkison again lot s of good men get em says andy if you don t answer the first letter they let you drop if you answer it they write again asking you to come on with your money and do business but think of em writing to me says murkison a few days later he drops around again boys says he i know you are all right or i wouldn t confide in you i wrote to them rascals again just for fun they answered and told me to come on to chicago they said telegraph to j smith when i would start when i get there i m to wait on a certain street corner till a man in a gray suit comes along and drops a newspaper in front of me then i am to ask him how the water is and he knows it s me and i know it s him ah yes says andy gaping it s the same old game i ve often read about it in the papers then he conducts you to the private abattoir in the hotel where mr jones is already waiting they show you brand new real money and sell you all you want at five for one you see em put it in a satchel for you and know it s there of course it s brown paper when you come to look at it afterward oh they couldn t switch it on me says murkison i haven t built up the best paying business in grassdale without having witticisms about me you say it s real money they show you mr tucker i ve always i see by the papers that it always is says andy boys says murkison i ve got it in my mind that them fellows can t fool me i think i ll put a couple of thousand in my jeans and go up there and put it all over em if bill murkison gets his eyes once on them bills they show him he ll never take em off of em they offer for and they ll have to stick to the bargain if i tackle em that s the kind of trader bill murkison is yes i jist believe i ll drop up chicago way and take a to shot on j smith i guess the water ll be fine enough me and andy tries to get this financial misquotation out of murkison s head but we might as well have tried to keep the man who rolls peanuts with a toothpick from betting on bryan s election no sir he was going to perform a public duty by catching these green goods swindlers at their own game maybe it would teach em a lesson after murkison left us me and andy sat a while prepondering over our silent meditations and heresies of reason in our idle hours we always improved our higher selves by ratiocination and mental thought jeff says andy after a long time quite unseldom i have seen fit to impugn your molars when you have been chewing the rag with me about your conscientious way of doing business i may have been often wrong but here is a case where i think we can agree i feel that it would be wrong for us to allow mr murkison to go alone to meet those chicago green goods men there is but one way it can end don t you think we would both feel better if we was to intervene in some way and prevent the doing of this deed i got up and shook andy tucker s hand hard and long andy says i i may have had one or two hard thoughts about the heartlessness of your corporation but i retract em now you have a kind nucleus at the interior of your exterior after all it does you credit i was just thinking the same thing that you have expressed it would not be honorable or praiseworthy says i for us to let murkison go on with this project he has taken up if he is determined to go let us go with him and prevent this swindle from coming off andy agreed with me and i was glad

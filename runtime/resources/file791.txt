simply indecent terrifying humiliating screams such as women emit when they see ghosts or caterpillars it s an awful thing to hear a strong desperate fat man scream incontinently in a cave at daybreak i jumped up to see what the matter was red chief was sitting on bill s chest with one hand twined in bill s hair in the other he had the sharp case knife we used for slicing bacon and he was industriously and realistically trying to take bill s scalp according to the sentence that had been pronounced upon him the evening before i got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again but from that moment bill s spirit was broken he laid down on his side of the bed but he never closed an eye again in sleep as long as that boy was with us i dozed off for a while but along toward sun up i remem bered that red chief had said i was to be burned at the stake at the rising of the sun i wasn t nervous or afraid but i sat up and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock what you getting up so soon for sam asked bill me says i oh i got a kind of a pain in my shoulder i thought sitting up would rest it you re a liar says bill you re afraid you was to be burned at sunrise and you was afraid he d do it and he would too if he could find a match ain t it awful sam do you think anybody will pay out money to get a little imp like that back home sure said i a rowdy kid like that is just the kind that parents dote on now you and the chief get up and cook breakfast while i go up on the top of this mountain and reconnoitre i went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the contiguous vicinity over toward summit i expected to see the sturdy yeomanry of the village armed with scythes and pitchforks beating the countryside for the dastardly kidnappers but what i saw was a peaceful landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule nobody was dragging the creek no couriers dashed hither and yon bringing tidings of no news to the distracted parents there was a sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness pervading that section of the external outward surface of alabama that lay exposed to my view perhaps says i to myself it has not yet been discov ered that the wolves have home away the tender lambkin from the fold heaven help the wolves says i and i went down the mountain to breakfast when i got to the cave i found bill backed up against the side of it breathing hard and the boy threatening to smash him with a rock half as big as a cocoanut he put a red hot boiled potato down my back explained bill and the mashed it with his foot and i boxed his ears have you got a gun about you sam i took the rock away from the boy and kind of patched up the argument i ll fix you says the kid to bill no man ever yet struck the red chief but what he got paid for it you better beware after breakfast the kid takes a piece of leather with strings wrapped around it out of his pocket and goes out side the cave unwinding it what s he up to now says bill anxiously you don t think he ll run away do you sam no fear of it says i he don t seem to be much of a home body but we ve got to fix up some plan about the ransom there don t seem to be much excitement around summit on account of his disappearance but maybe they haven t realized yet that he s gone his folks may think he s spending the night with aunt jane or one of the neighbours anyhow he ll be missed to day to night we must get a message to his father demanding the two thousand dollars for his return just then we heard a kind of war whoop such as david might have emitted when he knocked out the champion goliath it was a sling that red chief had pulled out of his pocket and he was whirling it around his head i dodged and heard a heavy thud and a kind of a sigh from bill like a horse gives out when you take his saddle off a niggerhead rock the size of an egg had caught bill just behind his left ear he loosened himself all over and fell in the fire across the frying pan of hot water for washing the dishes i dragged him out and poured cold water on his head for half an hour by and by bill sits up and feels behind his ear and says sam do you know who my favourite biblical character is take it easy says i you ll come to your senses presently king herod says he you won t go away and leave me here alone will you sam i went out and caught that boy and shook him until his freckles rattled if you don t behave says i i ll take you straight home now are you going to be good or not i was only funning says he sullenly i didn t mean to hurt old hank but what did he hit me for i ll behave snake eye if you won t send me home and if you ll let me play the black scout to day i don t know the game says i that s for you and mr bill to decide he s your playmate for the day i m going away

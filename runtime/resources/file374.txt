hour of ten while tansey was playing billiards with a number of his friends on alternate evenings he was released from duty at the store after seven o clock even among his fellow men tansey was timorous and constrained in his imagination he had done valiant deeds and performed acts of distinguished gallantry but in fact he was a sallow youth of twenty three with an over modest demeanour and scant vocabulary when the clock struck ten tansey hastily laid down his cue and struck sharply upon the show case with a coin for the attendant to come and receive the pay for his score what s your hurry tansey called one got another engagement tansey got an engagement echoed another not on your life tansey s got to get home at motten by her peek s orders it s no such thing chimed in a pale youth taking a large cigar from his mouth tansey s afraid to be late because miss katie might come down stairs to unlock the door and kiss him in the hall this last delicate piece of raillery sent a fiery tingle into tansey s blood for the indictment was true barring the kiss that was a thing to dream of to wildly hope for but too remote and sacred a thing to think of lightly casting a cold and contemptuous look at the speaker a punishment commensurate with his own diffident spirit tansey left the room descending the stairs into the street for two years he had silently adored miss peek worshipping her from a spiritual distance through which her attractions took on stellar brightness and mystery mrs peek kept a few choice boarders among whom was tansey the other young men romped with katie chased her with crickets in their fingers and jollied her with an irreverent freedom that turned tansey s heart into cold lead in his bosom the signs of his adoration were few a tremulous good morning stealthy glances at her during meals and occasionally oh rapture a blushing delirious game of cribbage with her in the parlour on some rare evening when a miraculous lack of engagement kept her at home kiss him in the hall aye he feared it but it was an ecstatic fear such as elijah must have felt when the chariot lifted him into the unknown but to night the gibes of his associates had stung him to a feeling of forward lawless mutiny a defiant challenging atavistic recklessness spirit of corsair adventurer lover poet bohemian possessed him the stars he saw above him seemed no more unattainable no less high than the favour of miss peek or the fearsome sweetness of her delectable lips his fate seemed to him strangely dramatic and pathetic and to call for a solace consonant with its extremity a saloon was near by and to this he flitted calling for absinthe beyond doubt the drink most adequate to his mood the tipple of the roue the abandoned the vainly sighing lover once he drank of it and again and then again until he felt a strange exalted sense of non participation in worldly affairs pervade him tansey was no drinker his consumption of three absinthe anisettes within almost as few minutes proclaimed his unproficiency in the art tansey was merely flooding with unproven liquor his sorrows which record and tradition alleged to be drownable coming out upon the sidewalk he snapped his fingers defiantly in the direction of the peek homestead turned the other way and voyaged columbus like into the wilds of an enchanted street nor is the figure exorbitant for beyond his store the foot of tansey had scarcely been set for years store and boarding house between these ports he was charted to run and contrary currents had rarely deflected his prow tansey aimlessly protracted his walk and whether it was his unfamiliarity with the district his recent accession of audacious errantry or the sophistical whisper of a certain green eyed fairy he came at last to tread a shuttered blank and echoing thoroughfare dark and unpeopled and suddenly this way came to an end as many streets do in the spanish built archaic town of san antone butting its head against an imminent high brick wall no the street still lived to the right and to the left it breathed through slender tubes of exit narrow somnolent ravines cobble paved and unlighted accommodating a rise in the street to the right was reared a phantom flight of five luminous steps of limestone flanked by a wall of the same height and of the same material upon one of these steps tansey seated himself and bethought him of his love and how she might never know she was his love and of mother peek fat vigilant and kind not unpleased tansey thought that he and katie should play cribbage in the parlour together for the cut rate had not cut his salary which sordidly speaking ranked him star boarder at the peek s and he thought of captain peek katie s father a man he dreaded and abhorred a genteel loafer and spendthrift battening upon the labour of his women folk a very queer fish and according to repute not of the freshest the night had turned chill and foggy the heart of the town with its noises was left behind reflected from the high vapours its distant lights were manifest in quivering cone shaped streamers in questionable blushes of unnamed colours in unstable ghostly waves of far electric flashes now that the darkness was become more friendly the wall against which the street splintered developed a stone coping topped with an armature of spikes beyond it loomed what appeared to be the acute angles of mountain peaks pierced here and there by little lambent parallelograms considering this vista tansey at length persuaded himself that the seeming mountains were in fact the convent of santa mercedes with which ancient and bulky pile he was better

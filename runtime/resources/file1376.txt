bamboo furniture to misfurnish half a dozen seaside cottages in the first place says the man you want to know who i am i m sole lessee and proprietor of this tribe of indians they call me the grand yacuma which is to say king or main finger of the bunch i ve got more power here than a charge d affaires a charge of dynamite and a charge account at tiffany s combined in fact i m the big stick with as many extra knots on it as there is on the record run of the lusitania oh i read the papers now and then says he now let s hear your entitlements he goes on and the meeting will be open well says i i am known as one w d finch occupation capitalist address east thirty second new york chips in the noble grand i know says he grinning it ain t the first time you ve seen it go down on the blotter i can tell by the way you hand it out well explain capitalist i tells this boss plain what i come for and how i come to came gold dust says he looking as puzzled as a baby that s got a feather stuck on its molasses finger that s funny this ain t a gold mining country and you invested all your capital on a stranger s story well well these indians of mine they are the last of the tribe of peehes are simple as children they know nothing of the purchasing power of gold i m afraid you ve been imposed on says he maybe so says i but it sounded pretty straight to me w d says the king all of a sudden i ll give you a square deal it ain t often i get to talk to a white man and i ll give you a show for your money it may be these constituents of mine have a few grains of gold dust hid away in their clothes to morrow you may get out these goods you ve brought up and see if you can make any sales now i m going to introduce myself unofficially my name is shane patrick shane i own this tribe of peche indians by right of conquest single handed and unafraid i drifted up here four years ago and won em by my size and complexion and nerve i learned their language in six weeks it s easy you simply emit a string of consonants as long as your breath holds out and then point at what you re asking for i conquered em spectacularly goes on king shane and then i went at em with economical politics law sleight of hand and a kind of new england ethics and parsimony every sunday or as near as i can guess at it i preach to em in the council house i m the council on the law of supply and demand i praise supply and knock demand i use the same text every time you wouldn t think w d says shane that i had poetry in me would you well says i i wouldn t know whether to call it poetry or not tennyson says shane furnishes the poetic gospel i preach i always considered him the boss poet here s the way the text goes for not to admire if a man could learn it were more than to walk all day like a sultan of old in a garden of spice you see i teach em to cut out demand that supply is the main thing i teach em not to desire anything beyond their simplest needs a little mutton a little cocoa and a little fruit brought up from the coast that s all they want to make cm happy i ve got em well trained they make their own clothes and hats out of a vegetable fibre and straw and they re a contented lot it s a great thing winds up shane to have made a people happy by the incultivation of such simple institutions well the next day with the king s permission i has the mcclintock open up a couple of sacks of my goods in the little plaza of the village the indians swarmed around by the hundred and looked the bargain counter over i shook red blankets at em flashed finger rings and ear bobs tried pearl necklaces and sidecombs on the women and a line of red hosiery on the men twas no use they looked on like hungry graven images but i never made a sale i asked mcclintock what was the trouble mac yawned three or four times rolled a cigarette made one or two confidential side remarks to a mule and then condescended to inform me that the people had no money just then up strolls king patrick big and red and royal as usual with the gold chain over his chest and his cigar in front of him how s business w d he asks fine says i it s a bargain day rush i ve got one more line of goods to offer before i shut up shop i ll try em with safety razors i ve got two gross that i bought at a fire sale shane laughs till some kind of mameluke or private secretary he carries with him has to hold him up my sainted aunt jerusha says he ain t you one of the babes in the goods w d don t you know that no indians ever shave they pull out their whiskers instead well says i that s just what these razors would do for em they wouldn t have any kick coming if they used em once shane went away and i could hear him laughing a block if there had been any block tell em says i to mcclintock it ain t money i want tell em i ll take gold dust tell em i ll allow em sixteen dollars an ounce for it in trade that s what i m out for the dust mac interprets and you d have thought a squadron of cops had charged the crowd to disperse it every uncle s nephew and aunt s niece of em faded away inside of two minutes at the royal palace that night me and the king talked it over they ve got the dust hid out somewhere says i or they wouldn t have been so sensitive about it they haven t says shane what s this gag you ve got about gold you been reading edward allen poe they ain t got any gold they put it in quills says i and then they empty it in jars and then into sacks of twenty five pounds each i got it straight w d says shane laughing and chewing his cigar i don t often see a white man and i feel like putting you on i don t think you ll get away from here alive anyhow so i m going to tell you come over here he draws aside a silk fibre curtain in a corner of the room and shows me a pile of buckskin sacks forty of em says shane one arroba in each one in round numbers worth of gold dust you see there it s all mine it belongs to the grand yacuma they bring it all to me two hundred and twenty thousand dollars think of that you glass bead peddler says shane and all mine little good it does you says i contemptuously and hatefully and so you are the government depository of this gang of money less money makers don t you pay enough interest on it to enable one of your depositors to buy an augusta maine pullman carbon diamond worth for listen says patrick shane with the sweat coming out on his brow i m confidant with you as you have somehow enlisted my regards did you ever he says feel the avoirdupois power of gold not the troy weight of it but the sixteen ounces to the pound force of it never says i i never take in any bad money shane drops down on the floor and throws his arms over the sacks of gold dust i love it says he i want to feel the touch of it day and night it s my pleasure in life i come in this room and i m a king and a rich man i ll be a millionaire in another year the pile s getting bigger every month i ve got the whole tribe washing out the sands in the creeks i m the happiest man in the world w d i just want to be near this gold and know it s mine and it s increasing every day now you know says he why my indians wouldn t buy your goods they can t they bring all the dust to me i m their king i ve taught em not to desire or admire you might as well shut up shop i ll tell you what you are says i you re a plain contemptible miser you preach supply and you forget demand now supply i goes on is never anything but supply on the contrary says i demand is a much broader syllogism and assertion demand includes the rights of our women and children and charity and friendship and even a little begging on the street corners they ve both got to harmonize equally and i ve got a few things up my commercial sleeve yet says i that may jostle your preconceived ideas of politics and economy the next morning i had mcclintock bring tip another mule load of goods to the plaza and open it up the people gathered around the same as before i got out the finest line of necklaces bracelets hair combs and earrings that i carried and had the women put em on and then i played trumps out of my last pack i opened up a half gross of hand mirrors with solid tinfoil backs and passed em around among the ladies that was the first introduction of looking glasses among the peche indians shane walks by with his big laugh business looking up any he asks it s looking at itself right now says i by and by a kind of a murmur goes through the crowd the women had looked into the magic crystal and seen that they were beautiful and was confiding the secret to the men the men seemed to be urging the lack of money and the hard times just before the election but their excuses didn t go then was my time i called mcclintock away from an animated conversation with his mules and told him to do some interpreting tell em says i that gold dust will buy for them these befitting ornaments for kings and queens of the earth tell em the yellow sand they wash out of the waters for the high sanctified yacomay and chop suey of the tribe will buy the precious jewels and charms that will make them beautiful and preserve and pickle them from evil spirits tell em the pittsburg banks are paying four per cent interest on deposits by mail while this get rich frequently custodian of the public funds ain t even paying attention keep telling em mac says i to let the gold dust family do their work talk to em like a born anti bryanite says i remind em that tom watson s gone back to georgia says i mcclintock waves his hand affectionately at one of his mules and then hurls a few stickfuls of minion type at the mob of shoppers a gutta percha indian man with a lady hanging on his arm with three strings of my fish scale jewelry and imitation marble beads around her neck stands up on a block of stone and makes a talk that sounds like a man shaking dice in a box to fill aces and sixes he says says mcclintock that the people not know that gold dust will buy their things the women very mad the grand yacuma tell them it no good but for keep to make bad spirits keep away you can t keep bad spirits away from money says i they say goes on mcclintock the yacuma fool them they raise plenty row going going says i gold dust or cash takes the entire stock the dust weighed before you and taken at sixteen dollars the ounce the highest price on the gaudymala coast then the crowd disperses all of a sudden and i don t know what s up mac and me packs away the hand mirrors and jewelry they had handed back to us and we had the mules back to the corral they had set apart for our garage while we was there we hear great noises of shouting and down across the plaza runs patrick shane hotfoot with his clothes ripped half off and scratches on his face like a cat had fought him hard for every one of its lives they re looting the treasury w d he sings out they re going to kill me and you too unlimber a couple of mules at once we ll have to make a get away in a couple of minutes they ve found out says i the truth about the law of supply and demand it s the women mostly says the king and they used to admire me so they hadn t seen looking glasses then says i they ve got knives and hatchets says shane hurry take that roan mule says i you and your law of supply i ll ride the dun for he s two knots per hour the faster the roan has a stiff knee but he may make it says i if you d included reciprocity in your political platform i might have given you the dun says i shane and mcclintock and me mounted our mules and rode across the rawhide bridge just as the peches reached the other side and began firing stones and long knives at us we cut the thongs that held up our end of the bridge and headed for the coast a tall bulky policeman came into finch s shop at that moment and leaned an elbow on the showcase finch nodded at him friendly i heard down at casey s said the cop in rumbling husky tones that there was going to be a picnic of the hat cleaners union over at bergen beach sunday is that right sure said finch there ll be a dandy time gimme five tickets said the cop throwing a five dollar bill on the showcase why said finch ain t you going it a little too go to h said the cop you got em to sell ain t you somebody s got to buy em wish i could go along i was glad to see finch so well thought of in his neighborhood and then in came a wee girl of seven with dirty face and pure blue eyes and a smutched and insufficient dress mamma says she recited shrilly that you must give me eighty cents for the grocer and nineteen for the milkman and five cents for me to buy hokey pokey with but she didn t say that the elf concluded with a hopeful but honest grin finch shelled out the money counting it twice but i noticed that the total sum that the small girl received was one dollar and four cents that s the right kind of a law remarked finch as he carefully broke some of the stitches of my hatband so that it would assuredly come off within a few days the law of supply and demand but they ve both got to work together i ll bet he went on with his dry smile she ll get jelly beans with that nickel she likes em what s supply if there s no demand for it what ever became of the king i asked curiously oh i might have told you said finch that was shane came in and bought the tickets he came back with me and he s on the force now buried treasure there are many kinds of fools now will everybody please sit still until they are called upon specifically to rise i had been every kind of fool except one i had expended my patrimony pretended my matrimony played poker lawn tennis and bucket shops parted soon with my money in many ways but there remained one rule of the wearer of cap and bells that i had not played that was the seeker after buried treasure to few does the delectable furor come but of all the would be followers in the hoof prints of king midas none has found a pursuit so rich in pleasurable promise but going back from my theme a while as lame pens must do i was a fool of the sentimental soft i saw may martha mangum and was hers she was eighteen the color of the white ivory keys of a new piano beautiful and possessed by the exquisite solemnity and pathetic witchery of an unsophisticated angel doomed to live in a small dull texas prairie town she had a spirit and charm that could have enabled her to pluck rubies like raspberries from the crown of belgium or any other sporty kingdom but she did not know it and i did not paint the picture for her you see i wanted may martha mangum for to have and to hold i wanted her to abide with me and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings may martha s father was a man hidden behind whiskers and spectacles he lived for bugs and butterflies and all insects that fly or crawl or buzz or get down your back or in the butter he was an etymologist or words to that effect he spent his life seining the air for flying fish of the june bug order and then sticking pins through em and calling em names he and may martha were the whole family he prized her highly as a fine specimen of the racibus humanus because she saw that he had food at times and put his clothes on right side before and kept his alcohol bottles filled scientists they say are apt to be absent minded there was another besides myself who thought may martha mangum one to be desired that was goodloe banks a young man just home from college he had all the attainments to be found in books latin greek philosophy and especially the higher branches of mathematics and logic if it hadn t been for his habit of pouring out this information and learning on every one that he addressed i d have liked him pretty well but even as it was he and i were you would have thought great pals we got together every time we could because each of us wanted to pump the other for whatever straws we could to find which way the wind blew from the heart of may martha mangum rather a mixed metaphor goodloe banks would never have been guilty of that that is the way of rivals you might say that goodloe ran to books manners culture rowing intellect and clothes i would have put you in mind more of baseball and friday night debating societies by way of culture and maybe of a good horseback rider but in our talks together and in our visits and conversation with may martha neither goodloe banks nor i could find out which one of us she preferred may martha was a natural born non committal and knew in her cradle how to keep people guessing as i said old man mangum was absentminded after a long time he found out one day a little butterfly must have told him that two young men were trying to throw a net over the head of the young person a daughter or some such technical appendage who looked after his comforts i never knew scientists could rise to such occasions old mangum orally labelled and classified goodloe and myself easily among the lowest orders of the vertebrates and in english too without going any further into latin than the simple references to orgetorix rex helvetii which is as far as i ever went myself and he told us that if he ever caught us around his house again he would add us to his collection goodloe banks and i remained away five days expecting the storm to subside when we dared to call at the house again may martha mangum and her father were gone gone the house they had rented was closed their little store of goods and chattels was gone also and not a word of farewell to either of us from may martha not a white fluttering note pinned to the hawthorn bush not a chalk mark on the gate post nor a post card in the post office to give us a clew for two months goodloe banks and i separately tried every scheme we could think of to track the runaways we used our friendship and influence with the ticket agent with livery stable men railroad conductors and our one lone lorn constable but without results then we became better friends and worse enemies than ever we forgathered in the back room of snyder s saloon every afternoon after work and played dominoes and laid conversational traps to find out from each other if anything had been discovered that is the way of rivals now goodloe banks had a sarcastic way of displaying his own learning and putting me in the class that was reading poor jane ray her bird is dead she cannot play well i rather liked goodloe and i had a contempt for his college learning and i was always regarded as good natured so i kept my temper and i was trying to find out if he knew anything about may martha so i endured his society in talking things over one afternoon he said to me suppose you do find her ed whereby would you profit miss mangum has a mind perhaps it is yet uncultured but she is destined for higher things than you could give her i have talked with no one who seemed to appreciate more the enchantment of the ancient poets and writers and the modern cults that have assimilated and expended their philosophy of life don t you think you are wasting your time looking for her my idea said i of a happy home is an eight room house in a grove of live oaks by the side of a charco on a texas prairie a piano i went on with an automatic player in the sitting room three thousand head of cattle under fence for a starter a buckboard and ponies always hitched at a post for the missus and may martha mangum to spend the profits of the ranch as she pleases and to abide with me and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings that said i is what is to be and a fig a dried smyrna dago stand fig for your curriculums cults and philosophy she is meant for higher things repeated goodloe banks whatever she is meant for i answered just now she is out of pocket and i shall find her as soon as i can without aid of the colleges the game is blocked said goodloe putting down a domino and we had the beer shortly after that a young farmer whom i knew came into town and brought me a folded blue paper he said his grandfather had just died i concealed a tear and he went on to say that the old man had jealously guarded this paper for twenty years he left it to his family as part of his estate the rest of which consisted of two mules and a hypotenuse of non arable land the sheet of paper was of the old blue kind used during the rebellion of the abolitionists against the secessionists it was dated june and it described the hiding place of ten burro loads of gold and silver coin valued at three hundred thousand dollars old rundle grandfather of his grandson sam was given the information by a spanish priest who was in on the treasure burying and who died many years before no afterward in old rundle s house old rundle wrote it down from dictation why didn t your father look this up i asked young rundle he went blind before he could do so he replied why didn t you hunt for it yourself i asked well said he i ve only known about the paper for ten years first there was the spring ploughin to do and then choppin the weeds out of the corn and then come takin fodder and mighty soon winter was on us it seemed to run along that way year after year that sounded perfectly reasonable to me so i took it up with young lee rundle at once the directions on the paper were simple the whole burro cavalcade laden with the treasure started from an old spanish mission in dolores county they travelled due south by the compass until they reached the alamito river they forded this and buried the treasure on the top of a little mountain shaped like a pack saddle standing in a row between two higher ones a heap of stones marked the place of the buried treasure all the party except the spanish priest were killed by indians a few days later the secret was a monopoly it looked good to me lee rundle suggested that we rig out a camping outfit hire a surveyor to run out the line from the spanish mission and then spend the three hundred thousand dollars seeing the sights in fort worth but without being highly educated i knew a way to save time and expense we went to the state land office and had a practical what they call a working sketch made of all the surveys of land from the old mission to the alamito river on this map i drew a line due southward to the river the length of lines of each survey and section of land was accurately given on the sketch by these we found the point on the river and had a connection made with it and an important well identified corner of the los animos five league survey a grant made by king philip of spain by doing this we did not need to have the line run out by a surveyor it was a great saving of expense and time so lee rundle and i fitted out a two horse wagon team with all the accessories and drove a hundred and forty nine miles to chico the nearest town to the point we wished to reach there we picked up a deputy county surveyor he found the corner of the los animos survey for us ran out the five thousand seven hundred and twenty varas west that our sketch called for laid a stone on the spot had coffee and bacon and caught the mail stage back to chico i was pretty sure we would get that three hundred thousand dollars lee rundle s was to be only one third because i was paying all the expenses with that two hundred thousand dollars i knew i could find may martha mangum if she was on earth and with it i could flutter the butterflies in old man mangum s dove cot too if i could find that treasure but lee and i established camp across the river were a dozen little mountains densely covered by cedar brakes but not one shaped like a pack saddle that did not deter us appearances are deceptive a pack saddle like beauty may exist only in the eye of the beholder i and the grandson of the treasure examined those cedar covered hills with the care of a lady hunting for the wicked flea we explored every side top circumference mean elevation angle slope and concavity of every one for two miles up and down the river we spent four days doing so then we hitched up the roan and the dun and hauled the remains of the coffee and bacon the one hundred and forty nine miles back to concho city lee rundle chewed much tobacco on the return trip i was busy driving because i was in a hurry as shortly as could be after our empty return goodloe banks and i forgathered in the back room of snyder s saloon to play dominoes and fish for information i told goodloe about my expedition after the buried treasure if i could have found that three hundred thousand dollars i said to him i could have scoured and sifted the surface of the earth to find may martha mangum she is meant for higher things said goodloe i shall find her myself but tell me how you went about discovering the spot where this unearthed increment was imprudently buried i told him in the smallest detail i showed him the draughtsman s sketch with the distances marked plainly upon it after glancing over it in a masterly way he leaned back in his chair and bestowed upon me an explosion of sardonic superior collegiate laughter well you are a fool jim he said when he could speak it s your play said i patiently fingering my double six twenty said goodloe making two crosses on the table with his chalk why am i a fool i asked buried treasure has been found before in many places because said he in calculating the point on the river where your line would strike you neglected to allow for the variation the variation there would be nine degrees west let me have your pencil goodloe banks figured rapidly on the back of an envelope the distance from north to south of the line run from the spanish mission said he is exactly twenty two miles it was run by a pocket compass according to your story allowing for the variation the point on the alamito river where you should have searched for your treasure is exactly six miles and nine hundred and forty five varas farther west than the place you hit upon oh what a fool you are jim what is this variation that you speak of i asked i thought figures never lied the variation of the magnetic compass said goodloe from the true meridian he smiled in his superior way and then i saw come out in his face the singular eager consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried treasure sometimes he said with the air of the oracle these old traditions of hidden money are not without foundation suppose you let me look over that paper describing the location perhaps together we might the result was that goodloe banks and i rivals in love became companions in adventure we went to chico by stage from huntersburg the nearest railroad town in chico we hired a team drawing a covered spring wagon and camping paraphernalia we had the same surveyor run out our distance as revised by goodloe and his variations and then dismissed him and sent him on his homeward road it was night when we arrived i fed the horses and made a fire near the bank of the river and cooked supper goodloe would have helped but his education had not fitted him for practical things but while i worked he cheered me with the expression of great thoughts handed down from the dead ones of old he quoted some translations from the greek at much length anacreon he explained that was a favorite passage with miss mangum as i recited it she is meant for higher things said i repeating his phrase can there be anything higher asked goodloe than to dwell in the society of the classics to live in the atmosphere of learning and culture you have often decried education what of your wasted efforts through your ignorance of simple mathematics how soon would you have found your treasure if my knowledge had not shown you your error we ll take a look at those hills across the river first said i and see what we find i am still doubtful about variations i have been brought up to believe that the needle is true to the pole the next morning was a bright june one we were up early and had breakfast goodloe was charmed he recited keats i think it was and kelly or shelley while i broiled the bacon we were getting ready to cross the river which was little more than a shallow creek there and explore the many sharp peaked cedar covered hills on the other side my good ulysses said goodloe slapping me on the shoulder while i was washing the tin breakfast plates let me see the enchanted document once more i believe it gives directions for climbing the hill shaped like a pack saddle i never saw a pack saddle what is it like jim score one against culture said i i ll know it when i see it goodloe was looking at old rundle s document when he ripped out a most uncollegiate swear word come here he said holding the paper up against the sunlight look at that he said laying his finger against it on the blue paper a thing i had never noticed before i saw stand out in white letters the word and figures malvern what about it i asked it s the water mark said goodloe the paper was manufactured in the writing on the paper is dated this is a palpable fraud oh i don t know said i the rundles are pretty reliable plain uneducated country people maybe the paper manufacturers tried to perpetrate a swindle and then goodloe banks went as wild as his education permitted he dropped the glasses off his nose and glared at me i ve often told you you were a fool he said you have let yourself be imposed upon by a clodhopper and you have imposed upon me how i asked have i imposed upon you by your ignorance said he twice i have discovered serious flaws in your plans that a common school education should have enabled you to avoid and he continued i have been put to expense that i could ill afford in pursuing this swindling quest i am done with it i rose and pointed a large pewter spoon at him fresh from the dish water goodloe banks i said i care not one parboiled navy bean for your education i always barely tolerated it in any one and i despised it in you what has your learning done for you it is a curse to yourself and a bore to your friends away i said away with your water marks and variations they are nothing to me they shall not deflect me from the quest i pointed with my spoon across the river to a small mountain shaped like a pack saddle i am going to search that mountain i went on for the treasure decide now whether you are in it or not if you wish to let a water mark or a variation shake your soul you are no true adventurer decide a white cloud of dust began to rise far down the river road it was the mail wagon from hesperus to chico goodloe flagged it i am done with the swindle said he sourly no one but a fool would pay any attention to that paper now well you always were a fool jim i leave you to your fate he gathered his personal traps climbed into the mail wagon adjusted his glasses nervously and flew away in a cloud of dust after i had washed the dishes and staked the horses on new grass i crossed the shallow river and made my way slowly through the cedar brakes up to the top of the hill shaped like a pack saddle it was a wonderful june day never in my life had i seen so many birds so many butter flies dragon flies grasshoppers and such winged and stinged beasts of the air and fields i investigated the hill shaped like a pack saddle from base to summit i found an absolute absence of signs relating to buried treasure there was no pile of stones no ancient blazes on the trees none of the evidences of the three hundred thousand dollars as set forth in the document of old man rundle i came down the hill in the cool of the afternoon suddenly out of the cedar brake i stepped into a beautiful green valley where a tributary small stream ran into the alamito river and there i was started to see what i took to be a wild man with unkempt beard and ragged hair pursuing a giant butterfly with brilliant wings perhaps he is an escaped madman i thought and wondered how he had strayed so far from seats of education and learning and then i took a few more steps and saw a vine covered cottage near the small stream and in a little grassy glade i saw may martha mangum plucking wild flowers she straightened up and looked at me for the first time since i knew her i saw her face which was the color of the white keys of a new piano turn pink i walked toward her without a word she let the gathered flowers trickle slowly from her hand to the grass i knew you would come jim she said clearly father wouldn t let me write but i knew you would come what followed you may guess there was my wagon and team just across the river i ve often wondered what good too much education is to a man if he can t use it for himself if all the benefits of it are to go to others where does it come in for may martha mangum abides with me there is an eight room house in a live oak grove and a piano with an automatic player and a good start toward the three thousand head of cattle is under fence and when i ride home at night my pipe and slippers are put away in places where they cannot be found but who cares for that who cares who cares to him who waits the hermit of the hudson was hustling about his cave with unusual animation the cave was on or in the top of a little spur of the catskills that had strayed down to the river s edge and not having a ferry ticket had to stop there the bijou mountains were densely wooded and were infested by ferocious squirrels and woodpeckers that forever menaced the summer transients like a badly sewn strip of white braid a macadamized road ran between the green skirt of the hills and the foamy lace of the river s edge a dim path wound from the comfortable road up a rocky height to the hermit s cave one mile upstream was the viewpoint inn to which summer folk from the city came leaving cool electric fanned apartments that they might be driven about in burning sunshine shrieking in gasoline launches by spindle legged modreds bearing the blankest of shields train your lorgnette upon the hermit and let your eye receive the personal touch that shall endear you to the hero a man of forty judging him fairly with long hair curling at the ends dramatic eyes and a forked brown beard like those that were imposed upon the west some years ago by self appointed divine healers who succeeded the grasshopper crop his outward vesture appeared to be kind of gunny sacking cut and made into a garment that would have made the fortune of a london tailor his long well shaped fingers delicate nose and poise of manner raised him high above the class of hermits who fear water and bury money in oyster cans in their caves in spots indicated by rude crosses chipped in the stone wall above the hermit s home was not altogether a cave the cave was an addition to the hermitage which was a rude hut made of poles daubed with clay and covered with the best quality of rust proof zinc roofing in the house proper there were stone slabs for seats a rustic bookcase made of unplaned poplar planks and a table formed of a wooden slab laid across two upright pieces of granite something between the furniture of a druid temple and that of a broadway beefsteak dungeon hung against the walls were skins of wild animals purchased in the vicinity of eighth street and university place new york the rear of the cabin merged into the cave there the hermit cooked his meals on a rude stone hearth with infinite patience and an old axe he had chopped natural shelves in the rocky walls on them stood his stores of flour bacon lard talcum powder kerosene baking powder soda mint tablets pepper salt and olivo cremo emulsion for chaps and roughness of the hands and face the hermit had hermited there for ten years he was an asset of the viewpoint inn to its guests he was second in interest only to the mysterious echo in the haunted glen and the lover s leap beat him only a few inches flat footed he was known far but not very wide on account of the topography as a scholar of brilliant intellect who had forsworn the world because he had been jilted in a love affair every saturday night the viewpoint inn sent to him surreptitiously a basket of provisions he never left the immediate outskirts of his hermitage guests of the inn who visited him said his store of knowledge wit and scintillating philosophy were simply wonderful you know that summer the viewpoint inn was crowded with guests so on saturday nights there were extra cans of tomatoes and sirloin steak instead of rounds in the hermit s basket now you have the material allegations in the case so make way for romance evidently the hermit expected a visitor he carefully combed his long hair and parted his apostolic beard when the ninety eight cent alarm clock on a stone shelf announced the hour of five he picked up his gunny sacking skirts brushed them carefully gathered an oaken staff and strolled slowly into the thick woods that surrounded the hermitage he had not long to wait up the faint pathway slippery with its carpet of pine needles toiled beatrix youngest and fairest of the famous trenholme sisters she was all in blue from hat to canvas pumps varying in tint from the shade of the tinkle of a bluebell at daybreak on a spring saturday to the deep hue of a monday morning at nine when the washer woman has failed to show up beatrix dug her cerulean parasol deep into the pine needles and sighed the hermit on the q t removed a grass burr from the ankle of one sandalled foot with the big toe of his other one she blued and almost starched and ironed him with her cobalt eyes it must be so nice she said in little tremulous gasps to be a hermit and have ladies climb mountains to talk to you the hermit folded his arms and leaned against a tree beatrix with a sigh settled down upon the mat of pine needles like a bluebird upon her nest the hermit followed suit drawing his feet rather awkwardly under his gunny sacking it must be nice to be a mountain said he with ponderous lightness and have angels in blue climb up you instead of flying over you mamma had neuralgia said beatrix and went to bed or i couldn t have come it s dreadfully hot at that horrid old inn but we hadn t the money to go anywhere else this summer last night said the hermit i climbed to the top of that big rock above us i could see the lights of the inn and hear a strain or two of the music when the wind was right i imagined you moving gracefully in the arms of others to the dreamy music of the waltz amid the fragrance of flowers think how lonely i must have been the youngest handsomest and poorest of the famous trenholme sisters sighed you haven t quite hit it she said plaintively i was moving gracefully at the arms of another mamma had one of her periodical attacks of rheumatism in both elbows and shoulders and i had to rub them for an hour with that horrid old liniment i hope you didn t think that smelled like flowers you know there were some west point boys and a yachtload of young men from the city at last evening s weekly dance i ve known mamma to sit by an open window for three hours with one half of her registering degrees and the other half frostbitten and never sneeze once but just let a bunch of ineligibles come around where i am and she ll begin to swell at the knuckles and shriek with pain and i have to take her to her room and rub her arms to see mamma dressed you d be surprised to know the number of square inches of surface there are to her arms i think it must be delightful to be a hermit that cassock gabardine isn t it that you wear is so becoming do you make it or them of course you must have changes yourself and what a blessed relief it must be to wear sandals instead of shoes think how we must suffer no matter how small i buy my shoes they always pinch my toes oh why can t there be lady hermits too the beautifulest and most adolescent trenholme sister extended two slender blue ankles that ended in two enormous blue silk bows that almost concealed two fairy oxfords also of one of the forty seven shades of blue the hermit as if impelled by a kind of reflex telepathic action drew his bare toes farther beneath his gunny sacking i have heard about the romance of your life said miss trenholme softly they have it printed on the back of the menu card at the inn was she very beautiful and charming on the bills of fare muttered the hermit but what do i care for the world s babble yes she was of the highest and grandest type then he continued then i thought the world could never contain another equal to her so i forsook it and repaired to this mountain fastness to spend the remainder of my life alone to devote and dedicate my remaining years to her memory it s grand said miss trenholme absolutely grand i think a hermit s life is the ideal one no bill collectors calling no dressing for dinner how i d like to be one but there s no such luck for me if i don t marry this season i honestly believe mamma will force me into settlement work or trimming hats it isn t because i m getting old or ugly but we haven t enough money left to butt in at any of the swell places any more and i don t want to marry unless it s somebody i like that s why i d like to be a hermit hermits don t ever marry do they hundreds of em said the hermit when they ve found the right one but they re hermits said the youngest and beautifulest because they ve lost the right one aren t they because they think they have answered the recluse fatuously wisdom comes to one in a mountain cave as well as to one in the world of swells as i believe they are called in the argot when one of the swells brings it to them said miss trenholme and my folks are swells that s the trouble but there are so many swells at the seashore in the summer time that we hardly amount to more than ripples so we ve had to put all our money into river and harbor appropriations we were all girls you know there were four of us i m the only surviving one the others have been married off all to money mamma is so proud of my sisters they send her the loveliest pen wipers and art calendars every christmas i m the only one on the market now i m forbidden to look at any one who hasn t money but began the hermit but oh said the beautifulest of course hermits have great pots of gold and doubloons buried somewhere near three great oak trees they all have i have not said the hermit regretfully i m so sorry said miss trenholme i always thought they had i think i must go now oh beyond question she was the beautifulest fair lady began the hermit i am beatrix trenholme some call me trix she said you must come to the inn to see me i haven t been a stone s throw from my cave in ten years said the hermit you must come to see me there she repeated any evening except thursday the hermit smiled weakly good bye she said gathering the folds of her pale blue skirt i shall expect you but not on thursday evening remember what an interest it would give to the future menu cards of the viewpoint inn to have these printed lines added to them only once during the more than ten years of his lonely existence did the mountain hermit leave his famous cave that was when he was irresistibly drawn to the inn by the fascinations of miss beatrix trenholme youngest and most beautiful of the celebrated trenholme sisters whose brilliant marriage to aye to whom the hermit walked back to the hermitage at the door stood bob binkley his old friend and companion of the days before he had renounced the world bob himself arrayed like the orchids of the greenhouse in the summer man s polychromatic garb bob the millionaire with his fat firm smooth shrewd face his diamond rings sparkling fob chain and pleated bosom he was two years older than the hermit and looked five years younger you re hamp ellison in spite of those whiskers and that going away bathrobe he shouted i read about you on the bill of fare at the inn they ve run your biography in between the cheese and not responsible for coats and umbrellas what d you do it for hamp and ten years too geewhilikins you re just the same said the hermit come in and sit down sit on that limestone rock over there it s softer than the granite i can t understand it old man said binkley i can see how you could give up a woman for ten years but not ten years for a woman of course i know why you did it everybody does edith carr she jilted four or five besides you but you were the only one who took to a hole in the ground the others had recourse to whiskey the klondike politics and that similia similibus cure but say hamp edith carr was just about the finest woman in the world high toned and proud and noble and playing her ideals to win at all kinds of odds she certainly was a crackerjack after i renounced the world said the hermit i never heard of her again she married me said binkley the hermit leaned against the wooden walls of his ante cave and wriggled his toes i know how you feel about it said binkley what else could she do there were her four sisters and her mother and old man carr you remember how he put all the money he had into dirigible balloons well everything was coming down and nothing going up with em as you might say well i know edith as well as you do although i married her i was worth a million then but i ve run it up since to between five and six it wasn t me she wanted as much as well it was about like this she had that bunch on her hands and they had to be taken care of edith married me two months after you did the ground squirrel act i thought she liked me too at the time and now inquired the recluse we re better friends than ever now she got a divorce from me two years ago just incompatibility i didn t put in any defence well well well hamp this is certainly a funny dugout you ve built here but you always were a hero of fiction seems like you d have been the very one to strike edith s fancy maybe you did but it s the bank roll that catches em my boy your caves and whiskers won t do it honestly hamp don t you think you ve been a darned fool the hermit smiled behind his tangled beard he was and always had been so superior to the crude and mercenary binkley that even his vulgarities could not anger him moreover his studies and meditations in his retreat had raised him far above the little vanities of the world his little mountain side had been almost an olympus over the edge of which he saw smiling the bolts hurled in the valleys of man below had his ten years of renunciation of thought of devotion to an ideal of living scorn of a sordid world been in vain up from the world had come to him the youngest and beautifulest fairer than edith one and three seventh times lovelier than the seven years served rachel so the hermit smiled in his beard when binkley had relieved the hermitage from the blot of his presence and the first faint star showed above the pines the hermit got the can of baking powder from his cupboard he still smiled behind his beard there was a slight rustle in the doorway there stood edith carr with all the added beauty and stateliness and noble bearing that ten years had brought her she was never one to chatter she looked at the hermit with her large thinking dark eyes the hermit stood still surprised into a pose as motionless as her own only his subconscious sense of the fitness of things caused him to turn the baking powder can slowly in his hands until its red label was hidden against his bosom i am stopping at the inn said edith in low but clear tones i heard of you there i told myself that i must see you i want to ask your forgiveness i sold my happiness for money there were others to be provided for but that does not excuse me i just wanted to see you and ask your forgiveness you have lived here ten years they tell me cherishing my memory i was blind hampton i could not see then that all the money in the world cannot weigh in the scales against a faithful heart if but it is too late now of course her assertion was a question clothed as best it could be in a loving woman s pride but through the thin disguise the hermit saw easily that his lady had come back to him if he chose he had won a golden crown if it pleased him to take it the reward of his decade of faithfulness was ready for his hand if he desired to stretch it forth for the space of one minute the old enchantment shone upon him with a reflected radiance and then by turns he felt the manly sensations of indignation at having been discarded and of repugnance at having been as it were sought again and last of all how strange that it should have come at last the pale blue vision of the beautifulest of the trenholme sisters illuminated his mind s eye and left him without a waver it is too late he said in deep tones pressing the baking powder can against his heart once she turned after she had gone slowly twenty yards down the path the hermit had begun to twist the lid off his can but he hid it again under his sacking robe he could see her great eyes shining sadly through the twilight but he stood inflexible in the doorway of his shack and made no sign just as the moon rose on thursday evening the hermit was seized by the world madness up from the inn fainter than the horns of elf land came now and then a few bars of music played by the casino band the hudson was broadened by the night into an illimitable sea those lights dimly seen on its opposite shore were not beacons for prosaic trolley lines but low set stars millions of miles away the waters in front of the inn were gay with fireflies or were they motor boats smelling of gasoline and oil once the hermit had known these things and had sported with amaryllis in the shade of the red and white striped awnings but for ten years he had turned a heedless ear to these far off echoes of a frivolous world but to night there was something wrong the casino band was playing a waltz a waltz what a fool he had been to tear deliberately ten years of his life from the calendar of existence for one who had given him up for the false joys that wealth tum ti tum ti tum ti how did that waltz go but those years had not been sacrificed had they not brought him the star and pearl of all the world the youngest and beautifulest of but do not come on thursday evening she had insisted perhaps by now she would be moving slowly and gracefully to the strains of that waltz held closely by west pointers or city commuters while he who had read in her eyes things that had recompensed him for ten lost years of life moped like some wild animal in its mountain den why should damn it said the hermit suddenly i ll do it he threw down his marcus aurelius and threw off his gunny sack toga he dragged a dust covered trunk from a corner of the cave and with difficulty wrenched open its lid candles he had in plenty and the cave was soon aglow clothes ten years old in cut scissors razors hats shoes all his discarded attire and belongings were dragged ruthlessly from their renunciatory rest and strewn about in painful disorder a pair of scissors soon reduced his beard sufficiently for the dulled razors to perform approximately their office cutting his own hair was beyond the hermit s skill so he only combed and brushed it

open the door in two minutes perhaps in another way he might open it in one kneeling upon the floor he laid his ear to the combination plate and slowly turned the knob as he had surmised it was locked at only a day com upon one number his keen ear caught the faint warning click as the tumbler was disturbed he used the clue the handle turned he swung the door wide open the interior of the safe was bare not even a scrap of paper rested within the hollow iron cube doctor james rose to his feet and walked back to the bed a thick dew had formed upon the dying man s brow but there was a mocking grim smile on his lips and in his eyes i never saw it before he said painfully medicine and burglary wedded do you make the combination pay dear doctor than that situation afforded there was never a more rigorous test of doctor james s greatness trapped by the diabolic humor of his victim into a position both ridiculous and unsafe he maintained his dignity as well as his presence of mind taking out his watch he waited for the man to die you were just a shade too anxious about that money but it never was in any danger from you dear doctor it s safe perfectly safe it s all in the hands of the bookmakers twenty thousand amy s money i played it at the races lost every cent of it i ve been a pretty bad boy burglar excuse me doctor but i ve been a square sport i don t think i ever met such an eighteen carat rascal as you are doctor excuse me burglar in all my rounds is it contrary to the ethics of your gang burglar to give a victim excuse me patient a drink of water doctor james brought

the last sounds hie was to hear i never yet struck a woman it were vain to attempt to con such men there is no curriculum that can reckon with them in its ken thev are offshoots from the types whereof men say he will do this or he will do that we only know that they exist and that we can observe them and tell one another of their bare performances as children watch and speak of the marionettes yet it were a droll study in egoism to consider these two one an assassin and a robber standing above his victim the other baser in his offences if a lesser law breaker lying abhorred in the house of the wife he had persecuted spoiled and smitten one a tiger the other a dog wolf to consider each of them sickening at the foulness of the other and each flourishing out of the mire of his manifest guilt his own immaculate standard of conduct if not of honor the one retort of doctor james must have struck home to the other s remaining shreds of shame and manhood for it proved the coup de grace a deep

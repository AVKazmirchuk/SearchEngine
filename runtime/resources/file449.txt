turned toward him mr penne with extreme politeness possibly you would gather my meaning more intelligently if you would wait for the conclusion of the sentence dictates watched her rise as gracefully as a fawn as she mounted the eastern terrace miss lore oh mr penne dictates and yet cortland s position was so far above that of this rustic maiden that he dreaded to consider the social upheaval that would ensue should he marry her in no uncertain tones the traditional voices of his caste and world cried out loudly to him to let her go what should follow miss lore looking up with a start i m sure i can t say mr penne unless with a giggle you would want to add gallegher mr penne coldly pardon me i was not seeking to impose upon you the task of a collaborator kindly consider the question a part

wandering will you kindly point out miss lore where i have intimated that cortland was full if you prefer that word miss lore calmly consulting her stenographic notes it is right here word for word reads afterward he set out for a stroll with a skate on mr penne with peculiar emphasis ah and now will you kindly take down the expurgated phrase dictates afterward he set out for a stroll with as kate on one occasion had fancifully told him her spirit leaning upon his arm miss lore oh mr penne dictates chapter thirty four heading what kate found in the garden that fragrant summer morning brought gracious tasks to all the bees were at the honeysuckle blossoms on the porch kate singing a little song was training the riotous branches of her favorite woodbine the sun himself had rows miss

handed to fuzzy as his fingers closed on the slender glass stem his disabilities dropped from him for one brief moment he straightened himself and time so disobliging to most of us turned backward to accomodate fuzzy forgotten christmas ghosts whiter than the false beards of the most opulent kris kringle were rising in the fumes of grogan s whisky what had the millionaire s mansion to do with a long wainscoted virginia hall where the riders were grouped around a silver punch bowl drinking the ancient toast of the house and why should the patter of the cab horses hoofs on the frozen street be in any wise related to the sound of the saddled hunters stamping under the shelter of the west veranda and what had fuzzy to do with any of it the lady looking at him over her glass let her condescending smile fade away like a false dawn her eyes turned serious she saw something beneath the rags and scotch terrier whiskers that she did not understand but it did not matter fuzzy lifted his glass and smiled vacantly p pardon lady he said but couldn t leave without exchangin comp ments sheason with lady th house gainst princ ples gen leman do sho and then he began the ancient salutation that was a tradition in the house when men wore lace ruffles and powder the blessings of another year fuzzy s memory failed him the lady prompted be upon this hearth the guest stammered fuzzy and upon her who continued the lady with a leading smile oh cut it out said fuzzy ill manneredly i can t remember drink hearty fuzzy had shot his arrow they drank the lady smiled again the smile

wonder said the lady to herself musing who but there were so many who came i wonder whether memory is a curse or a blessing to them after they have fallen so low fuzzy and his escort were nearly at the door the lady called james james stalked back obsequiously leaving fuzzy waiting unsteadily with his brief spark of the divine fire gone outside black riley stamped his cold feet and got a firmer grip on his section of gas pipe you will conduct this gentleman said the lady downstairs then tell louis to get out the mercedes and take him to whatever place he wishes to go a night in new arabia the great city of bagdad on the subway is caliph ridden its palaces bazaars khans and byways are thronged with al rashids in divers disguises seeking diversion and victims for their unbridled generosity you can scarcely find a poor beggar whom they are willing to let enjoy his spoils unsuccored nor a wrecked unfortunate upon whom they will not reshower the means of fresh misfortune you will hardly find anywhere a hungry one who has not had the opportunity to tighten his belt in gift libraries nor a poor pundit who has not blushed at the holiday basket of celery crowned turkey forced resoundingly through his door by the eleemosynary press so then fearfully through the harun haunted streets creep the one eyed calenders the little hunchback and the barber s sixth brother hoping to escape the ministrations of the roving horde of caliphoid sultans entertainment for many arabian nights might be had from the histories of those who have escaped the largesse of the army of commanders

empty dining room by the coke ovens of hell it must be that ten thousand dollars if i can get that squared it ll do the trick thus by the commonest artifice of the trade having gained your interest the action of the story will now be suspended leaving you grumpily to consider a sort of dull biography beginning fifteen years before when old jacob was young jacob he was a breaker boy in a

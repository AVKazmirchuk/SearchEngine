the whole thing sammy is an obituary on romance sammy brown sat comfortably in the leather arm chair by the open window his suit was a vehement brown with visible checks beautifully matched in shade by the ends of four cigars that his vest pocket poorly concealed light tan were his shoes gray his socks sky blue his apparent linen snowy and high and adamantine his collar against which a black but terfly had alighted and spread his wings sammy s face least important was round and pleasant and pinkish and in his eyes you saw no haven for fleeing romance that window of ravenel s apartment opened upon an old garden full of ancient trees and shrubbery the apartment house towered above one side of it a high brick wall fended it from the street oppo site ravenel s window an old old mansion stood half hidden in the shade of the summer foliage the house was a castle besieged the city howled and roared and shrieked and beat upon its double doors and shook white fluttering checks above the wall offering terms of surrender the gray dust settled upon the trees the siege was pressed hotter but the draw bridge was not lowered no further will the language of chivalry serve inside lived an old gentleman who loved his home and did not wish to sell it that is all the romance of the besieged castle three or four times every week came sammy brown to ravenel s apartment he belonged to the poet s club for the former browns had been con spicuous though sammy bad been vulgarized by business he had no tears for departed romance the song of the ticker was the one that reached his heart and when it

cloud of pipe smoke be had just blown out the window ravenel was no greater than achilles no one is there is bound to be a spot the somebody or other must take bold of us somewhere when she dips us in

there are five more verses said ravenel pa tiently sardonic one naturally pauses at the end of each of course oh let s have the rest old man shouted sammy contritely i didn t mean to cut you off i m not much of a poetry expert you know i never saw a poem that didn t look like it ought to have terminal facilities at the end of every verse reel off the rest of it ravenel sighed and laid the

china dog on the mantelpiece that aunt harriet used to play with when she was a child his hair waved a little bit like the statue of the dinkus thrower at the vacation in rome but the color of it reminded you of the sunset in the grand canon by an american artist that they hang over the stove pipe holes in the salongs he was the reub without needing a touch you d have known him for one even if you d seen him on the vaudeville stage with one cotton suspender and a straw over his ear i told him what i wanted and found him ready to jump at the job overlooking such a trivial little peccadillo as the habit of manslaughter says i what have you accomplished in the way of indirect brigandage or nonactionable thriftiness that you could point to with or without pride as an evidence of your qualifications for the position why says he in his kind of southern system of procrastinated accents hain t you heard tell there ain t any man black or white in the blue ridge that can tote off a shoat as easy as i can without bein heard seen or cotched i can lift a shoat he goes on out of a pen from under a porch at the trough in the woods day or night anywhere or anyhow and i guarantee nobody won t hear a squeal it s all in the way you grab hold of em and carry em atterwards some day goes on this gentle despoiler of pig pens i hope to become reckernized as the champion shoat stealer of the world it s proper to be ambitious says i and hog stealing will do very well for mount nebo but in the outside world mr tatum it would be considered as crude a piece of business as a bear raid on bay state gas however it will do as a guarantee of good faith we ll go into partnership i ve got a thousand dollars cash capital and with that homeward plods atmosphere of yours we ought to be able to win out a few shares of soon parted preferred in the money market so i attaches rufe and we go away from mount nebo down into the lowlands and all the way i coach him for his part in the grafts i had in mind i had idled away two months on the florida coast and was feeling all to the ponce de leon besides having so many new schemes up my sleeve that i had to wear kimonos to hold em i intended to assume a funnel shape and mow a path nine miles wide though the farming belt of the middle west so we headed in that direction but when we got as far as lexington we found binkley brothers circus there and the blue grass peasantry romping into town and pounding the belgian blocks with their hand pegged sabots as artless and arbitrary as an extra session of a datto bryan drama i never pass a circus without pulling the valve cord and coming down for a little key west money so i engaged a couple of rooms and board for rufe and me at a house near the circus grounds run by a widow lady named peevy then i took rufe to a clothing store and gent s outfitted him he showed up strong as i knew he would after he was rigged up in the ready made rutabaga regalia me and old misfitzky stuffed him into a bright blue suit with a nile green visible plaid effect and riveted on a fancy vest of a light tuskegee normal tan color a red necktie and the yellowest pair of shoes in town they were the first clothes rufe had ever worn except the gingham layette and the butternut top dressing of his native kraal and he looked as self conscious as an igorrote with a new nose ring that night i went down to the circus tents and opened a small shell game rufe was to be the capper i gave him a roll of phony currency to bet with and kept a bunch of it in a special pocket to pay his winnings out of no i didn t mistrust him but i simply can t manipulate the ball to lose when i see real money bet my fingers go on a strike every time i try it i set up my little table and began to show them how easy it was to guess which shell the little pea was under the unlettered hinds gathered in a thick semicircle and began to nudge elbows and banter one another to bet then was when rufe ought to have single footed up and called the turn on the little joker for a few tens and fives to get them started but no rufe i d seen him two or three times walking about and looking at the side show pictures with his mouth full of peanut candy but he never came nigh the crowd piked a little but trying to work the shells without a capper is like fishing without a bait i closed the game with only forty two dollars of the unearned increment while i had been counting on yanking the yeomen for two hundred at least i went home at eleven and went to bed i supposed that the circus had proved too alluring for rufe and that he had succumbed to it concert and all but i meant to give him a lecture on general business principles in the morning just after morpheus had got both my shoulders to the shuck mattress i hears a houseful of unbecoming and ribald noises like a youngster screeching with green apple colic i opens my door and calls out in the hall for the widow lady and when she sticks her head out i says mrs

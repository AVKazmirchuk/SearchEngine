broke into applause at the art of it and at the proper time delmars leaped out at her side mimicking the uncouth hideous bounds of the gorilla so funnily that the grizzled sergeant himself gave a short laugh like the closing of a padlock they danced together the gorilla dance and won a hand from all then began the most fantastic part of the scene the wooing of the nymph by the gorilla it was a kind of dance itself eccentric and prankish with the nymph coquettish and seductive retreat followed by the gorilla as he sang i ll woo thee to my sylvan home the song was a lyric of merit the words were non sense as befitted the play but the music was worthy of something better delmars struck into it in a rich tenor that owned a quality that shamed the flippant words during one verse of the song the wood nymph per formed the grotesque evolutions designed for the scene at the middle of the second verse she stood still with a strange look on her face seeming to gaze dreamily into the depths of the scenic forest the gorilla s last leap had brought him to her feet and there he knelt holding her hand until he had finished the haunting lyric that was set in the absurd comedy like a diamond in a

weeks she has spoiled that scene in just that manner at every performance i have begged her to consider that it is not ophelia or juliet that she is playing do you wonder now at our impatience tears for the gorilla song the play is lost out of her bewitchment whatever it was the wood nymph flared suddenly and pointed a desperate finger at delmars it is you you who have done this she cried wildly

an old woman teach you all she said she went up to miss carroll and took her hand the man s wearing his heart out for you my dear couldn t you tell it the first note you heard him sing all of his monkey flip flops wouldn t have kept it from me must you be deaf as well as blind that s why you couldn t act your part child do you love him or must he be a gorilla for the rest of his days miss carroll whirled around and caught delmars with a lightning glance of her eye he came toward her melancholy did you hear mr delmars she asked with a catching breath i did said the comedian it is true i didn t think there was any use i tried to let you know with the song silly said the matron why didn t you speak no no cried the wood nymph his way was the best i didn t know but it was just what i wanted bobby she sprang like a green grasshopper and the comedian opened his arms and smiled get out of this roared the desk sergeant to the waiting waiter from the restaurant there s nothing doing

aside it was nothing new to receive such epistles from desperate men whom he had been called upon to judge he felt no alarm later on he showed the letter to littlefield the young district attorney for littlefield s name was included in the threat and the judge was punctilious in matters between himself and his fellow men littlefield honoured the rattle of the writer as far as it concerned himself with a smile of contempt but he frowned a little over the reference to the judge s daughter for he and nancy derwent were to be married in the fall littlefield went to the clerk of the court and looked over the records with him they decided that the letter might have been sent by mexico sam a half breed border desperado who had been imprisoned for manslaughter four years before then official

day while she was lying with the fever burning brightly in her checks she said suddenly papa i wish i could do something good for a whole lot of children what would you like to do dear asked the com missioner give them a party oh i don t mean those kind i mean poor children who haven t homes and aren t loved and cared for as i am i tell you what papa what my own child if i shouldn t get well i ll leave them you not give you but just lend you for you must come to mamma and me when you die too if you can find time wouldn t you do something to help them if i ask you papa hush hush dear dear child said the commissioner holding her hot little hand against his cheek you ll get well real soon and you and i will see what we can do for them together but in whatsoever paths of benevolence thus vaguely premeditated the commissioner might tread he was not to have the company of his beloved that night the little frail body grew suddenly too tired to struggle further and georgia s exit was made from the great stage when she had scarcely begun to speak her little piece before the footlights but there must be a stage manager who understands she had given the cue to the one who was to speak after her a week after she was laid away the commissioner reappeared at the office a little more courteous a little paler and sterner with the black frock coat hanging a little more loosely from his tall figure his desk was piled with work that had accumulated during the four heartbreaking weeks of his absence his chief clerk had done what he could but there were ques tions of law of fine judicial decisions to be made concern ing the issue of patents the marketing and leasing of school lands the classification into grazing agricultural watered and timbered of new tracts to be opened to settlers the commissioner went to work silently and ob stinately putting back his grief as far as possible forcing his mind to attack the complicated and important busi ness of his office on the second day after his return he called the porter pointed to a leather covered chair that stood near his own and ordered it removed to a lumber room at the top of the building in that chair georgia would always sit when she came to the office for him of afternoons as time passed the commissioner seemed to grow more silent solitary and reserved a new phase of mind developed in him he could not endure the presence of a child often when a clattering youngster belonging to one of the clerks would come chattering into the big business room adjoining his little apartment the com missioner would steal softly and close the door he would always cross the street to avoid meeting the school children when they came dancing along in happy groups upon the sidewalk and his firm mouth would close into a mere line it was nearly three months after the rains had washed the last dead flower petals from the mound above little georgia when the land shark firm of hamlin and avery filed papers upon what they considered the fattest vacancy of the year it should not be supposed that all who were termed land sharks deserved the name many of them were reputable men of good business character some of them could walk into the most august councils of the state and say gentlemen we would like to have this and that and matters go thus but next to a three years drought and the boll worm the actual settler hated the land shark the land shark haunted the land office where all the land records were kept and hunted vacancies that is tracts of unappro priated public domain generally invisible upon the official maps but actually existing upon the ground the law entitled any one possessing certain state scrip to file by virtue of same upon any land not previously legally appropriated most of the scrip was now in the hands of the land sharks thus at the cost of a few hundred dollars they often secured lands worth as many thousands naturally the search for vacancies was lively but often very often the land they thus secured though legally unappropriated would be occupied by happy and contented settlers who had laboured for years to build up their homes only to discover that their titles were worthless and to receive peremptory notice to quit thus came about the bitter and not unjustifiable hatred felt by the toiling settlers toward the shrewd and seldom merciful speculators who so often turned them forth destitute and homeless from their fruitless labours the history of the state teems with their antagonism mr land shark seldom showed his face on locations from which he should have to eject the unfortunate victims of a monstrously tangled land system but let his emis saxies do the work there was lead in every cabin moulded into balls for him many of his brothers had enriched the grass with their blood the fault of it all lay far back when the state was young she felt the need of attract ing newcomers and of rewarding those pioneers already within her borders year after year she issued land scrip headrights bounties veteran donations confeder ates and to railroads irrigation companies colonies and tillers of the soil galore all required of the grantee was that he or it should have the scrip properly surveyed upon the public domain by the county or district surveyor and the land thus appropriated became the property of him or it or his or its heirs and assigns forever in those days and here is where the trouble began the state s domain was practically inexhaustible and the

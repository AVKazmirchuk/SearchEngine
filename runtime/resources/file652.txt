through the long morning and past the time of the dinner at the store in her mind she could hear the girls shrieking over a pull bone could hear old bachman s roar over his own deeply concealed jokes could see the diamonds of fat mrs bachman who came to the store only on thanksgiving days could see mr ramsay moving about alert kindly looking to the comfort of all at four in the afternoon with an expressionless face and a lifeless air she slowly made her way to schlegel s shop and told him she could not pay the due on the dress gott cried schlegel angrily for what do you look so glum take him away he is ready pay me some time haf i not seen you pass mine shop every day in two years if i make clothes is it that i do not know how to read beoples because you will pay me some time when you can take him away he is made goot and if you look bretty in him all right so pay me when you can maida breathed a millionth part of the thanks in her heart and hurried away with her dress as she left the shop a smart dash of rain struck upon her face she smiled and did not feel it ladies who shop in carriages you do not understand girls whose wardrobes are charged to the old man s account you cannot begin to comprehend you could not understand why maida did not feel the cold dash of the thanksgiving rain at five o clock she went out upon the street wearing her purple dress the rain had increased and it beat down upon her in a steady wind blown pour people were scurrying home and to cars with close held umbrellas and tight buttoned raincoats many of them turned their heads to marvel at this beautiful serene happy eyed girl in the purple dress walking through the storm as though she were strolling in a garden under summer skies i say you do not understand it ladies of the full purse and varied wardrobe you do not know what it is to live with a perpetual longing for pretty things to starve eight months in order to bring a purple dress and a holiday together what difference if it rained hailed blew snowed cycloned maida had no umbrella nor overshoes she had her purple dress and she walked abroad let the elements do their worst a starved heart must have one crumb during a year the rain ran down and dripped from her fingers some one turned a corner and blocked her way she looked up into mr ramsay s eyes sparkling with admiration and interest why miss maida said he you look simply magnificent in your new dress i was greatly disappointed not to see you at our dinner and of all the girls i ever knew you show the greatest sense and intelligence there is nothing more healthful and invigorating than braving the weather as you are doing may i walk with you and maida blushed and sneezed the foreign policy of company john byrnes hose cart driver of engine company no was afflicted with what his comrades called japanits byrnes had a war map spread permanently upon a table in the second story of the engine house and he could explain to you at any hour of the day or

other firemen would hear him yell go it you blamed little sawed off huckleberry eyed monkey faced hot tamales eat em up you little sleight o hand bow legged bull terriers give em another of them yalu

name says the palmist thoughtful looking is not spelled out by the lines but they indicate tis a long one and the letter o should be in it there s no more to tell good evening don t block up the door tis wonderful how she knows says tobin as we walk to the pier as we squeezed through the gates a nigger man sticks his lighted segar against tobin s ear and there is trouble tobin hammers his neck and the women squeal and by presence of mind i drag the little man out of the way before the police comes tobin is always in an ugly mood when enjoying himself on the boat going back when the man calls who wants the good looking waiter tobin tried to plead guilty feeling the desire to blow the foam off a crock of suds but when he felt in his pocket he found himself discharged for lack of evidence somebody had disturbed his change during the commotion so we sat dry upon the stools listening to the dagoes fiddling on deck if anything tobin was lower in spirits and less congenial with his misfortunes than when we started on a seat against the railing was a young woman dressed suitable for red automobiles with hair the colour of an unsmoked meerschaum in passing by tobin kicks her foot without intentions and being polite to ladies when in drink he tries to give his hat a twist while apologising but he knocks it off and the wind carries it overboard tobin came back and sat down and i began to look out for him for the man s adversities were becoming frequent he was apt when pushed so close by hard luck to kick the best dressed man he could see and try to take command of the boat presently tobin grabs my arm and says excited jawn says he do ye know what we re doing we re taking a voyage upon the water there now says i subdue yeself the boat l land in ten minutes more look says he at the light lady upon the bench and have ye forgotten the nigger man that burned me ear and isn t the money i had gone a dollar sixty five it was i thought he was no more than summing up his catastrophes so as to get violent with good excuse as men will do and i tried to make him understand such things was trifles listen says tobin ye ve no ear for the gift of prophecy or the miracles of the inspired what did the palmist lady tell ye out of me hand tis coming true before your eyes look out says she for a dark man and a light woman they ll bring ye trouble have ye forgot the nigger man though be got some of it back from me fist can ye show me a lighter woman than the blonde lady that was the cause of me hat falling in the water and where s the dollar sixty five i had in me vest when we left the shooting gallery the way tobin put it it did seem to corroborate the art of prediction though it looked to me that these accidents could happen to any one at coney without the implication of palmistry tobin got up and walked around on deck looking close at the passengers out of his little red eyes i asked him the interpretation of his movements ye never know what tobin has in his mind until he begins to carry it out ye should know says he i m working out the salvation promised by the lines in me palm i m looking for the crooked nose man that s to bring the good luck tis all that will save us jawn did ye ever see a straighter nosed gang of hellions in the days of your life twas the nine thirty boat and we landed and walked up town through twenty second street tobin being without his hat on a street corner standing under a gas light and looking over the elevated road at the moon was a man a long man he was dressed decent with a segar between his teeth and i saw that his nose made two twists from bridge to end like the wriggle of a snake tobin saw it at the same time and i heard him breathe hard like a horse when you take the saddle off he went straight up to the man and i went with him good night to ye tobin says to the man the man takes out his segar and passes the compliments sociable would ye hand us your name asks tobin and let us look at the size of it it may be our duty to become acquainted with ye my name says the man polite is friedenhausman maximus g friedenhausman tis the right length says tobin do you spell it with an o anywhere down the stretch of it i do not says the man can ye spell it with an o inquires tobin turning anxious if your conscience says the man with the nose is indisposed toward foreign idioms ye might to please yourself smuggle the letter into the penultimate syllable tis well says tobin ye re in the presence of jawn malone and daniel tobin tis highly appreciated says the man with a bow and now since i cannot conceive that ye would hold a spelling bee upon the street corner will ye name some reasonable excuse for being at large by the two signs answers tobin trying to explain which ye display according to the reading of the egyptian palmist from the sole of me hand ye ve been nominated to offset with good luck the lines of trouble leading to the nigger man and the blonde lady with her feet crossed in the boat besides the financial loss of a dollar sixty

she had inherited from the gitanas of the basque province as for the humming bird part of her that dwelt in her heart you could not perceive it unless her bright red skirt and dark blue blouse gave you a symbolic hint of the vagarious bird the newly lighted sun god asked for a drink of water tonia brought it from the red jar hanging under the brush shelter sandridge considered it necessary to dismount so as to lessen the trouble of her ministrations i play no spy nor do i assume to master the thoughts of any human heart but i assert by the chronicler s right that before a quarter of an hour had sped sandridge was teaching her how to plaint a six strand rawhide stake rope and tonia had explained to him that were it not for her little english book that the peripatetic padre had given her and the little crippled chivo that she fed from a bottle she would be very very lonely indeed which leads to a suspicion that the kid s fences needed repairing and that the adjutant general s sarcasm had fallen upon unproductive soil in his camp by the water hole lieutenant sandridge announced and reiterated his intention of either causing the cisco kid to nibble the black loam of the frio country prairies or of haling him before a judge and jury that sounded business like twice a week he rode over to the lone wolf crossing of the frio and directed tonia s slim slightly lemon tinted fingers among the intricacies of the slowly growing lariata a six strand plait is hard to learn and easy to teach the ranger knew that he might find the kid there at any visit he kept his armament ready and had a frequent eye for the pear thicket at the rear of the jacal thus he might bring down the kite and the humming bird with one stone while the sunny haired ornithologist was pursuing his studies the cisco kid was also attending to his professional duties he moodily shot up a saloon in a small cow village on quintana creek killed the town marshal plugging him neatly in the centre of his tin badge and then rode away morose and unsatisfied no true artist is uplifted by shooting an aged man carrying an old style bulldog on his way the kid suddenly experienced the yearning that all men feel when wrong doing loses its keen edge of delight he yearned for the woman he loved to reassure him that she was his in spite of it he wanted her to call his bloodthirstiness bravery and his cruelty devotion he wanted tonia to bring him water from the red jar under the brush shelter and tell him how the chivo was thriving on the bottle the kid turned the speckled roan s head up the ten mile pear flat that stretches along the arroyo hondo until it ends at the lone wolf crossing of the frio the roan whickered for he had a sense of locality and direction equal to that of a belt line street car horse and he knew he would soon be nibbling the rich mesquite grass at the end of a forty foot stake rope while ulysses rested his head in circe s straw roofed hut more weird and lonesome than the journey of an amazonian explorer is the ride of one through a texas pear flat with dismal monotony and startling variety the uncanny and multiform shapes of the cacti lift their twisted trunks and fat bristly hands to encumber the way the demon plant appearing to live without soil or rain seems to taunt the parched traveller with its lush grey greenness it warps itself a thousand times about what look to be open and inviting paths only to lure the rider into blind and impassable spine defended bottoms of the bag leaving him to retreat if he can with the points of the compass whirling in his head to be lost in the pear is to die almost the death of the thief on the cross pierced by nails and with grotesque shapes of all the fiends hovering about but it was not so with the kid and his mount winding twisting circling tracing the most fantastic and bewildering trail ever picked out the good roan lessened the distance to the lone wolf crossing with every coil and turn that he made while they fared the kid sang he knew but one tune and sang it as he knew but one code and lived it and but one girl and loved her he was a single minded man of conventional ideas he had a voice like a coyote with bronchitis but whenever he chose to sing his song he sang it it was a conventional song of the camps and trail running at its beginning as near as may be to these words don t you monkey with my lulu girl or i ll tell you what i ll do and so on the roan was inured to it and did not mind but even the poorest singer will after a certain time gain his own consent to refrain from contributing to the world s noises so the kid by the time he was within a mile or two of tonia s jacal had reluctantly allowed his song to die away not because his vocal performance had become less charming to his own ears but because his laryngeal muscles were aweary as though he were in a circus ring the speckled roan wheeled and danced through the labyrinth of pear until at length his rider knew by certain landmarks that the lone wolf crossing was close at hand then where the pear was thinner he caught sight of the grass roof of the jacal and the hackberry tree on the edge of the arroyo a few yards farther the kid stopped the roan and

a hit on the way home says she ain t the stars lovely and bright to night mr pratt for the chance they ve got says i they re humping themselves in a mighty creditable way that big one you see is sixty six million miles distant it took thirty six years for its light to reach us with an eighteen foot telescope you can see forty three millions of em including them of the thirteenth magnitude which if one was to go out now you would keep on seeing it for twenty seven hundred years my says mrs sampson i never knew that before how warm it is i m as damp as i can be from dancing so much that s easy to account for says i when you happen to know that you ve got two million sweat glands working all at once if every one of your perspiratory ducts which are a quarter of an inch long was placed end to end they would reach a distance of seven miles lawsy says mrs sampson it sounds like an irrigation ditch you was describing mr pratt how do you get all this knowledge of information from observation mrs sampson i tells her i keep my eyes open when i go about the world mr pratt says she i always did admire a man of education there are so few scholars among the sap headed plug uglies of this town that it is a real pleasure to converse with a gentleman of culture i d be gratified to have you call at my house whenever you feel so inclined and that was the way i got the goodwill of the lady in the yellow house every tuesday and friday evening i used to go there and tell her about the wonders of the universe as discovered tabulated and compiled from nature by herkimer idaho and the other gay lutherans of the town got every minute of the rest of the week that they could i never imagined that idaho was trying to work on mrs sampson with old k m s rules of courtship till one afternoon when i was on my way over to take her a basket of wild hog plums i met the lady coming down the lane that led to her house her eyes was snapping and her hat made a dangerous dip over one eye mr pratt she opens up this mr green is a friend of yours i believe for nine years says i cut him out says she he s no gentleman why ma am says i he s a plain incumbent of the mountains with asperities and the usual failings of a spendthrift and a liar but i never on the most momentous occasion had the heart to deny that he was a gentleman it may be that in haberdashery and the sense of arrogance and display idaho offends the eye but inside ma am i ve found him impervious to the lower grades of crime and obesity after nine years of idaho s society mrs sampson i winds up i should hate to impute him and i should hate to see him imputed it s right plausible of you mr pratt says mrs sampson to take up the curmudgeons in your friend s behalf but it don t alter the fact that he has made proposals to me sufficiently obnoxious to ruffle the ignominy of any lady why now now now says i old idaho do that i could believe it of myself sooner i never knew but one thing to deride in him and a blizzard was responsible for that once while we was snow bound in the mountains he became a prey to a kind of spurious and uneven poetry which may have corrupted his demeanour it has says mrs sampson ever since i knew him he has been reciting to me a lot of irreligious rhymes by some person he calls ruby ott and who is no better than she should be if you judge by her poetry then idaho has struck a new book says i for the one he had was by a man who writes under the nom de plume of k m he d better have stuck to it says mrs sampson whatever it was and to day he caps the vortex i get a bunch of flowers from him and on em is pinned a note now mr pratt you know a lady when you see her and you know how i stand in rosa society do you think for a moment that i d skip out to the woods with a man along with a jug of wine and a loaf of bread and go singing and cavorting up and down under the trees with him i take a little claret with my meals but i m not in the habit of packing a jug of it into the brush and raising cain in any such style as that and of course he d bring his book of verses along too he said so let him go on his scandalous picnics alone or let him take his ruby ott with him i reckon she wouldn t kick unless it was on account of there being too much bread along and what do you think of your gentleman friend now mr pratt well m says i it may be that idaho s invitation was a kind of poetry and meant no harm may be it belonged to the class of rhymes they call figurative they offend law and order but they get sent through the mails on the grounds that they mean something that they don t say i d be glad on idaho s account if you d overlook it says i and let us extricate our minds from the low regions of poetry to the higher planes of fact and fancy on a beautiful afternoon like this mrs sampson

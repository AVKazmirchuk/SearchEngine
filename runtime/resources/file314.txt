seems i must find you a husband and make you a widow in the same night i know not sword play said david he flushed to make the confession before his lady i know not sword play mimicked the marquis shall we fight like peasants with oaken cudgels hola francois my pistols a postilion brought two shining great pistols ornamented with carven silver from the carriage holsters the marquis tossed one upon the table near david s hand to the other end of the table he cried even a shepherd may pull a trigger few of them attain the honour to die by the weapon of a de beaupertuys the shepherd and the marquis faced each other from the ends of the long table the landlord in an ague of terror clutched the air and stammered m m monseigneur for the love of christ not in my house do not spill blood it will ruin my custom the look of the marquis threatening him paralyzed his tongue coward cried the lord of beaupertuys cease chattering your teeth long enough to give the word for us if you can mine host s knees smote the floor he was without a vocabulary even sounds were beyond him still by gestures he seemed to beseech peace in the name of his house and custom i will give the word said the lady in a clear voice she went up to david and kissed him sweetly her eyes were sparkling bright and colour had come to her cheek she stood against the wall and the two men levelled their pistols for her count un deux trois the two reports came so nearly together that the candles flickered but once the marquis stood smiling the fingers of his left hand resting outspread upon the end of the table david remained erect and turned his head very slowly searching for his wife with his eyes then as a garment falls from where it is hung he sank crumpled upon the floor with a little cry of terror and despair the widowed maid ran and stooped above him she found his wound and then looked up with her old look of pale melancholy through his heart she whispered oh his heart come boomed the great voice of the marquis out with you to the carriage daybreak shall not find you on my hands wed you shall be again and to a living husband this night the next we come upon my lady highwayman or peasant if the road yields no other then the churl that opens my gates out with you into the carriage the marquis implacable and huge the lady wrapped again in the mystery of her cloak the postilion bearing the weapons all moved out to the waiting carriage the sound of its ponderous wheels rolling away echoed through the slumbering village in the hall of the silver flagon the distracted landlord wrung his hands above the slain poet s body while the flames of the four and twenty candles danced and flickered on the table the right branch three leagues then the road ran and turned into a puzzle it joined with another and a larger road at right angles david stood uncertain for a while and then took the road to the right whither it led he knew not but he was resolved to leave vernoy far behind that night he travelled a league and then passed a large chateau which showed testimony of recent entertainment lights shone from every window from the great stone gateway ran a tracery of wheel tracks drawn in the dust by the vehicles of the guests three leagues farther and david was weary he rested and slept for a while on a bed of pine boughs at the roadside then up and on again along the unknown way thus for five days he travelled the great road sleeping upon nature s balsamic beds or in peasants ricks eating of their black hospitable bread drinking from streams or the willing cup of the goatherd at length he crossed a great bridge and set his foot within the smiling city that has crushed or crowned more poets than all the rest of the world his breath came quickly as paris sang to him in a little undertone her vital chant of greeting the hum of voice and foot and wheel high up under the eaves of an old house in the rue conti david paid for lodging and set himself in a wooden chair to his poems the street once sheltering citizens of import and consequence was now given over to those who ever follow in the wake of decline the houses were tall and still possessed of a ruined dignity but many of them were empty save for dust and the spider by night there was the clash of steel and the cries of brawlers straying restlessly from inn to inn where once gentility abode was now but a rancid and rude incontinence but here david found housing commensurate to his scant purse daylight and candlelight found him at pen and paper one afternoon he was returning from a foraging trip to the lower world with bread and curds and a bottle of thin wine halfway up his dark stairway he met or rather came upon for she rested on the stair a young woman of a beauty that should balk even the justice of a poet s imagination a loose dark cloak flung open showed a rich gown beneath her eyes changed swiftly with every little shade of thought within one moment they would be round and artless like a child s and long and cozening like a gypsy s one hand raised her gown undraping a little shoe high heeled with its ribbons dangling untied so heavenly she was so unfitted to stoop so qualified to charm and command perhaps she had seen david coming and had waited for his help there ah would monsieur pardon

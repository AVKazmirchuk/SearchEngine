that pink and yellow guy at the store says these reubs do forget it oh you ll like it when you get used to it said ranse yes i ll send you up one more drink by pedro i think you ll make a first class cowpuncher before i get through with you me said curly i pity the cows you set me to chaperon they can go chase themselves don t forget my nightcap please boss ranse paid a visit to the store before going to the house sam rivell was taking off his tan shoes regretting and preparing for bed any of the boys from the san gabriel camp riding in early in the morning asked ranse long collins said sam briefly for the mail tell him said ranse to take that tramp out to camp with him and keep him till i get there curly was sitting on his blankets in the san gabriel camp cursing talentedly when ranse truesdell rode up and dismounted on the next afternoon the cowpunchers were ignoring the stray he was grimy with dust and black dirt his clothes were making their last stand in favour of the conventions ranse went up to buck rabb the camp boss and spoke briefly he s a plumb buzzard said buck he won t work and he s the low downest passel of inhumanity i ever see i didn t know what you wanted done with him ranse so i just let him set that seems to suit him he s been condemned to death by the boys a dozen times but i told em maybe you was savin him for the torture ranse took off his coat i ve got a hard job before me buck i reckon but it has to be done i ve got to make a man out of that thing that s what i ve come to camp for he went up to curly brother he said don t you think if you had a bath it would allow you to take a seat in the company of your fellow man with less injustice to the atmosphere run away farmer said curly sardonically willie will send for nursey when he feels like having his tub the charco or water hole was twelve yards away ranse took one of curly s ankles and dragged him like a sack of potatoes to the brink then with the strength and sleight of a hammer throw he hurled the offending member of society far into the lake curly crawled out and up the bank spluttering like a porpoise ranse met him with a piece of soap and a coarse towel in his hands go to the other end of the lake and use this he said buck will give you some dry clothes at the wagon the tramp obeyed without protest by the time supper was ready he had returned to camp he was hardly to be recognised in his new shirt and brown duck clothes ranse observed him out of the corner of his eye lordy i hope he ain t a coward he was saying to himself i hope he won t turn out to be a coward his doubts were soon allayed curly walked straight to where he stood his light blue eyes were blazing now i m clean he said meaningly maybe you ll talk to me think you ve got a picnic here do you you clodhoppers think you can run over a man because you know he can t get away all right now what do you think of that curly planted a stinging slap against ranse s left cheek the print of his hand stood out a dull red against the tan ranse smiled happily the cowpunchers talk to this day of the battle that followed somewhere in his restless tour of the cities curly had acquired the art of self defence the ranchman was equipped only with the splendid strength and equilibrium of perfect health and the endurance conferred by decent living the two attributes nearly matched there were no formal rounds at last the fibre of the clean liver prevailed the last time curly went down from one of the ranchman s awkward but powerful blows he remained on the grass but looking up with an unquenched eye ranse went to the water barrel and washed the red from a cut on his chin in the stream from the faucet on his face was a grin of satisfaction much benefit might accrue to educators and moralists if they could know the details of the curriculum of reclamation through which ranse put his waif during the month that he spent in the san gabriel camp the ranchman had no fine theories to work out perhaps his whole stock of pedagogy embraced only a knowledge of horse breaking and a belief in heredity the cowpunchers saw that their boss was trying to make a man out of the strange animal that he had sent among them and they tacitly organised themselves into a faculty of assistants but their system was their own curly s first lesson stuck he became on friendly and then on intimate terms with soap and water and the thing that pleased ranse most was that his subject held his ground at each successive higher step but the steps were sometimes far apart once he got at the quart bottle of whisky kept sacredly in the grub tent for rattlesnake bites and spent sixteen hours on the grass magnificently drunk but when he staggered to his feet his first move was to find his soap and

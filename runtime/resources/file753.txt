to do something money has a way of taking wings unto itself and you know it takes money to keep step with our crowd in washington i saw this opening in the west and well a marshalship isn t quite as high a position as that of ambassador but the ambassador said the girl warmly doesn t call any more he needn t ever have done so you ought to know that and so now you are one of these dashing western heroes and you ride and shoot and go into all kinds of dangers that s different from the washington life you have been missed from the old crowd the girl s eyes fascinated went back widening a little to rest upon the glittering handcuffs don t you worry about them miss said the other man all marshals handcuff themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away mr easton knows his business will we see you again soon in washington asked the girl not soon i think said easton my butterfly days are over i fear i love the west said the girl irrelevantly her eyes were shining softly she looked away out the car window she began to speak truly and simply without the gloss of style and manner mamma and i spent the summer in denver she went home a week ago because father was slightly ill i could live and be happy in the west i think the air here agrees with me money isn t everything but people always misunderstand things and remain stupid say mr marshal growled the glum faced man this isn t quite fair i m needing a drink and haven t had a smoke all day haven t you talked long enough take me in the smoker now won t you i m half dead for a pipe the bound travelers rose to their feet easton with the same slow smile on his face i can t deny a petition for tobacco he said lightly it s the one friend of the unfortunate good bye miss fairchild duty calls you know he held out his hand for a farewell it s too bad you are not going east she said reclothing herself with manner and style but you must go on to leavenworth i suppose yes said easton i must go on to leavenworth the two men sidled down the aisle into the smoker the two passengers in a seat near by had heard most of the conversation said one of them that marshal s a good sort of chap some of these western fellows are all right pretty young to hold an office like that isn t he asked the other young exclaimed the first speaker why oh didn t you catch on say did you ever know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to his right hand the cactus the most notable thing about time is that it is so purely relative a large amount of reminiscence is by common consent conceded to the drowning man and it is not past belief that one may review an entire courtship while removing one s gloves that is what trysdale was doing standing by a table in his bachelor apartments on the table stood a singular looking green plant in a red earthen jar the plant was one of the species of cacti and was provided with long tentacular leaves that perpetually swayed with the slightest breeze with a peculiar beckoning motion trysdale s friend the brother of the bride stood at a sideboard complaining at being allowed to drink alone both men were in evening dress white favors like stars upon their coats shone through the gloom of the apartment as he slowly unbuttoned his gloves there passed through trysdale s mind a swift scarifying retrospect of the last few hours it seemed that in his nostrils was still the scent of the flowers that had been banked in odorous masses about the church and in his ears the lowpitched hum of a thousand well bred voices the rustle of crisp garments and most insistently recurring the drawling words of the minister irrevocably binding her to another from this last hopeless point of view he still strove as if it had become a habit of his mind to reach some conjecture as to why and how he had lost her shaken rudely by the uncompromising fact he had suddenly found himself confronted by a thing he had never before faced his own innermost unmitigated arid unbedecked self he saw all the garbs of pretence and egoism that he had worn now turn to rags of folly he shuddered at the thought that to others before now the garments of his soul must have appeared sorry and threadbare vanity and conceit these were the joints in his armor and how free from either she had always been but why as she had slowly moved up the aisle toward the altar he had felt an unworthy sullen exultation that had served to support him he had told himself that her paleness was from thoughts of another than the man to whom she was about to give herself but even that poor consolation had been wrenched from him for when he saw that swift limpid upward look that she gave the man when he took her hand he knew himself to be forgotten once that same look had been raised to him and he had gauged its meaning indeed his conceit had crumbled its last prop was gone why had it ended thus there had been no quarrel between them nothing for the thousandth time he remarshalled in his mind the events of those last few days before the tide had so suddenly turned she had always insisted upon placing him upon a pedestal and he had accepted her homage with royal grandeur it had been a very sweet incense that she had burned

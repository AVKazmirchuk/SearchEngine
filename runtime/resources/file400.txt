strange warbling that he understood was just what kept the warbler without his breakfast but he knew very well that the part he did not understand did not concern him so he gave a little flutter of his wings and swooped down like a brown bullet upon a big fat worm that was wriggling along the levee path the halberdier of the little rheinschloss i go sometimes into the bierhalle and restaurant called old munich not long ago it was a resort of interesting bohemians but now only artists and musicians and literary folk frequent it but the pilsner is yet good and i take some diversion from the conversation of waiter no for many years the customers of old munich have accepted the place as a faithful copy from the ancient german town the big hall with its smoky rafters rows of imported steins portrait of goethe and verses painted on the walls translated into german from the original of the cincinnati poets seems atmospherically correct when viewed through the bottom of a glass but not long ago the proprietors added the room above called it the little rheinschloss and built in a stairway up there was an imitation stone parapet ivy covered and the walls were painted to represent depth and distance with the rhine winding at the base of the vineyarded slopes and the castle of ehrenbreitstein looming directly opposite the entrance of course there were tables and chairs and you could have beer and food brought you as you naturally would on the top of a castle on the rhine i went into old munich one afternoon when there were few customers and sat at my usual table near the stairway i was shocked and almost displeased to perceive that the glass cigar case by the orchestra stand had been smashed to smithereens i did not like things to happen in old munich nothing had ever happened there before waiter no came and breathed on my neck i was his by right of discovery eighteen s brain was built like a corral it was full of ideas which when he opened the gate came huddling out like a flock of sheep that might get together afterward or might not i did not shine as a shepherd as a type eighteen fitted nowhere i did not find out if he had a nationality family creed grievance hobby soul preference home or vote he only came always to my table and as long as his leisure would permit let words flutter from him like swallows leaving a barn at daylight how did the cigar case come to be broken eighteen i asked with a certain feeling of personal grievance i can tell you about that sir said he resting his foot on the chair next to mine did you ever have anybody hand you a double handful of good luck while both your hands were full of bad luck and stop to notice how your fingers behaved no riddles eighteen said i leave out palmistry and manicuring you remember said eighteen the guy in the hammered brass prince albert and the oroide gold pants and the amalgamated copper hat that carried the combination meat axe ice pick and liberty pole and used to stand on the first landing as you go up to the little rindslosh why yes said i the halberdier i never noticed him particularly i remember he thought he was only a suit of armour he had a perfect poise he had more than that said eighteen he was me friend he was an advertisement the boss hired him to stand on the stairs for a kind of scenery to show there was something doing in the has been line upstairs what did you call him a what kind of beer a halberdier said i that was an ancient man at arms of many hundred years ago some mistake said eighteen this one wasn t that old he wasn t over twenty three or four it was the boss s idea rigging a man up in an ante bellum suit of tinware and standing him on the landing of the slosh he bought the goods at a fourth avenue antique store and hung a sign out able bodied hal halberdier wanted costume furnished the same morning a young man with wrecked good clothes and a hungry look comes in bringing the sign with him i was filling the mustard pots at my station i m it says he whatever it is but i never halberdiered in a restaurant put me on is it a masquerade i hear talk in the kitchen of a fishball says i bully for you eighteen says he you and i ll get on show me the boss s desk well the boss tries the harveyized pajamas on him and they fitted him like the scales on a baked redsnapper and he gets the job you ve seen what it is he stood straight up in the corner of the first landing with his halberd to his shoulder looking right ahead and guarding the portugals of the castle the boss is nutty about having the true old world flavour to his joint halberdiers goes with rindsloshes says he just as rats goes with rathskellers and white cotton stockings with tyrolean villages the boss is a kind of a antiologist and is all posted up on data and such information from p m to two in the morning was the halberdier s hours he got two meals with us help and a dollar an night i eat with him at the table he liked me he never told his name he was travelling impromptu like kings i guess the first time at supper i says to him have some more of the spuds mr frelinghuysen oh don t be so formal and offish eighteen says he call me hal that s short for halberdier oh don t think i wanted to pry

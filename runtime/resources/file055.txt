on the little muddy last august he went up there dressed in a red bedquilt and told sam he was king solomon and that the queen of sheba was coming to visit him he fetched along all the money he had a little bag full of silver and dropped it in sam s well she won t come says old man redruth to sam if she knows i ve got any money as soon as folks heard he had that sort of a theory about women and money they knowed he was crazy so they sent down and packed him to the foolish asylum was there a romance in his life that drove him to a solitary existence asked one of the passengers a young man who had an agency no said bildad not that i ever heard spoke of just ordinary trouble they say he had had unfortunateness in the way of love derangements with a young lady when he was young before he contracted red bed quilts and had his financial conclusions disqualified i never heard of no romance ah exclaimed judge menefee impressively a case of unrequited affection no doubt no sir returned bildad not at all she never married him marmaduke mulligan down at paradise seen a man once that come from old redruth s town he said redruth was a fine young man but when you kicked him on the pocket

have reach across you in a car to pay the fare well there come to the town a young chap all affluent and easy and fixed up with buggies and mining stock and leisure time although she was a staked claim miss alice and the new entry seemed to strike a mutual kind of a clip they had calls and coincidences of going to the post office and such things as sometimes make a girl send back the engagement ring and other presents a rift within the loot the poetry man calls it one day folks seen redruth and miss alice standing talking at the gate then he lifts his hat and walks away and that

be bound she tells the boy with the pay ore to trot and then spends her time watching out the window for the man with the empty pocket book and the tickly moustache i reckon redruth waits about nine year expecting her to send him a note by a nigger asking him to forgive her but she don t this game won t work says redruth then so won t i and he goes in the hermit business and raises whiskers yes laziness and whiskers was what done the trick they travel together you ever hear of a man with long whiskers and hair striking a bonanza no look at the duke of marlborough and this standard oil snoozer have they got em now this alice didn t never marry i ll bet a hoss if redruth had married somebody else she might have done so too but he never turns up she has these here things they call fond memories and maybe a lock of hair and a corset steel that he broke treasured up them sort of articles is as good as a husband to some women i d say she played out a lone hand i don t blame no woman for old man redruth s abandonment of barber shops and clean shirts next in order came the passenger who was nobody in particular nameless to us he travels the road from paradise to sunrise city but him you shall see if the firelight be not too dim as he responds to the judge s call a lean form in rusty brown clothing sitting like a frog his arms wrapped about his legs his chin resting upon his knees smooth oakum coloured hair long nose mouth like a satyr s with upturned tobacco stained corners an eye like a fish s a red necktie with a horseshoe pin he began with a rasping chuckle that gradually formed itself into words everybody wrong so far what a romance without any orange blossoms ho ho my money on the lad with the butterfly tie and the certified checks in his trouserings take em as they parted at the gate all right you never loved me says redruth wildly or you wouldn t speak to a man who can buy you the ice cream i hate him says she i loathe his side bar buggy i despise the elegant cream bonbons he sends me in gilt boxes covered with real lace i feel that i could stab him to the heart when he presents me with a solid medallion locket with turquoises and pearls running in a vine around the border away with him tis only you i love back to the cosey corner says redruth was i bound and lettered in east aurora get platonic if you please no jack pots for mine go and hate your friend some more for me the nickerson girl on avenue b and gum and a trolley ride around that night comes john w croesus what tears says he arranging his pearl pin you have driven my lover away says little alice sobbing i hate the sight of you marry me then says john w lighting a henry clay what she cries indignantly marry you never she says until this blows over and i can do some shopping and you see about the licence there s a telephone next door if you want to call up the county clerk the narrator paused to give vent to his cynical chuckle did they marry he continued did the duck swallow the june bug and then i take up the case of old boy redruth there s where you are all wrong again according to my theory what turned him into a hermit one says laziness one says remorse one says booze i say women did it how old is the old man now asked the speaker turning to bildad rose i should say about sixty five all right he conducted his hermit shop here for twenty years say he was twenty five when he took off his hat at the gate that leaves twenty years for him to account for or else be docked where did he spend that ten and two fives i ll give you my idea up for bigamy say there was the fat blonde in saint jo and the panatela brunette at skillet ridge and the gold tooth down in the kaw valley redruth gets his cases mixed and they send him up the road he gets out after they are through with him and says any line for me except the crinoline the hermit trade is not overdone and the stenographers never apply to em for work the jolly hermit s life for me no more long hairs in the comb or dill pickles lying around in the cigar tray you tell me they pinched old redruth for the noodle villa just because he said he was king solomon figs he was solomon that s all of

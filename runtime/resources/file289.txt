the greene home i shook my wild habits from me like a worn out cloak i trained for the conflict with the care of a prize fighter and the self denial of a brahmin as for chloe greene i shall weary you with no sonnets to her eyebrow she was a splendidly feminine girl as wholesome as a november pippin and no more mysterious than a windowpane she had whimsical little theories that she had deduced from life and that fitted the maxims of epictetus like princess gowns i wonder after all if that old duffer wasn t rather wise chloe had a father the reverend homer greene and an intermittent mother who sometimes palely presided over a twilight teapot the reverend homer was a burr like man with a life work he was writing a concordance to the scriptures and had arrived as far as kings being presumably a suitor for his daughter s hand i was timber for his literary outpourings i had the family tree of israel drilled into my head until i used to cry aloud in my sleep and aminadab begat jay eye see and so forth until he had tackled another book i once made a calculation that the reverend homer s concordance would be worked up as far as the seven vials mentioned in revelations about the third day after they were opened louis devoe as well as i was a visitor and an intimate friend of the greenes it was there i met him the oftenest and a more agreeable man or a more accomplished i have never hated in my life luckily or unfortunately i came to be accepted as a boy my appearance was youthful and i suppose i had that pleading and homeless air that always draws the motherliness that is in women and the cursed theories and hobbies of pater familiases chloe called me tommy and made sisterly fun of my attempts to woo her with devoe she was vastly more reserved he was the man of romance one to stir her imagination and deepest feelings had her fancy leaned toward him i was closer to her but standing in no glamour i had the task before me of winning her in what seems to me the american way of fighting with cleanness and pluck and everyday devotion to break away the barriers of friendship that divided us and to take her if i could between sunrise and dark abetted by neither moonlight nor music nor foreign wiles chloe gave no sign of bestowing her blithe affections upon either of us but one day she let out to me an inkling of what she preferred in a man it was tremendously interesting to me but not illuminating as to its application i had been tormenting her for the dozenth time with the statement and catalogue of my sentiments toward her tommy said she i don t want a man to show his love for me by leading an army against another country and blowing people off the earth with cannons if you mean that the opposite way i answered as they say women do i ll see what i can do the papers are full of this diplomatic row in russia my people know some big people in washington who are right next to the army people and i could get an artillery commission and i m not that way interrupted chloe i mean what i say it isn t the big things that are done in the world tommy that count with a woman when the knights were riding abroad in their armor to slay dragons many a stay

like candied violets that i must not be talked to when i am looking at the moonlight shining on water and that i very very often long for dates stuffed with english walnuts frivolity i said with a frown any well trained servant would be equal to such details and he must remember went on chloe to remind me of what i want when i do not know myself what i want you re rising in the scale i said what you seem to need is a first class clairvoyant and if i say that i am dying to hear a beethoven sonata and stamp my foot when i say it he must know by that that what my soul craves is salted almonds and he will have them ready in his pocket now said i i am at a loss i do not know whether your soul s affinity is to be an impresario or a fancy grocer chole turned her pearly smile upon me take less than half of what i said as a jest she went on and don t think too lightly of the little things boy be a paladin if you must but don t let it show on you most women are only very big children and most men are only very little ones please us don t try to overpower us when we want a hero we can make one out of even a plain grocer the third time he catches our handkerchief before it falls to the ground that evening i was taken down with pernicious fever that is a kind of coast fever with improvements and high geared attachments your temperature goes up among the threes and fours

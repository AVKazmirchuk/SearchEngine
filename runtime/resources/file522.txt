name but to morrow would do that same day i started in on the course of iniquity that this uneventful city forced upon me i was in the town only two days but in that time i managed to lie shamelessly by telegraph and to be an accomplice after the fact if that is the correct legal term to a murder as i rounded the corner nearest my hotel the afrite coachman of the ploychromatic nonpareil coat seized me swung open the dungeony door of his peripatetic sarcophagus flirted his feather duster and began his ritual step right in boss carriage is clean jus got back from a funeral fifty cents to any and then he knew me and grinned broadly scuse me boss you is de gen l man what rid out with me dis mawnin thank you kindly suh i am going out to again to morrow afternoon at three said i and if you will be here i ll let you drive me so you know miss adair i concluded thinking of my dollar bill i belonged to her father judge adair suh he replied i judge that she is pretty poor i said she hasn t much money to speak of has she for an instant i looked again at the fierce countenance of king cettiwayo and then he changed back to an extortionate old negro hack driver she ain t gwine to starve suh he said slowly she has reso ces suh she has reso ces i shall pay you fifty cents for the trip said i dat is puffeckly correct suh he answered humbly i jus had to have dat two dollars dis mawnin boss i went to the hotel and lied by electricity i wired the magazine a adair holds out for eight cents a word the answer that came back was give it to her quick you duffer just before dinner major wentworth caswell bore down upon me with the greetings of a long lost friend i have seen few men whom i have so instantaneously hated and of whom it was so difficult to be rid i was standing at the bar when he invaded me therefore i could not wave the white ribbon in his face i would have paid gladly for the drinks hoping thereby to escape another but he was one of those despicable roaring advertising bibbers who must have brass bands and fireworks attend upon every cent that they waste in their follies with an air of producing millions he drew two one dollar bills from a pocket and dashed one of them upon the bar i looked once more at the dollar bill with the upper right hand corner missing torn through the middle and patched with a strip of blue tissue paper it was my dollar bill again it could have been no other i went up to my room the drizzle and the monotony of a dreary eventless southern town had made me tired and listless i remember that just before i went to bed i mentally disposed of the mysterious dollar bill which might have formed the clew to a tremendously fine detective story of san francisco by saying to myself sleepily seems as if a lot of people here own stock in the hack driver s trust pays dividends promptly too wonder if then i fell asleep king cettiwayo was at his post the next day and rattled my bones over the stones out to he was to wait and rattle me back again when i was ready azalea adair looked paler and cleaner and frailer than she had looked on the day before after she had signed the contract at eight cents per word she grew still paler and began to slip out of her chair whitout much trouble i managed to get her up on the antediluvian horsehair sofa and then i ran out to the sidewalk and yelled to the coffee colored pirate to bring a doctor with a wisdom that i had not expected in him he abandoned his team and struck off up the street afoot realizing the value of speed in ten minutes he returned with a grave gray haired and capable man of medicine in a few words worth much less than eight cents each i explained to him my presence in the hollow house of mystery he bowed with stately understanding and turned to the old negro uncle caesar he said calmly run up to my house and ask miss lucy to give you a cream pitcher full of fresh milk and half a tumbler of port wine and hurry back don t drive run i want you to get back sometime this week it occurred to me that dr merriman also felt a distrust as to the speeding powers of the land pirate s steeds after uncle caesar was gone lumberingly but swiftly up the street the doctor looked me over with great politeness and as much careful calculation until he had decided that i might do it is only a case of insufficient nutrition he said in other words the result of poverty pride and starvation mrs caswell has many devoted friends who would be glad to aid her but she will accept nothing except from that old negro uncle caesar who was once owned by her family mrs caswell said i in surprise and then i looked at the contract and saw that she had signed it azalea adair caswell i thought she was miss adair i said married to a drunken worthless loafer sir said the doctor it is said that he robs her even of the small sums that her old servant contributes toward her support when the milk and wine had been brought the doctor soon revived azalea adair she sat up and talked of the beauty of the autumn leaves that were then in season and their height of color she referred lightly to her fainting seizure

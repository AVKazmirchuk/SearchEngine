bum all right enough but dat other t ing don t go wit me burglary is no good i ll say good night and many t anks fer whistling dick had moved away a few steps as he spoke but he stopped very suddenly boston had covered him with a short revolver of roomy calibre take your seat said the tramp leader i d feel mighty proud of myself if i let you go and spoil the game you ll stick right in this camp

this thousand dollars i m going to get will fix me for fair i m going to drop the road and start a saloon in a little town i know about i m tired of being kicked around boston harry took from his pocket a cheap silver watch and held it near the fire it s a quarter to nine he said pete you and blinky start go down the road past the house and fire the cane in a dozen places then strike for the levee and come back on it instead of the road so you won t meet anybody by the time you get back the men will all be striking out for the fire and we ll break for the house and collar the dollars everybody cough up what matches he s got the two surly tramps made a collection of all the matches in the party whistling dick contributing his quota with propitiatory alacrity and then they departed in the dim starlight in the direction of the road of the three remaining vagrants two goggles and indiana tom reclined lazily upon convenient lumber and regarded whistling dick with undisguised disfavour boston observing that the dissenting recruit was disposed to remain peaceably relaxed a little of his vigilance whistling dick arose presently and strolled leisurely up and down keeping carefully within the territory assigned him dis planter chap he said pausing before boston harry w ot makes yer t ink he s got de tin in de house wit im i m advised of the facts in the case said boston he drove to noo orleans and got it i say to day want to change your mind now and come in naw i was just askin wot kind o team did de boss drive pair of grays double surrey yep women folks along wife and kid say what morning paper are you trying to pump news for i was just conversin to pass de time away i guess dat team passed me in de road dis evenin dat s all as whistling dick put his hands in his pockets and continued his curtailed beat up and down by the fire he felt the silk stocking he had picked up in the road ther bloomin little skeezicks he muttered with a grin as he walked up and down he could see through a sort of natural opening or lane among the trees the planter s residence some seventy five yards distant the side of the house toward him exhibited spacious well lighted windows through which a soft radiance streamed illuminating the broad veranda and some extent of the lawn beneath what s that you said asked boston sharply oh nuttin t all said whistling dick lounging carelessly and kicking meditatively at a little stone on the ground just as easy continued the warbling vagrant softly to himself an sociable an swell an sassy wit her mer ry chris mus wot d yer t ink now dinner two hours late was being served in the bellemeade plantation dining room the dining room and all its appurtenances spoke of an old regime that was here continued rather than suggested to the memory the plate was rich to the extent that its age and quaintness alone saved it from being showy there were interesting names signed in the corners of the pictures on the walls the viands were of the kind that bring a shine into the eyes of gourmets the service was swift silent lavish as in the days when the waiters were assets like the plate the names by which the planter s family and their visitors addressed one another were historic in the annals of two nations their manners and conversation had that most difficult kind of ease the kind that still preserves punctilio the planter himself seemed to be the dynamo that generated the larger portion of the gaiety and wit the younger ones at the board found it more than difficult to turn back on him his guns of raillery and banter it is true the young men attempted to storm his works repeatedly incited by the hope of gaining the approbation of their fair companions but even when they sped a well aimed shaft the planter forced them to feel defeat by the tremendous discomfiting thunder of the laughter with which he accompanied his retorts at the head of the table serene matronly benevolent reigned the mistress of the house placing here and there the right smile the right word the encouraging glance the talk of the party was too desultory too evanescent to follow but at last they came to the subject of the tramp nuisance one that had of late vexed the plantations for many miles around the planter seized the occasion to direct his good natured fire of raillery at the mistress accusing her of encouraging the plague they swarm up and down the river every winter he said they overrun new orleans and we catch the surplus which is generally the worst part and a day or two ago madame new orleans suddenly discovering that she can t go shopping without brushing her skirts against great rows of the vagabonds sunning themselves on the banquettes says to the police catch em all and the police catch a dozen or two and the remaining three or four thousand overflow up and down the levee and madame there pointing tragically with the carving knife at her feeds them they won t work they defy my overseers and they make friends with my dogs and you madame feed them before my eyes and intimidate me when i would interfere tell us please how many to day did you thus incite to future laziness and depredation six i think said madame with a reflective smile but you know two of them offered to work for you heard them yourself the planter s disconcerting laugh rang out again yes at their own trades and one was an artificial flower maker and the other a glass blower oh they were looking for work not a hand would they consent to lift to labour of any other kind and another one continued the soft hearted mistress used quite good language it was really extraordinary for one of his class and he carried a watch and had lived in boston i don t believe they are all bad they have always seemed to me to rather lack development i always look upon them as children with whom wisdom has remained at a standstill while whiskers have continued to grow we passed one this evening as we were driving home who had a face as good as it was incompetent he was whistling the intermezzo from cavalleria and blowing the spirit of mascagni himself into it a bright eyed young girl who sat at the left of the mistress leaned over and said in a confidential undertone i wonder mamma if that tramp we passed on the road found my stocking and do you think he will hang it up to night now i can hang up but one do you know why i wanted a new pair of silk stockings when i have plenty well old aunt judy says if you hang up two that have never been worn santa claus will fill one with good things and monsieur pambe will place in the other payment for all the words you have spoken good or bad on the day before christmas that s why i ve been unusually nice and polite to everyone to day monsieur pambe you know is a witch gentleman he the words of the young girl were interrupted by a startling thing like the wraith of some burned out shooting star a black streak came crashing through the window pane and upon the table where it shivered into fragments a dozen pieces of crystal and china ware and then glanced between the heads of the guests to the wall imprinting therein a deep round indentation at which to day the visitor to bellemeade marvels as he gazes upon it and listens to this tale as it is told the women screamed in many keys and the men sprang to their feet and would have laid their hands upon their swords had not the verities of chronology forbidden the planter was the first to act he sprang to the intruding missile and held it up to view by jupiter he cried a meteoric shower of hosiery has communication at last been established with mars i should say ahem venus ventured a young gentleman visitor looking hopefully for approbation toward the unresponsive young lady visitors the planter held at arm s length the unceremonious visitor a long dangling black stocking it s loaded he announced as he spoke he reversed the stocking holding it by the toe and down from it dropped a roundish stone wrapped about by a piece of yellowish paper now for the first interstellar message of the century he cried and nodding to the company who had crowded about him he adjusted his glasses with provoking deliberation and examined it closely when he finished he had changed from the jolly host to the practical decisive man of business he immediately struck a bell and said to the silent footed mulatto man who responded go and tell mr wesley to get reeves and maurice and about ten stout hands they can rely upon and come to the hall door at once tell him to have the men arm themselves and bring plenty of ropes and plough lines tell him to hurry and then he read aloud from the paper these words to the gent of de hous dere is five tuff hoboes xcept meself in the vaken lot near de road war de old brick piles is dey got me stuck up wid a gun see and i taken dis means of communication of der lads is gone down to set fire to de cain field below de hous and when yous fellers goes to turn de hoes on it de hole gang is goin to rob de hous of de money yoo gotto pay off wit say git a move on ye say de kid dropt dis sock on der rode tel her mery crismus de same as she told me ketch de bums down de rode first and den sen a relefe core to get me out of soke youres truly whistlen dick there was some quiet but rapid mavoeuvring at bellemeade during the ensuring half hour which ended in five disgusted and sullen tramps being captured and locked securely in an outhouse pending the coming of the morning and retribution for another result the visiting young gentlemen had secured the unqualified worship of the visiting young ladies by their distinguished and heroic conduct for still another behold whistling dick the hero seated at the planter s table feasting upon viands his experience had never before included and waited upon by admiring femininity in shapes of such beauty and swellness that even his ever full mouth could scarcely prevent him from whistling he was made to disclose in detail his adventure with the evil gang of boston harry and how he cunningly wrote the note and wrapped it around the stone and placed it at the toe of the stocking and watching his chance sent it silently with a wonderful centrifugal momentum like a comet at one of the big lighted windows of the dining room the planter vowed that the wanderer should wander no more that his was a goodness and an honesty that should be rewarded and that a debt of gratitude had been made that must be paid for had he not saved them from a doubtless imminent loss and maybe a greater calamity he assured whistling dick that he might consider himself a charge upon the honour of bellemeade that a position suited to his powers would be found for him at once and hinted that the way would be heartily smoothed for him to rise to as high places of emolument and trust as the plantation afforded but now they said he must be weary and the immediate thing to consider was rest and sleep so the mistress spoke to a servant and whistling dick was conducted to a room in the wing of the house occupied by the servants to this room in a few minutes was brought a portable tin bathtub filled with water which was placed on a piece of oiled cloth upon the floor there the vagrant was left to pass the night by the light of a candle he examined the room a bed with the covers neatly turned back revealed snowy pillows and sheets a worn but clean red carpet covered the floor there was a dresser with a beveled mirror a washstand with a flowered bowl and pitcher the two or three chairs were softly upholstered a little table held books papers and a day old cluster of roses in a jar there were towels on a rack and soap in a white dish whistling dick set his candle on a chair and placed his hat carefully under the table after satisfying what we must suppose to have been his curiosity by a sober scrutiny he removed his coat folded it and laid it upon the floor near the wall as far as possible from the unused bathtub taking his coat for a pillow he stretched himself luxuriously upon the carpet when on christmas morning the first streaks of dawn broke above the marshes whistling dick awoke and reached instinctively for his hat then he remembered that the skirts of fortune had swept him into their folds on the night previous and he went to the window and raised it to let the fresh breath of the morning cool his brow and fix the yet dream like memory of his good luck within his brain as he stood there certain dread and ominous sounds pierced the fearful hollow of his ear the force of plantation workers eager to complete the shortened task allotted to them were all astir the mighty din of the ogre labour shook the earth and the poor tattered and forever disguised prince in search of his fortune held tight to the window sill even in the enchanted castle and trembled already from the bosom of the mill came the thunder of rolling barrels of sugar and prison like sounds there was a great rattling of chains as the mules were harried with stimulant imprecations to their places by the waggon tongues a little vicious dummy engine with a train of flat cars in tow stewed and fumed on the plantation tap of the narrow gauge railroad and a toiling hurrying hallooing stream of workers were dimly seen in the half darkness loading the train with the weekly output of sugar here was a poem an epic nay a tragedy with work the curse of the world for its theme the december air was frosty but the sweat broke out upon whistling dick s face he thrust his head out of the window and looked down fifteen feet below him against the wall of the house he could make out that a border of flowers grew and by that token he overhung a bed of soft earth softly as a burglar goes he clambered out upon the sill lowered himself until he hung by his hands alone and then dropped safely no one seemed to be about upon this side of the house he dodged low and skimmed swiftly across the yard to the low fence it was an easy matter to vault this for a terror urged him such as lifts the gazelle over the thorn bush when the lion pursues a crash through the dew drenched weeds on the roadside a clutching slippery rush up the grassy side of the levee to the footpath at the summit and he was free the east was blushing and brightening the wind himself a vagrant rover saluted his brother upon the cheek some wild geese high above gave cry a rabbit skipped along the path before him free to turn to the right or to the left as his mood should send him the river slid past and certainly no one could tell the ultimate abiding place of its waters a small ruffled brown breasted bird sitting upon a dog wood sapling began a soft throaty tender little piping in praise of the dew which entices foolish worms from their holes but suddenly he stopped and sat with his head turned sidewise listening from the path along the levee there burst forth a jubilant stirring buoyant thrilling whistle loud and keen and clear as the cleanest notes of the piccolo the soaring sound rippled and trilled and arpeggioed as the songs of wild birds do not but it had a wild free grace that in a way reminded the small brown bird of something familiar but exactly what he could not tell there was in it the bird call or reveille that all birds know but a great waste of lavish unmeaning things that art had added and arranged besides and that were quite puzzling and strange and the little brown bird sat with his head on one side until the sound died away in the distance the little bird did not know that the part of that strange warbling that he understood was just what kept the warbler without his breakfast but he knew very well that the part he did not understand did not concern him so he gave a little flutter of his wings and swooped down like a brown bullet upon a big fat worm that was wriggling along the levee path the halberdier of the little rheinschloss i go sometimes into the bierhalle and restaurant called old munich not long ago it was a resort of interesting bohemians but now only artists and musicians and literary folk frequent it but the pilsner is yet good and i take some diversion from the conversation of waiter no for many years the customers of old munich have accepted the place as a faithful copy from the ancient german town the big hall with its smoky rafters rows of imported steins portrait of goethe and verses painted on the walls translated into german from the original of the cincinnati poets seems atmospherically correct when viewed through the bottom of a glass but not long ago the proprietors added the room above called it the little rheinschloss and built in a stairway up there was an imitation stone parapet ivy covered and the walls were painted to represent depth and distance with the rhine winding at the base of the vineyarded slopes and the castle of ehrenbreitstein looming directly opposite the entrance of course there were tables and chairs and you could have beer and food brought you as you naturally would on the top of a castle on the rhine i went into old munich one afternoon when there were few customers and sat at my usual table near the stairway i was shocked and almost displeased to perceive that the glass cigar case by the orchestra stand had been smashed to smithereens i did not like things to happen in old munich nothing had ever happened there before waiter no came and breathed on my neck i was his by right of discovery eighteen s brain was built like a corral it was full of ideas which when he opened the gate came huddling out like a flock of sheep that might get together afterward or might not i did not shine as a shepherd as a type eighteen fitted nowhere i did not find out if he had a nationality family creed grievance hobby soul preference home or vote he only came always to my table and as long as his leisure would permit let words flutter from him like swallows leaving a barn at daylight how did the cigar case come to be broken eighteen i asked with a certain feeling of personal grievance i can tell you about that sir said he resting his foot on the chair next to mine did you ever have anybody hand you a double handful of good luck while both your hands were full of bad luck and stop to notice how your fingers behaved no riddles eighteen said i leave out palmistry and manicuring you remember said eighteen the guy in the hammered brass prince albert and the oroide gold pants and the amalgamated copper hat that carried the combination meat axe ice pick and liberty pole and used to stand on the first landing as you go up to the little rindslosh why yes said i the halberdier i never noticed him particularly i remember he thought he was only a suit of armour he had a perfect poise he had more than that said eighteen he was me friend he was an advertisement the boss hired him to stand on the stairs for a kind of scenery to show there was something doing in the has been line upstairs what did you call him a what kind of beer a halberdier said i that was an ancient man at arms of many hundred years ago some mistake said eighteen this one wasn t that old he wasn t over twenty three or four it was the boss s idea rigging a man up in an ante bellum suit of tinware and standing him on the landing of the slosh he bought the goods at a fourth avenue antique store and hung a sign out able bodied hal halberdier wanted costume furnished the same morning a young man with wrecked good clothes and a hungry look comes in bringing the sign with him i was filling the mustard pots at my station i m it says he whatever it is but i never halberdiered in a restaurant put me on is it a masquerade i hear talk in the kitchen of a fishball says i bully for you eighteen says he you and i ll get on show me the boss s desk well the boss tries the harveyized pajamas on him and they fitted him like the scales on a baked redsnapper and he gets the job you ve seen what it is he stood straight up in the corner of the first landing with his halberd to his shoulder looking right ahead and guarding the portugals of the castle the boss is nutty about having the true old world flavour to his joint halberdiers goes with rindsloshes says he just as rats goes with rathskellers and white cotton stockings with tyrolean villages the boss is a kind of a antiologist and is all posted up on data and such information from p m to two in the morning was the halberdier s hours he got two meals with us help and a dollar an night i eat with him at the table he liked me he never told his name he was travelling impromptu like kings i guess the first time at supper i says to him have some more of the spuds mr frelinghuysen oh don t be so formal and offish eighteen says he call me hal that s short for halberdier oh don t think i wanted to pry for names says i i know all about the dizzy fall from wealth and greatness we ve got a count washing dishes in the kitchen and the third bartender used to be a pullman conductor and they work sir percival says i sarcastic eighteen says he as a friendly devil in a cabbage scented hell would you mind cutting up this piece of steak for me i don t say that it s got more muscle than i have but and then he shows me the insides of his hands they was blistered and cut and corned and swelled up till they looked like a couple of flank steaks criss crossed with a knife the kind the butchers hide and take home knowing what is the best shoveling coal says he and piling bricks and loading drays but they gave out and i had to resign i was born for a halberdier and i ve been educated for twenty four years to fill the position now quit knocking my profession and pass along a lot more of that ham i m holding the closing exercises says he of a forty eight hour fast the second night he was on the job he walks down from his corner to the cigar case and calls for cigarettes the customers at the tables all snicker out loud to show their acquaintance with history the boss is on an let s see oh yes an anachronism says the boss cigarettes was not made at the time when halberdiers was invented the ones you sell was says sir percival caporal wins from chronology by the length of a cork tip so he gets em and lights one and puts the box in his brass helmet and goes back to patroling the rindslosh he made a big hit specially with the ladies some of em would poke him with their fingers to see if he was real or only a kind of a stuffed figure like they burn in elegy and when he d move they d squeak and make eyes at him as they went up to the slosh he looked fine in his halberdashery he slept at a week in a hall room on third avenue he invited me up there one night he had a little book on the washstand that he read instead of shopping in the saloons after hours i m on to that says i from reading about it in novels all the heroes on the bum carry the little book it s either tantalus or liver or horace and its printed in latin and you re a college man and i wouldn t be surprised says i if you wasn t educated too but it was only the batting averages of the league for the last ten years one night about half past eleven there comes in a party of these high rollers that are always hunting up new places to eat in and poke fun at there was a swell girl in a h p auto tan coat and veil and a fat old man with white side whiskers and a young chap that couldn t keep his feet off the tail of the girl s coat and an oldish lady that looked upon life as immoral and unnecessary how perfectly delightful they says to sup in a slosh up the stairs they go and in half a minute back down comes the girl her skirts swishing like the waves on the beach she stops on the landing and looks our halberdier in the eye you she says with a smile that reminded me of lemon sherbet i was waiting up stairs in the slosh then and i was right down here by the door putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle of tabasco and i heard all they said it says sir percival without moving i m only local colour are my hauberk helmet and halberd on straight is there an explanation to this says she is it a practical joke such as men play in those griddle cake and lamb clubs i m afraid i don t see the point i heard vaguely that you were away for three months i we have not seen you or heard from you i m halberdiering for my living says the stature i m working says he i don t suppose you know what work means have you have you lost your money she asks sir percival studies a minute i am poorer says he than the poorest sandwich man on the streets if i don t earn my living you call this work says she i thought a man worked with his hands or his head instead of becoming a mountebank the calling of a halberdier says he is an ancient and honourable one sometimes says he the man at arms at the door has saved the castle while the plumed knights were cake walking in the banquet halls above i see you re not ashamed says she of your peculiar tastes i wonder though that the manhood i used to think i saw in you didn t prompt you to draw water or hew wood instead of publicly flaunting your ignominy in this disgraceful masquerade sir percival kind of rattles his armour and says helen will you suspend sentence in this matter for just a little while you don t understand says he i ve got to hold this job down a little longer you like being a harlequin or halberdier as you call it says she i wouldn t get thrown of the job just now says he with a grin to be appointed minister to the court of st james s and then the h p girl s eyes sparked as hard as diamonds very well says she you shall have full run of your serving man s tastes this night and she swims over to the boss s desk and gives him a smile that knocks the specks off his nose i think your rindslosh says she is as beautiful as a dream it is a little slice of the old world set down in new york we shall have a nice supper up there but if you will grant us one favour the illusion will be perfect give us your halberdier to wait on our table that hits the boss s antiology hobby just right sure says he dot vill be fine und der orchestra shall blay die wacht am rhein all der time and he goes over and tells the halberdier to go upstairs and hustle the grub at the swells table i m on the job says sir percival taking off his helmet and hanging it on his halberd and leaning em in the corner the girl goes up and takes her seat and i see her jaw squared tight under her smile we re going to be waited on by a real halberdier says she one who is proud of his profession isn t it sweet ripping says the swell young man much prefer a waiter says the fat old gent i hope he doesn t come from a cheap museum says the old lady he might have microbes in his costume before he goes to the table sir percival takes me by the arm eighteen he says i ve got to pull off this job without a blunder you coach me straight or i ll take that halberd and make hash out of you and then he goes up to the table with his coat of mail on and a napkin over his arm and waits for the order why it s deering says the young swell hello old man what the beg pardon sir interrupts the halberdier i m waiting on the table the old man looks at him grim like a boston bull so deering he says you re at work yet yes sir says sir percival quiet and gentlemanly as i could have been myself for almost three months now you haven t been discharged during the time asks the old man not once sir says he though i ve had to change my work several times waiter orders the girl short and sharp another napkin he brings her one respectful i never saw more devil if i may say it stirred up in a lady there was two bright red spots on her cheeks and her eyes looked exactly like a wildcat s i d seen in the zoo her foot kept slapping the floor all the time waiter she orders bring me filtered water without ice bring me a footstool take away this empty salt cellar she kept him on the jump she was sure giving the halberdier his there wasn t but a few customers up in the slosh at that time so i hung out near the door so i could help sir percival serve he got along fine with the olives and celery and the bluepoints they was easy and then the consomme came up the dumb waiter all in one big silver tureen instead of serving it from the side table he picks it up between his hands and starts to the dining table with it when nearly there he drops the tureen smash on the floor and the soup soaks all the lower part of that girl s swell silk dress stupid incompetent says she giving him a look standing in a corner with a halberd seems to be your mission in life pardon me lady says he it was just a little bit hotter than blazes i couldn t help it the old man pulls out a memorandum book and hunts in it the th of april deering says he i know it says sir percival and ten minutes to twelve o clock says the old man by jupiter you haven t won yet and he pounds the table with his fist and yells to me waiter call the manager at once tell him to hurry here as fast as he can i go after the boss and old brockmann hikes up to the slosh on the jump i want this man discharged at once roads the old guy look what he s done ruined my daughter s dress it cost at least discharge this awkward lout at once or i ll sue you for the price of it dis is bad pizness says the boss six hundred dollars is much i reckon i vill haf to wait a minute herr brockmann says sir percival easy and smiling but he was worked up under his tin suitings i could see that and then he made the finest neatest little speech i ever listened to i can t give you the words of course he give the millionaires a lovely roast in a sarcastic way describing their automobiles and opera boxes and diamonds and then he got around to the working classes and the kind of grub they eat and the long hours they work and all that sort of stuff bunkum of course the restless rich says he never content with their luxuries always prowling among the haunts of the poor and humble amusing themselves with the imperfections and misfortunes of their fellow men and women and even here herr brockmann he says in this beautiful rindslosh a grand and enlightening reproduction of old world history and architecture they come to disturb its symmetry and picturesqueness by demanding in their arrogance that the halberdier of the castle wait upon their table i have faithfuly and conscientiously says he performed my duties as a halberdier i know nothing of a waiter s duties it was the insolent whim of these transient pampered aristocrats that i should be detailed to serve them food must i be blamed must i be deprived of the means of a livelihood he goes on on account of an accident that was the result of their own presumption and haughtiness but what hurts me more than all says sir percival is the desecration that has been done to this splendid rindslosh the confiscation of its halberdier to serve menially at the banquet board even i could see that this stuff was piffle but it caught the boss mein gott says he you vas right ein halberdier have not got der right to dish up soup him i vill not discharge have anoder waiter if you like und let mein halberdier go back und stand mit his halberd but gentlemen he says pointing to the old man you go ahead and sue mit der dress sue me for or i stand der suit and the boss puffs off down stairs old brockmann was an all right dutchman just then the clock strikes twelve and the old guy laughs loud you win deering says he and let me explain to all he goes on some time ago mr deering asked me for something that i did not want to give him i looks at the girl and she turns as red as a pickled beet i told him says the old guy if he would earn his own living for three months without being discharged for incompetence i would give him what he wanted it seems that the time was up at twelve o clock to night i came near fetching you though deering on that soup question says the old boy standing up and grabbing sir percival s hand the halberdier lets out a yell and jumps three feet high look out for those hands says he and he holds em up you never saw such hands except on a labourer in a limestone quarry heavens boy says old side whiskers what have you been doing to em oh says sir percival little chores like hauling coal and excavating rock till they went back on me and when i couldn t hold a pick or a whip i took up halberdiering to give em a rest tureens full of hot soup don t seem to be a particularly soothing treatment i would have bet on that girl that high tempered kind always go as far the other way according to my experience she whizzes round the table like a cyclone and catches both his hands in hers poor hands dear hands she sings out and sheds tears on em and holds em close to her bosom well sir with all that rindslosh scenery it was just like a play and the halberdier sits down at the table at the girl s side and i served the rest of the supper and that was about all except that when they left he shed his hardware store and went with em i dislike to be side tracked from an original proposition but you haven t told me eighteen said i how the cigar case came to be broken oh that was last night said eighteen sir percival and the girl drove up in a cream coloured motor car and had dinner in the rindslosh the same table billy i heard her say as they went up i waited on em we ve got a new halberdier now a bow legged guy with a face like a sheep as they came down stairs sir percival passes him a ten case note the new halberdier drops his halberd and it falls on the cigar case that s how that happened two renegades in the gate city of the south the confederate veterans were reuniting and i stood to see them march beneath the tangled flags of the great conflict to the hall of their oratory and commemoration while the irregular and halting line was passing i made onslaught upon it and dragged from the ranks my friend barnard o keefe who had no right to be there for he was a northerner born and bred and what should he be doing halloing for the stars and bars among those gray and moribund veterans and why should he be trudging with his shining martial humorous broad face among those warriors of a previous and alien generation i say i dragged him forth and held him till the last hickory leg and waving goatee had stumbled past and then i hustled him out of the crowd into a cool interior for the gate city was stirred that day and the hand organs wisely eliminated marching through georgia from their repertories now what deviltry are you up to i asked of o keefe when there were a table and things in glasses between us o keefe wiped his heated face and instigated a commotion among the floating ice in his glass before he chose to answer i am assisting at the wake said he of the only nation on earth that ever did me a good turn as one gentleman to another i am ratifying and celebrating the foreign policy of the late jefferson davis as fine a statesman as ever settled the financial question of a country equal ratio that was his platform a barrel of money for a barrel of flour a pair of bills for a pair of boots a hatful of currency for a new hat say ain t that simple compared with w j b s little old oxidized plank what talk is this i asked your financial digression is merely a subterfuge why were you marching in the ranks of the confederate veterans because my lad answered o keefe the confederate government in its might and power interposed to protect and defend barnard o keefe against immediate and dangerous assassination at the hands of a blood thirsty foreign country after the unites states of america had overruled his appeal for protection and had instructed private secretary cortelyou to reduce his estimate of the republican majority for by one vote come barney said i the confederate states of america has been out of existence nearly forty years you do not look older yourself when was it that the deceased government exerted its foreign policy in your behalf four months ago said o keefe promptly the infamous foreign power i alluded to is still staggering from the official blow dealt it by mr davis s contraband aggregation of states that s why you see me cake walking with the ex rebs to the illegitimate tune about simmon seeds and cotton i vote for the great father in washington but i am not going back on mars jeff you say the confederacy has been dead forty years well if it hadn t been for it i d have been breathing to day with soul so dead i couldn t have whispered a single cuss word about my native land the o keefes are not overburdened with ingratitude i must have looked bewildered the war was over i said vacantly in o keefe laughed loudly scattering my thoughts ask old doc millikin if the war is over he shouted hugely diverted oh no doc hasn t surrendered yet and the confederate states well i just told you they bucked officially and solidly and nationally against a foreign government four months ago and kept me from being shot old jeff s country stepped in and brought me off under its wing while roosevelt was having a gunboat repainted and waiting for the national campaign committee to look up whether i had ever scratched the ticket isn t there a story in this barney i asked no said o keefe but i ll give you the facts you know i went down to panama when this irritation about a canal began i thought i d get in on the ground floor i did and had to sleep on it and drink water with little zoos in it so of course i got the chagres fever that was in a little town called san juan on the coast after i got the fever hard enough to kill a port au prince nigger i had a relapse in the shape of doc millikin there was a doctor to attend a sick man if doc millikin had your case he made the terrors of death seem like an invitation to a donkey party he had the bedside manners of a piute medicine man and the soothing presence of a dray loaded with iron bridge girders when he laid his hand on your fevered brow you felt like cap john smith just before pocahontas went his bail well this old medical outrage floated down to my shack when i sent for him he was build like a shad and his eyebrows was black and his white whiskers trickled down from his chin like milk coming out of a sprinkling pot he had a nigger boy along carrying an old tomato can full of calomel and a saw doc felt my pulse and then he began to mess up some calomel with an agricultural implement that belonged to the trowel class i don t want any death mask made yet doc i says nor my liver put in a plaster of paris cast i m sick and it s medicine i need not frescoing you re a blame yankee ain t you asked doc going on mixing up his portland cement i m from the north says i but i m a plain man and don t care for mural decorations when you get the isthmus all asphalted over with that boll weevil prescription would you mind giving me a dose of pain killer or a little strychnine on toast to ease up this feeling of unhealthiness that i have got they was all sassy just like you says old doc but we lowered their temperature considerable yes sir i reckon we sent a good many of ye over to old mortuis nisi bonum look at antietam and bull run and seven pines and around nashville there never was a battle where we didn t lick ye unless you was ten to our one i knew you were a blame yankee the minute i laid eyes on you don t reopen the chasm doc i begs him any yankeeness i may have is geographical and as far as i am concerned a southerner is as good as a filipino any day i m feeling to bad too argue let s have secession without misrepresentation if you say so but what i need is more laudanum and less lundy s lane if you re mixing that compound gefloxide of gefloxicum for me please fill my ears with it before you get around to the battle of gettysburg for there is a subject full of talk by this time doc millikin had thrown up a line of fortifications on square pieces of paper and he says to me yank take one of these powders every two hours they won t kill you i ll be around again about sundown to see if you re alive old doc s powders knocked the chagres i stayed in san juan and got to knowing him better he was from mississippi and the red hottest southerner that ever smelled mint he made stonewall jackson and r e lee look like abolitionists he had a family somewhere down near yazoo city but he stayed away from the states on account of an uncontrollable liking he had for the absence of a yankee government him and me got as thick personally as the emperor of russia and the dove of peace but sectionally we didn t amalgamate twas a beautiful system of medical practice introduced by old doc into that isthmus of land he d take that bracket saw and the mild chloride and his hypodermic and treat anything from yellow fever to a personal friend besides his other liabilities doc could play a flute for a minute or two he was guilty of two tunes dixie and another one that was mighty close to the suwanee river you might say one of its tributaries he used to come down and sit with me while i was getting well and aggrieve his flute and say unreconstructed things about the north you d have thought that the smoke from the first gun at fort sumter was still floating around in the air you know that was about the time they staged them property revolutions down there that wound up in the fifth act with the thrilling canal scene where uncle sam has nine curtain calls holding miss panama by the hand while the bloodhounds keep senator morgan treed up in a cocoanut palm that s the way it wound up but at first it seemed as if colombia was going to make panama look like one of the kind with dents made in it in the factory like they wear at north beach fish fries for mine i played the straw hat crowd to win and they gave me a colonel s commission over a brigade of twenty seven men in the left wing and second joint of the insurgent army the colombian troops were awfully rude to us one day when i had my brigade in a sandy spot with its shoes off doing a battalion drill by squads the government army rushed from behind a bush at us acting as noisy and disagreeable as they could my troops enfiladed left faced and left the spot after enticing the enemy for three miles or so we struck a brier patch and had to sit down when we were ordered to throw up our toes and surrender we obeyed five of my best staff officers fell suffering extremely with stone bruised heels then and there those colombians took your friend barney sir stripped him of the insignia of his rank consisting of a pair of brass knuckles and a canteen of rum and dragged him before a military court the presiding general went through the usual legal formalities that sometimes cause a case to hang on the calendar of a south american military court as long as ten minutes he asked me my age and then sentenced me to be shot they woke up the court interpreter an american named jenks who was in the rum business and vice versa and told him to translate the verdict jenks stretched himself and took a morphine tablet you ve got to back up against th dobe old man says he to me three weeks i believe you get haven t got a chew of fine cut on you have you translate that again with foot notes and a glossary says i i don t know whether i m discharged condemned or handed over to the gerry society oh says jenks don t you understand you re to be stood up against a dobe wall and shot in two or three weeks three i think they said would you mind asking em which says i a week don t amount to much after you re dead but it seems a real nice long spell while you are alive it s two weeks says the interpreter after inquiring in spanish of the court shall i ask em again let be says i let s have a stationary verdict if i keep on appealing this way they ll have me shot about ten days before i was captured no i haven t got any fine cut they sends me over to the calaboza with a detachment of coloured postal telegraph boys carrying enfield rifles and i am locked up in a kind of brick bakery the temperature in there was just about the kind mentioned in the cooking recipes that call for a quick oven then i gives a silver dollar to one of the guards to send for the united states consul he comes around in pajamas with a pair of glasses on his nose and a dozen or two inside of him i m to be shot in two weeks says i and although i ve made a memorandum of it i don t seem to get it off my mind you want to call up uncle sam on the cable as quick as you can and get him all worked up about it have em send the kentucky and the kearsage and the oregon down right away that ll be about enough battleships but it wouldn t hurt to have a couple of cruisers and a torpedo boat destroyer too and say if dewey isn t busy better have him come along on the fastest one of the fleet now see here o keefe says the consul getting the best of a hiccup what do you want to bother the state department about this matter for didn t you hear me says i i m to be shot in two weeks did you think i said i was going to a lawn party and it wouldn t hurt of roosevelt could get the japs to send down the yellowyamtiskookum or the ogotosingsing or some other first class cruisers to help it would make me feel safer now what you want says the consul is not to get excited i ll send you over some chewing tobacco and some banana fritters when i go back the united states can t interfere in this you know you were caught insurging against the government and you re subject to the laws of this country to tell the truth i ve had an intimation from the state department unofficially of course that whenever a soldier of fortune demands a fleet of gunboats in a case of revolutionary katzenjammer i should cut the cable give him all the tobacco he wants and after he s shot take his clothes if they fit me for part payment of my salary consul says i to him this is a serious question you are representing uncle sam this ain t any little international tomfoolery like a universal peace congress or the christening of the shamrock iv i m an american citizen and i demand protection i demand the mosquito fleet and schley and the atlantic squadron and bob evans and general e byrd grubb and two or three protocols what are you going to do about it nothing doing says the consul be off with you then says i out of patience with him and send me doc millikin ask doc to come and see me doc comes and looks through the bars at me surrounded by dirty soldiers with even my shoes and canteen confiscated and he looks mightily pleased hello yank says he getting a little taste of johnson s island now ain t ye doc says i i ve just had an interview with the u s consul i gather from his remarks that i might just as well have been caught selling suspenders in kishineff under the name of rosenstein as to be in my present condition it seems that the only maritime aid i am to receive from the united states is some navy plug to chew doc says i can t you suspend hostility on the slavery question long enough to do something for me it ain t been my habit doc millikin answers to do any painless dentistry when i find a yank cutting an eye tooth so the stars and stripes ain t lending any marines to shell the huts of the colombian cannibals hey oh say can you see by the dawn s early light the star spangled banner has fluked in the fight what s the matter with the war department hey it s a great thing to be a citizen of a gold standard nation ain t it rub it in doc all you want says i i guess we re weak on foreign policy for a yank says doc putting on his specs and talking more mild you ain t so bad if you had come from below the line i reckon i would have liked you right smart now since your country has gone back on you you have to come to the old doctor whose cotton you burned and whose mules who stole and whose niggers you freed to help you ain t that so yank it is says i heartily and let s have a diagnosis of the case right away for in two weeks time all you can do is to hold an autopsy and i don t want to be amputated if i can help it now says doc business like it s easy enough for you to get out of this scrape money ll do it you ve got to pay a long string of em from general pomposo down to this anthropoid ape guarding your door about will do the trick have you got the money me says i i ve got one chili dollar two real pieces and a medio then if you ve any last words utter em says that old reb the roster of your financial budget sounds quite much to be like the noise of a requiem change the treatment says i i admit that i m short call a consultation or use radium or smuggle me in some saws or something yank says doc millikin i ve a good notion to help you there s only one government in the world that can get you out of this difficulty and that s the confederate states of america the grandest nation that ever existed just as you said to me i says to doc why the confederacy ain t a nation it s been absolved forty years ago that s a campaign lie says doc she s running along as solid as the roman empire she s the only hope you ve got now you being a yank have got to go through with some preliminary obsequies before you can

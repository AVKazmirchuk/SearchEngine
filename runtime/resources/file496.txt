babel whence these polyglot idlers had been called by the winged walking delegate of the lord standing on a pine box a head higher than his flock of goats the preacher exhorted whatever transient and shifting audience the north wind doled out to him it was a slave market fifteen cents bought you a man you deeded him to morpheus and the recording angel gave you credit the preacher was incredibly earnest and unwearied he had looked over the list of things one may do for one s fellow man and had assumed for himself the task of putting to bed all who might apply at his soap box on the nights of wednesday and sunday that left but five nights for other philanthropists to handle and had they done their part as well this wicked city might have become a vast arcadian dormitory where all might snooze and snore the happy hours away letting problem plays and the rent man and business go to the deuce the hour of eight was but a little while past sightseers in a small dark mass of pay ore were gathered in the shadow of general worth s monument now and then shyly ostentatiously carelessly or with conscientious exactness one would step forward and bestow upon the preacher small bills or

it is worthy of being stenciled on all the white ribbons in the world no man ever learned to be a drunkard on five cent whisky think of it tippler it covers the ground from the sprouting rye to the potter s field a clean profiled erect young man in the rear rank of the bedless emulated the terrapin drawing his head far down into the shell of his coat collar it was a well cut tweed coat and the

straits to peruse no further the young man was no other than thomas mcquade ex coachman discharged for drunkenness one month before and now reduced to the grimy ranks of the one night bed seekers if you live in smaller new york you must know the van smuythe family carriage drawn by the two pound to shot bays the carriage is shaped like a bath tub in each end of it reclines an old lady van smuythe holding a black sunshade the size of a new year s eve feather tickler before his downfall thomas mcquade drove the van smuythe bays and was himself driven by annie the van smuythe lady s maid but it is one of the saddest things about romance that a tight shoe or an empty commissary or an aching tooth will make a temporary heretic of any cupid worshiper and thomas s physical troubles were not few therefore his soul was less vexed with thoughts of his lost lady s maid than it was by the fancied presence of certain non existent things that his racked nerves almost convinced him were flying dancing crawling and wriggling on the asphalt and in the air above and around the dismal campus of the bed line army nearly four weeks of straight whisky and a diet limited to crackers bologna and pickles often guarantees a psycho zoological sequel thus desperate freezing angry beset by phantoms as he was he felt the need of human sympathy and intercourse the bed liner standing at his right was a young man of about his own age shabby but neat what s the diagnosis of your case freddy asked thomas with the freemasonic familiarity of the damned booze that s mine you don t look like a panhandler

this bed bargain counter rummage sale the other young man seemed to welcome the advances of the airy ex coachman no said he mine isn t exactly a case of drink unless we allow that cupid is a bartender i married unwisely according to the opinion of my unforgiving relatives i ve been out of work for a year because i don t know how to work and i ve been sick in bellevue and other hospitals for months my wife and kid had to go back to her mother i was turned out of the hospital yesterday and i haven t a cent that s my tale of woe tough luck said thomas a man alone can pull through all right but i hate to see the women and kids get the worst of it just then there hummed up fifth avenue a motor car so splendid so red so smoothly running so craftily demolishing the speed regulations that it drew the attention even of the listless bed liners suspended and pinioned on its left side was an extra tire when opposite the unfortunate company the fastenings of this tire became loosed it fell to the asphalt bounded and rolled rapidly in the wake of the flying car thomas mcquade scenting an opportunity darted from his place among the preacher s goats in thirty seconds he had caught the rolling

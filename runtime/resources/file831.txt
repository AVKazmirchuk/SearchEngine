follow never a day would pass but she would be reminded of her sacrifice i would read a condescension in her smile a pity even in her affection that would madden me no the thing would stand between us forever only equals should mate i could never ask her to come down upon my lower plane an arc light faintly shone upon lorison s face an illumination from within also pervaded it the girl saw the rapt ascetic look it was the face either of sir galahad or sir fool quite starlike she said is this unapproachable angel really too high to be grasped by me yes she faced him suddenly my dear friend would you prefer your star fallen lorison made a wide gesture you push me to the bald fact he declared you are not in sympathy with my argument but i will answer you so if i could reach my particular star to drag it down i would not do it but if it were fallen i would pick it up and thank heaven for the privilege they were silent for some minutes norah shivered and thrust her hands deep into the pockets of her jacket lorison uttered a remorseful exclamation i m not cold she said i was just thinking i ought to tell you something you have selected a strange confidante but you cannot expect a chance acquain ance picked up in a doubtful restaurant to be an angel norah cried lorison let me go on you have told me about yourself we have been such good friends i must tell you now what i never wanted you to know i am worse than you are i was on the stage i sang in the chorus i was pretty bad i guess i stole diamonds from the prima donna they arrested me i gave most of them up and they let me go i drank wine every night a great deal i was very wicked but lorison knelt quickly by her side and took her hands dear norah he said exultantly it is you it is you i love you never guessed it did you tis you i meant all the time now i can speak let me make you forget the past we have both suffered let us shut out the world and live for each other norah do you hear me say i love you in spite of rather say because of it you have come out of your past noble and good your heart is an angel s give it to me a little while ago you feared the future too much to even speak but for you not for myself can you love me she cast herself wildly sobbing upon his breast better than life than truth itself than every thing and my own past said lorison with a note of solicitude can you forgive and i answered you that she whispered when i told you i loved you she leaned away and looked thought fully at him if i had not told you about myself would you have would you no he interrupted i would never have let you know i loved you i would never have asked you this norah will you be my wife she wept again oh believe me i am good now i am no longer wicked i will be the best wife in the world don t think i am bad any more if you do i shall die i shall die while he was consoling her she brightened up eager and impetuous will vou marry me to night she said will you prove it that way i have a reason for wishing it to be to night will you of one of two things was this exceeding frankness the outcome either of importunate brazenness or of utter innocence the lover s perspective contained only the one the sooner said lorison the happier i shall be what is there to do she asked what do you have to get come you should know her energy stirred the dreamer to action a city directory first he cried gayly to find where the man lives who gives licenses to happiness we will go together and rout him out cabs cars policemen telephones and ministers shall aid us father rogan shall marry us said the girl with ardour i will take you to him an hour later the two stood at the open doorway of an immense gloomy brick building in a narrow and lonely street the license was tight in norah s hand wait here a moment she said till i find father rogan she plunged into the black hallway and the lover was left standing as it were on one leg outside his impa tience was not greatly taxed gazing curiously into what seemed the hallway to erebus he was presently reassured by a stream of light that bisected the darkness far down the passage then he heard her call and fluttered lampward like the moth she beckoned him through a doorway into the room whence emanated the light the room was bare of nearly everything except books which had subjugated all its space here and there little spots of

a religious order his eye denoted an acquaintance with the perspective father rogan said norah this is he the two of ye said father rogan want to get married they did not deny it he married them the

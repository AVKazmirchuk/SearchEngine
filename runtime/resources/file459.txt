possessed youths whose fingernails were always irreproachably and clothes seams reproachfully shiny their conversation was in sentences so short that they made kipling s seem as long as court citations having the temperament they did no work any afternoon you could find them on eighth avenue either in front of spinelli s barber shop mike dugan s place or the limerick hotel rubbing their forefinger nails with dingy silk handkerchiefs at any time if you had happened to be standing undecisive near a pool table and cliff and mac had casually as it were drawn near mentioning something disinterestedly about a game well indeed would it have been for you had you gone your way unresponsive which assertion carefully considered is a study in tense punctuation and advice to strangers of

of brotherhood or the enjoining obligations of the matrimonial yoke you can bestow upon a cousin almost the interest and affection that you would give to a stranger you need not feel toward him the contempt and embarrassment that you have for one of your father s sons it is the closer clan feeling that sometimes makes the branch of a tree stronger than its trunk thus were the two mcgowans bonded they enjoyed a quiet celebrity in their district which was a strip west of eighth avenue with the pump for its pivot their talents were praised in a hundred joints their friendship was famed even in a neighborhood where men had been known to fight off the wives of their friends when domestic onslaught was being made upon their friends by the wives of their friends thus do the limitations of english

one night at about eleven o clock del delano dropped into mike s place on eighth avenue from that moment instead of remaining a place the cafe became a resort it was as though king edward had condescended to mingle with ten spots of a different suit or joe gans had casually strolled in to look over the tuskegee school or mr shaw of england had accepted an invitation to read selections from rena the snow bird at an unveiling of the proposed monument to james owen o connor at chinquapin falls mississippi in spite of these comparisons you will have to be told why the patronizing of a third rate saloon on the west side by the said del delano conferred such a specific honor upon the place del delano could not make his feet behave and so the world paid him a week to see them misconduct themselves on the vaudeville stage to make the matter plain to you and to swell the number of words he was the best fancy dancer on any of the circuits between ottawa and corpus christi with his eyes fixed on vacancy and his feet apparently fixed on nothing he nightly charmed thousands as his press agent incorrectly stated even taking night performance and matinee together he scarcely could have charmed more than eighteen hundred including those who left after zora the nautch girl had squeezed herself through a hoop twelve inches in diameter and those who were waiting for the moving pictures

to engage del delano for a three weeks trial engagement fused with a trained dog short circuit covering the three washingtons heights statue and square by the time this story was read and accepted del delano was drawing his three hundred dollars a week which divided by seven sunday acts not in costume being permissible dispels the delusion entertained by most of us that we have seen better days you can easily imagine the worshipful agitation of eighth avenue whenever del delano honored it with a visit after his terpsichorean act in a historically great and vilely ventilated broadway theatre if

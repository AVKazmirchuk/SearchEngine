train stopped at san rosario on time at a m a man with a thick black leather wallet under his arm left the train and walked rapidly up the main street of the town there were other passengers who also got off at san rosario but they either slouched limberly over to the railroad eating house or the silver dollar saloon or joined the groups of idlers about the station indecision had no part in the movements of the man with the wallet he was short in stature but strongly built with very light closely trimmed hair smooth determined face and aggressive gold rimmed nose glasses he was well dressed in the prevailing eastern style his air denoted a quiet but conscious reserve force if not actual authority after walking a distance of three squares he came to the centre of the town s business area here another street of importance crossed the main one forming the hub of san rosario s life and commerce upon one corner stood the post office upon another rubensky s clothing emporium the other two diagonally opposing corners were occupied by the town s two banks the first national and the stockmen s national into the first national bank of san rosario the newcomer walked never slowing his brisk step until he stood at the cashier s window the bank opened for business at nine and the working force was already assembled each member preparing his department for the day s business the cashier was examining the mail when he noticed the stranger standing at his window bank doesn t open til nine he remarked curtly but without feeling he had had to make that statement so often to early birds since

examiner was quickly inside the sacred precincts of the bank where he was ponderously introduced to each employee in turn by mr edlinger the cashier a middle aged gentleman of deliberation discretion and method i was kind of expecting sam turner round again pretty soon said mr edlinger sam s been examining us now for about four years i guess you ll find us all right though considering the tightness in business not overly much money on hand but able to stand the storms sir stand the storms mr turner and i have been ordered by the comptroller to exchange districts said the examiner in his decisive formal tones he is covering my old territory in southern illinois and indiana i will take the cash first please perry dorsey the teller was already arranging his cash on the counter for the examiner s inspection he knew it was right to a cent and he had nothing to fear but he was nervous and flustered so was every man in the bank there was something so icy and swift so impersonal and uncompromising about this man that his very presence seemed an accusation he looked to be a man who would never make nor overlook an error mr nettlewick first seized the currency and with a rapid almost juggling motion counted it by packages then he spun the sponge cup toward him and verified the count by bills his thin white fingers flew like some expert musician s upon the keys of a piano he dumped the gold upon the counter with a crash and the coins whined and sang as they skimmed across the marble slab from the tips of his nimble digits the air was full of fractional currency when he came to the halves and quarters he counted the last nickle and dime he had the scales brought and he weighed every sack of silver in the vault he questioned dorsey concerning each of the cash memoranda certain checks charge slips etc carried over from the previous day s work with unimpeachable courtesy yet with something so mysteriously momentous in his frigid manner that the teller was reduced to pink cheeks and a stammering tongue this newly imported examiner was so different from sam turner it had been sam s way to enter the bank with a shout pass the cigars and tell the latest

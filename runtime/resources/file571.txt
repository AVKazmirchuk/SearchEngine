the time he is on the jump riding day and night and he lives so hard between times that he doesn t enjoy the taste of high life when he gets it he knows that his time is bound to come to lose his life or liberty and that the accuracy of his aim the speed of his horse and the fidelity of his sider are all that postpone the inevitable it isn t that he loses any sleep over danger from the officers of the law in all my experience i never knew officers to attack a band of outlaws unless they outnumbered them at least three to one but the outlaw carries one thought constantly in his mind and that is what makes him so sore against life more than anything else he knows where the marshals get their recruits of deputies he knows that the majority of these upholders of the law were once lawbreakers horse thieves rustlers highwaymen and outlaws like himself and that they gamed their positions and immunity by turning state s evidence by turning traitor and delivering up their comrades to imprisonment and death he knows that some day unless he is shot first his judas will set to work the trap will be laid and he will be the surprised instead of a surpriser at a stick up that is why the man who holds up trains picks his company with a thousand times the care with which a careful girl chooses a sweetheart that is why he raises himself from his blanket of nights and listens to the tread of every horse s hoofs on the distant road that is why he broods suspiciously for days upon a jesting remark or an unusual movement of a tried comrade or the broken mutterings of his closest friend sleeping by his side and it is one of the reasons why the train robbing profession is not so pleasant a one as either of its collateral branches politics or cornering the market ulysses and the dogman do you know the time of the dogmen when the forefinger of twilight begins to smudge the clear drawn lines of the big city there is inaugurated an hour devoted to one of the most melancholy sights of urban life out from the towering flat crags and apartment peaks of the cliff dwellers of new york steals an army of beings that were once men even yet they go upright upon two limbs and retain human form and speech but you will observe that they are behind animals in progress each of these beings follows a dog to which he is fastened by an artificial ligament these men are all victims to circe not willingly do they become flunkeys to fido bell boys to bull terriers and toddlers after towzer modern circe instead of turning them into animals has kindly left the difference of a six foot leash between them every one of those dogmen has been either cajoled bribed or commanded by his own particular circe to take the dear household pet out for an airing by their faces and manner you can tell that the dogmen are bound in a hopeless enchantment never will there come even a dog catcher ulysses to remove the spell the faces of some are stonily set they are past the commiseration the curiosity or the jeers of their fellow beings years of matrimony of continuous compulsory canine constitutionals have made them callous they unwind their beasts from lamp posts or the ensnared legs of profane pedestrians with the stolidity of mandarins manipulating the strings of their kites others more recently reduced to the ranks of rover s retinue take their medicine sulkily and fiercely they play the dog on the end of their line with the pleasure felt by the girl out fishing when she catches a sea robin on her hook they glare at you threateningly if you look at them as if it would be their delight to let slip the dogs of war these are half mutinous dogmen not quite circe ized and you will do well not to kick their charges should they sniff around your ankles others of the tribe do not seem to feel so keenly they are mostly unfresh youths with gold caps and drooping cigarettes who do not harmonize with their dogs the animals they attend wear satin bows in their collars and the young men steer them so assiduously that you are tempted to the theory that some personal advantage contingent upon satisfactory service waits upon the execution of their duties the dogs thus personally conducted are of many varieties but they are one in fatness in pampered diseased vileness of temper in insolent snarling capriciousness of behaviour they tug at the leash fractiously they make leisurely nasal inventory of every door step railing and post they sit down to rest when they choose they wheeze like the winner of a third avenue beefsteak eating contest they blunder clumsily into open cellars and coal holes they lead the dogmen a merry dance these unfortunate dry nurses of dogdom the cur cuddlers mongrel managers spitz stalkers poodle pullers skye scrapers dachshund dandlers terrier trailers and pomeranian pushers of the cliff dwelling circes follow their charges meekly the doggies neither fear nor respect them masters of the house these men whom they hold in leash may be but they are not masters of them from cosey corner to fire escape from divan to dumbwaiter doggy s snarl easily drives this two legged being who is commissioned to walk at the other end of his string during his outing one twilight the dogmen came forth as usual at their circes pleading guerdon or crack of the whip one among them was a strong man apparently of too solid virtues for this airy vocation his expression was melancholic his manner depressed he was leashed to a vile white dog loathsomely fat fiendishly ill natured gloatingly

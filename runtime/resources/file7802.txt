hart was willing to stake the judgment experience and savings of his four years of vaudeville that mice will play would blossom into a perennial flower in the garden of the circuits miss cherry was slower to decide after many puckerings of her smooth young brow and tappings on her small white teeth with the end of a lead pencil she gave out her dictum mr hart said she i believe your sketch is going to win out that grimes part fits me like a shrinkable flannel after its first trip to a handless hand laundry i can make it stand out like the colonel of the forty fourth regiment at a little mothers bazaar and i ve seen you work i know what you can do with the other part but business is business how much do you get a week for the stunt you do now two hundred answered hart i get one hundred for mine said cherry that s about the natural discount for a woman but i live on it and put a few simoleons every week under the loose brick in the old kitchen hearth the stage is all right i love it but there s something else i love better that s a little country home some day with plymouth rock chickens and six ducks wandering around the yard now let me tell you mr hart i am strictly business if you want me to play the opposite part in your sketch i ll do it and i believe we can make it go and there s something else i want to say there s no nonsense in my make up i m on the level and i m on the stage for what it pays me just as other girls work in stores and offices i m going to save my money to keep me when i m past doing my stunts no old ladies home or retreat for imprudent actresses for me if you want to make this a business partnership mr hart with all nonsense cut out of it i m in on it i know something about vaudeville teams in general but this would have to be one in particular i want you to know that i m on the stage for what i can cart away from it every pay day in a little manila envelope with nicotine stains on it where the cashier has licked the flap it s kind of a hobby of mine to want to cravenette myself for plenty of rainy days in the future i want you to know just how i am i don t know what an all night restaurant looks like i drink only weak tea i never spoke to a man at a stage entrance in my life and i ve got money in five savings banks miss cherry said bob hart in his smooth serious tones you re in on your own terms i ve got strictly business pasted in my hat and stenciled on my make up box when i dream of nights i always see a five room bungalow on the north shore of long island with a jap cooking clam broth and duckling in the kitchen and me with the title deeds to the place in my pongee coat pocket swinging in a hammock on the side porch reading stanleys explorations into africa and nobody else around you never was interested in africa was you miss cherry not any said cherry what i m going to do with my money is to bank it you can get four per cent on deposits even at the salary i ve been earning i ve figured out that in ten years i d have an income of about a month just from the interest alone well i might invest some of the principal in a little business say trimming hats or a beauty parlor and make more well said hart you ve got the proper idea all right all right anyhow there are mighty few actors that amount to anything at all who couldn t fix themselves for the wet days to come if they d save their money instead of blowing it i m glad you ve got the correct business idea of it miss cherry i think the same way and i believe this sketch will more than double what both of us earn now when we get it shaped up the subsequent history of mice will play is the history of all successful writings for the stage hart cherry cut it pieced it remodeled it performed surgical operations on the dialogue and business changed the lines restored em added more cut em out renamed it gave it back the old name rewrote it substituted a dagger for the pistol restored the pistol put the sketch through all the known processes of condensation and improvement they rehearsed it by the old fashioned boardinghouse clock in the rarely used parlor until its warning click at five minutes to the hour would occur every time exactly half a second before the click of the unloaded revolver that helen grimes used in rehearsing the thrilling climax of the sketch yes that was a thriller and a piece of excellent work in the act a real caliber revolver was used loaded with a real cartridge helen grimes who is a western girl of decidedly buffalo billish skill and daring is tempestuously in love with frank desmond the private secretary and confidential prospective son in law of her father arapahoe grimes quarter million dollar cattle king owning a ranch that judging by the scenery is in either the bad lands or amagensett l i desmond in private life mr bob hart wears puttees and meadow brook hunt riding trousers and gives his address as new york leaving you to wonder why he comes to the bad lands or amagansett as the case may be and at the same time to conjecture mildly why a cattleman should want puttees about his ranch with a secretary in em well anyhow you know as well as i do that we all like that kind of play whether we admit it or not something along in between bluebeard jr and cymbeline played in the russian there were only two parts and a half in mice will play hart and cherry were the two of course and the half was a minor part always played by a stage hand who merely came in once in a tuxedo coat and a panic to announce that the house was surrounded by indians and to turn down the gas fire in the grate by the manager s orders there was another girl in the sketch a fifth avenue society swelless who was visiting the ranch and who had sirened jack valentine when he was a wealthy club man on lower third avenue before he lost his money this girl appeared on the stage only in the photographic state jack had her sarony stuck up on the mantel of the amagan of the bad lands droring room helen was jealous of course and now for the thriller old arapahoe grimes dies of angina pectoris one night so helen informs us in a stage ferryboat whisper over the footlights while only his secretary was present and that same day he was known to have had in cash in his ranch library just received for the sale of a drove of beeves in the east that accounts for the price we pay for steak the cash disappears at the same time jack valentine was the only person with the ranchman when he made his alleged croak gawd knows i love him but if he has done this deed you sabe don t you and then there are some mean things said about the fifth avenue girl who doesn t come on the stage and can we blame her with the vaudeville trust holding down prices until one actually must be buttoned in the back by a call boy maids cost so much but wait here s the climax helen grimes chaparralish as she can be is goaded beyond imprudence she convinces herself that jack valentine is not only a falsetto but a financier to lose at one fell swoop and a lover in riding trousers with angles in the sides like the variations on the chart of a typhoid fever patient is enough to make any perfect lady mad so then they stand in the ranch library which is furnished with mounted elk heads didn t the elks have a fish fry in amagensett once and the d enouement begins i know of no more interesting time in the run of a play unless it be when the prologue ends helen thinks jack has taken the money who else was there to take it the box office manager was at the front on his job the orchestra hadn t left their seats and no man could get past old jimmy the stage door man unless he could show a skye terrier or an automobile as a guarantee of eligibility goaded beyond imprudence as before said helen says to jack valentine robber and thief and worse yet stealer of trusting hearts this should be your fate with that out she whips of course the trusty caliber but i will be merciful goes on helen you shall live that will be your punishment i will show you how easily i could have sent you to the death that you deserve there is her picture on the mantel i will send through her more beautiful face the bullet that should have pierced your craven heart and she does it and there s no fake blank cartridges or assistants pulling strings helen fires the bullet the actual bullet goes through the face of the photograph and then strikes the hidden spring of the sliding panel in the wall and lo the panel slides and there is the missing in convincing stacks of currency and bags of gold it s great you know how it is cherry practised for two months at a target on the roof of her boarding house it took good shooting in the sketch she had to hit a brass disk only three inches in diameter covered by wall paper in the panel and she had to stand in exactly the same spot every night and the photo had to be in exactly the same spot and she had to shoot steady and true every time of course old arapahoe had tucked the funds away there in the secret place and of course jack hadn t taken anything except his salary which really might have come under the head of obtaining money under but that is neither here nor there and of course the new york girl was really engaged to a concrete house contractor in the bronx and necessarily jack and helen ended in a half nelson and there you are after hart and cherry had gotten mice will play flawless they had a try out at a vaudeville house that accommodates the sketch was a house wrecker it was one of those rare strokes of talent that inundates a theatre from the roof down the gallery wept and the orchestra seats being dressed for it swam in tears after the show the booking agents signed blank checks and pressed fountain pens upon hart and cherry five hundred dollars a week was what it panned out that night at bob hart took off his hat and bade cherry good night at her boarding house door mr hart said she thoughtfully come inside just a few minutes we ve got our chance now to make good and make money what we want to do is to cut expenses every cent we can and save all we can right said bob it s business with me you ve got your scheme for banking yours and i dream every night of that bungalow with the jap cook and nobody around to raise trouble anything to enlarge the net receipts will engage my attention come inside just a few minutes repeated cherry deeply thoughtful i ve got a proposition to make to you that will reduce our expenses a lot and help you work out your own future and help me work out mine and all on business principles mice will play had a tremendously successful run in new york for ten weeks rather neat for a vaudeville sketch and then it started on the circuits without following it it may be said that it was a solid drawing card for two years without a sign of abated popularity sam packard manager of one of keetor s new york houses said of hart cherry as square and high toned a little team as ever came over the circuit it s a pleasure to read their names on the booking list quiet hard workers no johnny and mabel nonsense on the job to the minute straight home after their act and each of em as gentlemanlike as a lady i don t expect to handle any attractions that give me less trouble or more respect for the profession and now after so much cracking of a nutshell here is the kernel of the story at the end of its second season mice will play came back to new york for another run at the roof gardens and summer theatres there was never any trouble in booking it at the top notch price bob hart had his bungalow nearly paid for and cherry had so many savings deposit bank books that she had begun to buy sectional bookcases on the instalment plan to hold them i tell you these things to assure you even if you can t believe it that many very many of the stage people are workers with abiding ambitions just the same as the man who wants to be president or the grocery clerk who wants a home in flatbush or a lady who is anxious to flop out of the count pan into the prince fire and i hope i may be allowed to say without chipping into the contribution basket that they often move in a mysterious way their wonders to perform but listen at the first performance of mice will play in new york at the westphalia no hams alluded to theatre winona cherry was nervous when she fired at the photograph of the eastern beauty on the mantel the bullet instead of penetrating the photo and then striking the disk went into the lower left side of bob hart s neck not expecting to get it there hart collapsed neatly while cherry fainted in a most artistic manner the audience surmising that they viewed a comedy instead of a tragedy in which the principals were married or reconciled applauded with great enjoyment the cool head who always graces such occasions rang the curtain down and two platoons of scene shifters respectively and more or less respectfully removed hart cherry from the stage the next turn went on and all went as merry as an alimony bell the stage hands found a young doctor at the stage entrance who was waiting for a patient with a decoction of am b ty roses the doctor examined hart carefully and laughed heartily no headlines for you old sport was his diagnosis if it had been two inches to the left it would have undermined the carotid artery as far as the red front drug store in flatbush and back again as it is you just get the property man to bind it up with a flounce torn from any one of the girls valenciennes and go home and get it dressed by the parlor floor practitioner on your block and you ll be all right excuse me i ve got a serious case outside to look after after that bob hart looked up and felt better and then to where he lay came vincente the tramp juggler great in his line vincente a solemn man from brattleboro vt named sam griggs at home sent toys and maple sugar home to two small daughters from every town he played vincente had moved on the same circuits with hart cherry and was their peripatetic friend bob said vincente in his serious way i m glad it s no worse the little lady is wild about you who asked hart cherry said the juggler we didn t know how bad you were hurt and we kept her away it s taking the manager and three girls to hold her it was an accident of course said hart cherry s all right she wasn t feeling in good trim or she couldn t have done it there s no hard feelings she s strictly business the doctor says i ll be on the job again in three days don t let her worry man said sam griggs severely puckering his old smooth lined face are you a chess automaton or a human pincushion cherry s crying her heart out for you calling bob bob every second with them holding her hands and keeping her from coming to you what s the matter with her asked hart with wide open eyes the sketch ll go on again in three days i m not hurt bad the doctor says she won t lose out half a week s salary i know it was an accident what s the matter with her you seem to be blind or a sort of a fool said vincente the girl loves you and is almost mad about your hurt what s the matter with you is she nothing to you i wish you could hear her call you loves me asked bob hart rising from the stack of scenery on which he lay cherry loves me why it s impossible i wish you could see her and hear her said griggs but man said bob hart sitting up it s impossible it s impossible i tell you i never dreamed of such a thing no human being said the tramp juggler could mistake it she s wild for love of you how have you been so blind but my god said bob hart rising to his feet it s too late it s too late i tell you sam it s too late it can t be you must be wrong it s impossible there s some mistake she s crying for you said the tramp juggler for love of you she s fighting three and calling your name so loud they don t dare to raise the curtain wake up man for love of me said bob hart with staring eyes don t i tell you it s too late it s too late man why cherry and i have been married two years the gold that glittered a story with a moral appended is like the bill of a mosquito it bores you and then injects a stinging drop to irritate your conscience therefore let us have the moral first and be done with it all is not gold that glitters but it is a wise child that keeps the stopper in his bottle of testing acid where broadway skirts the corner of the square presided over by george the veracious is the little rialto here stand the actors of that quarter and this is their shibboleth nit says i to frohman you can t touch me for a kopeck less than two fifty per and out i walks westward and southward from the thespian glare are one or two streets where a spanish american colony has huddled for a little tropical warmth in the nipping north the centre of life in this precinct is el refugio a cafe and restaurant that caters to the volatile exiles from the south up from chili bolivia colombia the rolling republics of central america and the ireful islands of the western indies flit the cloaked and sombreroed se ores who are scattered like burning lava by the political eruptions of their several countries hither they come to lay counterplots to bide their time to solicit funds to enlist filibusterers to smuggle out arms and ammunitions to play the game at long taw in el refugio they find the atmosphere in which they thrive in the restaurant of el refugio are served compounds delightful to the palate of the man from capricorn or cancer altruism must halt the story thus long on diner weary of the culinary subterfuges of the gallic chef hie thee to el refugio there only will you find a fish bluefish shad or pompano from the gulf baked after the spanish method tomatoes give it color individuality and soul chili colorado bestows upon it zest originality and fervor unknown herbs furnish piquancy and mystery and but its crowning glory deserves a new sentence around it above it beneath it in its vicinity but never in it hovers an ethereal aura an effluvium so rarefied and ddelicate that only the society for psychical research could note its origin do not say that garlic is in the fish at el refugio it is not otherwise than as if the spirit of garlic flitting past has wafted one kiss that lingers in the parsley crowned dish as haunting as those kisses in life by hopeless fancy feigned on lips that are for others and then when conchito the waiter brings you a plate of brown frijoles and carafe of wine that has never stood still between oporto and el refugio ah dios one day a hamburg american liner deposited upon pier no gen perrico ximenes villablanca falcon a passenger from cartagena the general was between a claybank and bay in complexion had a inch waist and stood feet with his du barry heels he had the mustache of a shooting gallery proprietor he wore the full dress of a texas congressman and had the important aspect of an uninstructed delegate gen falcon had enough english under his hat to enable him to inquire his way to the street in which el refugio stood when he reached that neighborhood he saw a sign before a respectable red brick house that read hotel espanol in the window was a card in spanish aqui se habla espanol the general entered sure of a congenial port in the cozy office was mrs o brien the proprietress she had blond oh unimpeachably blond hair for the rest she was amiability and ran largely to inches around gen falcon brushed the floor with his broad brimmed hat and emitted a quantity of spanish the syllables sounding like firecrackers gently popping their way down the string of a bunch spanish or dago asked mrs o brien pleasantly i am a colombian madam said the general proudly i speak the spanish the advisment in your window say the spanish he is spoken here how is that well you ve been speaking it ain t you said the madam i m sure i can t at the hotel espanol general falcon engaged rooms and established himself at dusk he sauntered out upon the streets to view the wonders of this roaring city of the north as he walked he thought of the wonderful golden hair of mme o brien it is here said the general to himself no doubt in his own language that one shall find the most beautiful se oras in the world i have not in my colombia viewed among our beauties one so fair but no it is not for the general falcon to think of beauty it is my country that claims my devotion at the corner of broadway and the little rialto the general became involved the street cars bewildered him and the fender of one upset him against a pushcart laden with oranges a cab driver missed him an inch with a hub and poured barbarous execrations upon his head he scrambled to the sidewalk and skipped again in terror when the whistle of a peanut roaster puffed a hot scream in his ear v algame dios what devil s city is this as the general fluttered out of the streamers of passers like a wounded snipe he was marked simultaneously as game by two hunters one was bully mcguire whose system of sport required the use of a strong arm and the misuse of an eight inch piece of lead pipe the other nimrod of the asphalt was spider kelley a sportsman with more refined methods in pouncing upon their self evident prey mr kelley was a shade the quicker his elbow fended accurately the onslaught of mr mcguire g wan he commanded harshly i saw it first mcguire slunk away awed by superior intelligence pardon me said mr kelley to the general but you got balled up in the shuffle didn t you let me assist you he picked up the general s hat and brushed the dust from it the ways of mr kelley could not but succeed the general bewildered and dismayed by the resounding streets welcomed his deliverer as a caballero with a most disinterested heart i have a desire said the general to return to the hotel of o brien in which i am stop caramba se or there is a loudness and rapidness of going and coming in the city of this nueva york mr kelley s politeness would not suffer the distinguished colombian to brave the dangers of the return unaccompanied at the door of the hotel espanol they paused a little lower down on the opposite side of the street shone the modest illuminated sign of el refugio mr kelley to whom few streets were unfamiliar knew the place exteriorly as a dago joint all foreigners mr kelley classed under the two heads of dagoes and frenchmen he proposed to the general that they repair thither and substantiate their acquaintance with a liquid foundation an hour later found general falcon and mr kelley seated at a table in the conspirator s corner of el refugio bottles and glasses were between them for the tenth time the general confided the secret of his mission to the estados unidos he was here he declared to purchase arms stands of winchester rifles for the colombian revolutionists he had drafts in his pocket drawn by the cartagena bank on its new york correspondent for at other tables other revolutionists were shouting their political secrets to their fellow plotters but none was as loud as the general he pounded the table he hallooed for some wine he roared to his friend that his errand was a secret one and not to be hinted at to a living soul mr kelley himself was stirred to sympathetic enthusiasm he grasped the general s hand across the table monseer he said earnestly i don t know where this country of yours is but i m for it i guess it must be a branch of the united states though for the poetry guys and the schoolmarms call us columbia too sometimes it s a lucky thing for you that you butted into me to night i m the only man in new york that can get this gun deal through for you the secretary of war of the united states is me best friend he s in the city now and i ll see him for you to morrow in the meantime monseer you keep them drafts tight in your inside pocket i ll call for you to morrow and take you to see him say that ain t the district of columbia you re talking about is it concluded mr kelley with a sudden qualm you can t capture that with no guns it s been tried with more no no no exclaimed the general it is the republic of colombia it is a g r reat republic on the top side of america of the south yes yes all right said mr kelley reassured now suppose we trek along home and go by by i ll write to the secretary to night and make a date with him it s a ticklish job to get guns out of new york mcclusky himself can t do it they parted at the door of the hotel espanol the general rolled his eyes at the moon and sighed it is a great country your nueva york he said truly the cars in the streets devastate one and the engine that cooks the nuts terribly makes a squeak in the ear but ah se or kelley the se oras with hair of much goldness and admirable fatness they are magnificas muy magnificas kelley went to the nearest telephone booth and called up mccrary s caf e far up on broadway he asked for jimmy dunn is that jimmy dunn asked kelley yes came the answer you re a liar sang back kelley joyfully your e the secretary of war wait there till i come up i ve got the finest thing down here in the way of a fish you ever baited for it s a colorado maduro with a gold band around it and free coupons enough to buy a red hall lamp and a statuette of psyche rubbering in the brook i ll be up on the next car jimmy dunn was an a m of crookdom he was an artist in the confidence line he never saw a bludgeon in his life and he scorned knockout drops in fact he would have set nothing before an intended victim but the purest of drinks if it had been possible to procure such a thing in new york it was the ambition of spider kelley to elevate himself into jimmy s class these two gentlemen held a conference that night at mccrary s kelley explained he s as easy as a gumshoe he s from the island of colombia where there s a strike or a feud or something going on and they ve sent him up here to buy winchesters to arbitrate the thing with he showed me two drafts for each and one for on a bank here s truth jimmy i felt real mad with him because he didn t have it in thousand dollar bills and hand it to me on a silver waiter now we ve got to wait till he goes to the bank and gets the money for us they talked it over for two hours and then dunn said bring him to no broadway at four o clock to morrow afternoon in due time kelley called at the hotel espanol for the general he found the wily warrior engaged in delectable conversation with mrs o brien the secretary of war is waitin for us said kelley the general tore himself away with an effort ay se or he said with a sigh duty makes a call but se or the se oras of your estados unidos how beauties for exemplification take you la madame o brien que magnifica she is one goddess one juno what you call one ox eyed juno now mr kelley was a wit and better men have been shriveled by the fire of their own imagination sure he said with a grin but you mean a peroxide juno don t you mrs o brien heard and lifted an auriferous head her businesslike eye rested for an instant upon the disappearing form of mr kelley except in street cars one should never be unnecessarily rude to a lady when the gallant colombian and his escort arrived at the broadway address they were held in an anteroom for half an hour and then admitted into a well equipped office where a distinguished looking man with a smooth face wrote at a desk general falcon was presented to the secretary of war of the united states and his mission made known by his old friend mr kelley ah colombia said the secretary significantly when he was made to understand i m afraid there will be a little difficutly in that case the president and i differ in our sympathies there he prefers the established government while i the secretary gave the general a mysterious but encouraging smile you of course know general falcon that since the tammany war an act of congress has been passed requiring all manufactured arms and ammunition exported from this country to pass through the war department now if i can do anything for you i will be glad to do so to oblige my old friend mr kelley but it must be in absolute secrecy as the president as i have said does not regard favorably the efforts of your revolutionary party in colombia i will have my orderly bring a list of the available arms now in the warehouse the secretary struck a bell and an orderly with the letters a d t on his cap stepped promptly into the room bring me schedule b of the small arms inventory said the secretary the orderly quickly returned with a printed paper the secretary studied it closely i find he said that in warehouse of government stores there is shipment of stands of winchester rifles that were ordered by the sultan of morocco who forgot to send the cash with his order our rule is that legal tender must be paid down at the time of purchase my dear kelley your friend general falcon shall have this lot of arms if he desires it at the manufacturer s price and you will forgive me i am sure if i curtail our interview i am expecting the japanese minister and charles murphy every moment as one result of this interview the general was deeply grateful to his esteemed friend mr kelley as another the nimble secretary of war was extremely busy during the next two days buying empty rifle cases and filling them with bricks which were then stored in a warehouse rented for that purpose as still another when the general returned to the hotel espanol mrs o brien went up to him plucked a thread from his lapel and said say se or i don t want to butt in but what does that monkey faced cat eyed rubber necked tin horn tough want with you sangre de mi vida exclaimed the general impossible it is that you speak of my good friend se or kelley come into the summer garden said mrs o brien i want to have a talk with you let us suppose that an hour has elapsed and you say said the general that for the sum of can be purchased the furnishment of the house and the lease of one year with this garden so lovely so resembling unto the patios of my cara colombia and dirt cheap at that sighed the lady ah dios breathed general falcon what to me is war and politics this spot is one paradise my country it have other brave heroes to continue the fighting what to me should be glory and the shooting of mans ah no it is here i have found one angel let us buy the hotel espanol and you shall be mine and the money shall not be waste on guns mrs o brien rested her blond pompadour against the shoulder of the colombian patriot oh se or she sighed happily ain t you terrible two days later was the time appointed for the delivery of the arms to the general the boxes of supposed rifles were stacked in the rented warehouse and the secretary of war sat upon them waiting for his friend kelley to fetch the victim mr kelley hurried at the hour to the hotel espanol he found the general behind the desk adding up accounts i have decide said the general to buy not guns i have to day buy the insides of this hotel and there shall be marrying of the general perrico ximenes villablanca falcon with la madame o brien mr kelley almost strangled say you old bald headed bottle of shoe polish he spluttered you re a swindler that s what you are you ve bought a boarding house with money belonging to your infernal country wherever it is ah said the general footing up a column that is what you call politics war and revolution they are not nice yes it is not best that one shall always follow minerva no it is of quite desirable to keep hotels and be with that juno that ox eyed juno ah what hair of the gold it is that she have mr kelley choked again ah senor kelley said the general feelingly and finally is it that you have never eaten of the corned beef hash that madame o brien she make babes in the jungle montague silver the finest street man and art grafter in the west says to me once in little rock if you ever lose your mind billy and get too old to do honest swindling among grown men go to new york in the west a sucker is born every minute but in new york they appear in chunks of roe you can t count em two years afterward i found that i couldn t remember the names of the russian admirals and i noticed some gray hairs over my left ear so i knew the time had arrived for me to take silver s advice i struck new york about noon one day and took a walk up broadway and i run against silver himself all encompassed up in a spacious kind of haberdashery leaning against a hotel and rubbing the half moons on his nails with a silk handkerchief paresis or superannuated i asks him hello billy says silver i m glad to see you yes it seemed to me that the west was accumulating a little too much wiseness i ve been saving new york for dessert i know it s a low down trick to take things from these people they only know this and that and pass to and fro and think ever and anon i d hate for my mother to know i was skinning these weak minded ones she raised me better is there a crush already in the waiting rooms of the old doctor that does skin grafting i asks well no says silver you needn t back epidermis to win to day i ve only been here a month but i m ready to begin and the members of willie manhattan s sunday school class each of whom has volunteered to contribute a portion of cuticle toward this rehabilitation may as well send their photos to the evening daily i ve been studying the town says silver and reading the papers every day and i know it as well as the cat in the city hall knows an o sullivan people here lie down on the floor and scream and kick when you are the least bit slow about taking money from them come up in my room and i ll tell you we ll work the town together billy for the sake of old times silver takes me up in a hotel he has a quantity of irrelevant objects lying about there s more ways of getting money from these metropolitan hayseeds says silver than there is of cooking rice in charleston s c they ll bite at anything the brains of most of em commute the wiser they are in intelligence the less perception of cognizance they have why didin t a man the other day sell j p morgan an oil portrait of rockefeller jr for andrea del sarto s celebrated painting of the young saint john you see that bundle of printed stuff in the corner billy that s gold mining stock i started out one day to sell that but i quit it in two hours why got arrested for blocking the street people fought to buy it i sold the policeman a block of it on the way to the station house and then i took it off the market i don t want people to give me their money i want some little consideration connected with the transaction to keep my pride from being hurt i want em to guess the missing letter in chic go or draw to a pair of nines before they pay me a cent of money now there s another little scheme that worked so easy i had to quit it you see that bottle of blue ink on the table i tattooed an anchor on the back of my hand and went to a bank and told em i was admiral dewey s nephew they offered to cash my draft on him for a thousand but i didn t know my uncle s first name it shows though what an easy town it is as for burglars they won t go in a house now unless there s a hot supper ready and a few college students to wait on em they re slugging citizens all over the upper part of the city and i guess taking the town from end to end it s a plain case of assault and battery monty says i when silver had slacked up you may have manhattan correctly discriminated in your perorative but i doubt it i ve only been in town two hours but it don t dawn upon me that it s ours with a cherry in it there ain t enough rus in urbe about it to suit me i d be a good deal much better satisfied if the citizens had a straw or more in their hair and run more to velveteen vests and buckeye watch charms they don t look easy to me you ve got it billy says silver all emigrants have it new york s bigger than little rock or europe and it frightens a foreigner you ll be all right i tell you i feel like slapping the people here because they don t send me all their money in laundry baskets with germicide sprinkled over it i hate to go down on the street to get it who wears the diamonds in this town why winnie the wiretapper s wife and bella the buncosteerer s bride new yorkers can be worked easier than a blue rose on a tidy the only thing that bothers me is i know i ll break the cigars in my vest pocket when i get my clothes all full of twenties i hope you are right monty says i but i wish all the same i had been satisfied with a small business in little rock the crop of farmers is never so short out there but what you can get a few of em to sign a petition for a new post office that you can discount for at the county bank the people hear appear to possess instincts of self preservation and illiberality i fear me that we are not cultured enough to tackle this game don t worry says silver i ve got this jayville near tarrytown correctly estimated as sure as north river is the hudson and east river ain t a river why there are people living in four blocks of broadway who never saw any kind of a building except a skyscraper in their lives a good live hustling western man ought to get conspicuous enough here inside of three months to incur either jerome s clemency or lawson s displeasure hyperbole aside says i do you know of any immediate system of buncoing the community out of a dollar or two except by applying to the salvation army or having a fit on miss helen gould s doorsteps dozens of em says silver how much capital have you got billy a thousand i told him i ve got says he we ll pool and do a big piece of business there s so many ways we can make a million that i don t know how to begin the next morning silver meets me at the hotel and he is all sonorous and stirred with a kind of silent joy we re to meet j p morgan this afternoon says he a man i know in the hotel wants to introduce us he s a friend of his he says he likes to meet people from the west that sounds nice and plausible says i i d like to know mr morgan it won t hurt us a bit says silver to get acquainted with a few finance kings i kind of like the social way new york has with strangers the man silver knew was named klein at three o clock klein brought his wall street friend to see us in silver s room mr morgan looked some like his pictures and he had a turkish towel wrapped around his left foot and he walked with a cane mr silver and mr pescud says klein it sounds superfluous says he to mention the name of the greatest financial cut it out klein says mr morgan i m glad to know you gents i take great interest in the west klein tells me you re from little rock i think i ve a railroad or two out there somewhere if either of you guys would like to deal a hand or two of stud poker i now pierpont cuts in klein you forget excuse me gents says morgan since i ve had the gout so bad i sometimes play a social game of cards at my house neither of you never knew one eyed peters did you while you was around little rock he lived in seattle new mexico before we could answer mr morgan hammers on the floor with his can and begins to walk up and down swearing in a loud tone of voice they have been pounding your stocks to day on the street pierpont asks klein smiling stocks no roars mr morgan it s that picture i sent an agent to europe to buy i just thought about it he cabled me to day that it ain t to be found in all italy i d pay to morrow for that picture yes i give the agent a la carte in purchasing it i cannot understand why the art galleries will allow a de vinchy to why mr morgan says klein i thought you owned all of the de vinchy paintings what is the picture like mr morgan asks silver it must be as big as the side of the flatiron building i m afraid your art education is on the bum mr silver says morgan the picture is inches by and it is called love s idle hour it represents a number of cloak models doing the two step on the bank of a purple river the cablegram said it might have been brought to this country my collection will never be complete without that picture well so long gents us financiers must keep early hours mr morgan and klein went away together in a cab me and silver talked about how simple and unsuspecting great people was and silver said what a shame it would be to try to rob a man like mr morgan and i said i thought it would be rather imprudent myself klein proposes a stroll after dinner and me and him and silver walks down toward seventh avenue to see the sights klein sees a pair of cuff links that instigate his admiration in a pawnshop window and we all go in while he buys em after we got back to the hotel and klein had gone silver jumps at me and waves his hands did you see it says he did you see it billy what i asks why that picture that morgan wants it s hanging in that pawnshop behind the desk i didn t say anything because klein was there it s the article sure as you live the girls are as natural as paint can make them all measuring and and skirts if they had any skirts and they re doing a buck and wing on the bank of a river with the blues what did mr morgan say he d give for it oh don t make me tell you they can t know what it is in that pawnshop when the pawnshop opened the next morning me and silver was standing there as anxious as if we wanted to soak our sunday suit to buy a drink we sauntered inside and began to look at watch chains that s a violent specimen of a chromo you ve got up there remarked silver casual to the pawnbroker but i kind of enthuse over the girl with the shoulderblades and red bunting would an offer of for it cause you to knock over any fragile articles of your stock in hurrying it off the nail the pawnbroker smiles and goes on showing us plate watch chains that picture says he was pledged a year ago by an italian gentleman i loaned him on it it is called love s idle hour and it is by leonardo de vinchy two days ago the legal time expired and it became an unredeemed pledge here is a style of chain that is worn a great deal now at the end of half an hour me and silver paid the pawnbroker and walked out with the picture silver got into a cab with it and started for morgan s office i goes to the hotel and waits for him in two hours silver comes back did you see mr morgan i asks how much did he pay you for it silver sits down and fools with a tassel on the table cover i never exactly saw mr morgan he says because mr morgan s been in europe for a month but what s worrying me billy is this the department stores have all got that same picture on sale framed for and they charge for the frame alone that s what i can t understand the day resurgent i can see the artist bite the end of his pencil and frown when it comes to drawing his easter picture for his legitimate pictorial conceptions of figures pertinent to the festival are but four in number first comes easter pagan goddess of spring here his fancy may have free play a beautiful maiden with decorative hair and the proper number of toes will fill the bill miss clarice st vavasour the well known model will pose for it in the lethergogallagher or whatever it was that trilby called it second the melancholy lady with upturned eyes in a framework of lilies this is magazine covery but reliable third miss manhattan in the fifth avenue easter sunday parade fourth maggie murphy with a new red feather in her old straw hat happy and self conscious in the grand street turnout of course the rabbits do not count nor the easter eggs since the higher criticism has hard boiled them the limited field of its pictorial possibilities proves that easter of all our festival days is the most vague and shifting in our conception it belongs to all religions although the pagans invented it going back still further to the first spring we can see eve choosing with pride a new green leaf from the tree ficus carica now the object of this critical and learned preamble is to set forth the theorem that easter is neither a date a season a festival a holiday nor an occasion what it is you shall find out if you follow in the footsteps of danny mccree easter sunday dawned as it should bright and early in its place on the calendar between saturday and monday at the sun rose and at danny followed its example he went into the kitchen and washed his face at the sink his mother was frying bacon she looked at his hard smooth knowing countenance as he juggled with the round cake of soap and thought of his father when she first saw him stopping a hot grounder between second and third twenty two years before on a vacant lot in harlem where the la paloma apartment house now stands in the front room of the flat danny s father sat by an open window smoking his pipe with his dishevelled gray hair tossed about by the breeze he still clung to his pipe although his sight had been taken from him two years before by a precocious blast of giant powder that went off without permission very few blind men care for smoking for the reason that they cannot see the smoke now could you enjoy having the news read to you from an evening newspaper unless you could see the colors of the headlines tis easter day said mrs mccree scramble mine said danny after breakfast he dressed himself in the sabbath morning costume of the canal street importing house dray chauffeur frock coat striped trousers patent leathers gilded trace chain across front of vest and wing collar rolled brim derby and butterfly bow from schonstein s between fourteenth street and tony s fruit stand saturday night sale you ll be goin out this day of course danny said old man mccree a little wistfully tis a kind of holiday they say well it s fine spring weather i can feel it in the air why should i not be going out demanded danny in his grumpiest chest tones should i stay in am i as good as a horse one day of rest my team has a week who earns the money for the rent and the breakfast you ve just eat i d like to know answer me that all right lad said the old man i m not complainin while me two eyes was good there was nothin better to my mind than a sunday out there s a smell of turf and burnin brush comin in the windy i have me tobaccy a good fine day and rist to ye lad times i wish your mother had larned to read so i might hear the rest about the hippopotamus but let that be now what is this foolishness he talks of hippopotamuses asked danny of his mother as he passed through the kitchen have you been taking him to the zoo and for what i have not said mrs mccree he sets by the windy all day tis little recreation a blind man among the poor gets at all i m thinkin they wander in their minds at times one day he talks of grease without stoppin for the most of an hour i looks to see if there s lard burnin in the fryin pan there is not he says i do not understand tis weary days sundays and holidays and all for a blind man danny there was no better nor stronger than him when he had his two eyes tis a fine day son injoy yeself ag inst the morning there will be cold supper at six have you heard any talk of a hippopotamus asked danny of mike the janitor as he went out the door downstairs i have not said mike pulling his shirtsleeves higher but tis the only subject in the animal natural and illegal lists of outrages that i ve not been compained to about these two days see the landlord or else move out if ye like have ye hippopotamuses in the lease no then it was the old man who spoke of it said danny likely there s nothing in it danny walked up the street to the avenue and then struck northward into the heart of the district where easter modern easter in new bright raiment leads the pascal march out of towering brown churches came the blithe music of anthems from the choirs the broad sidewalks were moving parterres of living flowers so it seemed when your eye looked upon the ester girl gentlemen frock coated silk hatted gardeniaed sustained the background of the tradition children carried lilies in their hands the windows of the brownstone mansions were packed with the most opulent creations of flora the sister of the lady of the lilies around a corner white gloved pink gilled and tightly buttoned walked corrigan the cop shield to the curb danny knew him why corrigan he asked is easter i know it comes the first you re full after the moon rises on the seventeenth of march but why is it a proper and religious ceremony or does the governor appoint it out of politics tis an annual celebration said corrigan with the judicial air of the third deputy police commissioner peculiar to new york it extends up to harlem sometimes they has the reserves out at one hundred and twenty fifth street in my opinion tis not political thanks said danny and say did you ever hear a man complain of hippopotamuses when not specially in drink i mean nothing larger than sea turtles said corrigan reflecting and there was wood alcohol in that danny wandered the double heavy incumbency of enjoying simultaneously a sunday and a festival day was his the sorrows of the hand toiler fit him easily they are worn so often that they hang with the picturesque lines of the best tailor made garments that is why well fed artists of pencil and pen find in the griefs of the common people their most striking models but when the philistine would disport himself the grimness of melpomene herself attends upon his capers therefore danny set his jaw hard at easter and took his pleasure sadly the family entrance of dugan s caf e was feasible so danny yielded to the vernal season as far as a glass of bock seated in a dark linoleumed humid back room his heart and mind still groped after the mysterious meaning of the springtime jubilee say tim he said to the waiter why do they have easter skiddoo said tim closing a sophisticated eye is that a new one all right tony pastor s for you last night i guess i give it up what s the answer two apples or a yard and a half from dugan s danny turned back eastward the april sun seemed to stir in him a vague feeling that he could not construe he made a wrong diagnosis and decided that it was katy conlon a block from her house on avenue a he met her going to church they pumped hands on the corner gee but you look dumpish and dressed up said katy what s wrong come away with me to church and be cheerful what s doing at church asked danny why it s easter sunday silly i waited till after eleven expectin you might come around to go what does this easter stand for katy asked danny gloomily nobody seems to know nobody as blind as you said katy with spirit you haven t even looked at my new hat and skirt why it s when all the girls put on new spring clothes silly are you coming to church with me i will said danny if this easter is pulled off there they ought to be able to give some excuse for it not that the hat ain t a beauty the green roses are great at church the preacher did some expounding with no pounding he spoke rapidly for he was in a hurry to get home to his early sabbath dinner but he knew his business there was one word

talking about it eat you said tansey after pondering a moment that can t be there s no plates but a sudden noise warned him to turn down upon him were bearing the captain and a monstrous long bearded dwarf in a spangled cloak and red trunk hose the dwarf leaped twenty feet and clutched them the captain seized katie and hurled her shrieking back into the carriage himself followed and the vehicle dashed away the dwarf lifted tansey high above his head and ran with him into the store holding him with one hand he raised the lid of an enormous chest half filled with cakes of ice flung tansey inside and closed down the cover the force of the fall must have been great for tansey lost consciousness when his faculties revived his first sensation was one of severe cold along his back and limbs opening his eyes he found himself to be seated upon the limestone steps still facing the wall and convent of santa mercedes his first thought was of the ecstatic kiss from katie the outrageous villainy of captain peek the unnatural mystery of the situation his preposterous conflict with the improbable dwarf these things roused and angered him but left no impression of the unreal i ll go back there to morrow he grumbled aloud and knock the head off that comic opera squab running out and picking up perfect strangers and shoving them into cold storage but the kiss remained uppermost in his mind i might have done that long ago he mused she liked it too she called me sam four times i ll not go up that street again too much scrapping guess i ll move down the other way wonder what she meant by saying they were going to eat her tansey began to feel sleepy but after a while he decided to move along again this time he ventured into the street to his left it ran level for a distance and then dipped gently downward opening into a vast dim barren space the old military plaza to his left some hundred yards distant he saw a cluster of flickering lights along the plaza s border he knew the locality at once huddled within narrow confines were the remnants of the once famous purveyors of the celebrated mexican national cookery a few years before their nightly encampments upon the historic alamo plaza in the heart of the city had been a carnival a saturnalia that was renowned throughout the land then the caterers numbered hundreds the patrons thousands drawn by the coquettish senoritas the music of the weird spanish minstrels and the strange piquant mexican dishes served at a hundred competing tables crowds thronged the alamo plaza all night travellers rancheros family parties gay gasconading rounders sightseers and prowlers of polyglot owlish san antone mingled there at the centre of the city s fun and frolic the popping of corks pistols and questions the glitter of eyes jewels and daggers the ring of laughter and coin these were the order of the night but now no longer to some half dozen tents fires and tables had dwindled the picturesque festival and these had been relegated to an ancient disused plaza often had tansey strolled down to these stands at night to partake of the delectable chili con carne a dish evolved by the genius of mexico composed of delicate meats minced with aromatic herbs and the poignant chili colorado a compound full of singular flavour and a fiery zest delightful to the southron s palate the titillating odour of this concoction came now on the breeze to the nostrils of tansey awakening in him hunger for it as he turned in that direction he saw a carriage dash up to the mexicans tents out of the gloom of the plaza some figures moved back and forward in the uncertain light of the lanterns and then the carriage was driven swiftly away tansey approached and sat at one of the tables covered with gaudy oil cloth traffic was dull at the moment a few half grown boys noisily fared at another table the mexicans hung listless and phlegmatic about their wares and it was still the night hum of the city crowded to the wall of dark buildings surrounding the plaza and subsided to an indefinite buzz through which sharply perforated the crackle of the languid fires and the rattle of fork and spoon a sedative wind blew from the southeast the starless firmament pressed down upon the earth like a leaden cover in all that quiet tansey turned his head suddenly and saw without disquietude a troop of spectral horsemen deploy into the plaza and charge a luminous line of infantry that advanced to sustain the shock he saw the fierce flame of cannon and small arms but heard no sound the careless victuallers lounged vacantly not deigning to view the conflict tansey mildly wondered to what nations these mute combatants might belong turned his back to them and ordered his chili and coffee from the mexican woman who advanced to serve him this woman was old and careworn her face was lined like the rind of a cantaloupe she fetched the viands from a vessel set by the smouldering fire and then retired to a tent dark within that stood near by presently tansey heard a turmoil in the tent a wailing broken hearted pleading in the harmonious spanish tongue and then two figures tumbled out into the light of the lanterns one was the old woman the other was a man clothed with a sumptuous and flashing splendour the woman seemed to clutch and beseech from him something against his will the man broke from her and struck her brutally back into the tent where she lay whimpering and invisible observing tansey he walked rapidly to the table where he sat tansey recognized him to be ramon torres a mexican the proprietor of the stand he was

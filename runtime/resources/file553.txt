seem that to their vision towns must appear as large or small ant hills without special characteristics yet it is not so studying the habits of ants frm so great a height should be but a mild diversion when coupled with the soft drink that mythology tells us is their only solace but doubtless they have amused themselves by the comparison of villages and towns and it will be no news to them nor perhaps to many mortals that in one particularity new york stands unique among the cities of the world this shall be the theme of a little story addressed to the man who sits smoking with his sabbath slippered feet on another chair and to the woman who snatches the paper for a moment while boiling greens or a narcotized baby leaves her free with these i love to sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings new york city is inhabited by mysterious strangers thus beating bird centre by three millions and half a dozen nine s they came here in various ways and for many reasons hendrik hudson the art schools green goods the stork the annual dressmakers convention the pennsylvania railroad love of money the stage cheap excursion rates brains personal column ads heavy walking shoes ambition freight trains all these have had a hand in making up the population but every man jack when he first sets foot on the stones of manhattan has got to fight he has got to fight at once until either he or his adversary wins there is no resting between rounds for there are no rounds it is slugging from the first it is a fight to a finish your opponent is the city you must do battle with it from the time the ferry boat lands you on the island until either it is yours or it has conquered you it is the same whether you have a million in your pocket or only the price of a week s lodging the battle is to decide whether you shall become a new yorker or turn the rankest outlander and philistine you must be one or the other you cannot remain neutral you must be for or against lover or enemy bosom friend or outcast and oh the city is a general in the ring not only by blows does it seek to subdue you it woos you to its heart with the subtlety of a siren it is a combination of delilah green chartreuse beethoven chloral and john l in his best days in other cities you may wander and abide as a stranger man as long as you please you may live in chicago until your hair whitens and be a citizen and still prate of beans if boston mothered you and without rebuke you may become a civic pillar in any other town but knickerbocker s and all the time publicly sneering at its buildings comparing them with the architecture of colonel telfair s residence in jackson miss whence you hail and you will not be set upon but in new york you must be either a new yorker or an invader of a modern troy concealed in the wooden horse of your conceited provincialism and this dreary preamble is only to introduce to you the unimportant figures of william and jack they came out of the west together where they had been friends they came to dig their fortunes out of the big city father knickerbocker met them at the ferry giving one a right hander on the nose and the other an upper cut with his left just to let them know that the fight was on william was for business jack was for art both were young and ambitious so they countered and clinched i think they were from nebraska or possibly missouri or minnesota anyhow they were out for success and scraps and scads and they tackled the city like two lochinvars with brass knucks and a pull at the city hall four years afterward william and jack met at luncheon the business man blew in like a march wind hurled his silk hat at a waiter dropped into the chair that was pushed under him seized the bill of fare and had ordered as far as cheese before the artist had time to do more than nod after the nod a humorous smile came into his eyes billy he said you re done for the city has gobbled you up it has taken you and cut you to its pattern and stamped you with its brand you are so nearly like ten thousand men i have seen to day that you couldn t be picked out from them if it weren t for your laundry marks camembert finished william what s that oh you ve still got your hammer out for new york have you well little old noisyville on the subway is good enough for me it s giving me mine and say i used to think the west was the whole round world only slightly flattened at the poles whenever bryan ran i used to yell myself hoarse about the free expense and hang my hat on the horizon and say cutting things in the grocery to little soap drummers from the east but i d never seen new york then jack me for it from the rathskellers up sixth avenue is the west to me now have you heard this fellow crusoe sing the desert isle for him i say but my wife made me go give me may irwin or e s willard any time poor billy said the artist delicately fingering a cigarette you remember when we were on our

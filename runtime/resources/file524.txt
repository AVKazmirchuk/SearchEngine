loves of those restless black insects below compared with the serene and awful immensity of the universe that lies above and around their insignificant city it is guaranteed that the philosopher will have these thoughts they have been expressly compiled from the philosophies of the world and set down with the proper interrogation point at the end of them to represent the invariable musings of deep thinkers on high places and when the philosopher takes the elevator down his mind is broader his heart is at peace and his conception of the cosmogony of creation is as wide as the buckle of orion s summer belt but if your name happened to be daisy and you worked in an eighth avenue candy store and lived in a little cold hall bedroom five feet by eight and earned per week and ate ten cent lunches and were nineteen years old and got up at and worked till and never had studied philosophy maybe things wouldn t look that way to you from the top of a skyscraper two sighed for the hand of daisy the unphilosophical one was joe who kept the smallest store in new york it was about the size of a tool box of the d p w and was stuck like a swallow s nest against a corner of a down town skyscraper its stock consisted of fruit candies newspapers song books cigarettes and lemonade in season when stern winter shook his congealed locks and joe had to move himself and the fruit inside there was exactly room in the store for the proprietor his wares a stove the size of a vinegar cruet and one customer joe was not of the nation that keeps us forever in a furore with fugues and fruit he was a capable american youth who was laying by money and wanted daisy to help him spend it three times he had asked her i got money saved up daisy was his love song and you know how bad i want you that store of mine ain t very big but oh ain t it would be the antiphony of the unphilosophical one why i heard wanamaker s was trying to get you to sublet part of your floor space to them for next year daisy passed joe s corner every morning and evening hello two by four was her usual greeting seems to me your store looks emptier you must have sold a pack of chewing gum ain t much room in here sure joe would answer with his slow grin except for you daise me and the store are waitin for you whenever you ll take us don t you think you might before long store a fine scorn was expressed by daisy s uptilted nose sardine box waitin for me you say gee you d have to throw out about a hundred pounds of candy before i could get inside of it joe i wouldn t mind an even swap like that said joe complimentary daisy s existence was limited in every way she had to walk sideways between the counter and the shelves in the candy store in her own hall bedroom coziness had been carried close to cohesiveness the walls were so near to one another that the paper on them made a perfect babel of noise she could light the gas with one hand and close the door with the other without taking her eyes off the reflection of her brown pompadour in the mirror she had joe s picture in a gilt frame on the dresser and sometimes but her next thought would always be of joe s funny little store tacked like a soap box to the corner of that great building and away would go her sentiment in a breeze of laughter daisy s other suitor followed joe by several months he came to board in the house where she lived his name was dabster and he was a philosopher though young attainments stood out upon him like continental labels on a passaic n j suit case knowledge he had kidnapped from cyclopedias and handbooks of useful information but as for wisdom when she passed he was left sniffling in the road without so much as the number of her motor car he could and would tell you the proportion of water and muscle making properties of peas and veal the shortest verse in the bible the number of pounds of shingle nails required to fasten shingles laid four inches to the weather the population of kankakee ill the theories of spinoza the name of mr h mckay twombly s second hall footman the length of the hoosac tunnel the best time to set a hen the salary of the railway post office messenger between driftwood and red bank furnace pa and the number of bones in the foreleg of a cat the weight of learning was no handicap to dabster his statistics were the sprigs of parsley with which he garnished the feast of small talk that he would set before you if he conceived that to be your taste and again he used them as breastworks in foraging at the boardinghouse firing at you a volley of figures concerning the weight of a lineal foot of bar iron x inches and the average annual rainfall at fort snelling minn he would transfix with his fork the best piece of chicken on the dish while you were trying to rally sufficiently to ask him weakly why does a hen cross the road thus brightly armed and further equipped with a measure of good looks of a hair oily shopping district at three in the afternoon kind it seems that joe of the lilliputian emporium had a rival worthy of his steel but joe carried no steel there wouldn t have been room in his store to draw it if he had one saturday afternoon about four o clock daisy and mr dabster

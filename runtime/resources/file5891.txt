the proof of the pudding usually it is a cold day in july when you can stroll up broadway in that month and get a story out of the drama i found one a few breathless parboiling days ago and it seems to decide a serious question in art there was not a soul left in the city except hollis and me and two or three million sunworshippers who remained at desks and counters the elect had fled to seashore lake and mountain and had already begun to draw for additional funds every evening hollis and i prowled about the deserted town searching for coolness in empty cafes dining rooms and roofgardens we knew to the tenth part of a revolution the speed of every electric fan in gotham and we followed the swiftest as they varied hollis s fiancee miss loris sherman had been in the adirondacks at lower saranac lake for a month in another week he would join her party there in the meantime he cursed the city cheerfully and optimistically and sought my society because i suffered him to show me her photograph during the black coffee every time we dined together my revenge was to read to him my one act play it was one insufferable evening when the overplus of the day s heat was being hurled quiveringly back to the heavens by every surcharged brick and stone and inch of iron in the panting town but with the cunning of the two legged beasts we had found an oasis where the hoofs of apollo s steed had not been allowed to strike our seats were on an ocean of cool polished oak the white linen of fifty deserted tables flapped like seagulls in the artificial breeze a mile away a waiter lingered for a heliographic signal we might have roared songs there or fought a duel without molestation out came miss loris s photo with the coffee and i once more praised the elegant poise of the neck the extremely low coiled mass of heavy hair and the eyes that followed one like those in an oil painting she s the greatest ever said hollis with enthusiasm good as great northern preferred and a disposition built like a watch one week more and i ll be happy jonny on the spot old tom tolliver my best college chum went up there two weeks ago he writes me that loris doesn t talk about anything but me oh i guess rip van winkle didn t have all the good luck yes yes said i hurriedly pulling out my typewritten play she s no doubt a charming girl now here s that little curtain raiser you promised to listen to ever been tried on the stage asked hollis not exactly i answered i read half of it the other day to a fellow whose brother knows robert edeson but he had to catch a train before i finished go on said hollis sliding back in his chair like a good fellow i m no stage carpenter but i ll tell you what i think of it from a first row balcony standpoint i m a theatre bug during the season and i can size up a fake play almost as quick as the gallery can flag the waiter once more and then go ahead as hard as you like with it i ll be the dog i read my little play lovingly and i fear not without some elocution there was one scene in it that i believed in greatly the comedy swiftly rises into thrilling and unexpectedly developed drama capt marchmont suddenly becomes cognizant that his wife is an unscrupulous adventuress who has deceived him from the day of their first meeting the rapid and mortal duel between them from that moment she with her magnificent lies and siren charm winding about him like a serpent trying to recover her lost ground he with his man s agony and scorn and lost faith trying to tear her from his heart that scene i always thought was a crackerjack when capt marchmont discovers her duplicity by reading on a blotter in a mirror the impression of a note that she has written to the count he raises his hand to heaven and exclaims o god who created woman while adam slept and gave her to him for a companion take back thy gift and return instead the sleep though it last forever rot said hollis rudely when i had given those lines with proper emphasis i beg your pardon i said as sweetly as i could come now went on hollis don t be an idiot you know very well that nobody spouts any stuff like that these days that sketch went along all right until you rang in the skyrockets cut out that right arm exercise and the adam and eve stunt and make your captain talk as you or i or bill jones would i ll admit said i earnestly for my theory was being touched upon that on all ordinary occasions all of us use commonplace language to convey our thoughts you will rememberthat up to the moment when the captain makes his terrible discovery all the characters on the stage talk pretty much as they would in real life but i believe that i am right in allowing him lines suitable to the strong and tragic situation into which he falls tragic my eye said my friend irreverently in shakespeare s day he might have sputtered out some high cockalorum nonsense of that sort because in those days they ordered ham and eggs in blank verse and discharged the cook with an epic but not for b way in the summer of it is my opinion said i that great human emotions shake up our vocabulary and leave the words best suited to express them on top a sudden violent grief or loss or disappointment will bring expressions out of an ordinary man as strong and solemn and dramatic as those used in fiction or on the stage to portray those emotions that s where you fellows are wrong said hollis plain every day talk is what goes your captain would very likely have kicked the cat lit a cigar stirred up a highball and telephoned for a lawyer instead of getting off those robert mantell pyrotechnics possibly a little later i continued but just at the time just as the blow is delivered if something scriptural or theatrical and deep tongued isn t wrung from a man in spite of his modern and practical way of speaking then i m wrong of course said hollis kindly you ve got to whoop her up some degrees for the stage the audience expects it when the villain kidnaps little effie you have to make her mother claw some chunks out of the atmosphere and scream me chee ild me chee ild what she would actually do would be to call up the police by phone ring for some strong tea and get the little darling s photo out ready for the reporters when you get your villain in a corner a stage corner it s all right for him to clap his hand to his forehead and hiss all is lost off the stage he would remark this is a conspiracy against me i refer you to my lawyers i get no consolation said i gloomily from your concession of an accentuated stage treatment in my play i fondly hoped that i was following life if people in real life meet great crises in a commonplace way they should do the same on the stage and then we drifted like two trout out of our cool pool in the great hotel and began to nibble languidly at the gay flies in the swift current of broadway and our question of dramatic art was unsettled we nibbled at the flies and avoided the hooks as wise trout do but soon the weariness of manhattan in summer overcame us nine stories up facing the south was hollis s apartment and we soon stepped into an elevator bound for that cooler haven i was familiar in those quarters and quickly my play was forgotten and i stood at a sideboard mixing things with cracked ice and glasses all about me a breeze from the bay came in the windows not altogether blighted by the asphalt furnace over which it had passed hollis whistling softly turned over a late arrived letter or two on his table and drew around the coolest wicker armchairs i was just measuring the vermouth carefully when i heard a sound some man s voice groaned hoarsely false oh god false and love is a lie and friendship but the byword of devils i looked around quickly hollis lay across the table with his head down upon his outstretched arms and then he looked up at me and laughed in his ordinary manner i knew him he was poking fun at me about my theory and it did seem so unnatural those swelling words during our quiet gossip that i half began to believe i had been mistaken that my theory was wrong hollis raised himself slowly from the table you were right about that theatrical business old man he said quietly as he tossed a note to me i read it loris had run away with tom tolliver a little talk about mobs i see remarked the tall gentleman in the frock coat and black slouch hat that another street car motorman in your city has narrowly excaped lynching at the hands of an infuriated mob by lighting a cigar and walking a couple of blocks down the street do you think they would have lynched him asked the new yorker in the next seat of the ferry station who was also waiting for the boat not until after the election said the tall man cutting a corner off his plug of tobacco i ve been in your city long enough to know something about your mobs the motorman s mob is about the least dangerous of them all except the national guard and the dressmakers convention you see when little willie goldstein is sent by his mother for pigs knuckles with a nickel tightly grasped in his chubby fist he always crosses the street car track safely twenty feet ahead of the car and then suddenly turns back to ask his inother whether it was pale ale or a spool of white cotton that she wanted the motorman yells and throws himself on the brakes like a football player there is a horrible grinding and then a ripping sound and a piercing shriek and willie is sitting with part of his trousers torn away by the fender screaming for his lost nickel in ten seconds the car is surrounded by infuriated citizens crying lynch the motorman lynch the motorman at the top of their voices some of them run to the nearest cigar store to get a rope but they find the last one has just been cut up and labelled hundreds of the excited mob press close to the cowering motorman whose hand is observed to tremble perceptibly as he transfers a stick of pepsin gum from his pocket to his mouth when the bloodthirsty mob of maddened citizens has closed in on the motorman some bringing camp stools and sitting quite close to him and all shouting lynch him policeman fogarty forces his way through them to the side of their prospective victim hello mike says the motorman in a low voice nice day shall i sneak off a block or so or would you like to rescue me well jerry if you don t mind says the policeman i d like to disperse the infuriated mob singlehanded i haven t defeated a lynching mob since last tuesday and that was a small one of only that wanted to string up a dago boy for selling wormy pears it would boost me some down at the station all right mike says the motorman anything to oblige i ll turn pale and tremble and he does so and policeman fogarty draws his club and says g wan wid yez and in eight seconds the desperate mob has scattered and gone about its business except about a hundred who remain to search for willie s nickel i never heard of a mob in our city doing violence to a motorman because of an accident said the new yorker you are not liable to said the tall man they know the motorman s all right and that he wouldn t even run over a stray dog if he could help it and they know that not a man among em would tie the knot to hang even a thomas cat that had been tried and condemned and sentenced according to law then why do they become infuriated and make threats of lynching asked the new yorker to assure the motorman answered the tall man that he is safe if they really wanted to do him up they would go into the houses and drop bricks on him from the third story windows new yorkers are not cowards said the other man a little stiffly not one at a time agreed the tall man promptly you ve got a fine lot of single handed scrappers in your town i d rather fight three of you than one and i d go up against all the gas trust s victims in a bunch before i d pass two citizens on a dark corner with my watch chain showing when you get rounded up in a bunch you lose your nerve get you in crowds and you re easy ask the l road guards and george b cortelyou and the tintype booths at coney island divided you stand united you fall e pluribus nihil whenever one of your mobs surrounds a man and begins to holler lynch him he says to himself oh dear i suppose i must look pale to please the boys but i will forsooth let my life insurance premium lapse to morrow this is a sure tip for me to play methuselah straight across the board in the next handicap i can imagine the tortured feelings of a prisoner in the hands of new york policemen when an infuriated mob demands that he be turned over to them for lynching for god s sake officers cries the distracted wretch have ye hearts of stone that ye will not let them wrest me from ye sorry jimmy says one of the policemen but it won t do there s three of us me and darrel and the plain clothes man and there s only sivin thousand of the mob how d we explain it at the office if they took ye jist chase the infuriated aggregation around the corner darrel and we ll be movin along to the station some of our gatherings of excited citizens have not been so harmless said the new yorker with a faint note of civic pride i ll admit that said the tall man a cousin of mine who was on a visit here once had an arm broken and lost an ear in one of them that must have been during the cooper union riots remarked the new yorker not the cooper union explained the tall man but it was a union riot at the vanastor wedding you seem to be in favor of lynch law said the new yorker severely no sir i am not no intelligent man is but sir there are certain cases when people rise in their just majesty and take a righteous vengeance for crimes that the law is slow in punishing i am an advocate of law and order but i will say to you that less than six months ago i myself assisted at the lynching of one of that race that is creating a wide chasm between your section of country and mine sir it is a deplorable condition said the new yorker that exists in the south but i am from indiana sir said the tall man taking another chew and i don t think you will condemn my course when i tell you that the colored man in question had stolen in cash sir from my own brother the snow man editorial note before the fatal illness of william sydney porter known through his literary work as o henry this american master of short story writing had begun for hampton s magazine the story printed below illness crept upon him rapidly and he was compelled to give up writing about at the point where the girl enters the story when he realized that he could do no more it was his lifelong habit to write with a pencil never dictating to a stenographer o henry told in detail the remainder of the snow man to harris merton lyon whom he had often spoken of as one of the most effective short story writers of the present time mr porter had delineated all of the characters leaving only the rounding out of the plot in the final pages to mr lyon housed and windowpaned from it the greatest wonder to little children is the snow to men it is something like a crucible in which their world melts into a white star ten million miles away the man who can stand the test is a snow man and this is his reading by fahrenheit reaumur or moses s carven tablets of stone night had fluttered a sable pinion above the canyon of big lost river and i urged my horse toward the bay horse ranch because the snow was deepening the flakes were as large as an hour s circular tatting by miss wilkins s ablest spinster betokening a heavy snowfall and less entertainment and more adventure than the completion of the tatting could promise i knew ross curtis of the bay horse and that i would be welcome as a snow bound pilgrim both for hospitality s sake and because ross had few chances to confide in living creatures who did not neigh bellow bleat yelp or howl during his discourse the ranch house was just within the jaws of the canyon where its builder may have fatuously fancied that the timbered and rocky walls on both sides would have protected it from the wintry colorado winds but i feared the drift even now through the endless bottomless rift in the hills the speaking tube of the four winds came roaring the voice of the proprietor to the little room on the top floor at my hello a ranch hand came from an outer building and received my thankful horse in another minute ross and i sat by a stove in the dining room of the four room ranch house while the big simple welcome of the household lay at my disposal fanned by the whizzing norther the fine dry snow was sifted and bolted through the cracks and knotholes of the logs the cook room without a separating door appended in there i could see a short sturdy leisurely and weather beaten man moving with professional sureness about his red hot stove his face was stolid and unreadable something like that of a great thinker or of one who had no thoughts to conceal i thought his eye seemed unwarrantably superior to the elements and to the man but quickly attributed that to the characteristic self importance of a petty chef camp cook was the niche that i gave him in the hall of types and he fitted it as an apple fits a dumpling cold it was in spite of the glowing stove and ross and i sat and talked shuddering frequently half from nerves and half from the freezing draughts so he brought the bottle and the cook brought boiling water and we made prodigious hot toddies against the attacks of boreas we clinked glasses often they sounded like icicles dropping from the eaves or like the tinkle of a thousand prisms on a louis xiv chandelier that i once heard at a boarder s dance in the parlor of a ten a week boarding house in gramercy square sic transit silence in the terrible beauty of the snow and of the sphinx and of the stars but they who believe that all things from a without wine table d hote to the crucifixion may be interpreted through music might have found a nocturne or a symphony to express the isolation of that blotted out world the clink of glass and bottle the aeolian chorus of the wind in the house crannies its deeper trombone through the canyon below and the wagnerian crash of the cook s pots and pans united in a fit discordant melody i thought no less welcome an accompaniment was the sizzling of broiling ham and venison cutlet indorsed by the solvent fumes of true java bringing rich promises of comfort to our yearning souls the cook brought the smoking supper to the table he nodded to me democratically as he cast the heavy plates around as though he were pitching quoits or hurling the discus i looked at him with some appraisement and curiosity and much conciliation there was no prophet to tell us when that drifting evil outside might cease to fall and it is well when snow bound to stand somewhere within the radius of the cook s favorable consideration but i could read neither favor nor disapproval in the face and manner of our pot wrestler he was about five feet nine inches and two hundred pounds of commonplace bull necked pink faced callous calm he wore brown duck trousers too tight and too short and a blue flannel shirt with sleeves rolled above his elbows there was a sort of grim steady scowl on his features that looked to me as though he had fixed it there purposely as a protection against the weakness of an inherent amiability that he fancied were better concealed and then i let supper usurp his brief occupancy of my thoughts draw up george said ross let s all eat while the grub s hot you fellows go on and chew answered the cook i ate mine in the kitchen before sun down think it ll be a big snow george asked the ranchman george had turned to reenter the cook room he moved slowly around and looking at his face it seemed to me that he was turning over the wisdom and knowledge of centuries in his head it might was his delayed reply at the door of the kitchen he stopped and looked back at us both ross and i held our knives and forks poised and gave him our regard some men have the power of drawing the attention of others without speaking a word their attitude is more effective than a shout and again it mightn t said george and went back to his stove after we had eaten he came in and gathered the emptied dishes he stood for a moment while his spurious frown deepened it might stop any minute he said or it might keep up for days at the farther end of the cook room i saw george pour hot water into his dishpan light his pipe and put the tableware through its required lavation he then carefully unwrapped from a piece of old saddle blanket a paperback book and settled himself to read by his dim oil lamp and then the ranchman threw tobacco on the cleared table and set forth again the bottles and glasses and i saw that i stood in a deep channel through which the long dammed flood of his discourse would soon be booming but i was half content comparing my fate with that of the late thomas tucker who had to sing for his supper thus doubling the burdens of both himself and his host snow is a hell of a thing said ross by way of a foreword it ain t somehow it seems to me salubrious i can stand water and mud and two inches below zero and a hundred and ten in the shade and medium sized cyclones but this here fuzzy white stuff naturally gets me all locoed i reckon the reason it rattles you is because it changes the look of things so much it s like you had a wife and left her in the morning with the same old blue cotton wrapper on and rides in of a night and runs across her all outfitted in a white silk evening frock waving an ostrich feather fan and monkeying with a posy of lily flowers wouldn t it make you look for your pocket compass you d be liable to kiss her before you collected your presence of mind by and by the flood of ross s talk was drawn up into the clouds so it pleased me to fancy and there condensed into the finer snowflakes of thought and we sat silent about the stove as good friends and bitter enemies will do i thought of boss s preamble about the mysterious influence upon man exerted by that ermine lined monster that now covered our little world and knew he was right of all the curious knickknacks mysteries puzzles indian gifts rat traps and well disguised blessings that the gods chuck down to us from the olympian peaks the most disquieting and evil bringing is the snow by scientific analysis it is absolute beauty and purity so at the beginning we look doubtfully at chemistry it falls upon the world and lo we live in another it hides in a night the old scars and familiar places with which we have grown heart sick or enamored so as quietly as we can we hustle on our embroidered robes and hie us on prince camaralzaman s horse or in the reindeer sleigh into the white country where the seven colors converge this is when our fancy can overcome the bane of it but in certain spots of the earth comes the snow madness made known by people turned wild and distracted by the bewildering veil that has obscured the only world they know in the cities the white fairy who sets the brains of her dupes whirling by a wave of her wand is cast for the comedy role her diamond shoe buckles glitter like frost with a pirouette she invites the spotless carnival but in the waste places the snow is sardonic sponging out the world of the outliers it gives no foothold on another sphere in return it makes of the earth a firmament under foot it leaves us clawing and stumbling in space in an inimical fifth element whose evil outdoes its strangeness and beauty there nature low comedienne plays her tricks on man though she has put him forth as her highest product it appears that she has fashioned him with what seems almost incredible carelessness and indexterity one sided and without balance with his two halves unequally fashioned and joined must he ever jog his eccentric way the snow falls the darkness caps it and the ridiculous man biped strays in accurate circles until he succumbs in the ruins of his defective architecture in the throat of the thirsty the snow is vitriol in appearance as plausible as the breakfast food of the angels it is as hot in the mouth as ginger increasing the pangs of the water famished it is a derivative from water air and some cold uncanny fire from which the caloric has been extracted good has been said of it even the poets crazed by its spell and shivering in their attics under its touch have indited permanent melodies commemorative of its beauty still to the saddest overcoated optimist it is a plague a corroding plague that pharaoh successfully side stepped it beneficently covers the wheat fields swelling the crop and the flour trust gets us by the throat like a sudden quinsy it spreads the tail of its white kirtle over the red seams of the rugged north and the alaskan short story is born etiolated perfidy it shelters the mountain traveler burrowing from the icy air and melting to morrow drowns his brother in the valley below at its worst it is lock and key and crucible and the wand of circe when it corrals man in lonely ranches mountain cabins and forest huts the snow makes apes and tigers of the hardiest it turns the bosoms of weaker ones to glass their tongues to infants rattles their hearts to lawlessness and spleen it is not all from the isolation the snow is not merely a blockader it is a chemical test it is a good man who can show a reaction that is not chiefly composed of a drachm or two of potash and magnesia with traces of adam ananias nebuchadnezzar and the fretful porcupine this is no story you say well let it begin there was a knock at the door is the opening not full of context and reminiscence oh best buyers of best sellers we drew the latch and in stumbled etienne girod as he afterward named himself but just then he was no more than a worm struggling for life enveloped in a killing white chrysalis we dug down through snow overcoats mufflers and waterproofs and dragged forth a living thing with a van dyck beard and marvellous diamond rings we put it through the approved curriculum of snow rubbing hot milk and teaspoonful doses of whiskey working him up to a graduating class entitled to a diploma of three fingers of rye in half a glassful of hot water one of the ranch boys had already come from the quarters at ross s bugle like yell and kicked the stranger s staggering pony to some sheltered corral where beasts were entertained let a paragraphic biography of girod intervene etienne was an opera singer originally we gathered but adversity and the snow had made him non compos vocis the adversity consisted of the stranded san salvador opera company a period of hotel second story work and then a career as a professional palmist jumping from town to town for like other professional palmists every time he worked the heart line too strongly he immediately moved along the line of least resistance though etienne did not confide this to us we surmised that he had moved out into the dusk about twenty minutes ahead of a constable and had thus encountered the snow in his most sacred blue language he dilated upon the subject of snow for etienne was paris born and loved the snow with the same passion that an orchid does mee ser rhable commented etienne and took another three fingers complete cast iron pussy footed blank blank said ross and followed suit rotten said i the cook said nothing he stood in the door weighing our outburst and insistently from behind that frozen visage i got two messages via the m a m wireless one was that george considered our vituperation against the snow childish the other was that george did not love dagoes inasmuch as etienne was a frenchman i concluded i had the message wrong so i queried the other bright eyes you don t really mean dagoes do you and over the wireless came three deathly psychic taps yes then i reflected that to george all foreigners were probably dagoes i had once known another camp cook who had thought mons sig and millie trans mississippi for mlle were italian given names this cook used to marvel therefore at the paucity of neo roman precognomens and therefore why not i have said that snow is a test of men for one day two days etienne stood at the window fletcherizing his finger nails and shrieking and moaning at the monotony to me etienne was just about as unbearable as the snow and so seeking relief i went out on the second day to look at my horse slipped on a stone broke my collarbone and thereafter underwent not the snow test but the test of flat on the back a test that comes once too often for any man to stand however i bore up cheerfully i was now merely a spectator and from my couch in the big room i could lie and watch the human interplay with that detached impassive impersonal feeling which french writers tell us is so valuable to the litterateur and american writers to the faro dealer i shall go crazy in this abominable mee ser rhable place was etienne s constant prediction never knew mark twain to bore me before said ross over and over he sat by the other window hour after hour a box of pittsburg stogies of the length strength and odor of a pittsburg graft scandal deposited on one side of him and roughing it the jumping frog and life on the mississippi on the other for every chapter he lit a new stogy puffing furiously this in time gave him a recurrent premonition of cramps gastritis smoker s colic or whatever it is they have in pittsburg after a too deep indulgence in graft scandals to fend off the colic ross resorted time and again to old doctor still s amber colored u s a colic cure result after forty eight hours nerves positive fact i never knew mark twain to make me tired before positive fact ross slammed roughing it on the floor when you re snowbound this away you want tragedy i guess humor just seems to bring out all your cussedness you read a man s poor pitiful attempts to be funny and it makes you so nervous you want to tear the book up get out your bandana and have a good long cry at the other end of the room the frenchman took his finger nails out of his mouth long enough to exclaim humor humor at such a time as thees my god i shall go crazy in thees abominable supper announced george these meals were not the meals of rabelais who said the great god makes the planets and we make the platters neat by that time the ranch house meals were not affairs of gusto they were mental distraction not bodily provender what they were to be later shall never be forgotten by ross or me or etienne after supper the stogies and finger nails began again my shoulder ached wretchedly and with half closed eyes i tried to forget it by watching the deft movements of the stolid cook suddenly i saw him cock his ear like a dog then with a swift step he moved to the door threw it open and stood there the rest of us had heard nothing what is it george asked ross the cook reached out his hand into the darkness alongside the jamb with careful precision he prodded something then he made one careful step into the snow his back muscles bulged a little under the arms as he stooped and lightly lifted a burden another step inside the door which he shut methodically behind him and he dumped the burden at a safe distance from the fire he stood up and fixed us with a solemn eye none of us moved under that orphic suspense until a woman remarked george miss willie adams was her name vocation school teacher present avocation getting lost in the snow age yum yum the persian for twenty take to the woods if you would describe miss adams a willow for grace a hickory for fibre a birch for the clear whiteness of her skin for eyes the blue sky seen through treetops the silk in cocoons for her hair her voice the murmur of the evening june wind in the leaves her mouth the berries of the wintergreen fingers as light as ferns her toe as small as a deer track general impression upon the dazed beholder you could not see the forest for the trees psychology with a capital p and the foot of a lynx at this juncture stalks into the ranch house three men a cook a pretty young woman all snowbound count me out of it as i did not count anyway i never did with women count the cook out if you like but note the effect upon ross and etienne girod ross dumped mark twain in a trunk and locked the trunk also he discarded the pittsburg scandals also he shaved off a three days beard etienne being french began on the beard first he pomaded it from a little tube of grease hongroise in his vest pocket he combed it with a little aluminum comb from the same vest pocket he trimmed it with manicure scissors from the same vest pocket his light and gallic spirits underwent a sudden miraculous change he hummed a blithe san salvador opera company tune he grinned smirked bowed pirouetted twiddled twaddled twisted and tooralooed gayly the notorious troubadour could not have equalled etienne ross s method of advance was brusque domineering little woman he said you re welcome here and with what he thought subtle double meaning welcome to stay here as long as you like snow or no snow miss adams thanked him a little wildly some of the wintergreen berries creeping into the birch bark she looked around hurriedly as if seeking escape but there was none save the kitchen and the room allotted her she made an excuse and disappeared into her own room later i feigning sleep heard the following mees adams i was almost to perislh die of monotony w en your fair and beautiful face appear in thees mee ser rhable house i opened my starboard eye the beard was being curled furiously around a finger the svengali eye was rolling the chair was being hunched closer to the school teacher s i am french you see temperamental nervous i cannot endure thees dull hours in thees ranch house but a woman comes ah the shoulders gave nine rahs and a tiger what a difference all is light and gay ever ting smile w en you smile you have eart beauty grace my eart comes back to me w en i feel your eart so he laid his hand upon his vest pocket from this vantage point he suddenly snatched at the school teacher s own hand ah mees adams if i could only tell you how i ad dinner remarked george he was standing just behind the frenchman s ear his eyes looked straight into the school teacher s eyes after thirty seconds of survey his lips moved deep in the flinty frozen maelstrom of his face dinner he concluded will be ready in two minutes miss adams jumped to her feet relieved i must get ready for dinner she said brightly and went into her room ross came in fifteen minutes late after the dishes had been cleaned away i waited until a propitious time when the room was temporarily ours alone and told him what had happened he became so excited that he lit a stogy without thinking yeller hided unwashed palm readin skunk he said under his breath i ll shoot him full o holes if he don t watch out talkin that way to my wife i gave a jump that set my collarbone back another week your wife i gasped well i mean to make her that he announced the air in the ranch house the rest of that day was tense with pent up emotions oh best buyers of best sellers ross watched miss adams as a hawk does a hen he watched etienne as a hawk does a scarecrow etienne watched miss adams as a weasel does a henhouse he paid no attention to ross the condition of miss adams in the role of sought after was feverish lately escaped from the agony and long torture of the white cold where for hours nature had kept the little school teacher s vision locked in and turned upon herself nobody knows through what profound feminine introspections she had gone now suddenly cast among men instead of finding relief and security she beheld herself plunged anew into other discomforts even in her own room she could hear the loud voices of her imposed suitors i ll blow you full o holes shouted ross witnesses shrieked etienne waving his hand at the cook and me she could not have known the previous harassed condition of the men fretting under indoor conditions all she knew was that where she had expected the frank freemasonry of the west she found the subtle tangle of two men s minds bent upon exacting whatever romance there might be in her situation she tried to dodge ross and the frenchman by spells of nursing me they also came over to help nurse this combination aroused such a natural state of invalid cussedness on my part that they were all forced to retire once she did manage to whisper i am so worried here i don t know what to do to which i replied gently hitching up my shoulder that i was a hunch savant and that the eighth house under this sign the moon being in virgo showed that everything would turn out all right but twenty minutes later i saw etienne reading her palm and felt that perhaps i might have to recast her horoscope and try for a dark man coming with a bundle toward sunset etienne left the house for a few moments and ross who had been sitting taciturn and morose having unlocked mark twain made another dash it was typical ross talk he stood in front of her and looked down majestically at that cool and perfect spot where miss adams forehead met the neat part in her fragrant hair first however he cast a desperate glance at me i was in a profound slumber little woman he began it s certainly tough for a man like me to see you bothered this way you gulp you have been alone in this world too long you need a protector i might say that at a time like this you need a protector the worst kind a protector who would take a three ring delight in smashing the saffron colored kisser off of any yeller skinned skunk that made himself obnoxious to you hem hem i am a lonely man miss adams i have so far had to carry on my life without the gulp sweet radiance gulp of a woman around the house i feel especially doggoned lonely at a time like this when i am pretty near locoed from havin to stall indoors and hence it was with delight i welcomed your first appearance in this here shack since then i have been packed jam full of more different kinds of feelings ornery mean dizzy and superb than has fallen my way in years miss adams made a useless movement toward escape the ross chin stuck firm i don t want to annoy you miss adams but by heck if it comes to that you ll have to be annoyed and i ll have to have my say this palm ticklin slob of a frenchman ought to be kicked off the place and if you ll say the word off he goes but i don t want to do the wrong thing you ve got to show a preference i m gettin around to the point miss miss willie in my own brick fashion i ve stood about all i can stand these last two days and somethin s got to happen the suspense hereabouts is enough to hang a sheepherder miss willie he lassooed her hand by main force just say the word you need somebody to take your part all your life long will you mar supper remarked george tersely from the kitchen door miss adams hurried away ross turned angrily you i have been revolving it in my head said george he brought the coffee pot forward heavily then bravely the big platter of pork and beans then somberly the potatoes then profoundly the biscuits i have been revolving it in my mind there ain t no use waitin any longer for swengalley might as well eat now from my excellent vantage point on the couch i watched the progress of that meal ross muddled glowering disappointed etienne eternally blandishing attentive ogling miss adams nervous picking at her food hesitant about answering questions almost hysterical now and then the solid flitting shadow of the cook passing behind their backs like a dreadnaught in a fog i used to own a clock which gurgled in its throat three minutes before it struck the hour i know therefore the slow freight of anticipation for i have awakened at three in the morning heard the clock gurgle and waited those three minutes for the three strokes i knew were to come alors in ross s ranch house that night the slow freight of climax whistled in the distance etienne began it after supper miss aclams had suddenly displayed a lively interest in the kitchen layout and i could see her in there chatting brightly at george not with him the while he ducked his head and rattled his pans my fren said etienne exhaling a large cloud from his cigarette and patting ross lightly on the shoulder with a bediamonded hand which hung limp from a yard or more of bony arm i see i mus be frank with you firs because we are rivals second because you take these matters so serious i i am frenchman i love the women he threw back his curls bared his yellow teeth and blew an unsavory kiss toward the kitchen it is i suppose a trait of my nation all frenchmen love the women pretty women now look here i am he spread out his arms cold outside i detes the col l l snow i abominate the mees ser rhable snow two men this pointing to me an this pointing to ross i am distracted for two whole days i stan at the window an tear my air i am nervous upset pr r ro foun ly distress inside my ead an suddenly be old a woman a nice pretty charming innocen young woman i naturally rejoice i become myself again gay light earted appy i address myself to mademoiselle it passes the time that m sieu is wot the women are for pass the time entertainment like the music like the wine they appeal to the mood the caprice the temperamen to play with thees woman follow her through her humor pursue her ah that is the mos delightful way to sen the hours about their business ross banged the table shut up you miserable yeller pup he roared i object to your pursuin anything or anybody in my house now you listen to me you he picked up the box of stogies and used it on the table as an emphasizer the noise of it awoke the attention of the girl in the kitchen unheeded she crept into the room i don t know anything about your french ways of lovemakin an i don t care in my section of the country it s the best man wins and i m the best man here and don t you forget it this girl s goin to be mine there ain t g oing to be any playing or philandering or palm reading about it i ve made up my mind i ll have this girl and that settles it my word is the law in this neck o the woods she s mine and as soon as she says she s mine you pull out the box made one final tremendous punctuation point etienne s bravado was unruffled ah that is no way to win a woman he smiled easily i make prophecy you will never win er that way no not thees woman she mus be played along an then keessed this charming delicious little creature one kees an then you ave her again he displayed his unpleasant teeth i make you a bet i will kees her as a cheerful chronicler of deeds done well it joys me to relate that the hand which fell upon etienne s amorous lips was not his own there was one sudden sound as of a mule kicking a lath fence and then through the swinging doors of oblivion for etienne i had seen this blow delivered it was an aloof unstudied almost absent minded affair i had thought the cook was rehearsing the proper method of turning a flapjack silently lost in thought he stood there scratching his head then he began rolling down his sleeves you d better get your things on miss and we ll get out of here he decided wrap up warm i heard her heave a little sigh of relief as she went to get her cloak sweater and hat ross jumped to his feet and said george what are you goin to do george who had been headed in my direction slowly swivelled around and faced his employer bein a camp cook i ain t over burdened with hosses george enlightened us therefore i am going to try to borrow this feller s here for the first time in four days my soul gave a genuine cheer if it s for lochinvar purposes go as far as you like i said grandly the cook studied me a moment as if trying to find an insult in my words no he replied it s for mine and the young lady s purposes and we ll go only three miles to hicksville now let me tell you somethin ross suddenly i was confronted with the cook s chunky back and i heard a low curt carrying voice shoot through the room at my host george had wheeled just as ross started to speak you re nutty that s what s the matter with you you can t stand the snow you re getting nervouser and nuttier every day that and this dago he jerked a thumb at the half dead frenchman in the corner has got you to the point where i thought i better horn in i got to revolving it around in my mind and i seen if somethin wasn t done and done soon there d be murder around here and maybe his head gave an imperceptible list toward the girl s room worse he stopped but he held up a stubby finger to keep any one else from speaking then he plowed slowly through the drift of his ideas about this here woman i know you ross and i know what you reely think about women if she hadn t happened in here durin this here snow you d never have given two thoughts to the whole woman question likewise when the storm clears and you and the boys go hustlin out this here whole business ll clear out of your head and you won t think of a skirt again until kingdom come just because o this snow here don t forget you re living in the selfsame world you was in four days ago and you re the same man too now what s the use o getting all snarled up over four days of stickin in the house that there s what i been revolvin in my mind and this here s the decision i ve come to he plodded to the door and shouted to one of the ranch hands to saddle my horse ross lit a stogy and stood thoughtful in the middle of the room then he began i ve a durn good notion george to knock your confounded head off and throw you into that snowbank if you re wrong mister that ain t a durned good notion you ve got it s durned bad look here he pointed steadily out of doors until we were both forced to follow his finger you re in here for more n a week yet after allowing this fact to sink in he barked out at ross can you cook then at me can you cook then he looked at the wreck of etienne and sniffed there was an embarrassing silence as ross and i thought solemnly of a foodless week if you just use hoss sense concluded george and don t go for to hurt my feelin s all i want to do is to take this young gal down to hicksville and then i ll head back here and cook fer you the horse and miss adams arrived simultaneously both of them very serious and quiet the horse because he knew what he had before him in that weather the girl because of what she had left behind then all at once i awoke to a realization of what the cook was doing my god man i cried aren t you afraid to go out in that snow behind my back i heard ross mutter not him george lifted the girl daintily up behind the saddle drew on his gloves put his foot in the stirrup and turned to inspect me leisurely as i passed slowly in his review i saw in my mind s eye the algebraic equation of snow the equals sign and the answer in the man before me snow is my last name said george he swung into the saddle and they started cautiously out into the darkening swirl of fresh new currency just issuing from the snowdrop mint the girl to keep her place clung happily to the sturdy figure of the camp cook i brought three things away from ross curtis s ranch house yes four one was the appreciation of snow which i have so humbly tried here to render was a collarbone of which i am extra careful was a memory of what it is to eat very extremely bad food for a week and was the cause of a little note delivered at the end of the week and hand painted in blue pencil on a sheet of meat paper i cannot come back there to that there job mrs snow say no george i been revolvin it in my mind considerin circumstances she s right whirligigs the world and the door a favourite dodge to get your story read by the public is to assert that it is true and then add that truth is stranger than fiction i do not know if the yarn i am anxious for you to read is true but the spanish purser of the fruit steamer el carrero swore to me by the shrine of santa guadalupe that he had the facts from the u s vice consul at la paz a person who could not possibly have been cognizant of half of them as for the adage quoted above i take pleasure in punc turing it by affirming that i read in a purely fictional story the other day the line be it so said the police man nothing so strange has yet cropped out in truth when h ferguson hedges millionaire promoter investor and man about new york turned his thoughts upon matters convivial and word of it went down the line bouncers took a precautionary turn at the indian clubs waiters put ironstone china on his favourite tables cab drivers crowded close to the curbstone in front of all night caf s and careful cashiers in his regular haunts charged up a few bottles to his account by way of preface and introduction as a money power a one millionaire is of small account in a city where the man who cuts your slice of beef behind the free lunch counter rides to work in his own automobile but hedges spent his money as lavishly loudly and showily as though he were only a clerk squandering a week s wages and after all the bartender takes no interest in your reserve fund he would rather look you up on his cash register than in bradstreet on the evening that the material allegation of facts begins hedges was bidding dull care begone in the com pany of five or six good fellows acquaintances and friends who had gathered in his

and quarrelsome he was burly and tough iron gray but vigorous good for the rest of the night there was a dispute about nothing that matters and the five fingered words were passed the words that represent the glove cast into the lists merriam played the r le of the verbal hotspur hedges rose quickly seized his chair swung it once and smashed wildly dowp at merriam s head merriam dodged drew a small revolver and shot hedges in the chest the leading roysterer stumbled fell in a wry heap and lay still wade a commuter had formed that habit of prompt ness he juggled merriam out a side door walked him to the corner ran him a block and caught a hansom they rode five minutes and then got out on a dark corner and dismissed the cab across the street the lights of a small saloon betrayed its hectic hospitality go in the back room of that saloon said wade and wait i ll go find out what s doing and let you know you may take two drinks while i am gone no more at ten minutes to one o clock wade returned brace up old chap he said the ambulance got there just as i did the doctor says he s dead you may have one more drink you let me run this thing for you you ve got to skip i don t believe a chair is legally a deadly weapon you ve got to make tracks that s all there is to it merriam complained of the cold querulously and asked for another drink did you notice what big veins he had on

hustler and the hardest hitter in anybody s cow camp an afternoon miracle at the united states end of an international river bridge four armed rangers sweltered in a little dobe hut keeping a fairly faithful espionage upon the lagging trail of passengers from the mexican side bud dawson proprietor of the top notch saloon had on the evening previous violently ejected from his premises one leandro garcia for alleged violation of the top notch code of behaviour garcia had mentioned twenty four hours as a limit by which time he would call and collect a painful indemnity for personal satisfaction this mexican although a tremendous braggart was thoroughly courageous and each side of the river respected him for one of these attributes he and a following of similar bravoes were addicted to the pastime of retrieving towns from stagnation the day designated by garcia for retribution was to be further signalised on the american side by a cattlemen s convention a bull fight and an old settlers barbecue and picnic knowing the avenger to be a man of his word and believing it prudent to court peace while three such gently social relaxations were in progress captain mcnulty of the ranger company stationed there detailed his lieutenant and three men for duty at the end of the bridge their instructions were to prevent the invasion of garcia either alone or attended by his gang travel was slight that sultry afternoon and the rangers swore gently and mopped their brows in their convenient but close quarters for an hour no one had crossed save an old woman enveloped in a brown wrapper and a black mantilla driving before her a burro loaded with kindling wood tied in small bundles for peddling then three shots were fired down the street the sound coming clear and snappy through the still air the four rangers quickened from sprawling symbolic figures of indolence to alert life but only one rose to his feet three turned their eyes beseechingly but hopelessly upon the fourth who had gotten nimbly up and was buckling his cartridge belt around him the three knew that lieutenant bob buckley in command would allow no man of them the privilege of investigating a row when he himself might go the agile broad chested lieutenant without a change of expression in his smooth yellow brown melancholy face shot the belt strap through the guard of the buckle hefted his sixes in their holsters as a belle gives the finishing touches to her toilette caught up his winchester and dived for the door there he paused long enough to caution his comrades to maintain their watch upon the bridge and then plunged into the broiling highway the three relapsed into resigned inertia and plaintive comment i ve heard of fellows grumbled broncho leathers what was wedded to danger but if bob buckley ain t committed bigamy with trouble i m a son of a gun peculiarness of bob is inserted the nueces kid he ain t had proper trainin he never learned how to git skeered now a man ought to be skeered enough when he tackles a fuss to hanker after readin his name on the list of survivors anyway buckley commented ranger no who was a misguided eastern man burdened with an education scraps in such a solemn manner that i have been led to doubt its spontaneity i m not quite onto his system but he fights like tybalt by the book of arithmetic i never heard mentioned broncho about any of dibble s ways of mixin scrappin and cipherin triggernometry suggested the nueces infant that s rather better than i hoped from you nodded the easterner approvingly the other meaning is that buckley never goes into a fight without giving away weight he seems to dread taking the slightest advantage that s quite close to foolhardiness when you are dealing with horse thieves and fence cutters who would ambush you any night and shoot you in the back if they could buckley s too full of sand he ll play horatius and hold the bridge once too often some day i m on there drawled the kid i mind that bridge gang in the reader me i go instructed for the other chap spurious somebody the one that fought and pulled his freight to fight em on some other day anyway summed up broncho bob s about the gamest man i ever see along the rio bravo great sam houston if she gets any hotter she ll sizzle broncho whacked at a scorpion with his four pound stetson felt and the three watchers relapsed into comfortless silence how well bob buckley had kept his secret since these men for two years his side comrades in countless border raids and dangers thus spake of him not knowing that he was the most arrant physical coward in all that rio bravo country neither his friends nor his enemies had suspected him of aught else than the finest courage it was purely a physical cowardice and only by an extreme grim effort of will had he forced his craven body to do the bravest deeds scourging himself always as a monk whips his besetting sin buckley threw himself with apparent recklessness into every danger with the hope of some day ridding himself of the despised affliction but each successive test brought no relief and the ranger s face by nature adapted to cheerfulness and good humour became set to the guise of gloomy melancholy thus while the frontier admired his deeds and his prowess was celebrated in print and by word of mouth in many camp fires in the valley of the bravo his heart was sick within him only himself knew of the horrible tightening of the chest the dry mouth the weakening of the spine the agony of the strung nerves the never failing symptoms of his shameful malady one mere boy in his company was wont to enter a fray with a leg perched flippantly about the horn of his saddle a cigarette hanging from his lips which emitted smoke and original slogans of clever invention buckley would have given a year s pay to attain that devil may care method once the debonair youth said to him buck you go into a scrap like it was a funeral not he added with a complimentary wave of his tin cup but what it generally is buckley s conscience was of the new england order with western adjustments and he continued to get his rebellious body into as many difficulties as possible wherefore on that sultry afternoon he chose to drive his own protesting limbs to investigation of that sudden alarm that had startled the peace and dignity of the state two squares down the street stood the top notch saloon here buckley came upon signs of recent upheaval a few curious spectators pressed about its front entrance grinding beneath their heels the fragments of a plate glass window inside buckley found bud dawson utterly ignoring a bullet wound in his shoulder while he feelingly wept at having to explain why he failed to drop the blamed masquerooter who shot him at the entrance of the ranger bud turned appealingly to him for confirmation of the devastation he might have dealt you know buck i d a plum got him first rattle if i d thought a minute come in a masque rootin playin female till he got the drop and turned loose i never reached for a gun thinkin it was sure chihuahua betty or mrs atwater or anyhow one of the mayfield girls comin a gunnin which they might liable as not i never thought of that blamed garcia until garcia snapped buckley how did he get over here bud s bartender took the ranger by the arm and led him to the side door there stood a patient grey burro cropping the grass along the gutter with a load of kindling wood tied across its back on the ground lay a black shawl and a voluminous brown dress masquerootin in them things called bud still resisting attempted ministrations to his wounds thought he was a lady till he gave a yell and winged me he went down this side street said the bartender he was alone and he ll hide out till night when his gang comes over you ought to find him in that mexican lay out below the depot he s got a girl down there pancha sales how was he armed asked buckley two pearl handled sixes and a knife keep this for me billy said the ranger handing over his winchester quixotic perhaps but it was bob buckley s way another man and a braver one might have raised a posse to accompany him it was buckley s rule to discard all preliminary advantage the mexican had left behind him a wake of closed doors and an empty street but now people were beginning to emerge from their places of refuge with assumed unconsciousness of anything having happened many citizens who knew the ranger pointed out to him with alacrity the course of garcia s retreat as buckley swung along upon the trail he felt the beginning of the suffocating constriction about his throat the cold sweat under the brim of his hat the old shameful dreaded sinking of his heart as it went down down down in his bosom the morning train of the mexican central had that day been three hours late thus failing to connect with the i g n on the other side of the river passengers for los estados unidos grumblingly sought entertainment in the little swaggering mongrel town of two nations for until the morrow no other train would come to rescue them grumblingly because two days later would begin the great fair and races in san antone consider that at that time san antone was the hub of the wheel of fortune and the names of its spokes were cattle wool faro running horses and ozone in those times cattlemen played at crack loo on the sidewalks with double eagles and gentlemen backed their conception of the fortuitous card with stacks limited in height only by the interference of gravity wherefore thither journeyed the sowers and the reapers they who stampeded the dollars and they who rounded them up especially did the caterers to the amusement of the people haste to san antone two greatest shows on earth were already there and dozens of smallest ones were on the way on a side track near the mean little dobe depot stood a private car left there by the mexican train that morning and doomed by an ineffectual schedule to ignobly await amid squalid surroundings connection with the next day s regular the car had been once a common day coach but those who had sat in it and gringed to the conductor s hat band slips would never have recognised it in its transformation paint and gilding and certain domestic touches had liberated it from any suspicion of public servitude the whitest of lace curtains judiciously screened its windows from its fore end drooped in the torrid air the flag of mexico from its rear projected the stars and stripes and a busy stovepipe the latter reinforcing in its suggestion of culinary comforts the general suggestion of privacy and ease the beholder s eye regarding its gorgeous sides found interest to culminate in a single name in gold and blue letters extending almost its entire length a single name the audacious privilege of royalty and genius doubly then was this arrogant nomenclature here justified for the name was that of alvarita queen of the serpent tribe this her car was back from a triumphant tour of the principal mexican cities and now headed for san antonio where according to promissory advertisement she would exhibit her marvellous dominion and fearless control over deadly and venomous serpents handling them with ease as they coil and hiss to the terror of thousands of tongue tied tremblers one hundred in the shade kept the vicinity somewhat depeopled this quarter of the town was a ragged edge its denizens the bubbling froth of five nations its architecture tent jacal and dobe its distractions the hurdy gurdy and the informal contribution to the sudden stranger s store of experience beyond this dishonourable fringe upon the old town s jowl rose a dense mass of trees surmounting and filling a little hollow through this bickered a small stream that perished down the sheer and disconcerting side of the great canon of the rio bravo del norte in this sordid spot was condemned to remain for certain hours the impotent transport of the queen of the serpent tribe the front door of the car was open its forward end was curtained off into a small reception room here the admiring and propitiatory reporters were wont to sit and transpose the music of senorita alvarita s talk into the more florid key of the press a picture of abraham lincoln hung against a wall one of a cluster of school girls grouped upon stone steps was in another place a third was easter lilies in a blood red frame a neat carpet was under foot a pitcher sweating cold drops and a glass stood on a fragile stand in a willow rocker reading a newspaper sat alvarita spanish you would say andalusian or better still basque that compound like the diamond of darkness and fire hair the shade of purple grapes viewed at midnight eyes long dusky and disquieting with their untroubled directness of gaze face haughty and bold touched with a pretty insolence that gave it life to hasten conviction of her charm but glance at the stacks of handbills in the corner green and yellow and white upon them you see an incompetent presentment of the senorita in her professional garb and pose irresistible in black lace and yellow ribbons she faces you a blue racer is spiralled upon each bare arm coiled twice about her waist and once about her neck his horrid head close to hers you perceive kuku the great eleven foot asian python a hand drew aside the curtain that partitioned the car and a middle aged faded woman holding a knife and a half peeled potato looked in and said alviry are you right busy i m reading the home paper ma what do you think that pale tow headed matilda price got the most votes in the news for the prettiest girl in gallipo lees shush she wouldn t of done it if you d been home alviry lord knows i hope we ll be there before fall s over i m tired gallopin round the world playin we are dagoes and givin snake shows but that ain t what i wanted to say that there biggest snake s gone again i ve looked all over the car and can t find him he must have been gone an hour i remember hearin somethin rustlin along the floor but i thought it was you oh blame that old rascal exclaimed the queen throwing down her paper this is the third time he s got away george never will fasten down the lid to his box properly i do believe he s afraid of kuku now i ve got to go hunt him better hurry somebody might hurt him the queen s teeth showed in a gleaming contemptuous smile no danger when they see kuku outside they simply scoot away and buy bromides there s a crick over between here and the river that old scamp d swap his skin any time for a drink of running water i guess i ll find him there all right a few minutes later alvarita stopped upon the forward platform ready for her quest her handsome black skirt was shaped to the most recent proclamation of fashion her spotless shirt waist gladdened the eye in that desert of sunshine a swelling oasis cool and fresh a man s split straw hat sat firmly on her coiled abundant hair beneath her serene round impudent chin a man s four in hand tie was jauntily knotted about a man s high stiff collar a parasol she carried of white silk and its fringe was lace yellowly genuine i will grant gallipolis as to her costume but firmly to seville or valladolid i am held by her eyes castanets balconies mantillas serenades ambuscades escapades all these their dark depths guaranteed ain t you afraid to go out alone alviry queried the queen mother anxiously there s so many rough people about mebbe you d better i never saw anything i was afraid of yet ma specially people and men in particular don t you fret i ll trot along back as soon as i find that runaway scamp the dust lay thick upon the bare ground near the tracks alvarita s eye soon discovered the serrated trail of the escaped python it led across the depot grounds and away down a smaller street in the direction of the little canon as predicted by her a stillness and lack of excitement in the neighbourhood encouraged the hope that as yet the inhabitants were unaware that so formidable a guest traversed their highways the heat had driven them indoors whence outdrifted occasional shrill laughs or the depressing whine of a maltreated concertina in the shade a few mexican children like vivified stolid idols in clay stared from their play vision struck and silent as alvarita came and went here and there a woman peeped from a door and stood dumb reduced to silence by the aspect of the white silk parasol a hundred yards and the limits of the town were passed scattered chaparral succeeding and then a noble grove overflowing the bijou canon through this a small bright stream meandered park like it was with a kind of cockney ruralness further endorsed by the waste papers and rifled tins of picnickers up this stream and down it among its pseudo sylvan glades and depressions wandered the bright and unruffled alvarita once she saw evidence of the recreant reptile s progress in his distinctive trail across a spread of fine sand in the arroyo the living water was bound to lure him he could not be far away so sure was she of his immediate proximity that she perched herself to idle for a time in the curve of a great creeper that looped down from a giant water elm to reach this she climbed from the pathway a little distance up the side of a steep and rugged incline around her chaparral grew thick and high a late blooming ratama tree dispensed from its yellow petals a sweet and persistent odour adown the ravine rustled a seductive wind melancholy with the taste of sodden fallen leaves alvarita removed her hat and undoing the oppressive convolutions of her hair began to slowly arrange it in two long dusky plaits from the obscure depths of a thick clump of evergreen shrubs five feet away two small jewel bright eyes were steadfastly regarding her coiled there lay kuku the great python kuku the magnificent he of the plated muzzle the grooved lips the eleven foot stretch of elegantly and brilliantly mottled skin the great python was viewing his mistress without a sound or motion to disclose his presence perhaps the splendid truant forefelt his capture but screened by the foliage thought to prolong the delight of his escapade what pleasure it was after the hot and dusty car to lie thus smelling the running water and feeling the agreeable roughness of the earth and stones against his body soon very soon the queen would find him and he powerless as a worm in her audacious hands would be returned to the dark chest in the narrow house that ran on wheels alvarita heard a sudden crunching of the gravel below her turning her head she saw a big swarthy mexican with a daring and evil expression contemplating her with an ominous dull eye what do you want she asked as sharply as five hairpins between her lips would permit continuing to plait her hair and looking him over with placid contempt the mexican continued to gaze at her and showed his teeth in a white jagged smile i no hurt y you senorita he said you bet you won t answered the queen shaking back one finished massive plait but don t you think you d better move on not hurt y you no but maybeso take one beso one li l kees you call him the man smiled again and set his foot to ascend the slope alvarita leaned swiftly and picked up a stone the size of a cocoanut vamoose quick she ordered peremptorily you coon the red of insult burned through the mexican s dark skin hidalgo yo he shot between his fangs i am not neg r ro diabla bonita for that you shall pay me he made two quick upward steps this time but the stone hurled by no weak arm struck him square in the chest he staggered back to the footway swerved half around and met another sight that drove all thoughts of the girl from his head she turned her eyes to see what had diverted his interest a man with red brown curling hair and a melancholy sunburned smooth shaven face was coming up the path twenty yards away around the mexican s waist was buckled a pistol belt with two empty holsters he had laid aside his sixes possibly in the jacal of the fair pancha and had forgotten them when the passing of the fairer alvarita had enticed him to her trail his hands now flew instinctively to the holsters but finding the weapons gone he spread his fingers outward with the eloquent abjuring deprecating latin gesture and stood like a rock seeing his plight the newcomer unbuckled his own belt containing two revolvers threw it upon the ground and continued to advance splendid murmured alvarita with flashing eyes as bob buckley according to the mad code of bravery that his sensitive conscience imposed upon his cowardly nerves abandoned his guns and closed in upon his enemy the old inevitable nausea of abject fear wrung him his breath whistled through his constricted air passages his feet seemed like lumps of lead his mouth was dry as dust his heart congested with blood hurt his ribs as it thumped against them the hot june day turned to moist november and still he advanced spurred by a mandatory pride that strained its uttermost against his weakling flesh the distance between the two men slowly lessened the mexican stood immovable waiting when scarce five yards separated them a little shower of loosened gravel rattled down from above to the ranger s feet he glanced upward with instinctive caution a pair of dark eyes brilliantly soft and fierily tender encountered and held his own the most fearful heart and the boldest one in all the rio bravo country exchanged a silent and inscrutable communication alvarita still seated within her vine leaned forward above the breast high chaparral one hand was laid across her bosom one great dark braid curved forward over her shoulder her lips were parted her face was lit with what seemed but wonder great and absolute wonder her eyes lingered upon buckley s let no one ask or presume to tell through what subtle medium the miracle was performed as by a lightning flash two clouds will accomplish counterpoise and compensation of electric surcharge so on that eyeglance the man received his complement of manhood and the maid conceded what enriched her womanly grace by its loss the mexican suddenly stirring ventilated his attitude of apathetic waiting by conjuring swiftly from his bootleg a long knife buckley cast aside his hat and laughed once aloud like a happy school boy at a frolic then empty handed he sprang nimbly and garcia met him without default so soon was the engagement ended that disappointment imposed upon the ranger s warlike ecstasy instead of dealing the traditional downward stroke the mexican lunged straight with his knife buckley took the precarious chance and caught his wrist fair and firm then he delivered the good saxon knock out blow always so pathetically disastrous to the fistless latin races and garcia was down and out with his head under a clump of prickly pears the ranger looked up again to the queen of the serpents alvarita scrambled down to the path i m mighty glad i happened along when i did said the ranger he he frightened me so cooed alvarita they did not hear the long low hiss of the python under the shrubs wiliest of the beasts no doubt he was expressing the humiliation he felt at having so long dwelt in subjection to this trembling and colouring mistress of his whom he had deemed so strong and potent and fearsome then came galloping to the spot the civic authorities and to them the ranger awarded the prostrate disturber of the peace whom they bore away limply across the saddle of one of their mounts but buckley and alvarita lingered slowly slowly they walked the ranger regained his belt of weapons with a fine timidity she begged the indulgence of fingering the great s with little ohs and ahs of new born delicious shyness the canoncito was growing dusky beyond its terminus in the river bluff they could see the outer world yet suffused with the waning glory of sunset a scream a piercing scream of fright from alvarita back she cowered and the ready protecting arm of buckley formed her refuge what terror so dire as to thus beset the close of the reign of the never before daunted queen across the path there crawled a caterpillar a horrid fuzzy two inch caterpillar truly kuku thou went avenged thus abdicated the queen of the serpent tribe viva la reina the higher abdication curly the tramp sidled toward the free lunch counter he caught a fleeting glance from the bartender s eye and stood still trying to look like a business man who had just dined at the menger and was waiting for a friend who had promised to pick him up in his motor car curly s histrionic powers were equal to the impersonation but his make up was wanting the bartender rounded the bar in a casual way looking up at the ceiling as though he was pondering some intricate problem of kalsomining and then fell upon curly so suddenly that the roadster had no excuses ready irresistibly but so composedly that it seemed almost absendmindedness on his part the dispenser of drinks pushed curly to the swinging doors and kicked him out with a nonchalance that almost amounted to sadness that was the way of the southwest curly arose from the gutter leisurely he felt no anger or resentment toward his ejector fifteen years of tramphood spent out of the twenty two years of his life had hardened the fibres of his spirit the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune fell blunted from the buckler of his armoured pride with especial resignation did he suffer contumely and injury at the hands of bartenders naturally they were his enemies and unnaturally they were often his friends he had to take his chances with them but he had not yet learned to estimate these cool languid southwestern knights of the bungstarter who had the manners of an earl of pawtucket and who when they disapproved of your presence moved you with the silence and despatch of a chess automaton advancing a pawn curly stood for a few moments in the narrow mesquite paved street san antonio puzzled and disturbed him three days he had been a non paying guest of the town having dropped off there from a box car of an i g n freight because greaser johnny had told him in des moines that the alamo city was manna fallen gathered cooked and served free with cream and sugar curly had found the tip partly a good one there was hospitality in plenty of a careless liberal irregular sort but the town itself was a weight upon his spirits after his experience with the rushing business like systematised cities of the north and east here he was often flung a dollar but too frequently a good natured kick would follow it once a band of hilarious cowboys had roped him on military plaza and dragged him across the black soil until no respectable rag bag would have stood sponsor for his clothes the winding doubling streets leading nowhere bewildered him and then there was a little river crooked as a pot hook that crawled through the middle of the town crossed by a hundred little bridges so nearly alike that they got on curly s nerves and the last bartender wore a number nine shoe the saloon stood on a corner the hour was eight o clock homefarers and outgoers jostled curly on the narrow stone sidewalk between the buildings to his left he looked down a cleft that proclaimed itself another thoroughfare the alley was dark except for one patch of light where there was light there were sure to be human beings where there were human beings after nightfall in san antonio there might be food and there was sure to be drink so curly headed for the light the illumination came from schwegel s cafe on the sidewalk in front of it curly picked up an old envelope it might have contained a check for a million it was empty but the wanderer read the address mr otto schwegel and the name of the town and state the postmark was detroit curly entered the saloon and now in the light it could be perceived that he bore the stamp of many years of vagabondage he had none of the tidiness of the calculating and shrewd professional tramp his wardrobe represented the cast off specimens of half a dozen fashions and eras two factories had combined their efforts in providing shoes for his feet as you gazed at him there passed through your mind vague impressions of mummies wax figures russian exiles and men lost on desert islands his face was covered almost to his eyes with a curly brown beard that he kept trimmed short with a pocket knife and that had furnished him with his nom de route light blue eyes full of sullenness fear cunning impudence and fawning witnessed the stress that had been laid upon his soul the saloon was small and in its atmosphere the odours of meat and drink struggled for the ascendancy the pig and the cabbage wrestled with hydrogen and oxygen behind the bar schwegel laboured with an assistant whose epidermal pores showed no signs of being obstructed hot weinerwurst and sauerkraut were being served to purchasers of beer curly shuffled to the end of the bar coughed hollowly and told schwegel that he was a detroit cabinet maker out of a job it followed as the night the day that he got his schooner and lunch was you acquainted maybe with heinrich strauss in detroit asked schwegel did i know heinrich strauss repeated curly affectionately why say bo i wish i had a dollar for every game of pinochle me and heine has played on sunday afternoons more beer and a second plate of steaming food was set before the diplomat and then curly knowing to a fluid drachm how far a con game would go shuffled out into the unpromising street and now he began to perceive the inconveniences of this stony southern town there was none of the outdoor gaiety and brilliancy and music that provided distraction even to the poorest in the cities of the north here even so early the gloomy rock walled houses were closed and barred against the murky dampness of the night the streets were mere fissures through which flowed grey wreaths of river mist as he walked he heard laughter and the chink of coin and chips behind darkened windows and music coming from every chink of wood and stone but the diversions were selfish the day of popular pastimes had not yet come to san antonio but at length curly as he strayed turned the sharp angle of another lost street and came upon a rollicking band of stockmen from the outlying ranches celebrating in the open in front of an ancient wooden hotel one great roisterer from the sheep country who had just instigated a movement toward the bar swept curly in like a stray goat with the rest of his flock the princes of kine and wool hailed him as a new zoological discovery and uproariously strove to preserve him in the diluted alcohol of their compliments and regards an hour afterward curly staggered from the hotel barroom dismissed by his fickle friends whose interest in him had subsided as quickly as it had risen full stoked with alcoholic fuel and cargoed with food the only question remaining to disturb him was that of shelter and bed a drizzling cold texas rain had begun to fall an endless lazy unintermittent downfall that lowered the spirits of men and raised a reluctant steam from the warm stones of the streets and houses thus comes the norther dousing gentle spring and amiable autumn with the chilling salutes and adieux of coming and departing winter curly followed his nose down the first tortuous street into which his irresponsible feet conducted him at the lower end of it on the bank of the serpentine stream he perceived an open gate in a cemented rock wall inside he saw camp fires and a row of low wooden sheds built against three sides of the enclosing wall he entered the enclosure under the sheds many horses were champing at their oats and corn many wagons and buckboards stood about with their teams harness thrown carelessly upon the shafts and doubletrees curly recognised the place as a wagon yard such as is provided by merchants for their out of town friends and customers no one was in sight no doubt the drivers of those wagons were scattered about the town seeing the elephant and hearing the owl in their haste to become patrons of the town s dispensaries of mirth and good cheer the last ones to depart must have left the great wooden gate swinging open curly had satisfied the hunger of an anaconda and the thirst of a camel so he was neither in the mood nor the condition of an explorer he zigzagged his way to the first wagon that his eyesight distinguished in the semi darkness under the shed it was a two horse wagon with a top of white canvas the wagon was half filled with loose piles of wool sacks two or three great bundles of grey blankets and a number of bales bundles and boxes a reasoning eye would have estimated the load at once as ranch supplies bound on the morrow for some outlying hacienda but to the drowsy intelligence of curly they represented only warmth and softness and protection against the cold humidity of the night after several unlucky efforts at last he conquered gravity so far as to climb over a wheel and pitch forward upon the best and warmest bed he had fallen upon in many a day then he became instinctively a burrowing animal and dug his way like a prairie dog down among the sacks and blankets hiding himself from the cold air as snug and safe as a bear in his den for three nights sleep had visited curly only in broken and shivering doses so now when morpheus condescended to pay him a call curly got such a strangle hold on the mythological old gentleman that it was a wonder that anyone else in the whole world got a wink of sleep that night six cowpunchers of the cibolo ranch were waiting around the door of the ranch store their ponies cropped grass near by tied in the texas fashion which is not tied at all their bridle reins had been dropped to the earth which is a more effectual way of securing them such is the power of habit and imagination than you could devise out of a half inch rope and a live oak tree these guardians of the cow lounged about each with a brown cigarette paper in his hand and gently but unceasingly cursed sam revell the storekeeper sam stood in the door snapping the red elastic bands on his pink madras shirtsleeves and looking down affectionately at the only pair of tan shoes within a forty mile radius his offence had been serious and he was divided between humble apology and admiration for the beauty of his raiment he had allowed the ranch stock of smoking to become exhausted i thought sure there was another case of it under the counter boys he explained but it happened to be catterdges you ve sure got a case of happenedicitis said poky rodgers

comfortably on the steps of the store inside sam chopped open with a hatchet the tops of the cans of fruit the store a big white wooden building like a barn stood fifty yards from the ranch house beyond it were the horse corrals and still farther the wool sheds and the brush topped shearing pens for the rancho cibolo raised both cattle and sheep behind the store at a little distance were the grass thatched jacals of the mexicans who bestowed their allegiance upon the cibolo the ranch house was composed of four large rooms with plastered adobe walls and a two room wooden ell a twenty feet wide gallery circumvented the structure it was set in a grove of immense live oaks and water elms near a lake a long not very wide and tremendously deep lake in which at nightfall great gars leaped to the surface and plunged with the noise of hippopotamuses frolicking at their bath from the trees hung garlands and massive pendants of the melancholy grey moss of the south indeed the cibolo ranch house seemed more of the south than of the west it looked as if old kiowa truesdell might have brought it with him from the lowlands of mississippi when he came to texas with his rifle in the hollow of his arm in but though he did not bring the family mansion truesdell did bring something in the way of a family inheritance that was more lasting than brick or stone he brought one end of the truesdell curtis family feud and when a curtis bought the rancho de los olmos sixteen miles from the cibolo there were lively times on the pear flats and in the chaparral thickets off the southwest in those days truesdell cleaned the brush of many a wolf and tiger cat and mexican lion and one or two curtises fell heirs to notches on his rifle stock also he buried a brother with a curtis bullet in him on the bank of the lake at cibolo and then the kiowa indians made their last raid upon the ranches between the frio and the rio grande and truesdell at the head of his rangers rid the earth of them to the last brave earning his sobriquet then came prosperity in the form of waxing herds and broadening lands and then old age and bitterness when he sat with his great mane of hair as white as the spanish dagger blossoms and his fierce pale blue eyes on the shaded gallery at cibolo growling like the pumas that he had slain he snapped his fingers at old age the bitter taste to life did not come from that the cup that stuck at his lips was that his only son ransom wanted to marry a curtis the last youthful survivor of the other end of the feud for a while the only sounds to be heard at the store were the rattling of the tin spoons and the gurgling intake of the juicy fruits by the cowpunchers the stamping of the grazing ponies and the singing of a doleful song by sam as he contentedly brushed his stiff auburn hair for the twentieth time that day before a crinkly mirror from the door of the store could be seen the irregular sloping stretch of prairie to the south with its reaches of light green billowy mesquite flats in the lower places and its rises crowned with nearly black masses of short chaparral through the mesquite flat wound the ranch road that five miles away flowed into the old government trail to san antonio the sun was so low that the gentlest elevation cast its grey shadow miles into the green gold sea of sunshine that evening ears were quicker than eyes the mexican held up a tawny finger to still the scraping of tin against tin one waggeen said he cross dthe arroyo hondo ah hear dthe wheel verree rockee place dthe hondo you ve got good ears gregorio said mustang taylor i never heard nothin but the song bird in the bush and the zephyr skallyhootin across the peaceful dell in ten minutes taylor remarked i see the dust of a wagon risin right above the fur end of the flat you have verree good eyes senor said gregorio smiling two miles away they saw a faint cloud dimming the green ripples of the mesquites in twenty minutes they heard the clatter of the horses hoofs in five minutes more the grey plugs dashed out of the thicket whickering for oats and drawing the light wagon behind them like a toy from the jacals came a cry of el amo el amo four mexican youths raced to unharness the greys the cowpunchers gave a yell of greeting and delight ranse truesdell driving threw the reins to the ground and laughed it s under the wagon sheet boys he said i know what you re waiting for if sam lets it run out again we ll use those yellow shoes of his for a target there s two cases pull em out and light up i know you all want a smoke after striking dry country ranse had removed the wagon sheet from the bows and thrown it over the goods in the wagon six pair of hasty hands dragged it off and grabbled beneath the sacks and blankets for the cases of tobacco long collins tobacco messenger from the san gabriel outfit who rode with the longest stirrups west of the mississippi delved with an arm like the tongue of a wagon he caught something harder than a blanket and pulled out a fearful thing a shapeless muddy bunch of leather tied together with wire and twine from its ragged end like the head and claws of a disturbed turtle protruded human toes who ee yelled long collins ranse are you a packin around of corpuses here s a howlin grasshoppers up from his long slumber popped curly like some vile worm from its burrow he clawed his way out and sat blinking like a disreputable drunken owl his face was as bluish red and puffed and seamed and cross lined as the cheapest round steak of the butcher his eyes were swollen slits his nose a pickled beet his hair would have made the wildest thatch of a jack in the box look like the satin poll of a cleo de merode the rest of him was scarecrow done to the life ranse jumped down from his seat and looked at his strange cargo with wide open eyes here you maverick what are you doing in my wagon how did you get in there the punchers gathered around in delight for the time they had forgotten tobacco curly looked around him slowly in every direction he snarled like a scotch terrier through his ragged beard where is this he rasped through his parched throat it s a damn farm in an old field what d you bring me here for say did i say i wanted to come here what are you reubs rubberin at hey g wan or i ll punch some of yer faces drag him out collins said ranse curly took a slide and felt the ground rise up and collide with his shoulder blades he got up and sat on the steps of the store shivering from outraged nerves hugging his knees and sneering taylor lifted out a case of tobacco and wrenched off its top six cigarettes began to glow bringing peace and forgiveness to sam how d you come in my wagon repeated ranse this time in a voice that drew a reply curly recognised the tone he had heard it used by freight brakemen and large persons in blue carrying clubs me he growled oh was you talkin to me why i was on my way to the menger but my valet had forgot to pack my pyjamas so i crawled into that wagon in the wagon yard see i never told you to bring me out to this bloomin farm see what is it mustang asked poky rodgers almost forgetting to smoke in his

volunteered long collins them galliwampuses has fins on their backs and eighteen toes this here is a hicklesnifter it lives under the ground and eats cherries don t stand so close to it it wipes out villages with one stroke of its prehensile tail sam the cosmopolite who called bartenders in san antone by their first name stood in the door he was a better zoologist well ain t that a willie for your whiskers he commented where d you dig up the hobo ranse goin to make an auditorium for inbreviates out of the ranch say said curly from whose panoplied breast all shafts of wit fell blunted any

you to drive me to a farm i want a drink i m goin all to little pieces what s doin ranse saw that the tramp s nerves were racking him he despatched one of the mexican boys to the ranch house for a glass of whisky curly gulped it down and into his eyes came a brief grateful glow as human as the expression in the eye of a faithful setter dog thanky boss he said quietly you re thirty miles from a railroad and forty miles from a saloon said ranse curly fell back weakly against the steps since you are here continued the ranchman come along with me we can t turn you out on the prairie a rabbit might tear you to pieces he conducted curly to a large shed where the ranch vehicles were kept there he spread out a canvas cot and brought blankets i don t suppose you can sleep said ranse since you ve been pounding your ear for twenty four hours but you can camp here till morning i ll have pedro fetch you up some grub sleep said curly i can sleep a week say sport have you got a coffin nail on you fifty miles had ransom truesdell driven that day and yet this is what he did old kiowa truesdell sat in his great wicker chair reading by the light of an immense oil lamp ranse laid a bundle of newspapers fresh from town at his elbow back ranse said the old man looking up son old kiowa continued i ve been thinking all day about a certain matter that we have talked about i want you to tell me again i ve lived for you i ve fought wolves and indians and worse white men to protect you you never had any mother that you can remember i ve taught you to shoot straight ride hard and live clean later on i ve worked to pile up dollars that ll be yours you ll be a rich man ranse when my chunk goes out i ve made you i ve licked you into shape like a leopard cat licks its cubs you don t belong to yourself you ve got to be a truesdell first now is there to be any more nonsense about this curtis girl i ll tell you once more said ranse slowly as i am a truesdell and as you are my father i ll never marry a curtis good boy said old kiowa you d better go get some supper ranse went to the kitchen at the rear of the house pedro the mexican cook sprang up to bring the food he was keeping warm in the stove just a cup of coffee pedro he said and drank it standing and then there s a tramp on a cot in the wagon shed take him something to eat better make it enough for two ranse walked out toward the jacals a boy came running manuel can you catch vaminos in the little pasture for me why not senor i saw him near the puerta but two hours past he bears a drag rope get him and saddle him as quick as you can prontito senor soon mounted on vaminos ranse leaned in the saddle pressed with his knees and galloped eastward past the store where sat sam trying his guitar in the moonlight vaminos shall have a word vaminos the good dun horse the mexicans who have a hundred names for the colours of a horse called him gruyo he was a mouse coloured slate coloured flea bitten roan dun if you can conceive it down his back from his mane to his tail went a line of black he would live forever and surveyors have not laid off as many miles in the world as he could travel in a day eight miles east of the cibolo ranch house ranse loosened the pressure of his knees and vaminos stopped under a big ratama tree the yellow ratama blossoms showered fragrance that would have undone the roses of france the moon made the earth a great concave bowl with a crystal sky for a lid in a glade five jack rabbits leaped and played together like kittens eight miles farther east shone a faint star that appeared to have dropped below the horizon night riders who often steered their course by it knew it to be the light in the rancho de los olmos in ten minutes yenna curtis galloped to the tree on her sorrel pony dancer the two leaned and clasped hands heartily i ought to have ridden nearer your home said ranse but you never will let me yenna laughed and in the soft light you could see her strong white teeth and fearless eyes no sentimentality there in spite of the moonlight the odour of the ratamas and the admirable figure of ranse truesdell the lover but she was there eight miles from her home to meet him how often have i told you ranse she said that i am your half way girl always half way well said ranse with a question in his tones i did said yenna with almost a sigh i told him after dinner when i thought he would be in a good humour did you ever wake up a lion ranse with the mistaken idea that he would be a kitten he almost tore the ranch to pieces it s all up i love my daddy ranse and i m afraid i m afraid of him too he ordered me to promise that i d never marry a truesdell i promised that s all what luck did you have the same said ranse slowly i promised him that his son would never marry a curtis somehow i couldn t go against him he s mighty old i m sorry yenna the girl leaned in her saddle and laid one hand on ranse s on the horn of his saddle i never thought i d like you better for giving me up she said ardently but i do i must ride back now ranse i slipped out of the house and saddled dancer myself good night neighbour good night said ranse ride carefully over them badger holes they wheeled and rode away in opposite directions yenna turned in her saddle and called clearly don t forget i m your half way girl ranse damn all family feuds and inherited scraps muttered ranse vindictively to the breeze as he rode back to the cibolo ranse turned his horse into the small pasture and went to his own room he opened the lowest drawer of an old bureau to get out the packet of letters that yenna had written him one summer when she had gone to mississippi for a visit the drawer stuck and he yanked at it savagely as a man will it came out of the bureau and bruised both his shins as a drawer will an old folded yellow letter without an envelope fell from somewhere probably from where it had lodged in one of the upper drawers ranse took it to the lamp and read it curiously then he took his hat and walked to one of the mexican jacals tia juana he said i would like to talk with you a while an old old mexican woman white haired and wonderfully wrinkled rose from a stool sit down said ranse removing his hat and taking the one chair in the jacal who am i tia juana he asked speaking spanish don ransom our good friend and employer why do you ask answered the old woman wonderingly tia juana who am i he repeated with his stern eyes looking into hers a frightened look came in the old woman s face she fumbled with her black shawl who am i tia

the two little horizontal slits that he used for eyes this was the man that old man ellison met on the trail and when you count up in the baron s favour that he was sixty five and weighed ninety eight pounds and had heard of king james s record and that he the baron had a hankering for the vita simplex and had no gun with him and wouldn t have used it if he had you can t censure him if i tell you that the smiles with which the troubadour had filled his wrinkles went out of them and left them plain wrinkles again but he was not the kind of baron that flies from danger he reined in the mile an hour pony no difficult feat and saluted the formidable monarch king james expressed himself with royal directness you re that old snoozer that s running sheep on this range ain t you said he what right have you got to do it do you own any land or lease any i have two sections leased from the state said old man ellison mildly not by no means you haven t said king james your lease expired yesterday and i had a man at the land office on the minute to take it up you don t control a foot of grass in texas you sheep men have got to git your time s up it s a cattle country and there ain t any room in it for snoozers this range you ve got your sheep on is mine i m putting up a wire fence forty by sixty miles and if there s a sheep inside of it when it s done it ll be a dead one i ll give you a week to move yours away if they ain t gone by then i ll send six men over here with winchesters to make mutton out of the whole lot and if i find you here at the same time this is what you ll get king james patted the breech of his shot gun warningly old man ellison rode on to the camp of incarnacion he sighed many times and the wrinkles in his face grew deeper rumours that the old order was about to change had reached him before the end of free grass was in sight other troubles too had been accumulating upon his shoulders his flocks were decreasing instead of growing the price of wool was declining at every clip even bradshaw the storekeeper at frio city at whose store he bought his ranch supplies was dunning him for his last six months bill and threatening to cut him off and so this last greatest calamity suddenly dealt out to him by the terrible king james was a crusher when the old man got back to the ranch at sunset he found sam galloway lying on his cot propped against a roll of blankets and wool sacks fingering his guitar hello uncle ben the troubadour called cheerfully you rolled in early this evening i been trying a new twist on the spanish fandango to day i just about got it here s how she goes listen that s fine that s mighty fine said old man ellison sitting on the kitchen step and rubbing his white scotch terrier whiskers i reckon you ve got all the musicians beat east and west sam as far as the roads are cut out oh i don t know said sam reflectively but i certainly do get there on variations i guess i can handle anything in five flats about as well as any of em but you look kind of fagged out uncle ben ain t you feeling right well this evening little tired that s all sam if you ain t played yourself out let s have that mexican piece that starts off with huile huile palomita it seems that that song always kind of soothes and comforts me after i ve been riding far or anything bothers me why seguramente senor said sam i ll hit her up for you as often as you like and before i forget about it uncle ben you want to jerk bradshaw up about them last hams he sent us they re just a little bit strong a man sixty five years old living on a sheep ranch and beset by a complication of disasters cannot successfully and continuously dissemble moreover a troubadour has eyes quick to see unhappiness in others around him because it disturbs his own ease so on the next day sam again questioned the old man about his air of sadness and abstraction then old man ellison told him the story of king james s threats and orders and that pale melancholy and red ruin appeared to have marked him for their own the troubadour took the news thoughtfully he had heard much about king james on the third day of the seven days of grace allowed him by the autocrat of the range old man ellison drove his buckboard to frio city to fetch some necessary supplies for the ranch bradshaw was hard but not implacable he divided the old man s order by two and let him have a little more time one article secured was a new fine ham for the pleasure of the troubadour five miles out of frio city on his way home the old man met king james riding into town his majesty could never look anything but fierce and menacing but to day his slits of eyes appeared to be a little wider than they usually were good day said the king gruffly i ve been wanting to see you i hear it said by a cowman from sandy yesterday that you was from jackson county mississippi originally i want to know if that s a fact born there said old man ellison and raised there till i was twenty one this man says went on king james that he thinks you was related to the jackson county reeveses was he right aunt caroline reeves said the old man was my half sister she was my aunt said king james i run away from home when i was sixteen now let s re talk over some things that we discussed a few days ago they call me a bad man and they re only half right there s plenty of room in my pasture for your bunch of sheep and their increase for a long time to come aunt caroline used to cut out sheep in cake dough and bake em for me you keep your sheep where they are and use all the range you want how s your finances the old man related his woes in detail dignifiedly with restraint and candour she used to smuggle extra grub into my school basket i m speaking of aunt caroline said king james i m going over to frio city to day and i ll ride back by your ranch to morrow i ll draw out of the bank there and bring it over to you and i ll tell bradshaw to let you have everything you want on credit you are bound to have heard the old saying at home that the jackson county reeveses and kings would stick closer by each other than chestnut burrs well i m a king yet whenever i run a cross a reeves so you look out for me along about sundown to morrow and don t worry about nothing shouldn t wonder if the dry spell don t kill out the young grass old man ellison drove happily ranchward once more the smiles filled out his wrinkles very suddenly by the magic of kinship and the good that lies somewhere in all hearts his troubles had been removed on reaching the ranch he found that sam galloway was not there his guitar hung by its buckskin string to a hackberry limb moaning as the gulf breeze blew across its masterless strings the kiowa endeavoured to explain sam he catch pony said he and say he ride to frio city what for no can damn sabe say he come back to night maybe so that all as the first stars came out the troubadour rode back to his haven he pastured his pony and went into the house his spurs jingling martially old man ellison sat at the kitchen table having a tin cup of before supper coffee he looked contented and pleased hello sam said he i m darned glad to see ye back i don t know how i managed to get along on this ranch anyhow before ye dropped in to cheer things up i ll bet ye ve been skylarking around with some of them frio city gals now that s kept ye so late and then old man ellison took another look at sam s face and saw that the minstrel had changed the man of action and while sam is unbuckling from his waist old man ellison s six shooter that the latter had left behind when he drove to town we may well pause to remark that anywhere and whenever a troubadour lays down the guitar and takes up the sword trouble is sure to follow it is not the expert thrust of athos nor the cold skill of aramis nor the iron wrist of porthos that we have to fear it is the gascon s fury the wild and unacademic attack of the troubadour the sword of d artagnan i done it said sam i went over to frio city to do it i couldn t let him put the skibunk on you uncle ben i met him in summers s saloon i knowed what to do i said a few things to him that nobody else heard he reached for his gun first half a dozen fellows saw him do it but i got mine unlimbered first three doses i gave him right around the lungs and a saucer could have covered up all of em he won t bother you no more this is king james you speak of asked old man ellison while he sipped his coffee you bet it was and they took me before the county judge and the witnesses what saw him draw his gun first was all there well of course they put me under bond to appear before the court but there was four or five boys on the spot ready to sign the bail he won t bother you no more uncle ben you ought to have seen how close them bullet holes was together i reckon playing a guitar as much as i do must kind of limber a fellow s trigger finger up a little don t you think uncle ben then there was a little silence in the castle except for the spluttering of a venison steak that the kiowa was cooking sam said old man ellison stroking his white whiskers with a tremulous hand would you mind getting the guitar and playing that huile huile palomita piece once or twice it always seems to be kind of soothing and comforting when a man s tired and fagged out there is no more to be said except that the title of the story is wrong it should have been called the last of the barons there never will be an end to the troubadours and now and then it does seem that the jingle of their guitars will drown the sound of the muffled blows of the pickaxes and trip hammers of all the workers in the world the sleuths in the big city a man will disappear with the suddenness and completeness of the flame of a candle that is blown out all the agencies of inquisition the hounds of the trail the sleuths of the city s labyrinths the closet detectives of theory and induction will be invoked to the search most often the man s face will be seen no more sometimes he will reappear in sheboygan or in the wilds of terre haute calling himself one of the synonyms of smith and without memory of events up to a certain time including his grocer s bill sometimes it will be found after dragging the rivers and polling the restaurants to see if he may be waiting for a well done sirloin that he has moved next door this snuffing out of a human being like the erasure of a chalk man from a blackboard is one of the most impressive themes in dramaturgy the case of mary snyder in point should not be without interest a man of middle age of the name of meeks came from the west to new york to find his sister mrs mary snyder a widow aged fifty two who had been living for a year in a tenement house in a crowded neighbourhood at her address he was told that mary snyder had moved away longer than a month before no one could tell him her new address on coming out mr meeks addressed a policeman who was standing on the corner and explained his dilemma my sister is very poor he said and i am anxious to find her i have recently made quite a lot of money in a lead mine and i want her to share my prosperity there is no use in advertising her because she cannot read the policeman pulled his moustache and looked so thoughtful and mighty that meeks could almost feel the joyful tears of his sister mary dropping upon his bright blue tie you go down in the canal street neighbourhood said the policeman and get a job drivin the biggest dray you can find there s old women always gettin knocked over by drays down there you might see er among em if you don t want to do that you better go round to headquarters and get em to put a fly cop onto the dame at police headquarters meeks received ready assistance a general alarm was sent out and copies of a photograph of mary snyder that her brother had were distributed among the stations in mulberry street the chief assigned detective mullins to the case the detective took meeks aside and said this is not a very difficult case to unravel shave off your whiskers fill your pockets with good cigars and meet me in the cafe of the waldorf at three o clock this afternoon meeks obeyed he found mullins there they had a bottle of wine while the detective asked questions concerning the missing woman now said mullins new york is a big city but we ve got the detective business systematized there are two ways we can go about finding your sister we will try one of em first you say she s fifty two a little past said meeks the detective conducted the westerner to a branch advertising office of one of the largest dailies there he wrote the following ad and submitted it to meeks wanted at once one hundred attractive chorus girls for a new musical comedy apply all day at no broadway meeks was indignant my sister said he is a poor hard working elderly woman i do not see what aid an advertisement of this kind would be toward finding her all right said the detective i guess you don t know new york but if you ve got a grouch against this scheme we ll try the other one it s a sure thing but it ll cost you more never mind the expense said meeks we ll try it the sleuth led him back to the waldorf engage a couple of bedrooms and a parlour he advised and let s go up this was done and the two were shown to a superb suite on the fourth floor meeks looked puzzled the detective sank into a velvet armchair and pulled out his cigar case i forgot to suggest old man he said that you should have taken the rooms by the month they wouldn t have stuck you so much for em by the month exclaimed meeks what do you mean oh it ll take time to work the game this way i told you it would cost you more we ll have to wait till spring there ll be a new city directory out then very likely your sister s name and address will be in it meeks rid himself of the city detective at once on the next day some one advised him to consult shamrock jolnes new york s famous private detective who demanded fabulous fees but performed miracles in the way of solving mysteries and crimes after waiting for two hours in the anteroom of the great detective s apartment meeks was shown into his presence jolnes sat in a purple dressing gown at an inlaid ivory chess table with a magazine before him trying to solve the mystery of they the famous sleuth s thin intellectual face piercing eyes and rate per word are too well known to need description meeks set forth his errand my fee if successful will be said shamrock jolnes meeks bowed his agreement to the price i will undertake your case mr meeks said jolnes finally the disappearance of people in this city has always been an interesting problem to me i remember a case that i brought to a successful outcome a year ago a family bearing the name of clark disappeared suddenly from a small flat in which they were living i watched the flat building for two months for a clue one day it struck me that a certain milkman and a grocer s boy always walked backward when they carried their wares upstairs following out by induction the idea that this observation gave me i at once located the missing family they had moved into the flat across the hall and changed their name to kralc shamrock jolnes and his client went to the tenement house where mary snyder had lived and the detective demanded to be shown the room in which she had lived it had been occupied by no tenant since her disappearance the room was small dingy and poorly furnished meeks seated himself dejectedly on a broken chair while the great detective searched the walls and floor and the few sticks of old rickety furniture for a clue at the end of half an hour jolnes had collected a few seemingly unintelligible articles a cheap black hat pin a piece torn off a theatre programme and the end of a small torn card on which was the word left and the characters c shamrock jolnes leaned against the mantel for ten minutes with his head resting upon his hand and an absorbed look upon his intellectual face at the end of that time he exclaimed with animation come mr meeks the problem is solved i can take you directly to the house where your sister is living and you may have no fears concerning her welfare for she is amply provided with funds for the present at least meeks felt joy and wonder in equal proportions how did you manage it he asked with admiration in his tones perhaps jolnes s only weakness was a professional pride in his wonderful achievements in induction he was ever ready to astound and charm his listeners by describing his methods by elimination said jolnes spreading his clues upon a little table i got rid of certain parts of the city to which mrs snyder might have removed you see this hatpin that eliminates brooklyn no woman attempts to board a car at the brooklyn bridge without being sure that she carries a hatpin with which to fight her way into a seat and now i will demonstrate to you that she could not have gone to harlem behind this door are two hooks in the wall upon one of these mrs snyder has hung her bonnet and upon the other her shawl you will observe that the bottom of the hanging shawl has gradually made a soiled streak against the plastered wall the mark is clean cut proving that there is no fringe on the shawl now was there ever a case where a middle aged woman wearing a shawl boarded a harlem train without there being a fringe on the shawl to catch in the gate and delay the passengers behind her so we eliminate harlem therefore i conclude that mrs snyder has not moved very far away on this torn piece of card you see the word left the letter c and the number now i happen to know that no avenue c is a first class boarding house far beyond your sister s means as we suppose but then i find this piece of a theatre programme crumpled into an odd shape what meaning does it convey none to you very likely mr meeks but it is eloquent to one whose habits and training take cognizance of the small est things you have told me that your sister was a scrub woman she scrubbed the floors of offices and hallways let us assume that she procured such work to perform in a theatre where is valuable jewellery lost the oftenest mr meeks in the theatres of course look at that piece of programme mr meeks observe the round impression in it it has been wrapped around a ring perhaps a ring of great value mrs snyder found the ring while at work in the theatre she hastily tore off a piece of a programme wrapped the ring carefully and thrust it into her bosom the next day she disposed of it and with her increased means looked about her for a more comfortable place in which to live when i reach thus far in the chain i see nothing impossible about no avenue c it is there we will find your sister mr meeks shamrock jolnes concluded his convincing speech with the smile of a successful artist meeks s admiration was too great for words together they went to no avenue c it was an old fashioned brownstone house in a prosperous and respectable neighbourhood they rang the bell and on inquiring were told that no mrs snyder was known there and that not within six months had a new occupant come to the house when they reached the sidewalk again meeks examined the clues which he had brought away from his sister s old room i am no detective he remarked to jolnes as he raised the piece of theatre programme to his nose but it seems to me that instead of a ring having been wrapped in this paper it was one of those round peppermint drops and this piece with the address on it looks to me like the end of a seat coupon no row c left aisle shamrock jolnes had a far away look in his eyes i think you would do well to consult juggins said he who is juggins asked meeks he is the leader said jolnes of a new modern school of detectives their methods are different from ours but it is said that juggins has solved some extremely puzzling cases i will take you to him they found the greater juggins in his office he was a small man with light hair deeply absorbed in reading one of the bourgeois works of nathaniel hawthorne the two great detectives of different schools shook hands with ceremony and meeks was introduced state the facts said juggins going on with his reading when meeks ceased the greater one closed his book and said do i understand that your sister is fifty two years of age with a large mole on the side of her nose and that she is a very poor widow making a scanty living by scrubbing and with a very homely face and figure that describes her exactly admitted meeks juggins rose and put on his hat in fifteen minutes he said i will return bringing you her present address shamrock jolnes turned pale but forced a smile within the specified time juggins returned and consulted a little slip of paper held in his hand your sister mary snyder he announced calmly will be found at no chilton street she is living in the back hall bedroom five flights up the house is only four blocks from here he continued addressing meeks suppose you go and verify the statement and then return here mr jolnes will await you i dare say meeks hurried away in twenty minutes he was back again with a beaming face she is there and well he cried name your fee two dollars said juggins when meeks had settled his bill and departed shamrock jolnes stood with his hat in his hand before juggins if it would not be asking too much he stammered if you would favour me so far would you object to certainly not said juggins pleasantly i will tell you how i did it you remember the description of mrs snyder did you ever know a woman like that who wasn t paying weekly instalments on an enlarged crayon portrait of herself the biggest factory of that kind in the country is just around the corner i went there and got her address off the books that s all witches loaves miss martha meacham kept the little bakery on the corner the one where you go up three steps and the bell tinkles when you open the door miss martha was forty her bank book showed a credit of two thousand dollars and she possessed two false teeth and a sympathetic heart many people have married whose chances to do so were much inferior to miss martha s two or three times a week a customer came in in whom she began to take an interest he was a middle aged man wearing spectacles and a brown beard trimmed to a careful point he spoke english with a strong german accent his clothes were worn and darned in places and wrinkled and baggy in others but he looked neat and had very good manners he always bought two loaves of stale bread fresh bread was five cents a loaf stale ones were two for five never did he call for anything but stale bread once miss martha saw a red and brown stain on his fingers she was sure then that he was an artist and very poor no doubt he lived in a garret where he painted pictures and ate stale bread and thought of the good things to eat in miss martha s bakery often when miss martha sat down to her chops and light rolls and jam and tea she would sigh and wish that the gentle mannered artist might share her tasty meal instead of eating his dry crust in that draughty attic miss martha s heart as you have been told was a sympathetic one in order to test her theory as to his occupation she brought from her room one day a painting that she had bought at a sale and set it against the shelves behind the bread counter it was a venetian scene a splendid marble palazzio so it said on the picture stood in the foreground or rather forewater for the rest there were gondolas with the lady trailing her hand in the water clouds sky and chiaro oscuro in plenty no artist could fail to notice it two days afterward the customer came in two loafs of stale bread if you blease you haf here a fine bicture madame he said while she was wrapping up the bread yes says miss martha reveling in her own cunning i do so admire art and no it would not do to say artists thus early and paintings she substituted you think it is a good picture der balance said the customer is not in good drawing der bairspective of it is not true goot morning madame he took his bread bowed and hurried out yes he must be an artist miss martha took the picture back to her room how gentle and kindly his eyes shone behind his spectacles what a broad brow he had to be able to judge perspective at a glance and to live on stale bread but genius often has to struggle before it is recognized what a thing it would be for art and perspective if genius were backed by two thousand dollars in bank a bakery and a sympathetic heart to but these were day dreams miss martha often now when he came he would chat for a while across the showcase he seemed to crave miss martha s cheerful words he kept on buying stale bread never a cake never a pie never one of her delicious sally lunns she thought he began to look thinner and discouraged her heart ached to add something good to eat to his meagre purchase but her courage failed at the act she did not dare affront him she knew the pride of artists miss martha took to wearing her blue dotted silk waist behind the counter in the back room she cooked a mysterious compound of quince seeds and borax ever so many people use it for the complexion one day the customer came in as usual laid his nickel on the showcase and called for his stale loaves while miss martha was reaching for them there was a great tooting and clanging and a fire engine came lumbering past the customer hurried to the door to look as any one will suddenly inspired miss martha seized the opportunity on the bottom shelf behind the counter was a pound of fresh butter that the dairyman had left ten minutes before with a bread knife miss martha made a deep slash in each of the stale loaves inserted a generous quantity of butter and pressed the loaves tight again when the customer turned once more she was tying the paper around them when he had gone after an unusually pleasant little chat miss martha smiled to herself but not without a slight fluttering of the heart had she been too bold would he take offense but surely not there was no language of edibles butter was no emblem of unmaidenly forwardness for a long time that day her mind dwelt on the subject she imagined the scene when he should discover her little deception he would lay down his brushes and palette there would stand his easel with the picture he was painting in which the perspective was beyond criticism he would prepare for his luncheon of dry bread and water he would slice into a loaf ah miss martha blushed would he think of the hand that placed it there as he ate would he the front door bell jangled viciously somebody was coming in making a great deal of noise miss martha hurried to the front two men were there one was a young man smoking a pipe a man she had never seen before the other was her artist his face was very red his hat was on the back of his head his hair was wildly rumpled he clinched his two fists and shook them ferociously at miss martha at miss martha dummkopf he shouted with extreme loudness and then tausendonfer or something like it in german the young man tried to draw him away i vill not go he said angrily else i shall told her he made a bass drum of miss martha s counter you haf shpoilt me he cried his blue eyes blazing behind his spectacles i vill tell you you vas von meddingsome old cat miss martha leaned weakly against the shelves and laid one hand on her blue dotted silk waist the young man took the other by the collar come on he said you ve said enough he dragged the angry one out at the door to the sidewalk and then came back guess you ought to be told ma am he said what the row is about that s blumberger he s an architectural draftsman i work in the same office with him he s been working hard for three months drawing a plan for a new city hall it was a prize competition he finished inking the lines yesterday you know a draftsman always makes his drawing in pencil first when it s done he rubs out the pencil lines with handfuls of stale bread crumbs that s better than india rubber blumberger s been buying the bread here well to day well you know ma am that butter isn t well blumberger s plan isn t good for anything now except to cut up into railroad sandwiches miss martha went into the back room she took off the blue dotted silk waist and put on the old brown serge she used to wear then she poured the quince seed and borax mixture out of the window into the ash can the pride of the cities said mr kipling the cities are full of pride challenging each to each even so new york was empty two hundred thousand of its people were away for the summer three million eight hundred thousand remained as caretakers and to pay the bills of the absentees but the two hundred thousand are an expensive lot the new yorker sat at a roof garden table ingesting solace through a straw his panama lay upon a chair the july audience was scattered among vacant seats as widely as outfielders when the champion batter steps to the plate vaudeville happened at intervals the breeze was cool from the bay around and above everywhere except on the stage were stars glimpses were to be had of waiters always disappearing like startled chamois prudent visitors who had ordered refreshments by phone in the morning were now being served the new yorker was aware of certain drawbacks to his comfort but content beamed softly from his rimless eyeglasses his family was out of town the drinks were warm the ballet was suffering from lack of both tune and talcum but his family would not return until september then up into the garden stumbled the man from topaz city nevada the gloom of the solitary sightseer enwrapped him bereft of joy through loneliness he stalked with a widower s face through the halls of pleasure thirst for human companionship possessed him as he panted in the metropolitan draught straight to the new yorker s table he steered the new yorker disarmed and made reckless by the lawless atmosphere of a roof garden decided upon utter abandonment of his life s traditions he resolved to shatter with one rash dare devil impulsive hair brained act the conventions that had hitherto been woven into his existence carrying out this radical and precipitous inspiration he nodded slightly to the stranger as he drew nearer the table the next moment found the man from topaz city in the list of the new yorker s closest friends he took a chair at the table he gathered two others for his feet he tossed his broad brimmed hat upon a fourth and told his life s history to his new found pard the new yorker warmed a little as an apartment house furnace warms when the strawberry season begins a waiter who came within hail in an unguarded moment was captured and paroled on an errand to the doctor wiley experimental station the ballet was now in the midst of a musical vagary and danced upon the stage programmed as bolivian peasants clothed in some portions of its anatomy as norwegian fisher maidens in others as ladies in waiting of marie antoinette historically denuded in other portions so as to represent sea nymphs and presenting the tout ensemble of a social club of central park west housemaids at a fish fry been in the city long inquired the new yorker getting ready the exact tip against the waiter s coming with large change from the bill me said the man from topaz city four days never in topaz city was you i said the new yorker i was never farther west than eighth avenue i had a brother who died on ninth but i met the cortege at eighth there was a bunch of violets on the hearse and the undertaker mentioned the incident to avoid mistake i cannot say that i am familiar with the west topaz city said the man who occupied four chairs is one of the finest towns in the world i presume that you have seen the sights of the metropolis said the new yorker four days is not a sufficient length of time in which to view even our most salient points of interest but one can possibly form a general impression our architectural supremacy is what generally strikes visitors to our city most forcibly of course you have seen our flatiron building it is considered saw it said the man from topaz city but you ought to come out our way it s mountainous you know and the ladies all wear short skirts for climbing and excuse me said the new yorker but that isn t exactly the point new york must be a wonderful revelation to a visitor from the west now as to our hotels say said the man from topaz city that reminds me there were sixteen stage robbers shot last year within twenty miles of i was speaking of hotels said the new yorker we lead europe in that respect and as far as our leisure class is concerned we are far oh i don t know interrupted the man from topaz city there were twelve tramps in our jail when i left home i guess new york isn t so beg pardon you seem to misapprehend the idea of course you visited the stock exchange and wall street where the oh yes said the man from topaz city as he lighted a pennsylvania stogie and i want to tell you chat we ve got the finest town marshal west of the rockies bill rainer he took in five pickpockets out of the crowd when red nose thompson laid the cornerstone of his new saloon topaz city don t allow have another rhine wine and seltzer suggested the new yorker i ve never been west as i said but there can t be any place out there to compare with new york as to the claims of chicago i one man said the topazite one man only has been murdered and robbed in topaz city in the last three oh i know what chicago is interposed the new yorker have you been up fifth avenue to see the magnificent residences of our mil seen em all you ought to know reub stegall the assessor of topaz when old man tilbury that owns the only two story house in town tried to swear his taxes from down to reub buckled on his forty five and went down to see yes yes but speaking of our great city one of its greatest features is our superb police department there is no body of men in the world that can equal it for that waiter gets around like a langley flying machine remarked the man from topaz city thirstily we ve got men in our town too worth there s old bill withers and colonel metcalf and have you seen broadway at night asked the new yorker courteously there are few streets in the world that can compare with it when the electrics are shining and the pavements are alive with two hurrying streams of elegantly clothed men and beautiful women attired in the costliest costumes that wind in and out in a close maze of expensively never knew but one case in topaz city said the man from the west jim bailey our mayor had his watch and chain and in cash taken from his pocket while that s another matter said the new yorker while you are in our city you should avail yourself of every opportunity to see its wonders our rapid transit system if you was out in topaz broke in the man from there i could show you a whole cemetery full of people that got killed accidentally talking about mangling folks up why when berry rogers turned loose that old double barrelled shot gun of his loaded with slugs at anybody here waiter called the new yorker two more of the same it is acknowledged by every one that our city is the centre of art and literature and learning take for instance our after dinner speakers where else in the country would you find such wit and eloquence as emanate from depew and ford and if you take the papers interrupted the westerner you must have read of pete webster s daughter the websters live two blocks north of the court house in topaz city miss tillie webster she slept forty days and nights without waking up the doctors said that pass the matches please said the new yorker have you observed the expedition with which new buildings are being run up in new york improved inventions in steel framework and i noticed said the nevadian that the statistics of topaz city showed only one carpenter crushed by falling timbers last year and he was caught in a cyclone they abuse our sky line continued the new yorker and it is likely that we are not yet artistic in the construction of our buildings but i can safely assert that we lead in pictorial and decorative art in some of our houses can be found masterpieces in the way of paintings and sculpture one who has the entree to our best galleries will find back up exclaimed the man from topaz city there was a game last month in our town in which changed hands on a pair of ta romt tara went the orchestra the stage curtain blushing pink at the name asbestos inscribed upon it came down with a slow midsummer movement the audience trickled leisurely down the elevator and stairs on the sidewalk below the new yorker and the man from topaz city shook hands with alcoholic gravity the elevated crashed raucously surface cars hummed and clanged cabmen swore newsboys shrieked wheels clattered ear piercingly the new yorker conceived a happy thought with which he aspired to clinch the pre eminence of his city you must admit said he that in the way of noise new york is far ahead of any other back to the everglades said the man from topaz city in when sousa s band and the repeating candidate were in our town you couldn t the rattle of an express wagon drowned the rest of the words holding up a train note the man who told me these things was for several years an outlaw in the southwest and a follower of the pursuit he so frankly describes his description of the modus operandi should prove interesting his counsel of value to the potential passenger in some future hold up while his estimate of the pleasures of train robbing will hardly induce any one to adopt it as a profession i give the story in almost exactly his own words o h most people would say if their opinion was asked for that holding up a train would be a hard job well it isn t it s easy i have contributed some to the uneasiness of railroads and the insomnia of express companies and the most trouble i ever had about a hold up was in being swindled by unscrupulous people while spending the money i got the danger wasn t anything to speak of and we didn t mind the trouble one man has come pretty near robbing a train by himself two have succeeded a few times three can do it if they are hustlers but five is about the right number the time to do it and the place depend upon several things the first stick up i was ever in happened in maybe the way i got into it will explain how most train robbers start in the business five out of six western outlaws are just cowboys out of a job and gone wrong the sixth is a tough from the east who dresses up like a bad man and plays some low down trick that gives the boys a bad name wire fences and nesters made five of them a bad heart made the sixth jim s and i were working on the ranch in colorado the nesters had the cowman on t he go they had taken up the land and elected officers who were hard to get along with jim and i rode into la junta one day going south from a round up we were having a little fun without malice toward any body when a farmer administration cut in and tried to harvest us jim shot a deputy marshal and i kind of corroborated his side of the argument we skirmished up and down the main street the boomers having bad luck all the time after a while we leaned forward and shoved for the ranch down on the ceriso we were riding a couple of horses that couldn t fly but they could catch birds a few days after that a gang of the la junta boomers came to the ranch and wanted us to go back with them naturally we declined we had the house on them and before we were done refusing that old dobe was plumb full of lead when dark came we fagged em a batch of bullets and shoved out the back door for the rocks they sure smoked us as we went we had to drift which we did and rounded up down in oklahoma well there wasn t anything we could get there and being mighty hard up we decided to transact a little business with the railroads jim and i joined forces with tom and ike moore two brothers who had plenty of sand they were willing to convert into dust i can call their names for both of them are dead tom was shot while robbing a bank in arkansas ike was killed during the more dangerous pastime of attending a dance in the creek nation we selected a place on the santa fe where there was a bridge across a deep creek surrounded by heavy timber all passenger trains took water at the tank close to one end of the bridge it was a quiet place the nearest house being five miles away the day before it happened we rested our horses and made medicine as to how we should get about it our plans were not at all elaborate as none of us had ever engaged in a hold up before the santa fe flyer was due at the tank at p m at eleven tom and i lay down on one side of the track and jim and ike took the other as the train rolled up the headlight flashing far down the track and the steam hissing from the engine i turned weak all over i would have worked a whole year on the ranch for nothing to have been out of that affair right then some of the nerviest men in the business have told me that they felt the same way the first time the engine had hardly stopped when i jumped on the running board on one side while jim mounted the other as soon as the engineer and fireman saw our guns they threw up their hands without being told and begged us not to shoot saying they would do anything we wanted them to hit the ground i ordered and they both jumped off we drove them before us down the side of the train while this was happening tom and ike had been blazing away one on each side of the train yelling like apaches so as to keep the passengers herded in the cars some fellow stuck a little twenty two calibre out one of the coach windows and fired it straight up in the air i let drive and smashed the glass just over his head that settled everything like resistance from that direction by this time all my nervousness was gone i felt a kind of pleasant excitement as if i were at a dance or a frolic of some sort the lights were all out in the coaches and as tom and ike gradually quit firing and yelling it got to be almost as still as a graveyard i remember hearing a little bird chirping in a bush at the side of the track as if it were complaining at being waked up i made the fireman get a lantern and then i went to the express car and yelled to the messenger to open up or get perforated he slid the door back and stood in it with his hands up jump overboard son i said and he hit the dirt like a lump of lead there were two safes in the car a big one and a little one by the way i first located the messenger s arsenal a double barrelled shot gun with buckshot cartridges and a thirty eight in a drawer i drew the cartridges from the shot gun pocketed the pistol and called the messenger inside i shoved my gun against his nose and put him to work he couldn t open the big safe but he did the little one there was only nine hundred dollars in it that was mighty small winnings for our trouble so we decided to go through the passengers we took our prisoners to the smoking car and from there sent the engineer through the train to light up the coaches beginning with the first one we placed a man at each door and ordered the passengers to stand between the seats with their hands up if you want to find out what cowards the majority of men are all you have to do is rob a passenger train i don t mean because they don t resist i ll tell you later on why they can t do that but it makes a man feel sorry for them the way they lose their heads big burly drummers and farmers and ex soldiers and high collared dudes and sports that a few moments before were filling the car with noise and bragging get so scared that their ears flop there were very few people in the day coaches at that time of night so we made a slim haul until we got to the sleeper the pullman conductor met me at one door while jim was going round to the other one he very politely informed me that i could not go into that car as it did not belong to the railroad company and besides the passengers had already been greatly disturbed by the shouting and firing never in all my life have i met with a finer instance of official dignity and reliance upon the power of mr pull man s great name i jabbed my six shooter so hard against mr conductor s front that i afterward found one of his vest buttons so firmly wedged in the end of the barrel that i had to shoot it out he just shut up like a weak springed knife and rolled down the car steps i opened the door of the sleeper and stepped inside a big fat old man came wabbling up to me puffing and blowing he had one coat sleeve on and was trying to put his vest on over that i don t know who he thought i was young man young man says he you must keep cool and not get excited above everything keep cool i can t says i excitement s just eating me up and then i let out a yell and turned loose my forty five through the skylight that old man tried to dive into one of the lower berths but a screech came out of it and a bare foot that took him in the bread basket and landed him on the floor i saw jim coming in the other door and i hollered for everybody to climb out and line up they commenced to scramble down and for a while we had a three ringed circus the men looked as frightened and tame as a lot of rabbits in a deep snow they had on on an average about a quarter of a suit of clothes and one shoe apiece one chap was sitting on the floor of the aisle looking as if he were working a hard sum in arithmetic he was trying very solemn to pull a lady s number two shoe on his number nine foot the ladies didn t stop to dress they were so curious to see a real live train robber bless em that they just wrapped blankets and sheets around themselves and came out squeaky and fidgety looking they always show more curiosity and sand than the men do we got them all lined up and pretty quiet and i went through the bunch i found very little on them i mean in the way of valuables one man in the line was a sight he was one of those big overgrown solemn snoozers that sit on the platform at lectures and look wise before crawling out he had managed to put on his long frock tailed coat and his high silk hat the rest of him was nothing but pajamas and bunions when i dug into that prince albert i expected to drag out at least a block of gold mine stock or an armful of government bonds but all i found was a little boy s french harp about four inches long what it was there for i don t know i felt a little mad because he had fooled me so i stuck the harp up against his mouth if you can t pay play i says i can t play says he then learn right off quick says i letting him smell the end of my gun barrel he caught hold of the harp turned red as a beet and commenced to blow he blew a dinky little tune i remembered hearing when i was a kid prettiest little gal in the country oh mammy and daddy told me so i made him keep on playing it all the time we were in the car now and then he d get weak and off the key and i d turn my gun on him and ask what was the matter with that little gal and whether he had any intention of going back on her which would make him start up again like sixty i think that old boy standing there in his silk hat and bare feet playing his little french harp was the funniest sight i ever saw one little red headed woman in the line broke out laughing at him you could have heard her in the next car then jim held them steady while i searched the berths i grappled around in those beds and filled a pillow case with the strangest assortment of stuff you ever saw now and then i d come across a little pop gun pistol just about right for plugging teeth with which i d throw out the window when i finished with the collection i dumped the pillow case load in the middle of the aisle there were a good many watches bracelets rings and pocket books with a sprinkling of false teeth whiskey flasks fa ce powder boxes chocolate caramels and heads of hair of various colours and lengths there were also about a dozen ladies stockings into which jewellery watches and rolls of bills had been stuffed and then wadded up tight and stuck under the mattresses i offered to return what i called the scalps saying that we were not indians on the war path but none of the ladies seemed to know to whom the hair belonged one of the women and a good looker she was wrapped in a striped blanket saw me pick up one of the stockings that was pretty chunky and heavy about the toe and she snapped out that s mine sir you re not in the business of robbing women are you now as this was our first hold up we hadn t agreed upon any code of ethics so i hardly knew what to answer but anyway i replied well not as a specialty if this contains your personal property you can have it back it just does she declared eagerly and reached out her hand for it you ll excuse my taking a look at the contents i said holding the stocking up by the toe out dumped a big gent s gold watch worth two hundred a gent s leather pocket book that we afterward found to contain six hundred dollars a calibre revolver and the only thing of the lot that could have been a lady s personal property was a silver bracelet worth about fifty cents i said madame here s your property and handed her the bracelet now i went on how can you expect us to act square with you when you try to deceive us in this manner i m surprised at such conduct the young woman flushed up as if she had been caught doing something dishonest some other woman down the line called out the mean thing i never knew whether she meant the other lady or me when we finished our job we ordered everybody back to bed told em good night very politely at the door and left we rode forty miles before daylight and then divided the stuff each one of us got in money we lumped the jewellery around then we scattered each man for himself that was my first train robbery and it was about as easily done as any of the ones that followed but that was the last and only time i ever went through the passengers i don t like that part of the business afterward i stuck strictly to the express car during the next eight years i handled a good deal of money the best haul i made was just seven years after the first one we found out about a train that was going to bring out a lot of money to pay off the soldiers at a government post we stuck that train up in broad daylight five of us lay in the sand hills near a little station ten soldiers were guarding the money on the train but they might just as well have been at home on a furlough we didn t even allow them to stick their heads out the windows to see the fun we had no trouble at all in getting the money which was all in gold of course a big howl was raised at the time about the robbery it was government stuff and the government got sarcastic and wanted to know what the convoy of soldiers went along for the only excuse given was that nobody was expecting an attack among those bare sand hills in daytime i don t know what the government thought about the excuse but i know that it was a good one the

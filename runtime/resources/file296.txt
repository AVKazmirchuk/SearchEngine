it seemed to me like a find of a big story you know that is a sort of thing that would write up pretty well let s try to forget it said i with a praiseworthy attempt at gayety and take the next car cross town i steeled myself against his unexpressed but palpable desire he should not coax cajole or wring from me the dollar he craved i had had enough of that wild goose chase tripp feebly unbuttoned his coat of the faded pattern and glossy seams to reach for something that had once been a handkerchief deep down in some obscure and cavernous pocket as he did so i caught the shine of a cheap silver plated watch chain across his vest and something dangling from it caused me to stretch forth my hand and seize it curiously it was the half of a silver dime that had been cut in halves with a chisel what i said looking at him keenly oh yes he responded dully george brown alias tripp what s the use barring the w c t u i d like to know if anybody disapproves of my having produced promptly from my pocket tripp s whiskey dollar and unhesitatingly laying it in his hand the higher pragmatism i where to go for wisdom has become a question of serious import the ancients are discredited plato is boiler plate aristotle is tottering marcus aurelius is reeling aesop has been copyrighted by indiana solomon is too solemn you couldn t get anything out of epictetus with a pick the ant which for many years served as a model of intelligence and industry in the school readers has been proven to be a doddering idiot and a waster of time and effort the owl to day is hooted at chautauqua conventions have abandoned culture and adopted diabolo graybeards give glowing testimonials to the venders of patent hair restorers there are typographical errors in the almanacs published by the daily newspapers college professors have become but there shall be no personalities to sit in classes to delve into the encyclopedia or the past performances page will not make us wise as the poet says knowledge comes but wisdom lingers wisdom is dew which while we know it not soaks into us refreshes us and makes us grow knowledge is a strong stream of water turned on us through a hose it disturbs our roots then let us rather gather wisdom but how to do so requires knowledge if we know a thing we know it but very often we are not wise to it that we are wise and but let s go on with the story ii once upon a time i found a ten cent magazine lying on a bench in a little city park anyhow that was the amount he asked me for when i sat on the bench next to him he was a musty dingy and tattered magazine with some queer stories bound in him i was sure he turned out to be a scrap book i am a newspaper reporter i said to him to try him i have been detailed to write up some of the experiences of the unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in this park may i ask you to what you attribute your downfall in i was interrupted by a laugh from my purchase a laugh so rusty and unpractised that i was sure it had been his first for many a day oh no no said he you ain t a reporter reporters don t talk that way they pretend to be one of us and say they ve just got in on the blind baggage from st louis i can tell a reporter on sight us park bums get to be fine judges of human nature we sit here all day and watch the people go by i can size up anybody who walks past my bench in a way that would surprise you well i said go on and tell me how do you size me up i should say said the student of human nature with unpardonable hesitation that you was say in the contracting business or maybe worked in a store or was a sign painter you stopped in the park to finish your cigar and thought you d get a little free monologue out of me still you might be a plasterer or a lawyer it s getting kind of dark you see and your wife won t let you smoke at home i frowned gloomily but judging again went on the reader of men i d say you ain t got a wife no said i rising restlessly no no no i ain t but i will have by the arrows of cupid that is if my voice must have trailed away and muffled itself in uncertainty and despair i see you have a story yourself said the dusty vagrant impudently it seemed to me suppose you take your dime back and spin your yarn for me i m interested myself in the ups and downs of unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in the park somehow that amused me i looked at the frowsy derelict with more interest i did have a story why not tell it to him i had told none of my friends i had always been a reserved and bottled up man it was psychical timidity or sensitiveness perhaps both and i smiled to myself in wonder when i felt an impulse to confide in this stranger and vagabond jack said i mack said he mack said i i ll tell you do you want the dime back in advance said he i handed him a dollar the dime said i was the price of listening to your story right on the point of the jaw said he go on and then incredible as it may seem to the lovers in the world who

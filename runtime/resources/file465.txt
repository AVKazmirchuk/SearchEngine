will suffice we are careful not to create any wrong impressions gladys vavasour smith and henry r grasty stood at the marriage altar mr grasty had evidently worked his rabbit s foot successfully although he was quite a while in doing so just as the preacher was about to pronounce the fatal words on which he would have realized ten dollars and had the laugh on mr grasty the steeple of the

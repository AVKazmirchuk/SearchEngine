on the little gallery in front of the hinkle parlor waiting for ileen to come when i heard voices inside she had come into the room with her father and old man hinkle began to talk to her i had observed before that he was a shrewd man and not unphilosophic ily said he i notice there s three or four young fellers that have been callin to see you regular for quite a while is there any one of em you like better than another why pa she answered i like all of em very well i think mr cuninngham and mr jacks and mr harris are very nice young men they are so frank and honest in everything they say to me i haven t known mr vesey very long but i think he s a very nice young man he s so frank and honest in everything he says to me now that s what i m gittin at says old hinkle you ve always been sayin you like people what tell the truth and don t go humbuggin you with compliments and bogus talk now suppose you make a test of these fellers and see which one of em will talk the straightest to you but how ll i do it pa i ll tell you how you know you sing a little bit ily you took music lessons nearly two years in logansport it wasn t long but it was all we could afford then and your teacher said you didn t have any voice and it was a waste of money to keep on now suppose you ask the fellers what they think of your singin and see what each one of em tells you the man that ll tell you the truth about it ll have a mighty lot of nerve and ll do to tie to what do you think of the plan all right pa said ileen i think it s a good idea i ll try it ileen and mr hinkle went out of the room through the inside doors unobserved i hurried down to the station jacks was at his telegraph table waiting for eight o clock to come it was bud s night in town and when he rode in i repeated the conversation to them both i was loyal to my rivals as all true admirers of all ileens should be simultaneously the three of us were smitten by an uplifting thought surely this test would eliminate vesey from the contest he with his unctuous flattery would be driven from the lists well we remembered ileen s love of frankness and honesty how she treasured truth and candor above vain compliment and blandishment linking arms we did a grotesque dance of joy up and down the platform singing muldoon was a solid man at the top of our voices that evening four of the willow rocking chairs were filled besides the lucky one that sustained the trim figure of miss hinkle three of us awaited with suppressed excitement the application of the test it was tried on bud first mr cunningham said ileen with her dazzling smile after she had sung when the leaves begin to turn what do you really think of my voice frankly and honestly now as you know i want you to always be toward me bud squirmed in his chair at his chance to show the sincerity that he knew was required of him tell you the truth miss ileen he said earnestly you ain t got much more voice than a weasel just a little squeak you know of course we all like to hear you sing for it s kind of sweet and soothin after all and you look most as mighty well sittin on the piano stool as you do faced around but as for real singin i reckon you couldn t call it that i looked closely at ileen to see if bud had overdone his frankness but her pleased smile and sweetly spoken thanks assured me that we were on the right track and what do you think mr jacks she asked next take it from me said jacks you ain t in the prima donna class i ve heard em warble in every city in the united states and i tell you your vocal output don t go otherwise you ve got the grand opera bunch sent to the soap factory in looks i mean for the high screechers generally look like mary ann on her thursday out but nix for the gargle work your epiglottis ain t a real side stepper its footwork ain t good with a merry laugh at jacks criticism ileen looked inquiringly at me i admit that i faltered a little was there not such a thing as being too frank perhaps i even hedged a little in my verdict but i stayed with the critics i am not skilled in scientific music miss ileen i said but frankly i cannot praise very highly the singing voice that nature has given you it has long been a favorite comparison that a great singer sings like a bird well there are birds and birds i would say that your voice reminds me of the thrush s throaty and not strong nor of much compass or variety but still er sweet in er its way and er thank you mr harris interrupted miss hinkle i knew i could depend upon your frankness and honesty and then c vincent vesey drew back one sleeve from his snowy cuff and the water came down at lodore my memory cannot do justice to his masterly tribute to that priceless god given treasure miss hinkle s voice he raved over it in terms that if they had been addressed to the morning stars when they sang together would have made that stellar choir explode in a meteoric shower of flaming self satisfaction he marshalled on his white

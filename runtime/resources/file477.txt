will bring recompense and requital for the sorrows of the days gone by and a new order of things when there will be more starch in cuff and collar and less in handkerchiefs come with me out into the starlight night so calm so serene ye lights of heaven so high above earth so pure and majestic and mysterious looking down on the mad struggle of life here below is there no pity in your never closing eyes for us mortals on which you shine come with me on to the bridge ah see there far below the dark turbid stream rushing and whirling and eddying under the dark pillars with ghostly murmur and siren whisper what shall we find in your depths the stars do not reflect themselves in your waters they are too dark and troubled and swift what shall we find in your depths rest peace catfish who knows tis but a moment a leap a plunge and then oblivion or another world who can tell a man once dived into your depths and brought up a horse collar and a hoop skirt ah what do we know of the beyond we know that death comes and we return no more to our world of trouble and care but where do we go are there lands where no traveler has been a chaos perhaps where no human foot has trod perhaps bastrop perhaps new jersey who knows where do people go who are in mcdade do they go where they have to fare worse they cannot go where they have worse fare let us leave the river the night grows cold we

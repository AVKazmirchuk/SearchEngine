the other poems that follow have been found in files of the rolling stone in the houston post s postscripts and in manuscript there are many others but these few have been selected rather arbitrarily to round out this collection the pewee in the hush of the drowsy afternoon when the very wind on the breast of june lies settled and hot white tracery of the shattered sunlight filters free through the unstinted leaves to the pied cool sward on a dead tree branch sings the saddest bard of the birds that be tis the lone pewee its note is a sob and its note is pitched in a single key like a soul bewitched to a mournful minstrelsy pewee pewee doth it ever cry a sad sweet minor threnody that threads the aisles of the dim hot grove like a tale of a wrong or a vanished love and the fancy comes that the wee dun bird perchance was a maid and her heart was stirred by some lover s rhyme in a golden time and broke when the world turned false and cold and her dreams grew dark and her faith grew cold in some fairy far off clime and her soul crept into the pewee s breast and forever she cries with a strange unrest for something lost in the afternoon for something missed from the lavish june for the heart that died in the long ago for the livelong pain that pierceth so thus the pewee cries while the evening lies steeped in the languorous still sunshine rapt to the leaf and the bough rind the vine of some hopeless paradise you can tell your paper the great man said i refused an interview i have nothing to say on the question sir nothing to say to you and then he talked till the sun went down and the chickens went to roost and he seized the collar of the poor young man and never his hold he loosed and the sun went down and the moon came up and he talked till the dawn of day though he said on this subject mentioned by you i have nothing whatever to say and down the reporter dropped to sleep and flat on the floor he lay and the last he heard was the great man s words i have nothing at all to say the murderer i push my boat among the reeds i sit and stare about queer slimy things crawl through the weeds put to a sullen rout i paddle under cypress trees all fearfully i peer through oozy channels when the breeze comes rustling at my ear the long moss hangs perpetually gray scalps of buried years blue crabs steal out and stare at me and seem to gauge my fears i start to hear the eel swim by i shudder when the crane strikes at his prey i turn to fly at drops

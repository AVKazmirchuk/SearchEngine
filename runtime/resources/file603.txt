they put him to keeping books in the ranch store for he was a devil at figures but he got tired of that and asked for something more in the line of activity the boys on the ranch liked him all right but he made us tired shouting new york all the time every night he d tell us about east river and j p morgan and the eden musee and hetty green and central park till we used to throw tin plates and branding irons at him one day this chap gets on a pitching pony and the pony kind of sidled up his back and went to eating grass while the new yorker was coming down he come down on his head on a chunk of mesquit wood and he didn t show any designs toward getting up again we laid him out in a tent and he begun to look pretty dead so gideon pease saddles up and burns the wind for old doc sleeper s residence in dogtown thirty miles away the doctor comes over and he investigates the patient boys says he you might as well go to playing seven up for his saddle and clothes for his head s fractured and if he lives ten minutes it will be a remarkable case of longevity of course we didn t gamble for the poor rooster s saddle that was one of doc s jokes but we stood around feeling solemn and all of us forgive him for having talked us to death about new york i never saw anybody about to hand in his checks act more peaceful than this fellow his eyes were fixed way up in the air and he was using rambling words to himself all about sweet music and beautiful streets and white robed forms and he was smiling like dying was a pleasure he s about gone now said doc whenever they begin to think they see heaven it s all off blamed if that new york man didn t sit right up when he heard the doc say that say says he kind of disappointed was that heaven confound it all i thought it was broadway some of you fellows get my clothes i m going to get up and i ll be blamed concluded bud if he wasn t on the train with a ticket for new york in his pocket four days afterward the adventures of shamrock jolnes i am so fortunate as to count shamrock jolnes the great new york detective among my muster of friends jolnes is what is called the inside man of the city detective force he is an expert in the use of the typewriter and it is his duty whenever there is a murder mystery to be solved to sit at a desk telephone at headquarters and take down the messages of cranks who phone in their confessions to having committed the crime but on certain off days when confessions are coming in slowly and three or four newspapers have run to earth as many different guilty persons jolnes will knock about the town with me exhibiting to my great delight and instruction his marvellous powers of observation and deduction the other day i dropped in at headquarters and found the great detective gazing thoughtfully at a string that was tied tightly around his little finger good morning whatsup he said without turning his head i m glad to notice that you ve had your house fitted up with electric lights at last will you please tell me i said in surprise how you knew that i am sure that i never mentioned the fact to any one and the wiring was a rush order not completed until this morning nothing easier said jolnes genially as you came in i caught the odour of the cigar you are smoking i know an expensive cigar and i know that not more than three men in new york can afford to smoke cigars and pay gas bills too at the present time that was an easy one but i am working just now on a little problem of my own why have you that string on your finger i asked that s the problem said jolnes my wife tied that on this morning to remind me of something i was to send up to the house sit down whatsup and excuse me for a few moments the distinguished detective went to a wall telephone and stood with the receiver to his ear for probably ten minutes were you listening to a confession i asked when he had returned to his chair perhaps said jolnes with a smile it might be called something of the sort to be frank with you whatsup i ve cut out the dope i ve been increasing the quantity for so long that morphine doesn t have much effect on me any more i ve got to have something more powerful that telephone i just went to is connected with a room in the waldorf where there s an author s reading in progress now to get at the solution of this string after five minutes of silent pondering jolnes looked at me with a smile and nodded his head wonderful man i exclaimed already it is quite simple he said holding up his finger you see that knot that is to prevent my forgetting it is therefore a forget me knot a forget me not is a flower it was a sack of flour that i was to send home beautiful i could not help crying out in admiration suppose we go out for a ramble suggested jolnes there is only one case of importance on hand just now old man mccarty one hundred and four years old died from eating too many bananas the evidence points so strongly to the mafia that the police have surrounded the second avenue katzenjammer gambrinus club no and the capture of

use it seems to me it s as good as the tommyrot you write i accepted the tip and if you read further you will learn the facts about the diamond of the goddess kali as vouched for by one of the most reliable reporters on the staff gen marcellus b ludlow lives in one of those decaying but venerated old red brick mansions in the west twenties the general is a member of an old new york family that does not advertise he is a globe trotter by birth a gentleman by predilection a millionaire by the mercy of heaven and a connoisseur of precious stones by occupation the reporter was admitted promptly when he made himself known at the general s residence at about eight thirty on the evening that he received the assignment in the magnificent library he was greeted by the distinguished traveller and connoisseur a tall erect gentleman in the early fifties with a nearly white moustache and a bearing so soldierly that one perceived in him scarcely a trace of the national guardsman his weather beaten countenance lit up with a charming smile of interest when the reporter made known his errand ah you have heard of my latest find i shall be glad to show you what i conceive to be one of the six most valuable blue diamonds in existence the general opened a small safe in a corner of the library and brought forth a plush covered box opening this he exposed to the reporter s bewildered gaze a huge and brilliant diamond nearly as large as a hailstone this stone said the general is something more than a mere jewel it once formed the central eye of the three eyed goddess kali who is worshipped by one of the fiercest and most fanatical tribes of india if you will arrange yourself comfortably i will give you a brief history of it for your paper general ludlow brought a decanter of whiskey and glasses from a cabinet and set a comfortable armchair for the lucky scribe the phansigars or thugs of india began the general are the most dangerous and dreaded of the tribes of north india they are extremists in religion and worship the horrid goddess kali in the form of images their rites are interesting and bloody the robbing and murdering of travellers are taught as a worthy and obligatory deed by their strange religious code their worship of the three eyed goddess kali is conducted so secretly that no traveller has ever heretofore had the honour of witnessing the ceremonies that distinction was reserved for myself while at sakaranpur between delhi and khelat i used to explore the jungle in every direction in the hope of learning something new about these mysterious phansigars one evening at twilight i was making my way through a teakwood forest when i came upon a deep circular depression in an open space in the centre of which was a rude stone temple i was sure that this was one of the temples of the thugs so i concealed myself in the undergrowth to watch when the moon rose the depression in the clearing was suddenly filled with hundreds of shadowy swiftly gliding forms then a door opened in the temple exposing a brightly illuminated image of the goddess kali before which a white robed priest began a barbarous incantation while the tribe of worshippers prostrated themselves upon the earth but what interested me most was the central eye of the huge wooden idol i could see by its flashing brilliancy that it was an immense diamond of the purest water after the rites were concluded the thugs slipped away into the forest as silently as they had come the priest stood for a few minutes in the door of the temple enjoying the cool of the night before closing his rather warm quarters suddenly a dark lithe shadow slipped down into the hollow leaped upon the priest and struck him down with a glittering knife then the murderer sprang at the image of the goddess like a cat and pried out the glowing central eye of kali with his weapon straight toward me he ran with his royal prize when he was within two paces i rose to my feet and struck him with all my force between the eyes he rolled over senseless and the magnificent jewel fell from his hand that is the splendid blue diamond you have just seen a stone worthy of a monarch s crown that s a corking story said the reporter that decanter is exactly like the one that john w gates always sets out during an interview pardon me said general ludlow for forgetting hospitality in the excitement of my narrative help yourself here s looking at you said the reporter what i am afraid of now said the general lowering his voice is that i may be robbed of the diamond the jewel that formed an eye of their goddess is their most sacred symbol somehow the tribe suspected me of having it and members of the band have followed me half around the earth they are the most cunning and cruel fanatics in the world and their religious vows would compel them to assassinate the unbeliever who has desecrated their sacred treasure once in lucknow three of their agents disguised as servants in a hotel endeavoured to strangle me with a twisted cloth again in london two thugs made up as street musicians climbed into my window at night and attacked me they have even tracked me to this country my life is never safe a month ago while i was at a hotel in the berkshires three of them sprang upon me from the roadside weeds i saved myself then by my knowledge of their customs how was that general asked the reporter there was a cow grazing near by said general ludlow a gentle jersey cow i ran to her

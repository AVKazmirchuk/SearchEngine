bite off a juicy piece of rib when a bullet took it away from his mouth somebody s celebrating with ball cartridges says he reaching for another piece little over zealous for a non resident patriot isn t it don t mind it i says to him twas an accident they happen you know on the fourth after one reading of the declaration of independence in new york i ve known the s r o sign to be hung out at all the hospitals and police stations but then jerry gives a howl and jumps up with one hand clapped to the back of his leg where another bullet has acted over zealous and then comes a quantity of yells and round a corner and across the plaza gallops general mary esperanza dingo embracing the neck of his horse with his men running behind him mostly dropping their guns by way of discharging ballast and chasing em all is a company of feverish little warriors wearing blue trousers and caps assistance amigos the general shouts trying to stop his horse assistance in the name of liberty that s the campania azul the president s bodyguard says jones what a shame they ve jumped on poor old mary just because he was helping us to celebrate come on boys it s our fourth do we let that little squad of a d t s break it up i vote no says martin dillard gathering his winchester it s the privilege of an american citizen to drink drill dress up and be dreadful on the fourth of july no matter whose country he s in fellow citizens says old man billfinger in the darkest hour of freedom s birth when our brave forefathers promulgated the principles of undying liberty they never expected that a bunch of blue jays like that should be allowed to bust up an anniversary let us preserve and protect the constitution we made it unanimous and then we gathered our guns and assaulted the blue troops in force we fired over their heads and then charged em with a yell and they broke and ran we were irritated at having our barbecue disturbed and we chased em a quarter of a mile some of em we caught and kicked hard the general rallied his troops and joined in the chase finally they scattered in a thick banana grove and we couldn t flush a single one so we sat down and rested if i were to be put severe through the third degree i wouldn t be able to tell much about the rest of the day i mind that we pervaded the town considerable calling upon the people to bring out more armies for us to destroy i remember seeing a crowd somewhere and a tall man that wasn t billfinger making a fourth of july speech from a balcony and that was about all somebody must have hauled the old ice factory up to where i was and put it around me for there s where i was when i woke up the next morning as soon as i could recollect by name and address i got up and held an inquest my last cent was gone i was all in and then a neat black carriage drives to the door and out steps general dingo and a bay man in a silk hat and tan shoes yes says i to myself i see it now you re the chief de policeos and high lord chamberlain of the calaboosum and you want billy casparis for excess of patriotism and assault with intent all right might as well be in jail anyhow but it seems that general mary is smiling and the bay man shakes my hand and speaks in the american dialect general dingo has informed me senor casparis of your gallant service in our cause i desire to thank you with my person the bravery of you and the other senores americanos turned the struggle for liberty in our favour our party triumphed the terrible battle will live forever in history battle says i what battle and i ran my mind back along history trying to think senor casparis is modest says general dingo he led his brave compadres into the thickest of the fearful conflict yes without their aid the revolution would have failed why now says i don t tell me there was a revolution yesterday that was only a fourth of but right there i abbreviated it seemed to me it might be best after the terrible struggle says the bay man president bolano was forced to fly to day caballo is president by proclamation ah yes beneath the new administration i am the head of the department of mercantile concessions on my file i find one report senor casparis that you have not made ice in accord with your contract and here the bay man smiles at me cute oh well says i i guess the report s straight i know they caught me that s all there is to it do not say so says the bay man he pulls off a glove and goes over and lays his hand on that chunk of glass ice says he nodding his head solemn general dingo also steps over and feels of it ice says the general i ll swear to it if senor casparis says the bay man will present himself to the treasury on the sixth day of this month he will receive back the thousand dollars he did deposit as a forfeit adios senor the general and the bay man bowed themselves out and i bowed as often as they did and when the carriage rolls away through the sand i bows once more deeper than ever till my hat touches the ground but this time twas not intended for them for over their heads i saw the old flag fluttering in the breeze above the consul s roof and twas to it i made my profoundest salute the emancipation of billy in the old old square porticoed mansion with the wry window shutters and the paint peeling off in discoloured flakes lived one of the last war governors the south has forgotten the enmity of the great conflict but it refuses to abandon its old traditions and idols in governor pemberton as he was still fondly called the inhabitants of elmville saw the relic of their state s ancient greatness and glory in his day he had been a man large in the eye of his country his state had pressed upon him every honour within its gift and now when he was old and enjoying a richly merited repose outside the swift current of public affairs his townsmen loved to do him reverence for the sake of the past the governor s decaying mansion stood upon the main street of elmville within a few feet of its rickety paling fence every morning the governor would descend the steps with extreme care and deliberation on account of his rheumatism and then the click of his gold headed cane would be heard as he slowly proceeded up the rugged brick sidewalk he was now nearly seventy eight but he had grown old gracefully and beautifully his rather long smooth hair and flowing parted whiskers were snow white his full skirted frock croak was always buttoned snugly about his tall spare figure he wore a high well kept silk hat known as a plug in elmville and nearly always gloves his manners were punctilious and somewhat overcharged with courtesy the governor s walks up lee avenue the principal street developed in their course into a sort of memorial triumphant procession everyone he met saluted him with profound respect many would remove their hats those who were honoured with his personal friendship would pause to shake hands and then you would see exemplified the genuine beau ideal southern courtesy upon reaching the corner of the second square from the mansion the governor would pause another street crossed the venue there and traffic to the extent of several farmers wagons and a peddler s cart or two would rage about the junction then the falcon eye of general deffenbaugh would perceive the situation and the general would hasten with ponderous solicitude from his office in the first national bank building to the assistance of his old friend when the two exchanged greetings the decay of modern manners would become accusingly apparent the general s bulky and commanding figure would bend lissomely at a point where you would have regarded its ability to do so with incredulity the governor would take the general s arm and be piloted safely between the hay wagons and the sprinkling cart to the other side of the street proceeding to the post office in the care of his friend the esteemed statesmen would there hold an informal levee among the citizens who were come for their morning mail here gathering two or three prominent in law politics or family the pageant would make a stately progress along the avenue stopping at the palace hotel where perhaps would be found upon the register the name of some guest deemed worthy of an introduction to the state s venerable and illustrious son if any such were found an hour or two would be spent in recalling the faded glories of the governor s long vanished administration on the return march the general would invariably suggest that his excellency being no doubt fatigued it would be wise to recuperate for a few minutes at the drug emporium of mr appleby r fentress an elegant gentleman sir one of the chatham county fentresses so many of our best blooded families have had to go into trade sir since the war mr appleby r fentress was a connoisseur in fatigue indeed if he had not been his memory alone should have enabled him to prescribe for the majestic invasion of his pharmacy was a casual happening that had surprised him almost daily for years mr fentress knew the formula of and possessed the skill to compound a certain potion antagonistic to fatigue the salient ingredient of which he described no doubt in pharmaceutical terms as genuine old hand made clover leaf private stock nor did the ceremony of administering the potion ever vary mr fentress would first compound two of the celebrated mixtures one for the governor and the other for the general to sample then the governor would make this little speech in his high piping quavering voice no sir not one drop until you have prepared one for yourself and join us mr fentress your father sir was one of my most valued supporters and friends during my administration and any mark of esteem i can confer upon his son is not only a pleasure but a duty sir blushing with delight at the royal condescension the druggist would obey and all would drink to the general s toast the prosperity of our grand old state gentlemen the memory of her glorious past the health of her favourite son some one of the old guard was always at hand to escort the governor home sometimes the general s business duties denied him the privilege and then judge broomfield or colonel titus or one of the ashford county slaughters would be on hand to perform the rite such were the observances attendant upon the governor s morning stroll to the post office how much more magnificent impressive and spectacular then was the scene at public functions when the general would lead forth the silver haired relic of former greatness like some rare and fragile waxwork figure and trumpet his pristine eminence to his fellow citizens general deffenbaugh was the voice of elmville some said he was elmville at any rate he had no competitor as the mouthpiece he owned enough stock in the daily banner to dictate its utterance enough shares in the first national bank to be the referee of its loans and a war record that left him without a rival for first place at barbecues school commencements and decoration days besides these acquirements he was possessed with endowments his personality was inspiring and triumphant undisputed sway had moulded him to the likeness of a fatted roman emperor the tones of his voice were not otherwise than clarion to say that the general was public spirited would fall short of doing him justice he had spirit enough for a dozen publics and as a sure foundation for it all he had a heart that was big and stanch yes general deffenbaugh was elmville one little incident that usually occurred during the governor s morning walk has had its chronicling delayed by more important matters the procession was accustomed to halt before a small brick office on the avenue fronted by a short flight of steep wooden steps a modest tin sign over the door bore the words wm b pemberton attorney at law looking inside the general would roar hello billy my boy the less distinguished members of the escort would call morning billy the governor would pipe good morning william then a patient looking little man with hair turning gray along the temples would come down the steps and shake hands with each one of the party all elmville shook hands when it met the formalities concluded the little man would go back to his table heaped with law books and papers while the procession would proceed billy pemberton was as his sign declared a lawyer by profession by occupation and common consent he was the son of his father this was the shadow in which billy lived the pit out of which he had unsuccessfully striven for years to climb and he had come to believe the grave in which his ambitions were destined to be buried filial respect and duty he paid beyond the habit of most sons but he aspired to be known and appraised by his own deeds and worth after many years of tireless labour he had become known in certain quarters far from elmville as a master of the principles of the law twice he had gone to washington and argued cases before the highest tribunal with such acute logic and learning that the silken gowns on the bench had rustled from the force of it his income from his practice had grown until he was able to support his father in the old family mansion which neither of them would have thought of abandoning rickety as it was in the comfort and almost the luxury of the old extravagant days yet he remained to elmville as only billy pemberton the son of our distinguished and honoured fellow townsman ex governor pemberton thus was he introduced at public gatherings where he sometimes spoke haltingly and prosily for his talents were too serious and deep for extempore brilliancy thus was he presented to strangers and to the lawyers who made the circuit of the courts and so the daily banner referred to him in print to be the son of was his doom what ever he should accomplish would have to be sacrificed upon the altar of this magnificent but fatal parental precedence the peculiarity and the saddest thing about billy s ambition was that the only world he thirsted to conquer was elmville his nature was diffident and unassuming national or state honours might have oppressed him but above all things he hungered for the appreciation of the friends among whom he had been born and raised he would not have plucked one leaf from the garlands that were so lavishly bestowed upon his father he merely rebelled against having his own wreathes woven from those dried and self same branches but elmville billied and sonned him to his concealed but lasting chagrin until at length he grew more reserved and formal and studious than ever there came a morning when billy found among his mail a letter from a very high source tendering him the appointment to an important judicial position in the new island possessions of our country the honour was a distinguished one for the entire nation had discussed the probable recipients of these positions and had agreed that the situation demanded only men of the highest character ripe learning and evenly balanced mind billy could not subdue a certain exultation at this token of the success of his long and arduous labours but at the same time a whimsical smile lingered around his mouth for he foresaw in which column elmville would place the credit we congratulate governor pemberton upon the mark of appreciation conferred upon his son elmville rejoices with our honoured citizen governor pemberton at his son s success put her there billy judge billy pemberton sir son of our state s war hero and the people s pride these were the phrases printed and oral conjured up by billy s prophetic fancy grandson of his state and stepchild to elmville thus had fate fixed his kinship to the body politic billy lived with his father in the old mansion the two and an elderly lady a distant relative comprised the family perhaps though old jeff the governor s ancient coloured body servant should be included without doubt he could have claimed the honour there were other servants but thomas jefferson pemberton sah was a member of de fambly jeff was the one elmvillian who gave to billy the gold of approval unmixed with the alloy of paternalism to him mars william was the greatest man in talbot county beaten upon though he was by the shining light that emanates from an ex war governor and loyal as he remained to the old regime his faith and admiration were billy s as valet to a hero and a member of the family he may have had superior opportunities for judging jeff was the first one to whom bill revealed the news when he reached home for supper jeff took his plug hat and smoothed it before hanging it upon the hall rack dar now said the old man i knowed it was er comin i knowed it was gwine ter happen er judge you says mars william dem yankees done made you er judge it s high time sah dey was doin somep n to make up for dey rascality endurin de war i boun dey holds a confab and says le s make mars william pemberton er judge and dat ll settle it does you have to go way down to dem fillypines mars william or kin you judge em from here i d have to live there most of the time of course said billy i wonder what de gubnor gwine say bout dat speculated jeff billy wondered too after supper when the two sat in the library according to their habit the governor smoking his clay pipe and billy his cigar the son dutifully confessed to having been tendered the appointment for a long time the governor sat smoking without making any comment billy reclined in his favourite rocker waiting perhaps still flushed with satisfaction over the tender that had come to him unsolicited in his dingy little office above the heads of the intriguing time serving clamorous multitude at last the governor spoke and though his words were seemingly irrelevant they were to the point his voice had a note of martyrdom running through its senile quaver my rheumatism has been growing steadily worse these past months william i am sorry father said billy gently and i am nearly seventy eight i am getting to be an old man i can recall the names of but two or three who were in public life during my administration what did you say is the nature of this position that is offered you william a federal judgeship father i believe it is considered to be a somewhat flattering tender it is outside of politics and wire pulling you know no doubt no doubt few of the pembertons have engaged in professional life for nearly a century none of them have ever held federal positions they have been land holders slave owners and planters on a large scale one of two of the derwents your mother s family were in the law have you decided to accept this appointment william i am thinking it over said billy slowly regarding the ash of his cigar you have been a good son to me continued the governor stirring his pipe with the handle of a penholder i ve been your son all my life said billy darkly i am often gratified piped the governor betraying a touch of complacency by being congratulated upon having a son with such sound and sterling qualities especially in this our native town is your name linked with mine in the talk of our citizens i never knew anyone to forget the vindculum murmured billy unintelligibly whatever prestige pursued the parent i may be possessed of by virtue of my name and services to the state has been yours to draw upon freely i have not hesitated to exert it in your behalf whenever opportunity offered and you have deserved it william you ve been the best of sons and now this appointment comes to take you away from me i have but a few years left to live i am almost dependent upon others now even in walking and dressing what would i do without you my son the governor s pipe dropped to the floor a tear trickled from his eye his voice had risen and crumbled to a weakling falsetto and ceased he was an old old man about to be bereft of a son that cherished him billy rose and laid his hand upon the governor s shoulder don t worry father he said cheerfully i m not going to accept elmville is good enough for me i ll write to night and decline it at the next interchange of devoirs between the governor and general deffenbaugh on lee avenue his excellency with a comfortable air of self satisfaction spoke of the appointment that had been tendered to billy the general whistled that s a plum for billy he shouted who d have thought that billy but confound it it s been in him all the time it s a boost for elmville it ll send real estate up it s an honour to our state it s a compliment to the south we ve all been blind about billy when does he leave we must have a reception great gatlings that job s eight thousand a year there s been a car load of lead pencils worn to stubs figuring on those appointments think of it our little wood sawing mealy mouthed billy angel unawares doesn t begin to express it elmville is disgraced forever until she lines up in a hurry for ratification and apology the venerable moloch smiled fatuously he carried the fire with which to consume all these tributes to billy the smoke of which would ascend as an incense to himself william said the governor with modest pride has declined the appointment he refuses to leave me in my old age he is a good son the general swung round and laid a large forefinger upon the bosom of his friend much of the general s success had been due to his dexterity in establishing swift lines of communication between cause and effect governor he said with a keen look in his big ox like eyes you ve been complaining to billy about your rheumatism my dear general replied the governor stiffly my son is forty two he is quite capable of deciding such questions for himself and i as his parent feel it my duty to state that your remark about er rheumatism is a mighty poor shot from a very small bore sir aimed at a purely personal and private affliction if you will allow me retorted the general you ve afflicted the public with it for some time and twas no small bore at that this first tiff between the two old comrades might have grown into something more serious but for the fortunate interruption caused by the ostentatious approach of colonel titus and another one of the court retinue from the right county to whom the general confided the coddled statesman and went his way after billy had so effectually entombed his ambitions and taken the veil so to speak in a sonnery he was surprised to discover how much lighter of heart and happier he felt he realized what a long restless struggle he had maintained and how much he had lost by failing to cull the simple but wholesome pleasures by the way his heart warmed now to elmville and the friends who had refused to set him upon a pedestal it was better he began to think to be billy and his father s son and to be hailed familiarly by cheery neighbours and grown up playmates than to be your honour and sit among strangers hearing maybe through the arguments of learned counsel that old man s feeble voice crying what would i do without you my son billy began to surprise his acquaintances by whistling as he walked up the street others he astounded by slapping them disrespectfully upon their backs and raking up old anecdotes he had not had the time to recollect for years though he hammered away at his law cases as thoroughly as ever he found more time for relaxation and the company of his friends some of the younger set were actually after him to join the golf club a striking proof of his abandonment to obscurity was his adoption of a most undignified rakish little soft hat reserving the plug for sundays and state occasions billy was beginning to enjoy elmville though that irreverent burgh had neglected to crown him with bay and myrtle all the while uneventful peace pervaded elmville the governor continued to make his triumphal parades to the post office with the general as chief marshal for the slight squall that had rippled their friendship had to all indications been forgotten by both but one day elmville woke to sudden excitement the news had come that a touring presidential party would honour elmville by a twenty minute stop the executive had promised a five minute address from the balcony of the palace hotel elmville rose as one man that man being of course general deffenbaugh to receive becomingly the chieftain of all the clans the train with the tiny stars and stripes fluttering from the engine pilot arrived elmville had done her best there were bands flowers carriages uniforms banners and committees without end high school girls in white frocks impeded the steps of the party with roses strewn nervously in bunches the chieftain had seen it all before scores of times he could have pictured it exactly in advance from the blue and gray speech down to the smallest rosebud yet his kindly smile of interest greeted elmville s display as if it had been the only and original in the upper rotunda of the palace hotel the town s most illustrious were assembled for the honour of being presented to the distinguished guests previous to the expected address outside elmville s inglorious but patriotic masses filled the streets here in the hotel general deffenbaugh was holding in reserve elmville s trump card elmville knew for the trump was a fixed one and its lead consecrated by archaic custom at the proper moment governor pemberton beautifully venerable magnificently antique tall paramount stepped forward upon the arm of the general elmville watched and harked with bated breath never until now when a northern president of the united states should clasp hands with ex war governor pemberton would the breach be entirely closed would the country be made one and indivisible no north not much south very little east and no west to speak of so elmville excitedly scraped kalsomine from the walls of the palace hotel with its sunday best and waited for the voice to speak and billy we had nearly forgotten billy he was cast for son and he waited patiently for his cue he carried his plug in his hand and felt serene he admired his father s striking air and pose after all it was a great deal to be a son of a man who could so gallantly hold the position of a cynosure for three generations general deffenbaugh cleared his throat elmville opened its mouth and squirmed the chieftain with the kindly fateful face was holding out his hand smiling ex war governor pemberton extended his own across the chasm but what was this the general was saying mr president allow me to present to you one who has the honour to be the father of our foremost distinguished citizen learned and honoured jurist beloved townsman and model southern gentleman the honourable william b pemberton the enchanted kiss but a clerk in the cut rate drug store was samuel tansey yet his slender frame was a pad that enfolded the passion of romeo the gloom of laura the romance of d artagnan and the desperate inspiration of melnotte pity then that he had been denied expression that he was doomed to the burden of utter timidity and diffidence that fate had set him tongue tied and scarlet before the muslin clad angels whom he adored and vainly longed to rescue clasp comfort and subdue the clock s hands were pointing close upon the hour of ten while tansey was playing billiards with a number of his friends on alternate evenings he was released from duty at the store after seven o clock even among his fellow men tansey was timorous and constrained in his imagination he had done valiant deeds and performed acts of distinguished gallantry but in fact he was a sallow youth of twenty three with an over modest demeanour and scant vocabulary when the clock struck ten tansey hastily laid down his cue and struck sharply upon the show case with a coin for the attendant to come and receive the pay for his score what s your hurry tansey called one got another engagement tansey got an engagement echoed another not on your life tansey s got to get home at motten by her peek s orders it s no such thing chimed in a pale youth taking a large cigar from his mouth tansey s afraid to be late because miss katie might come down stairs to unlock the door and kiss him in the hall this last delicate piece of raillery sent a fiery tingle into tansey s blood for the indictment was true barring the kiss that was a thing to dream of to wildly hope for but too remote and sacred a thing to think of lightly casting a cold and contemptuous look at the speaker a punishment commensurate with his own diffident spirit tansey left the room descending the stairs into the street for two years he had silently adored miss peek worshipping her from a spiritual distance through which her attractions took on stellar brightness and mystery mrs peek kept a few choice boarders among whom was tansey the other young men romped with katie chased her with crickets in their fingers and jollied her with an irreverent freedom that turned tansey s heart into cold lead in his bosom the signs of his adoration were few a tremulous good morning stealthy glances at her during meals and occasionally oh rapture a blushing delirious game of cribbage with her in the parlour on some rare evening when a miraculous lack of engagement kept her at home kiss him in the hall aye he feared it but it was an ecstatic fear such as elijah must have felt when the chariot lifted him into the unknown but to night the gibes of his associates had stung him to a feeling of forward lawless mutiny a defiant challenging atavistic recklessness spirit of corsair adventurer lover poet bohemian possessed him the stars he saw above him seemed no more unattainable no less high than the favour of miss peek or the fearsome sweetness of her delectable lips his fate seemed to him strangely dramatic and pathetic and to call for a solace consonant with its extremity a saloon was near by and to this he flitted calling for absinthe beyond doubt the drink most adequate to his mood the tipple of the roue the abandoned the vainly sighing lover once he drank of it and again and then again until he felt a strange exalted sense of non participation in worldly affairs pervade him tansey was no drinker his consumption of three absinthe anisettes within almost as few minutes proclaimed his unproficiency in the art tansey was merely flooding with unproven liquor his sorrows which record and tradition alleged to be drownable coming out upon the sidewalk he snapped his fingers defiantly in the direction of the peek homestead turned the other way and voyaged columbus like into the wilds of an enchanted street nor is the figure exorbitant for beyond his store the foot of tansey had scarcely been set for years store and boarding house between these ports he was charted to run and contrary currents had rarely deflected his prow tansey aimlessly protracted his walk and whether it was his unfamiliarity with the district his recent accession of audacious errantry or the sophistical whisper of a certain green eyed fairy he came at last to tread a shuttered blank and echoing thoroughfare dark and unpeopled and suddenly this way came to an end as many streets do in the spanish built archaic town of san antone butting its head against an imminent high brick wall no the street still lived to the right and to the left it breathed through slender tubes of exit narrow somnolent ravines cobble paved and unlighted accommodating a rise in the street to the right was reared a phantom flight of five luminous steps of limestone flanked by a wall of the same height and of the same material upon one of these steps tansey seated himself and bethought him of his love and how she might never know she was his love and of mother peek fat vigilant and kind not unpleased tansey thought that he and katie should play cribbage in the parlour together for the cut rate had not cut his salary which sordidly speaking ranked him star boarder at the peek s and he thought of captain peek katie s father a man he dreaded and abhorred a genteel loafer and spendthrift battening upon the labour of his women folk a very queer fish and according to repute not of the freshest the night had turned chill and foggy the heart of the town with its noises was left behind reflected from the high vapours its distant lights were manifest in quivering cone shaped streamers in questionable blushes of unnamed colours in unstable ghostly waves of far electric flashes now that the darkness was become more friendly the wall against which the street splintered developed a stone coping topped with an armature of spikes beyond it loomed what appeared to be the acute angles of mountain peaks pierced here and there by little lambent parallelograms considering this vista tansey at length persuaded himself that the seeming mountains were in fact the convent of santa mercedes with which ancient and bulky pile he was better familiar from different coigns of view a pleasant note of singing in his ears reinforced his opinion high sweet holy carolling far and harmonious and uprising as of sanctified nuns at their responses at what hour did the sisters sing he tried to think was it six eight twelve tansey leaned his back against the limestone wall and wondered strange things followed the air was full of white fluttering pigeons that circled about and settled upon the convent wall the wall blossomed with a quantity of shining green eyes that blinked and peered at him from the solid masonry a pink classic nymph came from an excavation in the cavernous road and danced barefoot and airy upon the ragged flints the sky was traversed by a company of beribboned cats marching in stupendous aerial procession the noise of singing grew louder an illumination of unseasonable fireflies danced past and strange whispers came out of the dark without meaning or excuse without amazement tansey took note of these phenomena he was on some new plane of understanding though his mind seemed to him clear and indeed happily tranquil a desire for movement and exploration seized him he rose and turned into the black gash of street to his right for a time the high wall formed one of its boundaries but further on two rows of black windowed houses closed it in here was the city s quarter once given over to the spaniard here were still his forbidding abodes of concrete and adobe standing cold and indomitable against the century from the murky fissure the eye saw flung against the sky the tangled filigree of his moorish balconies through stone archways breaths of dead vault chilled air coughed upon him his feet struck jingling iron rings in staples stone buried for half a cycle along these paltry avenues had swaggered the arrogant don had caracoled and serenaded and blustered while the tomahawk and the pioneer s rifle were already uplifted to expel him from a continent and tansey stumbling through this old world dust looked up dark as it was and saw andalusian beauties glimmering on the balconies some of them were laughing and listening to the goblin music that still followed others harked fearfully through the night trying to catch the hoof beats of caballeros whose last echoes from those stones had died away a century ago those women were silent but tansey heard the jangle of horseless bridle bits the whirr of riderless rowels and now and then a muttered malediction in a foreign tongue but he was not frightened shadows nor shadows of sounds could daunt him afraid no afraid of mother peek afraid to face the girl of his heart afraid of tipsy captain peek nay nor of these apparitions nor of that spectral singing that always pursued him singing he would show them he lifted up a strong and untuneful voice when you hear them bells go tingalingling serving notice upon those mysterious agencies that if it should come to a face to face encounter there ll be a hot time in the old town to night how long tansey consumed in treading this haunted byway was not clear to him but in time he emerged into a more commodious avenue when within a few yards of the corner he perceived through a window that a small confectionary of mean appearance was set in the angle his same glance that estimated its meagre equipment its cheap soda water fountain and stock of tobacco and sweets took cognizance of captain peek within lighting a cigar at a swinging gaslight as tansey rounded the corner captain peek came out and they met vis a vis an exultant joy filled tansey when he found himself sustaining the encounter with implicit courage peek indeed he raised his hand and snapped his fingers loudly it was peek himself who quailed guiltily before the valiant mien of the drug clerk sharp surprise and a palpable fear bourgeoned upon the captain s face and verily that face was one to rather call up such expressions on the faces of others the face of a libidinous heathen idol small eyed with carven folds in the heavy jowls and a consuming pagan license in its expression in the gutter just beyond the store tansey saw a closed carriage standing with its back toward him and a motionless driver perched in his place why it s tansey exclaimed captain peek how are you tansey h have a cigar tansey why it s peek cried tansey jubilant at his own temerity what deviltry are you up to now peek back streets and a closed carriage fie peek there s no one in the carriage said the captain smoothly everybody out of it is in luck continued tansey aggressively i d love for you to know peek that i m not stuck on you you re a bottle nosed scoundrel why the little rat s drunk cried the captain joyfully only drunk and i thought he was on go home tansey and quit bothering grown persons on the street but just then a white clad figure sprang out of the carriage and a shrill voice katie s voice sliced the air sam sam help me sam tansey sprung toward her but captain peek interposed his bulky form wonder of wonders the whilom spiritless youth struck out with his right and the hulking captain went over in a swearing heap tansey flew to katie and took her in his arms like a conquering knight she raised her face and he kissed her violets electricity caramels champagne here was the attainment of a dream that brought no disenchantment oh sam cried katie when she could i knew you would come to rescue me what do you suppose the mean things were going to do with me have your picture taken said tansey wondering at the foolishness of his remark no they were going to eat me i heard them talking about it eat you said tansey after pondering a moment that can t be there s no plates but a sudden noise warned him to turn down upon him were bearing the captain and a monstrous long bearded dwarf in a spangled cloak and red trunk hose the dwarf leaped twenty feet and clutched them the captain seized katie and hurled her shrieking back into the carriage himself followed and the vehicle dashed away the dwarf lifted tansey high above his head and ran with him into the store holding him with one hand he raised the lid of an enormous chest half filled with cakes of ice flung tansey inside and closed down the cover the force of the fall must have been great for tansey lost consciousness when his faculties revived his first sensation was one of severe cold along his back and limbs opening his eyes he found himself to be seated upon the limestone steps still facing the wall and convent of santa mercedes his first thought was of the ecstatic kiss from katie the outrageous villainy of captain peek the unnatural mystery of the situation his preposterous conflict with the improbable dwarf these things roused and angered him but left no impression of the unreal i ll go back there to morrow he grumbled aloud and knock the head off that comic opera squab running out and picking up perfect strangers and shoving them into cold storage but the kiss remained uppermost in his mind i might have done that long ago he mused she liked it too she called me sam four times i ll not go up that street again too much scrapping guess i ll move down the other way wonder what she meant by saying they were going to eat her tansey began to feel sleepy but after a while he decided to move along again this time he ventured into the street to his left it ran level for a distance and then dipped gently downward opening into a vast dim barren space the old military plaza to his left some hundred yards distant he saw a cluster of flickering lights along the plaza s border he knew the locality at once huddled within narrow confines were the remnants of the once famous purveyors of the celebrated mexican national cookery a few years before their nightly encampments upon the historic alamo plaza in the heart of the city had been a carnival a saturnalia that was renowned throughout the land then the caterers numbered hundreds the patrons thousands drawn by the coquettish senoritas the music of the weird spanish minstrels and the strange piquant mexican dishes served at a hundred competing tables crowds thronged the alamo plaza all night travellers rancheros family parties gay gasconading rounders sightseers and prowlers of polyglot owlish san antone mingled there at the centre of the city s fun and frolic the popping of corks pistols and questions the glitter of eyes jewels and daggers the ring of laughter and coin these were the order of the night but now no longer to some half dozen tents fires and tables had dwindled the picturesque festival and these had been relegated to an ancient disused plaza often had tansey strolled down to these stands at night to partake of the delectable chili con carne a dish evolved by the genius of mexico composed of delicate meats minced with aromatic herbs and the poignant chili colorado a compound full of singular flavour and a fiery zest delightful to the southron s palate the titillating odour of this concoction came now on the breeze to the nostrils of tansey awakening in him hunger for it as he turned in that direction he saw a carriage dash up to the mexicans tents out of the gloom of the plaza some figures moved back and forward in the uncertain light of the lanterns and then the carriage was driven swiftly away tansey approached and sat at one of the tables covered with gaudy oil cloth traffic was dull at the moment a few half grown boys noisily fared at another table the mexicans hung listless and phlegmatic about their wares and it was still the night hum of the city crowded to the wall of dark buildings surrounding the plaza and subsided to an indefinite buzz through which sharply perforated the crackle of the languid fires and the rattle of fork and spoon a sedative wind blew from the southeast the starless firmament pressed down upon the earth like a leaden cover in all that quiet tansey turned his head suddenly and saw without disquietude a troop of spectral horsemen deploy into the plaza and charge a luminous line of infantry that advanced to sustain the shock he saw the fierce flame of cannon and small arms but heard no sound the careless victuallers lounged vacantly not deigning to view the conflict tansey mildly wondered to what nations these mute combatants might belong turned his back to them and ordered his chili and coffee from the mexican woman who advanced to serve him this woman was old and careworn her face was lined like the rind of a cantaloupe she fetched the viands from a vessel set by the smouldering fire and then retired to a tent dark within that stood near by presently tansey heard a turmoil in the tent a wailing broken hearted pleading in the harmonious spanish tongue and then two figures tumbled out into the light of the lanterns one was the old woman the other was a man clothed with a sumptuous and flashing splendour the woman seemed to clutch and beseech from him something against his will the man broke from her and struck her brutally back into the tent where she lay whimpering and invisible observing tansey he walked rapidly to the table where he sat tansey recognized him to be ramon torres a mexican the proprietor of the stand he was patronizing torres was a handsome nearly full blooded descendant of the spanish seemingly about thirty years of age and of a haughty but extremely courteous demeanour to night he was dressed with signal magnificence his costume was that of a triumphant matador made of purple velvet almost hidden by jeweled embroidery diamonds of enormous size flashed upon his garb and his hands he reached for a chair and seating himself at the opposite side of the table began to roll a finical cigarette ah meester tanse he said with a sultry fire in his silky black eyes i give myself pleasure to see you this evening meester tansee you have many times come to eat at my table i theenk you a safe man a verree good friend how much would it please you to leeve forever not come

que es senor for tansey had sprung to his feet upsetting the chair the words of katie reverberated in his ears they re going to eat me sam this then was the monstrous fate to which she had been delivered by her unnatural parent the carriage he had seen drive up from the plaza was captain peek s where was katie perhaps already before he could decide what to do a loud scream came from the tent the old mexican woman ran out a flashing knife in her hand i have released her she cried you shall kill no more they will hang you ingrato encatador torres with a hissing exclamation sprang at her ramoncito she shrieked once you loved me the mexican s arm raised and descended you are old he cried and she fell and lay motionless another scream the flaps of the tent were flung aside and there stood katie white with fear her wrists still bound with a cruel cord sam she cried save me again tansey rounded the table and flung himself with superb nerve upon the mexican just then a clangour began the clocks of the city were tolling the midnight hour tansey clutched at torres and for a moment felt in his grasp the crunch of velvet and the cold facets of the glittering gems the next instant the bedecked caballero turned in his hands to a shrunken leather visaged white bearded old old screaming mummy sandalled ragged and four hundred and three the mexican woman was crawling to her feet and laughing she shook her brown hand in the face of the whining viejo go now she cried and seek your senorita it was i ramoncito who brought you to this within each moon you eat of the life giving chili it was i that kept the wrong time for you you should have eaten yesterday instead of to morrow it is too late off with you hombre you are too old for me this decided tansey releasing his hold of the gray beard is a private family matter concerning age and no business of mine with one of the table knives he hastened to saw asunder the fetters of the fair captive and then for the second time that night he kissed katie peek tasted again the sweetness the wonder the thrill of it attained once more the maximum of his incessant dreams the next instant an icy blade was driven deep between his shoulders he felt his blood slowly congeal heard the senile cackle of the perennial spaniard saw the plaza rise and reel till the zenith crashed into the horizon and knew no more when tansey opened his eyes again he was sitting upon those self same steps gazing upon the dark bulk of the sleeping convent in the middle of his back was still the acute chilling pain how had he been conveyed back there again he got stiffly to his feet and stretched his cramped limbs supporting himself against the stonework he revolved in his mind the extravagant adventures that had befallen him each time he had strayed from the steps that night in reviewing them certain features strained his credulity had he really met captain peek or katie or the unparalleled mexican in his wanders had he really encountered them under commonplace conditions and his over stimulated brain had supplied the incongruities however that might be a sudden elating thought caused him an intense joy nearly all of us have at some point in our lives either to excuse our own stupidity or to placate our consciences promulgated some theory of fatalism we have set up an intelligent fate that works by codes and signals tansey had done likewise and now he read through the night s incidents the finger prints of destiny each excursion that he had made had led to the one paramount finale to katie and that kiss which survived and grew strong and intoxicating in his memory clearly fate was holding up to him the mirror that night calling him to observe what awaited him at the end of whichever road he might take he immediately turned and hurried homeward clothed in an elaborate pale blue wrapper cut to fit miss katie peek reclined in an armchair before a waning fire in her room her little bare feet were thrust into house shoes rimmed with swan s down by the light of a small lamp she was attacking the society news of the latest sunday paper some happy substance seemingly indestructible was being rhythmically crushed between her small white teeth miss katie read of functions and furbelows but she kept a vigilant ear for outside sounds and a frequent eye upon the clock over the mantel at every footstep upon the asphalt sidewalk her smooth round chin would cease for a moment its regular rise and fall and a frown of listening would pucker her pretty brows at last she heard the latch of the iron gate click she sprang up tripped softly to the mirror where she made a few of those feminine flickering passes at her front hair and throat which are warranted to hypnotize the approaching guest the door bell rang miss katie in her haste turned the blaze of the lamp lower instead of higher and hastened noiselessly down stairs into the hall she turned the key the door opened and mr tansey side stepped in why the i de a exclaimed miss katie is this you mr tansey it s after midnight aren t you ashamed to wake me up at such an hour to let you in you re just awful i was late said tansey brilliantly i should think you were ma was awfully worried about you when you weren t in by ten that hateful tom mcgill said you were out calling on another said you were out calling on some young lady i just despise mr mcgill well i m not going to scold you any more mr tansey if it is a little late oh i turned it the wrong way miss katie gave a little scream absent mindedly she had turned the blaze of the lamp entirely out instead of higher it was very dark tansey heard a musical soft giggle and breathed an entrancing odour of heliotrope a groping light hand touched his arm how awkward i was can you find your way sam i i think i have a match miss k katie a scratching sound a flame a glow of light held at arm s length by the recreant follower of destiny illuminating a tableau which shall end the ignominious chronicle a maid with unkissed curling contemptuous lips slowly lifting the lamp chimney and allowing the wick to ignite then waving a scornful and abjuring hand toward the staircase the unhappy tansey erstwhile champion in the prophetic lists of fortune ingloriously ascending to his just and certain doom while let us imagine half within the wings stands the imminent figure of fate

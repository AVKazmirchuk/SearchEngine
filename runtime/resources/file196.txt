comfort came in reflected gleams from the decayed furniture the raggcd brocade upholstery of a couch and two chairs a footwide cheap pier glass between the two windows from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a corner the guest reclined inert upon a chair while the room confused in speech as though it were an apartment in babel tried to discourse to him of its divers tenantry a polychromatic rug like some brilliant flowered rectangular tropical islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting upon the gay papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from house to house the huguenot lovers the first quarrel the wedding breakfast psyche at the fountain the mantel s chastely severe outline was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew like the sashes of the amazonian ballet upon it was some desolate flotsam cast aside by the room s marooned when a lucky sail had borne them to a fresh port a trifling vase or two pictures of actresses a medicine bottle some stray cards out of a deck one by one as the characters of a cryptograph become explicit the little signs left by the furnished room s procession of guests developed a significance the threadbare space in the rug in front of the dresser told that lovely woman had marched in the throng tiny finger prints on the wall spoke of little prisoners trying to feel their way to sun and air a splattered stain raying like the shadow of a bursting bomb witnessed where a hurled glass or bottle had splintered with its contents against the wall across the pier glass had been scrawled with a diamond in staggering letters the name marie it seemed that the succession of dwellers in the furnished room had turned in fury perhaps tempted beyond forbearance by its garish coldness and wreaked upon it their passions the furniture was chipped and bruised the couch distorted by bursting springs seemed a horrible monster that had been slain during the stress of some grotesque convulsion some more potent upheaval had cloven a great slice from the marble mantel each plank in the floor owned its particular cant and shriek as from a separate and individual agony it seemed incredible that all this malice and injury had been wrought upon the room by those who had called it for a time their home and yet it may have been the cheated home instinct surviving blindly the resentful rage at false household gods that had kindled their wrath a hut that is our own we can sweep and adorn and cherish the young tenant in the chair allowed these thoughts to file soft shod through his mind while there drifted into the room furnished sounds and furnished scents he heard in one room a tittering and incontinent slack laughter in others the monologue of a scold the rattling of dice a lullaby and one crying dully above him a banjo tinkled with spirit doors banged somewhere the elevated trains roared intermittently a cat yowled miserably upon a back fence and he breathed the breath of the house a dank savour rather than a smell a cold musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork then suddenly as he rested there the room was filled with the strong sweet odour of mignonette it came as upon a single buffet of wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost seemed a living visitant and the man cried aloud what dear as if he had been called and sprang up and faced about the rich odour clung to him and wrapped him around he reached out his arms for it all his senses for the time confused and commingled how could one be peremptorily called by an odour surely it must have been a sound but was it not the sound that had touched that had caressed him she has been in this room he cried and he sprang to wrest from it a token for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had belonged to her or that she had touched this enveloping scent of mignonette the odour that she had loved and made her own whence came it the room had been but carelessly set in order scattered upon the flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins those discreet indistinguishable friends of womankind feminine of gender infinite of mood and uncommunicative of tense these he ignored conscious of their triumphant lack of identity ransacking the drawers of the dresser he came upon a discarded tiny ragged handkerchief he pressed it to his face it was racy and insolent with heliotrope he hurled it to the floor in another drawer he found odd buttons a theatre programme a pawnbroker s card two lost marshmallows a book on the divination of dreams in the last was a woman s black satin hair bow which halted him poised between ice and fire but the black satin hairbow also is femininity s demure impersonal common ornament and tells no tales and then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent skimming the walls considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and knees rummaging mantel and tables the curtains and hangngs the drunken cabinet in the corner for a visible sign unable to perceive that she was there beside around against within above him clinging to him wooing him calling him so poignantly through the finer senses that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call once again he answered loudly yes dear and turned wild eyed to gaze on vacancy for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and outstretched arms in the odour of mnignonette oh god whence that odour and since when have odours had a voice to call thus he groped he burrowed in crevices

side between sixth and seventh ave nues an alley cuts the block in the middle it per ishes in a little court in the centre of the block the district is theatrical the inhabitants the bubbling froth of half a dozen nations the atmosphere is bohemian the language polyglot the locality pre carious in the court at the rear of the alley lived the candy man at seven o clock be pushed his cart into the narrow entrance rested it upon the irregular stone slats and sat upon one of the handles to cool himself there was a great draught of cool wind through the alley there was a window above the spot where be al ways stopped his pushcart in the cool of the after noon mlle adele drawing card of the aerial roof garden sat at the window and took the air gen erally her ponderous mass of dark auburn hair was down that the breeze might have the felicity of aid ing sidonie the maid in drying and airing it about her shoulders the point of her that the pho tographers always made the most of was loosely draped a heliotrope scarf her arms to the elbow were bare there were no sculptors there to rave over them but even the stolid bricks in the walls of the alley should not have been so insensate as to disapprove while she sat thus fe ice another maid anointed and bathed the small feet that twinkled and so charmed the nightly aerial audiences gradually mademoiselle began to notice the candy man stopping to mop his brow and cool himself be neath her window in the hands of her maids she was deprived for the time of her vocation the charming and binding to her chariot of man to lose time was displeasing to mademoiselle here was the candy man no fit game for her darts truly but of the sex upon which she had been born to make war after casting upon him looks of unseeing coldness for a dozen times one afternoon she suddenly thawed and poured down upon him a smile that put to shame the sweets upon his cart candy man she said cooingly while sidonie followed her impulsive dive brushing the heavy auburn hair don t you think i am beautiful the candy man laughed harshly and looked up with his thin jaw set while he wiped his forehead with a red and blue handkerchief yer d make a dandy magazine cover he said grudgingly beautiful or not is for them that cares it s not my line if yer lookin for bou quets apply elsewhere between nine and twelve i think we ll have rain truly fascinating a candy man is like killing rab bits in a deep snow but the hunter s blood is widely diffused mademoiselle tugged a great coil of hair from sidonie s bands and let it fall out the window candy man have you a sweetheart anywhere with hair as long and soft as that and with an arm so round she flexed an arm like galatea s after the miracle across the window sill the candy man cackled shrilly as he arranged a stock of butter scotch that had tumbled down smoke up said he vulgarly nothin doin in the complimentary line i m too wise to be bam boozled by a switch of hair and a newly massaged arm oh i guess you ll make good in the calcium all right with plenty of powder and paint on and the orchestra playing under the old apple tree but don t put on your hat and chase downstairs to fly to the little church around the corner with me i ve been up against peroxide and make up boxes be fore say all joking aside don t you think we ll have rain candy man said mademoiselle softly with her lips curving and her chin dimpling don t you think i m pretty the candy man grinned savin money ain t yer said be by bein yer own press agent i smoke but i haven t seen yer mug on any of the five cent cigar boxes it d take a new brand of woman to get me goin anyway i know em from sidecombs to shoelaces gimme a good day s sales and steak and onions at seven and a pipe and an evenin paper back there

watchin them from behind a reef and there ain t a woman on land or water or in the air good evenin and he trundled his pushcart down the alley and back to the musty court where he lived incredibly to him who has not learned woman mademoiselle sat at the window each day and spread her nets for the ignominious game once she kept a grand cavalier waiting in her reception chamber for half an hour while she battered in vain the candy man s tough philosophy his rough laugh chafed her vanity to its core daily he sat on his cart in the breeze of the alley while her hair was being ministered to and daily the shafts of her beauty rebounded from his dull bosom pointless and ineffectual un worthy pique brightened her eyes pride hurt she glowed upon him in a way that would have sent her higher adorers into an egoistic paradise the candy man s hard eyes looked upon her with a half con cealed derision that urged her to the use of the sharp est arrow in her beauty s quiver one afternoon she leaned far over the sill and she did not challenge and torment him as usual candy man said she stand up and look into my eyes he stood up and looked into her eyes with his harsh laugh like the sawing of wood he took out his pipe fumbled with it and put it back into big pocket with a trembling band that will do said mademoiselle with a slow smile i must go now to my masseuse good evening the next evening at seven the candy man came and rested his cart under the window but was it the candy man his clothes were a bright new check his necktie was a flaming red adorned by a glit tering horseshoe pin almost life size his shoes were polished the tan of his cheeks had paled his hands had been washed the window was empty and he waited under it with his nose upward like a hound hoping for a bone mademoiselle came with sidonie carrying her load of hair she looked at the candy man and smiled a slow smile that faded away into ennui instantly she knew that the game was bagged and so quickly she wearied of the chase she began to talk to sidonie been a fine day said the candy man hollowly first time in a month i ve felt first class hit it up down old madison hollering out like i useter think it ll rain to morrow mademoiselle laid two round arms on the cushion on the window sill and a dimpled chin upon them candy man said she softly do you not love me the candy man stood up and leaned against the brick wall lady said be chokingly i ve got saved up did i say you wasn t beautiful take it every bit of it and buy a collar for your dog with it a sound as of a hundred silvery bells tinkled in the room of mademoiselle the laughter filled the alley and trickled back into the court as strange a thing to enter there as sunlight itself mademoiselle was amused sidonie a wise echo added a sepulchral but faithful contralto the laughter of the two seemed at last to penetrate the candy man he fumbled with his horseshoe pin at length mademoiselle ex hausted turned her flushed beautiful face to the win dow candy man said she go away when i laugh sidonie pulls my hair i can but laugh while you remain there here is a note for mademoiselle said fe ice coming to the window in the room there is no justice said the candy man lift ing the handle of his cart and moving away three yards he moved and stopped loud shriek after shriek came from the window of mademoiselle quickly he ran back he heard a body thumping upon the floor and a sound as though heels beat alter nately upon it what is it be called sidonie s severe head came into the window mademoiselle is overcome by bad news she said one whom she loved with all her soul has gone you may have beard of him he is monsieur ives he sails across the ocean to morrow oh you men squaring the circle at the hazard of wearying you this tale of vehe ment emotions must be prefaced by a discourse on geometry nature moves in circles art in straight lines the natural is rounded the artificial is made up of angles a man lost in the snow wanders in spite of himself in perfect circles the city man s feet denaturalized by rectangular streets and floors carry him ever away from himself the round eyes of childhood typify innocence the narrowed line of the flirt s optic proves the in vasion of art the horizontal mouth is the mark of determined cunning who has not read nature s most spontaneous lyric in lips rounded for the candid kiss beauty is nature in perfection circularity is its chief attribute behold the full moon the enchant ing golf ball the domes of splendid temples the huckleberry pie the wedding ring the circus ring the ring for the waiter and the round of drinks on the other hand straight lines show that na ture has been deflected imagine venus s girdle transformed into a straight front when we begin to move in straight lines and turn sharp corners our natures begin to change the consequence is that nature being more adaptive than art tries to conform to its sterner regulations the result is often a rather curious product for in stance a prize chrysanthemum wood alcohol whis key a republican missouri cauliflower au gratin and a new yorker nature is lost quickest in a big city the cause is geometrical not moral the straight lines of its streets and architecture the rectangularity of its laws and social customs the undeviating pavements the hard severe depressing uncompromising rules of all its ways even of its recreation and sports coldly exhibit a sneering defiance of the curved line of nature wherefore it may be said that the big city has demonstrated the problem of squaring the circle and it may be added that this mathematical intro duction precedes an account of the fate of a kentucky feud that was imported to the city that has a habit of making its importations conform to its angles the feud began in the cumberland mountains be tween the folwell and the harkness families the first victim of the homespun vendetta was a possum dog belonging to bill harkness the harkness family evened up this dire loss by laying out the chief of the folwell clan the folwells were prompt at repartee they oiled up their squirrel rifles and made it feasible for bill harkness to follow his dog to a land where the possums come down when treed without the stroke of an ax the feud flourished for forty years harknesses were shot at the plough through their lamp lit cabin windows coming from camp meeting asleep in duello sober and otherwise singly and in family groups prepared and unprepared folwells had the branches of their family tree lopped off in similar ways as the traditions of their country prescribed and authorized by and by the pruning left but a single member of each family and then cal harkness probably reasoning that further pursuance of the controversy would give a too decided personal flavor to the feud suddenly disappeared from the relieved cumberlands baulking the avenging hand of sam the ultimate op posing folwell a year afterward sam folwell learned that his hereditary unsuppressed enemy was living in new york city sam turned over the big iron wash pot in the yard scraped off some of the soot which he mixed with lard and shined his boots with the com pound he put on his store clothes of butternut dyed black a white shirt and collar and packed a carpet sack with spartan lingerie he took his squirrel rifle from its hooks but put it back again with a sigh however ethical and plausible the habit might be in the cumberlands perhaps new york would not swallow his pose of hunting squirrels among the skyscrapers along broadway an ancient but reliable colt s revolver that he resurrected from a bureau drawer seemed to proclaim itself the pink of weapons for metropolitan adventure and vengeance this and a hunting knife in a leather sheath sam packed in the carpet sack as he started muleback for the lowland railroad station the last folwell turned in his saddle and looked grimly at the little cluster of white pine slabs in the clump of cedars that marked the folwell burying ground sam folwell arrived in new york in the night still moving and living in the free circles of nature he did not perceive the formidable pitiless restless fierce angles of the great city waiting in the dark to close about the rotundity of his heart and brain and mould him to the form of its millions of re shaped victims a cabby picked him out of the whirl as sam himself had often picked a nut from a bed of wind tossed autumn leaves and whisked him away to a hotel commensurate to his boots and carpet sack on the next morning the last of the folwells made his sortie into the city that sheltered the last hark ness the colt was thrust beneath his coat and se cured by a narrow leather belt the hunting knife hung between his shoulder blades with the haft an inch below his coat collar he knew this much that cal harkness drove an express wagon some where in that town and that he sam folwell had come to kill him and as he stepped upon the side walk the red came into his eye and the feud hate into his heart the clamor of the central avenues drew him thith erward he had half expected to see cal coming down the street in his shirt sleeves with a jug and a whip in his hand just as he would have seen him in frankfort or laurel city but an hour went by and cal did not appear perhaps he was waiting in ambush to shoot him from a door or a window sam kept a sharp eye on doors and windows for a while about noon the city tired of playing with its mouse and suddenly squeezed him with its straight lines sam folwell stood where two great rectangular arteries of the city cross he looked four ways and saw the world burled from its orbit and reduced by spirit level and tape to an edged and cornered plane all life moved on tracks in grooves accord ing to system within boundaries by rote the root of life was the cube root the measure of existence was square measure people streamed by in straight rows the horrible din and crash stupefied him sam leaned against the sharp corner of a stone building those faces passed him by thousands and none of them were turned toward him a sudden fool ish fear that he had died and was a spirit and that they could not see him seized him and then the city smote him with loneliness a fat man dropped out of the stream and stood a few feet distant waiting for his car sam crept to his side and shouted above the tumult into his ear the rankinses hogs weighed more n ourn a whole passel but the mast in thar neighborhood was a fine chance better than what it was down the fat man moved away unostentatiously and bought roasted chestnuts to cover his alarm sam felt the need of a drop of mountain dew across the street men passed in and out through swinging doors brief glimpses could be had of a glistening bar and its bedeckings the feudist crossed and essayed to enter again had art eliminated the familiar circle sam s hand found no door knob it slid in vain over a rectangular brass plate and polished oak with nothing even so large as a pin s head upon which his fingers might close abashed reddened heartbroken he walked away from the bootless door and sat upon a step a locust club tickled him in the ribs take a walk for yourself said the policeman you ve been loafing around here long enough at the next corner a shrill whistle sounded in sam s ear he wheeled around and saw a black browed vil lain scowling at him over peanuts heaped on a steam ing machine he started across the street an im mense engine running without mules with the voice of a bull and the smell of a smoky lamp whizzed past grazing his knee a cab driver bumped him with a hub and explained to him that kind words were in vented to be used on other occasions a motorman clanged his bell wildly and for once in his life cor roborated a cab driver a large lady in a changeable silk waist dug an elbow into his back and a newsy pensively pelted him with banana rinds murmuring i hates to do it but if anybody seen me let it pass cal harkness his day s work over and his express wagon stabled turned the sharp edge of the build ing that by the cheek of architects is modelled upon a safety razor out of the mass of hurrying people his eye picked up three yards away the surviving bloody and implacable foe of his kith and kin he stopped short and wavered for a moment be ing unarmed and sharply surprised but the keen mountaineer s eye of sam folwell had picked him out there was a sudden spring a ripple in the stream of passersby and the sound of sam s voice crying howdy cal i m durned glad to see ye and in the angles of broadway fifth avenue and twenty third street the cumberland feudists shook hands roses ruses and romance ravenel ravenel the traveller artist and poet threw his magazine to the floor sammy brown broker s clerk who sat by the window jumped what is it ravvy he asked the critics been hammering your stock down romance is dead said ravenel lightly when ravenel spoke lightly be was generally serious he picked up the magazine and fluttered its leaves even a philistine like you sammy said rave nel seriously a tone that insured him to be speak ing lightly ought to understand now here is a magazine that once printed poe and lowell and whitman and bret harte and du maurier and lanier and well that gives you the idea the current number has this literary feast to set before you an article on the stokers and coal bunkers of battleships an expose of the methods employed in making liver wurst a continued story of a standard preferred international baking powder deal in wall street a poem on the bear that the president missed an other story by a young woman who spent a week as a spy making overalls on the east side another fiction story that reeks of the garage and a cer tain make of automobile of course the title contains the words cupid and chauffeur an article on naval strategy illustrated with cuts of the spanish armada and the new staten island ferry boats an other story of a political boss who won the love of a fifth avenue belle by blackening her eye and refusing to vote for an iniquitous ordinance it doesn t say whether it was in the street cleaning department or congress and nineteen pages by the editors brag ging about the circulation the whole thing sammy is an obituary on romance sammy brown sat comfortably in the leather arm chair by the open window his suit was a vehement brown with visible checks beautifully matched in shade by the ends of four cigars that his vest pocket poorly concealed light tan were his shoes gray his socks sky blue his apparent linen snowy and high and adamantine his collar against which a black but terfly had alighted and spread his wings sammy s face least important was round and pleasant and pinkish and in his eyes you saw no haven for fleeing romance that window of ravenel s apartment opened upon an old garden full of ancient trees and shrubbery the apartment house towered above one side of it a high brick wall fended it from the street oppo site ravenel s window an old old mansion stood half hidden in the shade of the summer foliage the house was a castle besieged the city howled and roared and shrieked and beat upon its double doors and shook white fluttering checks above the wall offering terms of surrender the gray dust settled upon the trees the siege was pressed hotter but the draw bridge was not lowered no further will the language of chivalry serve inside lived an old gentleman who loved his home and did not wish to sell it that is all the romance of the besieged castle three or four times every week came sammy brown to ravenel s apartment he belonged to the poet s club for the former browns had been con spicuous though sammy bad been vulgarized by business he had no tears for departed romance the song of the ticker was the one that reached his heart and when it came to matters equine and batting scores he was something of a pink edition he loved to sit in the leather armchair by ravenel s window and ravenel didn t mind particularly sammy seemed to enjoy his talk and then the broker s clerk was such a perfect embodiment of modernity and the day s sordid practicality that ravenel rather liked to use him as a scapegoat i ll tell you what s the matter with you said sammy with the shrewdness that business had taught him the magazine has turned down some of your poetry stunts that s why you are sore at it that would be a good guess in wall street or in a campaign for the presidency of a woman s club said ravenel quietly now there is a poem if you will allow me to call it that of my own in this number of the magazine read it to me said sammy watching a cloud of pipe smoke be had just blown out the window ravenel was no greater than achilles no one is there is bound to be a spot the somebody or other must take bold of us somewhere when she dips us in the something or other that makes us invulnerable he read aloud this verse in the magazine the four roses one rose i twined within your hair white rose that spake of worth and one you placed upon your breast red rose love s seal of birth you plucked another from its stem tea rose that means for aye and one you gave that bore for me the thorns of memory that s a crackerjack said sammy admiringly there are five more verses said ravenel pa tiently sardonic one naturally pauses at the end of each of course oh let s have the rest old man shouted sammy contritely i didn t mean to cut you off i m not much of a poetry expert you know i never saw a poem that didn t look like it ought to have terminal facilities at the end of every verse reel off the rest of it ravenel sighed and laid the magazine down all right said sammy cheerfully we ll have it next time i ll be off now got a date at five o clock he took a last look at the shaded green garden and left whistling in an off key an untuneful air from a roofless farce comedy the next afternoon ravenel while polishing a ragged line of a new sonnet reclined by the window overlooking the besieged garden of the unmercenary baron suddenly he sat up spilling two rhymes and a syllable or two through the trees one window of the old mansion could be seen clearly in its window draped in flow ing white leaned the angel of all his dreams of ro mance and poesy young fresh as a drop of dew graceful as a spray of clematis conferring upon the garden hemmed in by the roaring traffic the air of a princess s bower beautiful as any flower sung by poet thus ravenel saw her for the first time she lingered for a while and then disappeared within leaving a few notes of a birdlike ripple of song to reach his entranced ears through the rattle of cabs and the snarling of the electric cars thus as if to challenge the poet s flaunt at ro mance and to punish him for his recreancy to the undying spirit of youth and beauty this vision bad dawned upon him with a thrilling and accusive power and so metabolic was the power that in an instant the atoms of ravenel s entire world were redistrib uted the laden drays that passed the house in which she lived rumbled a deep double bass to the tune of love the newsboys shouts were the notes of singing birds that garden was the pleasance of the capulets the janitor was an ogre himself a knight ready with sword lance or lute thus does romance show herself amid forests of brick and stone when she gets lost in the city and there has to be sent out a general alarm to find her again at four in the afternoon ravenel looked out across the garden in the window of his hopes were set four small vases each containing a great full blown rose red and white and as he gazed she leaned above them shaming them with her loveliness and seeming to direct her eyes pensively toward his own window and then as though she had caught his respectful but ardent regard she melted away leaving the fragrant emblems on the window sill yes emblems he would be unworthy if be had not understood she had read his poem the four roses it had reached her heart and this was its romantic answer of course she must know that ravenel the poet lived there across her garden his picture too she must have seen in the magazines the delicate tender modest flattering message could not be ignored ravenel noticed beside the roses a small flowering pot containing a plant without shame be brought his opera glasses and employed them from the cover of his window curtain a nutmeg geranium with the true poetic instinct be dragged a book of useless information from his shelves and tore open the leaves at the language of flowers geranium nutmeg i expect a meeting so romance never does things by halves if she comes back to you she brings gifts and her knitting and will sit in your chimney corner if you will let her and now ravenel smiled the lover smiles when be thinks he has won the woman who loves ceases to smile with victory he ends a battle she begins hers what a pretty idea to set the four roses in her window for him to see she must have a sweet poetic soul and now to contrive the meeting a whistling and slamming of doors preluded the coming of sammy brown ravenel smiled again even sammy brown was shone upon by the far flung rays of the renaissance sammy with his ultra clothes his horseshoe pin his plump face his trite slang his uncomprehending admiration of ravenel the broker s clerk made an excellent foil to the new bright unseen visitor to the poet s sombre apartment sammy went to his old seat by the window and looked out over the dusty green foliage in the garden then he looked at his watch and rose hastily by grabs he exclaimed twenty after four i can t stay old man i ve got a date at why did you come then asked ravenel with sarcastic jocularity if you had an engagement at that time i thought you business men kept better account of your minutes and seconds than that sammy hesitated in the doorway and turned pinker fact is ravvy be explained as to a customer whose margin is exhausted i didn t know i had it till i came i ll tell you old man there s a dandy girl in that old house next door that i m dead gone on i put it straight we re engaged the old man says nit but that don t go he keeps her pretty close i can see edith s window from yours here she gives me a tip when she s going shopping and i meet her it s to day maybe i ought to have explained sooner but i know it s all right with you so long how do you get your tip as you call it asked ravenel losing a little spontaneity from his smile roses said sammy briefly four of em to day means four o clock at the corner of broadway and twenty third but the geranium persisted ravenel clutch ing at the end of flying romance s trailing robe means half past shouted sammy from the hall see you to morrow the city of dreadful night during the recent warmed over spell said my friend carney driver of express wagon no a good many opportunities was had of observing human nature through peekaboo waists the park commissioner and the commissioner of polis and the forestry commission gets together and agrees to let the people sleep in the parks until the weather bureau gets the thermometer down again to a living basis so they draws up open air resolu tions and has them k d by the secretary of agri culture mr comstock and the village improvement mosquito exterminating society of south orange n j when the proclamation was made opening up to the people by special grant the public parks that be long to em there was a general exodus into central park by the communities existing along its borders in ten minutes after sundown you d have thought that there was an undress rehearsal of a potato famine in ireland and a kishineff massacre they come by families gangs clambake societies clans clubs and tribes from all sides to enjoy a cool sleep on the grass them that didn t have oil stoves brought along plenty of blankets so as not to be upset with the cold and discomforts of sleeping outdoors by building fires of the shade trees and huddling together in the bridle paths and burrowing under the grass where the ground was soft enough the likes of head of people successfully battled against the night air in central park alone ye know i live in the elegant furnished apart ment house called the beersheba flats over against the elevated portion of the new york central rail road when the order come to the flats that all hands must turn out and sleep in the park according to the instructions of the consulting committee of the city club and the murphy draying returfing and sod ding company there was a look of a couple of fires and an eviction all over the place the tenants began to pack up feather beds rub ber boots strings of garlic hot water bags porta ble canoes and scuttles of coal to take along for the sake of comfort the sidewalk looked like a russian camp in oyama s line of mareb there was waiting and lamenting up and down stairs from danny geog hegan s flat on the top floor to the apartments of missis goldsteinupski on the first for why says danny coming down and raging in his blue yarn socks to the janitor should i be turned out of me comfortable apartments to lay in the dirty grass like a rabbit tis like jerome to stir up trouble wid small matters like this instead of whist says officer reagan on the sidewalk rapping with his club tis not jerome tis by order of the polis commissioner turn out every one of yez and hike yerselves to the park now twas a peaceful and happy home that all of us had in them same beersheba flats the o dowds and the steinowitzes and the callahans and the cohens and the spizzinellis and the mcmanuses and the spiegelmayers and the joneses all nations of us we lived like one big family together and when the hot nights come along we kept a line of children reaching from the front door to kelly s on the corner passing along the cans of beer from one to another without the trouble of running after it and with no more clothing on than is provided for in the statutes sitting in all the windies with a cool growler in every one and your feet out in the air and the rosenstein girls singing on the fire escape of the sixth floor and patsy rourke s flute going in the eighth and the ladies calling each other synonyms out the win dies and now and then a breeze sailing in over mister depew s central i tell you the beersheba flats was a summer resort that made the catskills look like a bole in the ground with his person full of beer and his feet out the windy and his old woman frying pork chops over a charcoal furnace and the children dancing in cotton slips on the sidewalk around the organ grinder and the rent paid for a week what does a man want better on a hot night than that and then comes this ruling of the polis driving people out o their comfortable homes to sleep in parks twas for all the world like a ukase of them rus sians twill be heard from again at next election time well then officer reagan drives the whole lot of us to the park and turns us in by the nearest gate tis dark under the trees and all the children sets up to howling that they want to go home ye ll pass the night in this stretch of woods and scenery says officer reagan twill be fine and imprisonment for insoolting the park commis sioner and the chief of the weather bureau if ye re fuse i m in charge of thirty acres between here and

night me orders was silent on the subject of bail but i find out if tis required and there ll be bondsmen at the gate there being no lights except along the automo bile drives us tenants of the beersheba flats prepared to spend the night as best we could in the raging forest them that brought blankets and kin dling wood was best off they got fires started and wrapped the blankets round their heads and laid down cursing in the grass there was nothing to see nothing to drink nothing to do in the dark we had no way of telling friend or foe except by feeling the noses of em i brought along me last winter overcoat me toothbrush some quinine pills and the red quilt off the bed in me flat three times during the night somebody rolled on me quilt and stuck his knees against the adam s apple of me and three times i judged his character by running me hand over his face and three times i rose up and kicked the in truder down the hill to the gravelly walk below and then some one with a flavor of kelly s whiskey snug gled up to me and i found his nose turned up the right way and i says is that you then patsey and he says it is carney how long do you think it ll last i m no weather prophet says i but if they bring out a strong anti tammany ticket next fall it ought to get us home in time to sleep on a bed once or twice before they line us up at the polls a playing of my flute into the airshaft i says patsey rourke and a perspiring in me own windy to the joyful noise of the passing trains and the smell of liver and onions and a reading of the latest mur der in the smoke of the cooking is well enough for me says he what is this herding us in grass for not to mention the crawling things with legs that walk up the trousers of us and the jersey snipes that peck at us masquerading under the name and denom ination of mosquitoes what is it all for carney and the rint going on just the same over at the flats tis the great annual municipal free night outing lawn party says i given by the polis hetty green and the drug trust during the heated season they hold a week of it in the principal parks tis a scheme to reach that portion of the people that s not worth taking up to north beach for a fish fry i can t sleep on the ground says patsey wid any benefit i have the hay fever and the rheuma tism and me car is full of ants well the night goes on and the ex tenants of the flats groans and stumbles around in the dark trying to find rest and recreation in the forest the children is screaming with the coldness and the jan itor makes hot tea for em and keeps the fires going with the signboards that point to the tavern and the casino the tenants try to lay down on the grass by families in the dark but you re lucky if you can sleep next to a man from the same floor or believing in the same religion now and then a murpby acci dental rolls over on the grass of a rosenstein or a cohen tries to crawl under the o grady bush and then there s a feeling of noses and somebody is rolled down the hill to the driveway and stays there there is some hair pulling among the women folks and everybody spanks the nearest howling kid to him by the sense of feeling only regardless of its parentage and ownership tis hard to keep up the social dis tinctions in the dark that flourish by daylight in the beersheba flats mrs rafferty that despises the asphalt that a dago treads on wakes up in the morn ing with her feet in the bosom of antonio spizzinelli and mike o dowd that always threw peddlers down stairs as fast as he came upon em has to unwind old isaacstein s whiskers from around his neck and wake up the whole gang at daylight but here and there some few got acquainted and overlooked the discom forts of the elements there was five engagements to be married announced at the flats the next morning about midnight i gets up and wrings the dew out of my hair and goes to the side of the driveway and sits down at one side of the park i could see the lights in the streets and houses and i was thinking how happy them folks was who could chase the duck and smoke their pipes at their windows and keep cool and pleasant like nature intended for em to just then an automobile stops by me and a fine looking well dressed man steps out me man says he can you tell me why all these people are lying around on the grass in the park i thought it was against the rules twas an ordinance says i just passed by the polis department and ratified by the turf cut ters association providing that all persons not car rying a license number on their rear axles shall keep in the public parks until further notice fortu nately the orders comes this year during a spell of fine weather and the mortality except on the borders of the lake and along the automobile drives will

his younger brothers like logs out of his way as they lay sleeping on the floor before a foot square looking glass hung by the win dow he stood and shaved himself if that may seem to you a task too slight to be thus impressively chron icled i bear with you you do not know of the areas to be accomplished in traversing the cheek and chin of mr mcquirk mcquirk senior had gone to work long before the big son of the house was idle he was a marble cutter and the marble cutters were out on a strike what ails ye asked his mother looking at him curiously are ye not feeling well the morning maybe now he s thinking along of annie maria doyle im pudently explained younger brother tim ten years old tiger reached over the hand of a champion and swept the small mcquirk from his chair i feel fine said he beyond a touch of the i don t know wbat you call its i feel like there was going to be earthquakes or music or a trifle of chills and fever or maybe a picnic i don t know how i feel i feel like knocking the face off a policeman or else maybe like playing coney island straight across the board from pop corn to the elephant boudabs it s the spring in yer bones said mrs mcquirk it s the sap risin time was when i couldn t keep me feet still nor me head cool when the earthworms began to crawl out in the dew of the mornin tis a bit of tea will do ye good made from pipsissewa and gentian bark at the druggist s back up said mr mcquirk impatiently there s no spring in sight there s snow yet on the shed in donovan s backyard and yesterday they puts open cars on the sixth avenue lines and the janitors have quit ordering coal and that means six weeks more of winter by all the signs that be after breakfast mr mcquirk spent fifteen minutes before the corrugated mirror subjugating his hair and arranging his green and purple ascot with its amethyst tombstone pin eloquent of his chosen calling since the strike had been called it was this par ticular striker s habit to hie himself each morning to the corner saloon of flaherty brothers and there establish himself upon the sidewalk with one foot resting on the bootblack s stand observing the panorama of the street until the pace of time brought twelve o clock and the dinner hour and mr tiger mcquirk with his athletic seventy inches well trained in sport and battle his smooth pale solid amiable face blue where the razor had trav elled his carefully considered clothes and air of capa bility was himself a spectacle not displeasing to the eye but on this morning mr mcquirk did not hasten immediately to his post of leisure and observation something unusual that he could not quite grasp was in the air something disturbed his thoughts ruffled his senses made him at once languid irritable elated dissastisfied and sportive he was no diagnostician and he did not know that lent was breaking up physiologically in his system mrs mcquirk had spoken of spring sceptically tiger looked about him for signs few they were the organ grinders were at work but they were always precocious harbingers it was near enough spring for them to go penny hunting when the skating ball dropped at the park in the milliners windows easter hats grave gay and jubilant blos somed there were green patches among the side walk debris of the grocers on a third story window sill the first elbow cushion of the season old gold stripes on a crimson ground supported the kimo noed arms of a pensive brunette the wind blew cold from the east river but the sparrows were fly ing to the eaves with straws a second hand store combining foresight with faith had set out an ice chest and baseball goods and then tiger s eye discrediting these signs fell upon one that bore a bud of promise from a bright new lithograph the head of capricornus con fronted him betokening the forward and heady brew mr mcquirk entered the saloon and called for his glass of bock he threw his nickel on the bar raised the glass set it down without tasting it and strolled toward the door wot s the matter lord bolinbroke inquired the sarcastic bartender want a chiny vase or a gold lined epergne to drink it out of hey say said mr mcquirk wheeling and shooting out a horizontal hand and a forty five degree chin you know your place only when it comes for givin titles i ve changed me mind about drinkin see you got your money ain t you wait till you get stung before you get the droop to your lip will you thus mr quirk added mutability of desires to the strange humors that had taken possession of him leaving the saloon he walked away twenty steps and leaned in the open doorway of lutz the barber he and lutz were friends masking their sentiments behind abuse and bludgeons of repartee irish loafer roared lutz how do you do so not yet haf der bolicemans or der catcher of dogs done deir duty hello dutch said mr mcquirk can t get your mind off of frankfurters can you bah exclaimed the german coming and lean ing in the door i haf a soul above frankfurters to day dere is springtime in der air i can feel it coming in ofer der mud of der streets and das ice in der river soon will dere be bienics in der islands mit kegs of beer under der trees say said mr mcquirk setting his bat on one side is everybody kiddin me about gentle spring there ain t any more spring in the air than there is in a horsehair sofa in a second avenue furnished room for me the winter underwear yet and the buckwheat cakes you haf no boetry said lutz true it is yedt cold und in der city we haf not many of der signs but dere are dree kinds of beoble dot should always feel der approach of spring first dey are boets lovers and poor vidows mr mcquirk went on his way still possessed by the strange perturbation that he did not understand something was lacking to his comfort and it made him half angry because be did not know what it was two blocks away he came upon a foe one conover whom he was bound in honor to engage in combat mr mcquirk made the attack with the charac teristic suddenness and fierceness that had gained for him the endearing sobriquet of tiger the de fence of mr conover was so prompt and admirable that the conflict was protracted until the onlookers un selfishly gave the warning cry of cheese it the cop the principals escaped easily by running through the nearest open doors into the communi cating backyards at the rear of the houses mr mcquirk emerged into another street he stood by a lamp post for a few minutes engaged in thought and then he turned and plunged into a small notion and news shop a red haired young woman eating gum drops came and looked freezingly at him across the ice bound steppes of the counter say lady he said have you got a song book with this in it let s see bow it leads off when the springtime comes well wander in the dale love and whisper of those days of yore i m having a friend explained mr mcquirk laid up with a broken leg and he sent me after it he s a devil for songs and poetry when he can t get out to drink we have not replied the young woman with un concealed contempt but there is a new song out that begins this way let us sit together in the old armchair and while the firelight flickers we ll be comfortable there there will be no profit in following mr tiger mcquirk through his further vagaries of that day until he comes to stand knocking at the door of annie maria doyle the goddess eastre it seems had guided his footsteps aright at last is that you now jimmy mcquirk she cried smiling through the opened door annie maria had never accepted the tiger well whatever come out in the ball said mr mcquirk i want to ask yer opinion of the weather on the level are you crazy sure said annie maria i am said the tiger they ve been telling me all day there was spring in the air were they liars or am i dear me said annie maria haven t you no ticed it i can almost smell the violets and the green grass of course there ain t any yet it s just a kind of feeling you know that s what i m getting at

violets it spells yer own name annie maria and it s you i want i go to work next monday and i make four dollars a day spiel up old girl do we make a team jimmy sighed annie maria suddenly disap pearing in his overcoat don t you see that spring is all over the world right this minute but you yourself remember how that day ended beginning with so fine a promise of vernal things late in the afternoon the air chilled and an inch of snow fell even so late in march on fifth ave nue the ladies drew their winter furs close about them only in the florists windows could be per ceived any signs of the morning smile of the coming goddess eastre at six o clock herr lutz began to close his shop he beard a well known shout hello dutch tiger mcquirk in his shirt sleeves with his hat on the back of his bead stood outside in the whirling snow puffing at a black cigar donnerwetter shouted lutz der vinter he has gome back again yet yer a liar dutch called back mr mcquirk with friendly geniality it s springtime by the watch the fool killer down south whenever any one perpetrates some particularly monumental piece of foolishness every body says send for jesse holmes jesse holmes is the fool killer of course he is a myth like santa claus and jack frost and general prosperity and all those concrete conceptions that are supposed to represent an idea that nature has failed to embody the wisest of the southrons can not tell you whence comes the fool killer s name but few and happy are the households from the ro anoke to the rio grande in which the name of jesse holmes has not been pronounced or invoked always with a smile and often with a tear is he summoned to his official duty a busy man is jesse holmes i remember the clear picture of him that hung on the walls of my fancy during my barefoot days when i was dodging his oft threatened devoirs to me be was a terrible old man in gray clothes with a long ragged gray beard and reddish fierce eyes i looked to see him come stumping up the road in a cloud of dust with a white oak staff in his hand and his shoes tied with leather thongs i may yet but this is a story not a sequel i have taken notice with regret that few stories worth reading have been written that did not con tain drink of some sort down go the fluids from arizona dick s three fingers of red pizen to the in efficacious oolong that nerves lionel montressor to repartee in the dotty dialogues so in such good company i may introduce an absinthe drip one absinthe drip dripped through a silver dripper orderly opalescent cool green eyed deceptive kerner was a fool besides that he was an artist and my good friend now if there is one thing on earth utterly despicable to another it is an artist in the eyes of an author whose story he has illus trated just try it once write a story about a mining camp in idiho sell it spend the money and then six months later borrow a quarter or a dime and buy the magazine containing it you find a full page wash drawing of your hero black bill the cowboy somewhere in your story you em ployed the word horse aha the artist has grasped the idea black bill has on the regulation trousers of the m f h of the westchester county hunt he carries a parlor rifle and wears a mon ocle in the distance is a section of forty second street during a search for a lost gas pipe and the taj mahal the famous mausoleum in india enough i hated kerner and one day i met him and we became friends he was young and glori ously melancholy because his spirits were so high and life bad so much in store for him yes he was almost riotously sad that was his youth when a man begins to be hilarious in a sorrowful way you can bet a million that he is dyeing his hair ker ner s hair was plentiful and carefully matted as an artist s thatch should be he was a cigaretteur and be audited his dinners with red wine but most of all be was a fool and wisely i envied him and listened patiently while he knocked velasquez and tintoretto once he told me that he liked a story of mine that he bad come across in an anthology he described it to me and i was sorry that mr fitz james o brien was dead and could not learn of the eulogy of his work but mostly kerner made few breaks and was a consistent fool i d better explain what i mean by that there was a girl now a girl as far as i am concerned is a thing that belongs in a seminary or an album but i conceded the existence of the animal in order to retain kerner s friendship he showed me her picture in a locket she was a blonde or a brunette i have forgotten which she worked in a factory for eight dollars a week lest factories quote this wage by way of vindication i will add that the girl bad worked for five years to reach that supreme ele vation of remuneration beginning at per week kerner s father was worth a couple of millions he was willing to stand for art but he drew the line at the factory girl so kerner disinherited his father and walked out to a cheap studio and lived on sausages for breakfast and on farroni for dinner farroni had the artistic soul and a line of credit for painters and poets nicely adjusted sometimes ker rier sold a picture and bought some new tapestry a ring and a dozen silk cravats and paid farroni two dollars on account one evening kerner had me to dinner with himself and the factory girl they were to be married as soon as kerner could slosh paint profitably as for the ex father s two millions pouf she was a wonder small and half way pretty and as much at her ease in that cheap cafe as though she were only in the palmer house chicago with a souvenir spoon already safely hidden in her shirt waist she was natural two things i noticed about her especially her belt buckle was exactly in the middle of her back and she didn t tell us that a large man with a ruby stick pin had followed her up all the way from fourteenth street was kerner such a fool i wondered and then i thought of the quantity of striped cuffs and blue glass beads that can buy for the heathen and i said to myself that he was and then elise certainly that

be fixed a gulf christmas would come on thursday on tuesday morning trinidad instead of going to work sought the judge at the lucky strike hotel it ll be a disgrace to yellowhammer said trinidad if it throws cherokee down on his christmas tree blowout you might say that that man made this town for one i m goin to see what can be done to give santa claus a square deal my co operation said the judge would be gladly forthcoming i am indebted to cherokee for past favours but i do not see i have heretofore regarded the absence of children rather as a luxury but in this instance still i do not see look at me said trinidad and you ll see old ways and means with the fur on i m goin to hitch up a team and rustle a load of kids for cherokee s santa claus act if i have to rob an orphan asylum eureka cried the judge enthusiastically no you didn t said trinidad decidedly i found it myself i learned about that latin word at school i will accompany you declared the judge waving his cane perhaps such eloquence and gift of language as i possess will be of benefit in persuading our young friends to lend themselves to our project within an hour yellowhammer was acquainted with the scheme of trinidad and the judge and approved it citizens who knew of families with offspring within a forty mile radius of yellowhammer came forward and contributed their information trinidad made careful notes of all such and then hastened to secure a vehicle and team the first stop scheduled was at a double log house fifteen miles out from yellowhammer a man opened the door at trinidad s hail and then came down and leaned upon the rickety gate the doorway was filled with a close mass of youngsters some ragged all full of curiosity and health it s this way explained trinidad we re from yellowhammer and we come kidnappin in a gentle kind of a way one of our leading citizens is stung with the santa claus affliction and he s due in town to morrow with half the folderols that s painted red and made in germany the youngest kid we got in yellowhammer packs a forty five and a safety razor consequently we re mighty shy on anybody to say oh and ah when we light the candles on the christmas tree now partner if you ll loan us a few kids we guarantee to return em safe and sound on christmas day and they ll come back loaded down with a good time and swiss family robinsons and cornucopias and red drums and similar testimonials what do you say in other words said the judge we have discovered for the first time in our embryonic but progressive little city the inconveniences of the absence of adolescence the season of the year having approximately arrived during which it is a custom to bestow frivolous but often appreciated gifts upon the young and tender i understand said the parent packing his pipe with a forefinger i guess i needn t detain you gentlemen me and the old woman have got seven kids so to speak and runnin my mind over the bunch i don t appear to hit upon none that we could spare for you to take over to your doin s the old woman has got some popcorn candy and rag dolls hid in the clothes chest and we allow to give christmas a little whirl of our own in a insignificant sort of style no i couldn t with any degree of avidity seem to fall in with the idea of lettin none of em go thank you kindly gentlemen down the slope they drove and up another foothill to the ranch house of wiley wilson trinidad recited his appeal and the judge boomed out his ponderous antiphony mrs wiley gathered her two rosy cheeked youngsters close to her skirts and did not smile until she had seen wiley laugh and shake his head again a refusal trinidad and the judge vainly exhausted more than half their list before twilight set in among the hills they spent the night at a stage road hostelry and set out again early the next morning the wagon had not acquired a single passenger it s creepin upon my faculties remarked trinidad that borrowin kids at christmas is somethin like tryin to steal butter from a man that s got hot pancakes a comin it is undoubtedly an indisputable fact said the judge that the ah family ties seem to be more coherent and assertive at that period of the year on the day before christmas they drove thirty miles making four fruitless halts and appeals everywhere they found kids at a premium the sun was low when the wife of a section boss on a lonely railroad huddled her unavailable progeny behind her and said there s a woman that s just took charge of the railroad eatin house down at granite junction i hear she s got a little boy maybe she might let him go trinidad pulled up his mules at granite junction at five o clock in the afternoon the train had just departed with its load of fed and appeased passengers on the steps of the eating house they found a thin and glowering boy of ten smoking a cigarette the dining room had been left in chaos by the peripatetic appetites a youngish woman reclined exhausted in a chair her face wore sharp lines of worry she had once possessed a certain style of beauty that would never wholly leave her and would never wholly return trinidad set forth his mission i d count it a mercy if

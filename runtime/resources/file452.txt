way did he go out i then went wait a minute said the populist candidate rising i don t see why in the h once more i must beg that you will be silent said tictocq rather sharply you should not interrupt me in the midst of my report i made one false arrest continued tictocq i was passing two finely dressed gentlemen on the street when one of them remarked that he had stole his socks i handcuffed him and dragged him to a lighted store when his companion explained to me that he was somewhat intoxicated and his tongue was not entirely manageable he had been speaking of some business transaction and what he intended to say was that he had sold his stocks i then released him an hour afterward i passed a saloon and saw this professor von bum drinking beer at a table i knew him in paris i said here is my man he worshipped wagner lived on limburger cheese beer and credit and would have stolen anybody s socks i shadowed him to the reception at colonel st vitus s and in an opportune moment i seized him and tore the socks from his feet there they are with a dramatic gesture tictocq threw a pair of dingy socks upon the table folded his arms and threw back his head with a loud cry of rage the populist candidate sprang once more to his feet gol darn it i will say what i want to i the two other populists in the room gazed at him coldly and sternly is this tale true they demanded of the candidate no by gosh it ain t he replied pointing a trembling finger at the democratic chairman there stands the man who has concocted the whole scheme it is an infernal unfair political trick to lose votes for our party how far has thing gone he added turning savagely to the detective all the newspapers have my written report on the matter and the statesman will have it in plate matter next week said tictocq complacently all is lost said the populists turning toward the door for god s sake my friends pleaded the candidate following them listen to me i swear before high heaven that i never wore a pair of socks in my life it is all a devilish campaign lie the populists turn their backs the damage is already done they said the people have heard the story you have yet time to withdraw decently before the race all left the room except tictocq and the democrats let s all go down and open a bottle of fizz on the finance committee said the chairman of the executive committee platform no tracked to doom or the mystery of the rue de peychaud tis midnight in paris a myriad of lamps that line the champs elysees and the rouge et noir cast their reflection in the dark waters of the seine as it flows gloomily past the place vendome and the black walls of the convent notadam the great french capital is astir it is the hour when crime and vice and wickedness reign hundreds of fiacres drive madly through the streets conveying women flashing with jewels and as beautiful as dreams from opera and concert and the little bijou supper rooms of the cafe tout le temps are filled with laughing groups while bon mots persiflage and repartee fly upon the air the jewels of thought and conversation luxury and poverty brush each other in the streets the homeless gamin begging a sou with which to purchase a bed and the spendthrift roue scattering golden louis d or tread the same pavement when other cities sleep paris has just begun her wild revelry the first scene of our story is a cellar beneath the rue de peychaud the room is filled with smoke of pipes and is stifling with the reeking breath of its inmates a single flaring gas jet dimly lights the scene which

leaning against the bar is carnaignole cusheau generally known as the gray wolf he is the worst man in paris he is more than four feet ten in height and his sharp ferocious looking face and the mass of long tangled gray hair that covers his face and head have earned for him the name he bears his striped blouse is wide open at the neck and falls outside of his dingy leather trousers the handle of a deadly looking knife protrudes from his belt one stroke of its blade would open a box of the finest french sardines voila gray wolf cries couteau the bartender how many victims to day there is no

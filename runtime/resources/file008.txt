without further notice i had a friend once of the entitlement of paisley fish that i imagined was sealed to me for an endless space of time side by side for seven years we had mined ranched sold patent churns herded sheep took photographs and other things built wire fences and picked prunes thinks i neither homocide nor flattery nor riches nor sophistry nor drink can make trouble between me and paisley fish we was friends an amount you could hardly guess at we was friends in business and we let our amicable qualities lap over and season our hours of recreation and folly we certainly had days of damon and nights of pythias one summer me and paisley gallops down into these san andres mountains for the purpose of a month s surcease and levity dressed in the natural store habiliments of man we hit this town of los pinos which certainly was a roof garden spot of the world and flowing with condensed milk and honey it had a street or two and air and hens and a eating house and that was enough for us we strikes the town after supper time and we concludes to sample whatever efficacy there is in this eating house down by the railroad tracks by the time we had set down and pried up our plates with a knife from the red oil cloth along intrudes widow jessup with the hot biscuit and the fried liver now there was a woman that would have tempted an anchovy to forget his vows she was not so small as she was large and a kind of welcome air seemed to mitigate her vicinity the pink of her face was the in hoc signo of a culinary temper and a warm disposition and her smile would have brought out the dogwood blossoms in december widow jessup talks to us a lot of garrulousness about the climate and history and tennyson and prunes and the scarcity of mutton and finally wants to know where we came from spring valley says i big spring valley chips in paisley out of a lot of potatoes and knuckle bone of ham in his mouth that was the first sign i noticed that the old fidus diogenes business between me and paisley fish was ended forever he knew how i hated a talkative person and yet he stampedes into the conversation with his amendments and addendums of syntax on the map it was big spring valley but i had heard paisley himself call it spring valley a thousand times without saying any more we went out after supper and set on the railroad track we had been pardners too long not to know what was going on in each other s mind i reckon you understand says paisley that i ve made up my mind to accrue that widow woman as part and parcel in and to my hereditaments forever both domestic sociable legal and otherwise until death us do part why yes says i i read it between the lines though you only spoke one and i suppose you are aware says i that i have a movement on foot that leads up to the widow s changing her name to hicks and leaves you writing to the society column to inquire whether the best man wears a japonica or seamless socks at the wedding there ll be some hiatuses in your program says paisley chewing up a piece of a railroad tie i d give in to you says he in most any respect if it was secular affairs but this is not so the smiles of woman goes on paisley is the whirlpool of squills and chalybeates into which vortex the good ship friendship is often drawn and dismembered i d assault a bear that was annoying you says paisley or i d endorse your note or rub the place between your shoulder blades with opodeldoc the same as ever but there my sense of etiquette ceases in this fracas with mrs jessup we play it alone i ve notified you fair and then i collaborates with myself and offers the following resolutions and by laws friendship between man and man says i is an ancient historical virtue enacted in the days when men had to protect each other against lizards with eighty foot tails and flying turtles and they ve kept up the habit to this day and stand by each other till the bellboy comes up and tells them the animals are not really there i ve often heard i says about ladies stepping in and breaking up a friendship between men why should that be i ll tell you paisley the first sight and hot biscuit of mrs jessup appears to have inserted a oscillation into each of our bosoms let the best man of us have her i ll play you a square game and won t do any underhanded work i ll do all of my courting of her in your presence so you will have an equal opportunity with that arrangement i don t see why our steamboat of friendship should fall overboard in the medicinal whirlpools you speak of whichever of us wins out good old hoss says paisley shaking my hand and i ll do the same says he we ll court the lady synonymously and without any of the prudery and bloodshed usual to such occasions and we ll be friends still win or lose at one side of mrs jessup s eating house was a bench under some trees where she used to sit in the breeze after the south bound had been fed and gone and there me and paisley used to congregate after supper and make partial payments on our respects to the lady of our choice and we was so honorable and circuitous in our calls that if one of us got there first we waited for the other before beginning any gallivantery

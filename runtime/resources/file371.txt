figure and trumpet his pristine eminence to his fellow citizens general deffenbaugh was the voice of elmville some said he was elmville at any rate he had no competitor as the mouthpiece he owned enough stock in the daily banner to dictate its utterance enough shares in the first national bank to be the referee of its loans and a war record that left him without a rival for first place at barbecues school commencements and decoration days besides these acquirements he was possessed with endowments his personality was inspiring and triumphant undisputed sway had moulded him to the likeness of a fatted roman emperor the tones of his voice were not otherwise than clarion to say that the general was public spirited would fall short of doing him justice he had spirit enough for a dozen publics and as a sure foundation for it all he had a heart that was big and stanch yes general deffenbaugh was elmville one little incident that usually occurred during the governor s morning walk has had its chronicling delayed by more important matters the procession was accustomed to halt before a small brick office on the avenue fronted by a short flight of steep wooden steps a modest tin sign over the door bore the words wm b pemberton attorney at law looking inside the general would roar hello billy my boy the less distinguished members of the escort would call morning billy the governor would pipe good morning william then a patient looking little man with hair turning gray along the temples would come down the steps and shake hands with each one of the party all elmville shook hands when it met the formalities concluded the little man would go back to his table heaped with law books and papers while the procession would proceed billy pemberton was as his sign declared a lawyer by profession by occupation and common consent he was the son of his father this was the shadow in which billy lived the pit out of which he had unsuccessfully striven for years to climb and he had come to believe the grave in which his ambitions were destined to be buried filial respect and duty he paid beyond the habit of most sons but he aspired to be known and appraised by his own deeds and worth after many years of tireless labour he had become known in certain quarters far from elmville as a master of the principles of the law twice he had gone to washington and argued cases before the highest tribunal with such acute logic and learning that the silken gowns on the bench had rustled from the force of it his income from his practice had grown until he was able to support his father in the old family mansion which neither of them would have thought of abandoning rickety as it was in the comfort and almost the luxury of the old extravagant days yet he remained to elmville as only billy pemberton the son of our distinguished and honoured fellow townsman ex governor pemberton thus was he introduced at public gatherings where he sometimes spoke haltingly and prosily for his talents were too serious and deep for extempore brilliancy thus was he presented to strangers and to the lawyers who made the circuit of the courts and so the daily banner referred to him in print to be the son of was his doom what ever he should accomplish would have to be sacrificed upon the altar of this magnificent but fatal parental precedence the peculiarity and the saddest thing about billy s ambition was that the only world he thirsted to conquer was elmville his nature was diffident and unassuming national or state honours might have oppressed him but above all things he hungered for the appreciation of the friends among whom he had been born and raised he would not have plucked one leaf from the garlands that were so lavishly bestowed upon his father he merely rebelled against having his own wreathes woven from those dried and self same branches but elmville billied and sonned him to his concealed but lasting chagrin until at length he grew more reserved and formal and studious than ever there came a morning when billy found among his mail a letter from a very high source tendering him the appointment to an important judicial position in the new island possessions of our country the honour was a distinguished one for the entire nation had discussed the probable recipients of these positions and had agreed that the situation demanded only men of the highest character ripe learning and evenly balanced mind billy could not subdue a certain exultation at this token of the success of his long and arduous labours but at the same time a whimsical smile lingered around his mouth for he foresaw in which column elmville would place the credit we congratulate governor pemberton upon the mark of appreciation conferred upon his son elmville rejoices with our honoured citizen governor pemberton at his son s success put her there billy judge billy pemberton sir son of our state s war hero and the people s pride these were the phrases printed and oral conjured up by billy s prophetic fancy grandson of his state and stepchild to elmville thus had fate fixed his kinship to the body politic billy lived with his father in the old mansion the two and an elderly lady a distant relative comprised the family perhaps though old jeff the governor s ancient coloured body servant should be included without doubt he could have claimed the honour there were other servants but thomas jefferson pemberton sah was a member of de fambly jeff was the one elmvillian who gave to billy the gold of approval unmixed with the alloy of paternalism to him mars william was the greatest man in talbot county beaten upon though he was by the shining light that emanates

the night before but that was a chronic trouble five times she had laughed at his offer to make her mrs vuyning he intended to ask her again the next wednesday evening vuyning walked along forty fourth street to broadway and then drifted down the great sluice that washes out the dust of the gold mines of gotham he wore a morning suit of light gray low dull kid shoes a plain finely woven straw hat and his visible linen was the most delicate possible shade of heliotrope his necktie was the blue gray of a november sky and its knot was plainly the outcome of a lordly carelessness combined with an accurate conception of the most recent dictum of fashion now to write of a man s haberdashery is a worse thing than to write a historical novel around paul jones or to pen a testimonial to a hay fever cure therefore let it be known that the description of vuyning s apparel is germane to the movements of the story and not to make room for the new fall stock of goods even broadway that morning was a discord in vuyning s ears and in his eyes it paralleled for a few dreamy dreary minutes a certain howling scorching seething malodorous slice of street that he remembered in morocco he saw the struggling mass of dogs beggars fakirs slave drivers and veiled women in carts without horses the sun blazing brightly among the bazaars the piles of rubbish from ruined temples in the street and then a lady passing jabbed the ferrule of a parasol in his side and brought him back to broadway five minutes of his stroll brought him to a certain corner where a number of silent pale faced men are accustomed to stand immovably for hours busy with the file blades of their penknives with their hat brims on a level with their eyelids wall street speculators driving home in their carriages love to point out these men to their visiting friends and tell them of this rather famous lounging place of the crooks on wall street the speculators never use the file blades of their knives vuyning was delighted when one of this company stepped forth and addressed him as he was passing he was hungry for something out of the ordinary and to be accosted by this smooth faced keen eyed low voiced athletic member of the under world with his grim yet pleasant smile had all the taste of an adventure to the convention weary vuyning excuse me friend said be could i have a few minutes talk with you on the level certainly said vuyning with a smile but suppose we step aside to a quieter place there is a divan a cafe over here that will do schrumm will give us a private corner schrumm established them under a growing palm with two seidls between them vuyning made a pleasant reference to meteorological conditions thus forming a binge upon which might be swung the door leading from the thought repository of the other in the first place said his companion with the air of one who presents his credentials i want you to understand that i am a crook out west i am known as rowdy the dude

square with you my name s emerson confound old kirk with his fish stories said vuyning to himself with silent glee as he went through his pockets for a card it s pronounced vining he said as he tossed it over to the other and i ll be as frank with you i m just a kind of a loafer i guess living on my daddy s money at the club they call me left at the post i never did a day s work in my life and i

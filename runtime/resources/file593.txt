folding beds in it and a relay of bellboys to work it up and down while i rest the clerk rubbed a speck off one of his finger nails and glanced sidewise at a tall man in a white hat sitting in the lobby that man came over and asked me politely if i had seen the shrubbery at the west entrance i had not so he showed it to me and then looked me over i thought you had em he said not unkindly but i guess you re all right you d better go see a doctor old man a week afterward my doctor tested my blood pressure again without the preliminary stimulant he looked to me a little less like napoleon and his socks were of a shade of tan that did not appeal to me what you need he decided is sea air and companionship would a mermaid i began but he slipped on his professional manner i myself he said will take you to the hotel bonair off the coast of long island and see that you get in good shape it is a quiet comfortable resort where you will soon recuperate the hotel bonair proved to be a nine hundred room fashionable hostelry on an island off the main shore everybody who did not dress for dinner was shoved into a side dining room and given only a terrapin and champagne table d hote the bay was a great stamping ground for wealthy yachtsmen the corsair anchored there the day we arrived i saw mr morgan standing on deck eating a cheese sandwich and gazing longingly at the hotel still it was a very inexpensive place nobody could afford to pay their p rices when you went away you simply left your baggage stole a skiff and beat it for the mainland in the night when i had been there one day i got a pad of monogrammed telegraph blanks at the clerk s desk and began to wire to all my friends for get away money my doctor and i played one game of croquet on the golf links and went to sleep on the lawn when we got back to town a thought seemed to occur to him suddenly by the way he asked how do you feel relieved of very much i replied now a consulting physician is different he isn t exactly sure whether he is to be paid or not and this uncertainty insures you either the most careful or the most careless attention my doctor took me to see a consulting physician he made a poor guess and gave me careful attention i liked him immensely he put me through some coordination exercises have you a pain in the back of your head he asked i told him i had not shut your eyes he ordered put your feet close together and jump backward as far as you can i always was a good backward jumper with my eyes shut so i obeyed my head struck the edge of the bathroom door which had been left open and was only three feet away the doctor was very sorry he had overlooked the fact that the door was open he closed it now touch your nose with your right forefinger he said where is it i asked on your face said he i mean my right forefinger i explained oh excuse me said he he reopened the bathroom door and i took my finger out of the crack of it after i had performed the marvellous digito nasal feat i said i do not wish to deceive you as to symptoms doctor i really have something like a pain in the back of my head he ignored the symptom and examined my heart carefully with a latest popular air penny in the slot ear trumpet i felt like a ballad now he said gallop like a horse for about five minutes around the room i gave the best imitation i could of a disqualified percheron being led out of madison square garden then without dropping in a penny he listened to my chest again no glanders in our family doc i said the consulting physician held up his forefinger within three inches of my nose look at my finger he commanded did you ever try pears i began but he went on with his test rapidly now look across the bay at my finger across the bay at my finger at my finger across the bay across the bay at my finger across the bay this for about three minutes he explained that this was a test of the action of the brain it seemed easy to me i never once mistook his finger for the bay i ll bet that if he had used the phrases gaze as it were unpreoccupied outward or rather laterally in the direction of the horizon underlaid so to speak with the adjacent fluid inlet and now returning or rather in a manner withdrawing your attention bestow it upon my upraised digit i ll bet i say that henry james himself could have passed the exami nation after asking me if i had ever had a grand uncle with curvature of the spine or a cousin with swelled ankles the two doctors retired to the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bath tub for their consultation i ate an apple and gazed first at my finger and then across the bay the doctors came out looking grave more they looked tombstones and tennessee papers please copy they wrote out a diet list to which i was to be restricted it had everything that i had ever heard of to eat on it except snails and i never eat a snail unless it overtakes me and bites me first you must follow this diet strictly said the doctors i d follow it a

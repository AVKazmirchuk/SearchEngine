off his nose and glared at me i ve often told you you were a fool he said you have let yourself be imposed upon by a clodhopper and you have imposed upon me how i asked have i imposed upon you by your ignorance said he twice i have discovered serious flaws in your plans that a common school education should have enabled you to avoid and he continued i have been put to expense that i could ill afford in pursuing this swindling quest i am done with it i rose and pointed a large pewter spoon at him fresh from the dish water goodloe banks i said i care not one parboiled navy bean for your education i always barely tolerated it in any one and i despised it in you what has your learning done for you it is a curse to yourself and a bore to your friends away i said away with your water marks and variations they are nothing to me they shall not deflect me from the quest i pointed with my spoon across the river to a small mountain shaped like a pack saddle i am going to search that mountain i went on for the treasure decide now whether you are in it or not if you wish to let a water mark or a variation shake your soul you are no true adventurer decide a white cloud of dust began to rise far down the river road it was the mail wagon from hesperus to chico goodloe flagged it i am done with the swindle said he sourly no one but a fool would pay any attention to that paper now well you always were a fool jim i leave you to your fate he gathered his personal traps climbed into the mail wagon adjusted his glasses nervously and flew away in a cloud of dust after i had washed the dishes and staked the horses on new grass i crossed the shallow river and made my way slowly through the cedar brakes up to the top of the hill shaped like a pack saddle it was a wonderful june day never in my life had i seen so many birds so many butter flies dragon flies grasshoppers and such winged and stinged beasts of the air and fields i investigated the hill shaped like a pack saddle from base to summit i found an absolute absence of signs relating to buried treasure there was no pile of stones no ancient blazes on the trees none of the evidences of the three hundred thousand dollars as set forth in the document of old man rundle i came down the hill in the cool of the afternoon suddenly out of the cedar brake i stepped into a beautiful green valley where a tributary small stream ran into the alamito river and there i was started to see what i took to be a wild man with unkempt beard and ragged hair pursuing a giant butterfly with brilliant wings perhaps he is an escaped madman i thought and wondered how he had strayed so far from seats of education and learning and then i took a few more steps and saw a vine covered cottage near the small stream and in a little grassy glade i saw may martha mangum plucking wild flowers she straightened up and looked at me for the first time since i knew her i saw her face which was the color of the white keys of a new piano turn pink i walked toward her without a word she let the gathered flowers trickle slowly from her hand to the grass i knew you would come jim she said clearly father wouldn t let me write but i knew you would come what followed you may guess there was my wagon and team just across the river i ve often wondered what good too much education is to a man if he can t use it for himself if all the benefits of it are to go to others where does it come in for may martha mangum abides with me there is an eight room house in a live oak grove and a piano with an automatic player and a good start toward the three thousand head of cattle is under fence and when i ride home at night my pipe and slippers are put away in places where they cannot be found but who cares for that who cares who cares to him who waits the hermit of the hudson was hustling about his cave with unusual animation the cave was on or in the top of a little spur of the catskills that had strayed down to the river s edge and not having a ferry ticket had to stop there the bijou mountains were densely wooded and were infested by ferocious squirrels and woodpeckers that forever menaced the summer transients like a badly sewn strip of white braid a macadamized road ran between the green skirt of the hills and the foamy lace of the river s edge a dim path wound from the comfortable road up a rocky height to the hermit s cave one mile upstream was the viewpoint inn to which summer folk from the city came leaving cool electric fanned apartments that they might be driven about in burning sunshine shrieking in gasoline launches by spindle legged modreds bearing the blankest of shields train your lorgnette upon the hermit and let your eye receive the personal touch that shall endear you to the hero a man of forty judging him fairly with long hair curling at the ends dramatic eyes and a forked brown beard like those that were imposed upon the west some years ago by self appointed divine healers who succeeded the grasshopper crop his outward vesture appeared to be kind of gunny sacking cut and made into a garment that would have made the fortune

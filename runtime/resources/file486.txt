private secretary and confidential prospective son in law of her father arapahoe grimes quarter million dollar cattle king owning a ranch that judging by the scenery is in either the bad lands or amagensett l i desmond in private life mr bob hart wears puttees and meadow brook hunt riding trousers and gives his address as new york leaving you to wonder why he comes to the bad lands or amagansett as the case may be and at the same time to conjecture mildly why a cattleman should want puttees about his ranch with a secretary in em well anyhow you know as well as i do that we all like that kind of play whether we admit it or not something along in between bluebeard jr and cymbeline played in the russian there were only two parts and a half in mice will play hart and cherry were the two of course and the half was a minor part always played by a stage hand who merely came in once in a tuxedo coat and a panic to announce that the house was surrounded by indians and to turn down the gas fire in the grate by the manager s orders there was another girl in the sketch a fifth avenue society swelless who was visiting the ranch and who had sirened jack valentine when he was a wealthy club man on lower third avenue before he lost his money this girl appeared on the stage only in the photographic state jack had her sarony stuck up on the mantel of the amagan of the bad lands droring room helen was jealous of course and now for the thriller old arapahoe grimes dies of angina pectoris one night so helen informs us in a stage ferryboat whisper over the footlights while only his secretary was present and that same day he was known to have had in cash in his ranch library just received for the sale of a drove of beeves in the east that accounts for the price we pay for steak the cash disappears at the same time jack valentine was the only person with the ranchman when he made his alleged croak gawd knows i love him but if he has done this deed you sabe don t you and then there are some mean things said about the fifth avenue girl who doesn t come on the stage and can we blame her with the vaudeville trust holding down prices until one actually must be buttoned in the back by a call boy maids cost so much but wait here s the climax helen grimes chaparralish as she can be is goaded beyond imprudence she convinces herself that jack valentine is not only a falsetto but a financier to lose at one fell swoop and a lover in riding trousers with angles in the sides like the variations on the chart of a typhoid fever patient is enough to make any perfect lady mad so then they stand in the ranch library which is furnished with mounted elk heads didn t the elks have a fish fry in amagensett once and the d enouement begins i know of no more interesting time in the run of a play unless it be when the prologue ends helen thinks jack has taken the money who else was there to take it the box office manager was at the front on his job the orchestra hadn t left their seats and no man could get past old jimmy the stage door man unless he could show a skye terrier or an automobile as a guarantee of eligibility goaded beyond imprudence as before said helen says to jack valentine robber and thief and worse yet stealer of trusting hearts this should be your fate with that out she whips of course the trusty caliber but i will be merciful goes on helen you shall live that will be your punishment i will show you how easily i could have sent you to the death that you deserve there is her picture on the mantel i will send through her more beautiful face the bullet that should have pierced your craven heart and she does it and there s no fake blank cartridges or assistants pulling strings helen fires the bullet the actual bullet goes through the face of the photograph and then strikes the hidden spring of the sliding panel in the wall and lo the panel slides and there is the missing in convincing stacks of currency and bags of gold it s great you know how it is cherry practised for two months at a target on the roof of her boarding house it took good shooting in the sketch she had to hit a brass disk only three inches in diameter covered by wall paper in the panel and she had to stand in exactly the same spot every night and the photo had to be in exactly the same spot and she had to shoot steady and true every time of course old arapahoe had tucked the funds away there in the secret place and of course jack hadn t taken anything except his salary which really might have come under the head of obtaining money under but that is neither here nor there and of course the new york girl was really engaged to a concrete house contractor in the bronx and necessarily jack and helen ended in a half nelson and there you are after hart and cherry had gotten mice will play flawless they had a try out at a vaudeville house that accommodates the sketch was a house wrecker it was one of those rare strokes of talent that inundates a theatre from the roof down the gallery wept and the orchestra seats being dressed for it swam in tears after the show the booking agents signed blank checks and pressed fountain pens upon hart and cherry five hundred dollars

turning business away lawyer gooch took client number one by the arm and led him suavely into one of the adjoining rooms favour me by remaining here a few minutes sir said he i will return and resume our consultation with the least possible delay i am rather expecting a visit from a very wealthy old lady in connection with a will i will not keep you waiting long the breezy gentleman seated himself with obliging acquiescence aud took up a magazine the lawyer returned to the middle office carefully closing behind him the connecting door show the lady in archibald he said to the office boy who was awaiting the order a tall lady of commanding presence and sternly hand some entered the room she wore robes robes not clothes ample and fluent in her eye could be per ceived the lambent flame of genius and soul in her hand was a green bag of the capacity of a bushel and an umbrella that also seemed to wear a robe ample and fluent she accepted a chair are you mr phineas c gooch the lawyer she asked in formal and unconciliatory tones i am answered lawyer gooch without circum locution he never circumlocuted when dealing with a woman women circumlocute time is wasted when both sides in debate employ the same tactics as a lawyer sir began the lady you may have acquired some knowledge of the human heart do you believe that the pusillanimous and petty conventions of our artificial social life should stand as an obstacle in the way of a noble and affectionate heart when it finds its true mate among the miserable and worthless wretches in the world that are called men madam said lawyer gooch in the tone that he used in curbing his female clients this is an office for conducting the practice of law i am a lawyer not a philosopher nor the editor of an answers to the lovelorn column of a newspaper i have other clients waiting i will ask you kindly to come to the point well you needn t get so stiff around the gills about it said the lady with a snap of her luminous eves and a startling gyration of her umbrella business is what i ve come for i want your opinion in the matter of a suit for divorce as the vulgar would call it but which is really only the readjustment of the false and ignoble con ditions that the short sihhted laws of man have interposed between a loving i beg your pardon madam interrupted lawyer gooch with some impatience for reminding you again that this is a law office perhaps mrs wilcox mrs wilcox is all right cut in the lady with a hint of asperity and so are tolstoi and mrs gertrude atherton and omar khayyam and mr edward bok i ve read em all i would like to discuss with you the divine right of the soul as opposed to the freedom destroy ing restrictions of a bigoted and narrow minded society but i will proceed to business i would prefer to lay the matter before you in an impersonal way until vou pass upon its merits that is to describe it as a sup posable instance without you wish to state a hypothetical case said lawyer gooch i was going to say that said the lady sharply now suppose there is a woman who is all soul and heart and aspirations for a complete existence this woman has a husband who is far below her in intellect in taste in everything bah he is a brute he despises literature he sneers at the lofty thoughts of the world s great thinkers he thinks only of real estate and such sordid things he is no mate for a woman with soul we will say that this unfortunate wife one day meets with her ideal a man with brain and heart and force she loves him although this man feels the thrill of a new found affinity he is too noble too honourable to declare himself he flies from the presence of his beloved she flies after him trampling with superb indifference upon the fetters with which an unenlightened social system would bind her now what will a divorce cost eliza ann timmins the poetess of sycamore gap got one for three hundred and forty dollars can i i mean can this lady i speak of get one that cheap madam said lawyer gooch your last two or three sentences delight me with their intelligence and clearness can we not now abandon the hypothetical and come down to names and business i should say so exclaimed the lady adopting the practical with admirable readiness thomas r bil lings is the name of the low brute who stands between the happiness of his legal his legal but not his spiri tual wife and henry k jessup the noble man whom nature intended for her mate i concluded the client with an air of dramatic revelation am mrs billings gentlemen to see you sir shouted archibald invad ing the room almost at a handspring lawyer gooch arose from his chair mrs billings he said courteously allow me to conduct you into the adjoining office apartment for a few minutes i am expecting a very wealthy old gentleman on busines connected with a will in a very short while i will join you and continue our consultation with his accustomed chivalrous manner lawyer gooch ushered his soulful client into the remaining unoccupied room and came out closing the door with circumspection the next visitor introduced by archibald was a thin nervous irritable looking man of middle age with a worried and apprehensive expression of countenance he carried in one hand a small satchel which he set down upon the floor beside the chair which the lawyer placed for him his clothing was of good quality but it was worn without regard to neatness

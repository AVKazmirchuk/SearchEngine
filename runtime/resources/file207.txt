design of providence farmers was made for a purpose and that was to furnish a livelihood to men like me and you else why was we given brains it is my belief that the manna that the israelites lived on for forty years in the wilderness was only a figurative word for farmers and they kept up the practice to this day and now says andy i am going to test my theory once a farmer always a come on in spite of the veneering and the orifices that a spurious civilization has brought to him you ll fail same as i did says i this one s shook off the shackles of the sheep fold he s entrenched behind the advantages of electricity education literature and intelligence i ll try said andy there are certain laws of nature that free rural delivery can t overcome andy fumbles around awhile in the closet and comes out dressed in a suit with brown and yellow checks as big as your hand his vest is red with blue dots and he wears a high silk hat i noticed he d soaked his sandy mustache in a kind of blue ink great barnums says i you re a ringer for a circus thimblerig man right says andy is the buggy outside wait here till i come back i won t be long two hours afterwards andy steps into the room and lays a wad of money on the table eight hundred and sixty dollars said he let me tell you he was in he looked me over and began to guy me i didn t say a word but got out the walnut shells and began to roll the little ball on the table i whistled a tune or two and then i started up the old formula step up lively gentlemen says i and watch the little ball it costs you nothing to look there you see it and there you don t guess where the little joker is the quickness of the hand deceives the eye i steals a look at the farmer man i see the sweat coming out on his forehead he goes over and closes the front door and watches me some more directly he says i ll bet you twenty i can pick the shell the ball s under now after that goes on andy there is nothing new to relate he only had cash in the house when i left he followed me to the gate there was tears in his eyes when he shook hands bunk says he thank you for the only real pleasure i ve had in years it brings up happy old days when i was only a farmer and not an agriculturalist god bless you here jeff peters ceased and i inferred that his story was done then you think i began yes said jeff something like that you let the farmers go ahead and amuse themselves with politics farming s a lonesome life and they ve been against the shell game before the chair of philanthromathematics i see that the cause of education has received the princely gift of more than fifty millions of dollars said i i was gleaning the stray items from the evening papers while jeff peters packed his briar pipe with plug cut which same said jeff calls for a new deck and a recitation by the entire class in philanthromathematics is that an allusion i asked it is said jeff i never told you about the time when me and andy tucker was philanthropists did i it was eight years ago in arizona andy and me was out in the gila mountains with a two horse wagon prospecting for silver we struck it and sold out to parties in tucson for they paid our check at the bank in silver a thousand dollars in a sack we loaded it in our wagon and drove east a hundred miles before we recovered our presence of intellect twenty five thousand dollars doesn t sound like so much when you re reading the annual report of the pennsylvania railroad or listening to an actor talking about his salary but when you can raise up a wagon sheet and kick around your bootheel and hear every one of em ring against another it makes you feel like you was a night and day bank with the clock striking twelve the third day out we drove into one of the most specious and tidy little towns that nature or rand and mcnally ever turned out it was in the foothills and mitigated with trees and flowers and about head of cordial and dilatory inhabitants the town seemed to be called floresville and nature had not contaminated it with many railroads fleas or eastern tourists me and andy deposited our money to the credit of peters and tucker in the esperanza savings bank and got rooms at the skyview hotel after supper we lit up and sat out on the gallery and smoked then was when the philanthropy idea struck me i suppose every grafter gets it sometime when a man swindles the public out of a certain amount he begins to get scared and wants to return part of it and if you ll watch close and notice the way his charity runs you ll see that he tries to restore it to the same people he got it from as a hydrostatical case take let s say a a made his millions selling oil to poor students who sit up nights studying political economy and methods for regulating the trusts so back to the universities and colleges goes his conscience dollars there s b got his from the common laboring man that works with his hands and tools how s he to get some of the remorse fund back into their overalls aha says b i ll do it in the name of education i ve skinned the laboring

gave way to the habit that had won for him his title subdued yet clear with each note as true and liquid as a bobolink s his whistle tinkled about the dim cold mountains of brick like drops of rain falling into a hidden pool he followed an air but it swam mistily into a swirling current of improvisation you could cull out the trill of mountain brooks the staccato of green rushes shivering above chilly lagoons the pipe of sleepy birds rounding a corner the whistler collided with a mountain of blue and brass so observed the mountain calmly you are already pack und dere vill not pe frost before two veeks yet und you haf forgotten how to vistle dere was a valse note in dot last bar watcher know about it said whistling dick with tentative familiarity you wit yer little gherman band nixcumrous

learn also dot a rolling shtone can t vistle for a cent big fritz s heavy moustache rounded into a circle and from its depths came a sound deep and mellow as that from a flute he repeated a few bars of the air the tramp had been whistling the rendition was cold but correct and he emphasized the note he had taken exception to dot p is p natural und not p vlat py der vay you petter pe glad i meet

ruffled brood that came yearly to nestle beneath her charitable pinions after the big policeman had departed whistling dick stood for an irresolute minute feeling all the outraged indignation of a delinquent tenant who is ordered to vacate his premises he had pictured to himself a day of dreamful ease when he should have joined his pal a day of lounging on the wharf munching the bananas and cocoanuts scattered in unloading the fruit steamers and then a feast along the free lunch counters from which the easy going owners were too good natured or too generous to drive him away and afterward a pipe in one of the little flowery parks and a snooze in some shady corner of the wharf but here was a stern order to exile and one that he knew must be obeyed so with a wary eye open from the gleam of brass buttons he began his retreat toward a rural refuge a few days in the country need not necessarily prove disastrous beyond the possibility of a slight nip of frost there was no formidable evil to be looked for however it was with a depressed spirit that whistling dick passed the old french market on his chosen route down the river for safety s sake he still presented to the world his portrayal of the part of the worthy artisan on his way to labour a stall keeper in the market undeceived hailed him by the generic name of his ilk and jack halted taken by surprise the vender melted by this proof of his own acuteness bestowed a foot of frankfurter and half a loaf and thus the problem of breakfast was solved when the streets from topographical reasons began to shun the river bank the exile mounted to the top of the levee and on its well trodden path pursued his way the suburban eye regarded him with cold suspicion individuals reflected the stern spirit of the city s heartless edict he missed the seclusion of the crowded town and the safety he could always find in the multitude at chalmette six miles upon his desultory way there suddenly menaced him a vast and bewildering industry a new port was being established the dock was being built compresses were going up picks and shovels and barrows struck at him like serpents from every side an arrogant foreman bore down upon him estimating his muscles with the eye of a recruiting sergeant brown men and black men all about him were toiling away he fled in terror by noon he had reached the country of the plantations the great sad silent levels bordering the mighty river he overlooked fields of sugar cane so vast that their farthest limits melted into the sky the sugar making season was well advanced and the cutters were at work the waggons creaked drearily after them the negro teamsters inspired the mules to greater speed with mellow and sonorous imprecations dark green groves blurred by the blue of distance showed where the plantation houses stood the tall chimneys of the sugar mills caught the eye miles distant like lighthouses at sea at a certain point whistling dick s unerring nose caught the scent of frying fish like a pointer to a quail he made his way down the levee side straight to the camp of a credulous and ancient fisherman whom he charmed with song and story so that he dined like an admiral and then like a philosopher annihilated the worst three hours of the day by a nap under the trees when he awoke and again continued his hegira

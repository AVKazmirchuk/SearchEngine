buckley s conscience was of the new england order with western adjustments and he continued to get his rebellious body into as many difficulties as possible wherefore on that sultry afternoon he chose to drive his own protesting limbs to investigation of that sudden alarm that had startled the peace and dignity of the state two squares down the street stood the top notch saloon here buckley came upon signs of recent upheaval a few curious spectators pressed about its front entrance grinding beneath their heels the fragments of a plate glass window inside buckley found bud dawson utterly ignoring a bullet wound in his shoulder while he feelingly wept at having to explain why he failed to drop the blamed masquerooter who shot him at the entrance of the ranger bud turned appealingly to him for confirmation of the devastation he might have dealt you know buck i d a plum got him first rattle if i d thought a minute come in a masque rootin playin female till he got the drop and turned loose i never reached for a gun thinkin it was sure chihuahua betty or mrs atwater or anyhow one of the mayfield girls comin a gunnin which they might liable as not i never thought of that blamed garcia until garcia snapped buckley how did he get over here bud s bartender took the ranger by the arm and led him to the side door there stood a patient grey burro cropping the grass along the gutter with a load of kindling wood tied across its back on the ground lay a black shawl and a voluminous brown dress masquerootin in them things called bud still resisting attempted ministrations to his wounds thought he was a lady till he gave a yell and winged me he went down this side street said the bartender he was alone and he ll hide out till night when his gang comes over you ought to find him in that mexican lay out below the depot he s got a girl down there pancha sales how was he armed asked buckley two pearl handled sixes and a knife keep this for me billy said the ranger handing over his winchester quixotic perhaps but it was bob buckley s way another man and a braver one might have raised a posse to accompany him it was buckley s rule to discard all preliminary

happened many citizens who knew the ranger pointed out to him with alacrity the course of garcia s retreat as buckley swung along upon the trail he felt the beginning of the suffocating constriction about his throat the cold sweat under the brim of his hat the old shameful dreaded sinking of his heart as it went down down down in his bosom the morning train of the mexican central had that day

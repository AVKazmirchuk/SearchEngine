it was so awkward of me and my shoe heels are horridly common sense i can t blame them at all chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest she was pretty in a refined way and her eye was both merry and kind she was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a sort of uniform such as shop girls wear her glossy dark brown hair showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament was a velvet ribbon and bow she could have posed as a model for the self respecting working girl of the best type a sudden idea came into the head of the young architect he would ask this girl to dine with him here was the element that his splendid but solitary periodic feasts had lacked his brief season of elegant luxury would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady s society this girl was a lady he was sure her manner and speech settled that and in spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to sit at table with her these thoughts passed swiftly through his mind and he decided to ask her it was a breach of etiquette of course but oftentimes wage earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind they were generally shrewd judges of men and thought better of their own judgment than they did of useless conventions his ten dollars discreetly expended would enable the two to dine very well indeed the dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull routine of the girl s life and her lively appreciation of it would add to his own triumph and pleasure i think he said to her with frank gravity that your foot needs a longer rest than you suppose now i am going to suggest a way in which you can give it that and at the same time do me a favour i was on my way to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the corner you come with me and we ll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant talk together and by that time your game ankle will carry you home very nicely i am sure the girl looked quickly up into chandler s clear pleasant countenance her eyes twinkled once very brightly and then she smiled ingenuously but we don t know each other it wouldn t be right would it she said doubtfully there is nothing wrong about it said the young man candidly i ll introduce myself permit me mr towers chandler after our dinner which i will try to make as pleasant as possible i will bid you good evening or attend you safely to your door whichever you prefer but dear me said the girl with a glance at chandler s faultless attire in this old dress and hat never mind that said chandler cheerfully i m sure you look more charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner toilette my ankle does hurt yet admitted the girl attempting a limping step i think i will accept your invitation mr chandler you may call me miss marian come then miss marian said the young architect gaily but with perfect courtesy you will not have far to walk there is a very respectable and good restaurant in the next block you will have to lean on my arm so and walk slowly it is lonely dining all by one s self i m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice when the two were established at a well appointed table with a promising waiter hovering in attendance chandler began to experience the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him the restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down broadway which he always preferred but it was nearly so the tables were well filled with prosperous looking diners there was a good orchestra playing softly enough to make conversation a possible pleasure and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism his companion even in her cheap hat and dress held herself with an air that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure and it is certain that she looked at chandler with his animated but self possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes with something not far from admiration in her own charming face then it was that the madness of manhattan the frenzy of fuss and feathers the bacillus of brag the provincial plague of pose seized upon towers chandler he was on broadway surrounded by pomp and style and there were eyes to look at him on the stage of that comedy he had assumed to play the one night part of a butterfly of fashion and an idler of means and taste he was dressed for the part and all his good angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it so he began to prate to miss marian of clubs of teas of golf and riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints of a yacht lying at larchmont he could see that she was vastly impressed by this vague talk so he endorsed his pose by random insinuations concerning great wealth and mentioned familiarly a few names that are handled reverently by the proletariat it was chandler s short little day and he was wringing from it the best that could be had as he saw it and yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and all objects this way of living that you speak of she said sounds so futile and purposeless haven t you any work to do in the

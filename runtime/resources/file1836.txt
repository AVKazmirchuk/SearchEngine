speck out of the noise only fifteen minutes after svangvsk s last kicking at the hands or rather the feet of engine company no he rode joe back through the door with the boy safe but acutely conscious of the licking he was going to receive svangvsk slipped to the floor leaned his head against joe s and made a noise like a clucking hen joe nodded and whistled loudly through his nostrils putting to shame the knowledge of sloviski of the delicatessen john byrnes walked up to svangvsk who grinned expecting to be kicked byrnes gripped the outlander so strongly by the hand that demetre grinned anyhow conceiving it to be a new form of punishment the heathen rides like a cossack remarked a fireman who had seen a wild west show they re the greatest riders in the world the word seemed to electrify svangvsk he grinned wider than ever yas yas me cossack he spluttered striking his chest cossack repeated john byrnes thoughtfully ain t that a kind of a russian they re one of the russian tribes sure said the desk man who read books between fire alarms just then alderman foley who was on his way home and did not know of the runaway stopped at the door of the engine house and called to byrnes hello there jimmy me boy how s the war coming along japs still got the bear on the trot have they oh i don t know said john byrnes argumentatively them japs haven t got any walkover you wait till kuropatkin gets a good whack at em and they won t be knee high to a puddle ducksky the lost blend since the bar has been blessed by the clergy and cocktails open the dinners of the elect one may speak of the saloon teetotalers need not listen if they choose there is always the slot restaurant where a dime dropped into the cold bouillon aperture will bring forth a dry martini con lantry worked on the sober side of the bar in kenealy s cafe you and i stood one legged like geese on the other side and went into voluntary liquidation with our week s wages opposite danced con clean temperate clear headed polite white jacketed punctual trustworthy young responsible and took our money the saloon whether blessed or cursed stood in one of those little places which are parallelograms instead of streets and inhabited by laundries decayed knickerbocker families and bohemians who have nothing to do with either over the cafe lived kenealy and his family his daughter katherine had eyes of dark irish but why should you be told be content with your geraldine or your eliza ann for con dreamed of her and when she called softly at the foot of the back stairs for the pitcher of beer for dinner his heart went up and down like a milk punch in the shaker orderly and fit are the rules of romance and if you hurl the last shilling of your fortune upon the bar for whiskey the bartender shall take it and marry his boss s daughter and good will grow out of it but not so con for in the presence of woman he was tongue tied and scarlet he who would quell with his eye the sonorous youth whom the claret punch made loquacious or smash with lemon squeezer the obstreperous or hurl gutterward the cantankerous without a wrinkle coming to his white lawn tie when he stood before woman he was voiceless incoherent stuttering buried beneath a hot avalanche of bashfulness and misery what then was he before katherine a trembler with no word to say for himself a stone without blarney the dumbest lover that ever babbled of the weather in the presence of his divinity there came to kenealy s two sunburned men riley and mcquirk they had conference with kenealy and then they took possession of a back room which they filled with bottles and siphons and jugs and druggist s measuring glasses all the appurtenances and liquids of a saloon were there but they dispensed no drinks all day long the two sweltered in there pouring and mixing unknown brews and decoctions from the liquors in their store riley had the education and he figured on reams of paper reducing gallons to ounces and quarts to fluid drams mcquirk a morose man with a red eye dashed each unsuccessful completed mixture into the waste pipes with curses gentle husky and deep they labored heavily and untiringly to achieve some mysterious solution like two alchemists striving to resolve gold from the elements into this back room one evening when his watch was done sauntered con his professional curiosity had been stirred by these occult bartenders at whose bar none drank and who daily drew upon kenealy s store of liquors to follow their consuming and fruitless experiments down the back stairs came katherine with her smile like sunrise on gweebarra bay good evening mr lantry says she and what is the news to day if you please it looks like r rain stammered the shy one backing to the wall it couldn t do better said katherine i m thinking there s nothing the worse off for a little water in the back room riley and mcquirk toiled like bearded witches over their strange compounds from fifty bottles they drew liquids carefully measured after riley s figures and shook the whole together in a great glass vessel then mcquirk would dash it out with gloomy profanity and they would begin again sit down said riley to con and i ll tell you last summer me and tim concludes that an american bar in this nation of nicaragua would pay there was a town on the coast where there s nothing to eat but quinine and nothing to drink but rum the natives and foreigners lay down with chills and get up with fevers and a good mixed drink is nature s remedy for all such tropical inconveniences so we lays in a fine stock of wet goods in new york and bar fixtures and glassware and we sails for that santa palma town on a lime steamer on the way me and tim sees flying fish and plays seven up with the captain and steward and already begins to feel like the high ball kings of the tropics of capricorn when we gets in five hours of the country that we was going to introduce to long drinks and short change the captain calls us over to the starboard binnacle and recollects a few things i forgot to tell you boys says he that nicaragua slapped an import duty of per cent ad valorem on all bottled goods last month the president took a bottle of cincinnati hair tonic by mistake for tobasco sauce and he s getting even barrelled goods is free sorry you didn t mention it sooner says we and we bought two forty two gallon casks from the captain and opened every bottle we had and dumped the stuff all together in the casks that per cent would have ruined us so we took the chances on making that cocktail rather than throw the stud away well when we landed we tapped one of the barrels the mixture was something heartrending it was the color of a plate of bowery pea soup and it tasted like one of those coffee substitutes your aunt makes you take for the heart trouble you get by picking losers we gave a nigger four fingers of it to try it and he lay under a cocoanut tree three days beating the sand with his heels and refused to sign a testimonial but the other barrel say bartender did you ever put on a straw hat with a yellow band around it and go up in a balloon with a pretty girl with in your pocket all at the same time that s what thirty drops of it would make you feel like with two fingers of it inside you you would bury your face in your hands and cry because there wasn t anything more worth while around for you to lick than little jim jeffries yes sir the stuff in that second barrel was distilled elixir of battle money and high life it was the color of gold and as clear as glass and it shone after dark like the sunshine was still in it a thousand years from now you ll get a drink like that across the bar well we started up business with that one line of drinks and it was enough the piebald gentry of that country stuck to it like a hive of bees if that barrel had lasted that country would have become the greatest on earth when we opened up of mornings we had a line of generals and colonels and ex presidents and revolutionists a block long waiting to be served we started in at cents silver a drink the last ten gallons went easy at a gulp it was wonderful stuff it gave a man courage and ambition and nerve to do anything at the same time he didn t care whether his money was tainted or fresh from the ice trust when that barrel was half gone nicaragua had repudiated the national debt removed the duty on cigarettes and was about to declare war on the united states and england twas by accident we discovered this king of drinks and twill be by good luck if we strike it again for ten months we ve been trying small lots at a time we ve mixed barrels of all the harmful ingredients known to the profession of drinking ye could have stocked ten bars with the whiskies brandies cordials bitters gins and wines me and tim have wasted a glorious drink like that to be denied to the world tis a sorrow and a loss of money the united states as a nation would welcome a drink of that sort and pay for it all the while mcquirk lead been carefully measuring and pouring together small quantities of various spirits as riley called them from his latest pencilled prescription the completed mixture was of a vile mottled chocolate color mcquirk tasted it and hurled it with appropriate epithets into the waste sink tis a strange story even if true said con i ll be going now along to my supper take a drink said riley we ve all kinds except the lost blend i never drink said con anything stronger than water i am just after meeting miss katherine by the stairs she said a true word there s not anything says she but is better off for a little water when con had left them riley almost felled mcquirk by a blow on the back did ye hear that he shouted two fools are we the six dozen bottles of pollinaris we had on the slip ye opened them yourself which barrel did ye pour them in which barrel ye mudhead i mind said mcquirk slowly twas in the second barrel we opened i mind the blue piece of paper pasted on the side of it we ve got it now cried riley twas that we lacked tis the water that does the trick everything else we had right hurry man and get two bottles of pollinaris from the bar while i figure out the proportionments with me pencil an hour later con strolled down the sidewalk toward kenealy s cafe thus faithful employees haunt during their recreation hours the vicinity where they labor drawn by some mysterious attraction a police patrol wagon stood at the side door three able cops were half carrying half hustling riley and mcquirk up its rear steps the eyes and faces of each bore the bruises and cuts of sanguinary and assiduous conflict yet they whooped with strange joy and directed upon the police the feeble remnants of their pugnacious madness began fighting each other in the back room explained kenealy to con and singing that was worse smashed everything pretty much up but they re good men they ll pay for everything trying to invent some new kind of cocktail they was i ll see they come out all right in the morning con sauntered into the back room to view the battlefield as he went through the hall katherine was just coming down the stairs good evening again mr lantry said she and is there no news from the weather yet still threatens r rain said con slipping past with red in his smooth pale cheek riley and mcquirk had indeed waged a great and friendly battle broken bottles and glasses were everywhere the room was full of alcohol fumes the floor was variegated with spirituous puddles on the table stood a ounce glass graduated measure in the bottom of it were two tablespoonfuls of liquid a bright golden liquid that seemed to hold the sunshine a prisoner in its auriferous depths con smelled it he tasted it he drank it as he returned through the hall katherine was just going up the stairs no news yet mr lantry she asked with her teasing laugh con lifted her clear from the floor and held her there the news is he said that we re to be married put me down sir she cried indignantly or i will oh con where oh wherever did you get the nerve to say it a harlem tragedy harlem mrs fink had dropped into mrs cassidy s flat one flight below ain t it a beaut said mrs cassidy she turned her face proudly for her friend mrs fink to see one eye was nearly closed with a great greenish purple bruise around it her lip was cut and bleeding a little and there were red finger marks on each side of her neck my husband wouldn t ever think of doing that to me said mrs fink concealing her envy i wouldn t have a man declared mrs cassidy that didn t beat me up at least once a week shows he thinks something of you say but that last dose jack gave me wasn t no homeopathic one i can see stars yet but he ll be the sweetest man in town for the rest of the week to make up for it this eye is good for theater tickets and a silk shirt waist at the very least i should hope said mrs fink assuming complacency that mr fink is too much of a gentleman ever to raise his hand against me oh go on maggie said mrs cassidy laughing and applying witch hazel you re only jealous your old man is too frapped and slow to ever give you a punch he just sits down and practises physical culture with a newspaper when he comes home now ain t that the truth mr fink certainly peruses of the papers when he comes home acknowledged mrs fink with a toss of her head but he certainly don t ever make no steve o donnell out of me just to amuse himself that s a sure thing mrs cassidy laughed the contented laugh of the guarded and happy matron with the air of cornelia exhibiting her jewels she drew down the collar of her kimono and revealed another treasured bruise maroon colored edged with olive and orange a bruise now nearly well but still to memory dear mrs fink capitulated the formal light in her eye softened to envious admiration she and mrs cassidy had been chums in the downtown paper box factory before they had married one year before now she and her man occupied the flat above mame and her man therefore she could not put on airs with mame don t it hurt when he soaks you asked mrs fink curiously hurt mrs cassidy gave a soprano scream of delight well say did you ever have a brick house fall on you well that s just the way it feels just like when they re digging you out of the ruins jack s got a left that spells two matinees and a new pair of oxfords and his right well it takes a trip to coney and six pairs of openwork silk lisle threads to make that good but what does he beat you for inquired mrs fink with wide open eyes silly said mrs cassidy indulgently why because he s full it s generally on saturday nights but what cause do you give him persisted the seeker after knowledge why didn t i marry him jack comes in tanked up and i m here ain t i who else has he got a right to beat i d just like to catch him once beating anybody else sometimes it s because supper ain t ready and sometimes it s because it is jack ain t particular about causes he just lushes till he remembers he s married and then he makes for home and does me up saturday nights i just move the furniture with sharp corners out of the way so i won t cut my head when he gets his work in he s got a left swing that jars you sometimes i take the count in the first round but when i feel like having a good time during the week or want some new rags i come up again for more punishment that s what i done last night jack knows i ve been wanting a black silk waist for a month and i didn t think just one black eye would bring it tell you what mag i ll bet you the ice cream he brings it to night mrs fink was thinking deeply my mart she said never hit me a lick in his life it s just like you said mame he comes in grouchy and ain t got a word to say he never takes me out anywhere he s a chair warmer at home for fair he buys me things but he looks so glum about it that i never appreciate em mrs cassidy slipped an arm around her chum you poor thing she said but everybody can t have a husband like jack marriage wouldn t be no failure if they was all like him these discontented wives you hear about what they need is a man to come home and kick their slats in once a week and then make it up in kisses and chocolate creams that d give em some interest in life what i want is a masterful man that slugs you when he s jagged and hugs you when he ain t jagged preserve me from the man that ain t got the sand to do neither mrs fink sighed the hallways were suddenly filled with sound the door flew open at the kick of mr cassidy his arms were occupied with bundles mame flew and hung about his neck her sound eye sparkled with the love light that shines in the eye of the maori maid when she recovers consciousness in the hut of the wooer who has stunned and dragged her there hello old girl shouted mr cassidy he shed his bundles and lifted her off her feet in a mighty hug i got tickets for barnum bailey s and if you ll bust the string of one of them bundles i guess you ll find that silk waist why good evening mrs fink i didn t see you at first how s old mart coming along he s very well mr cassidy thanks said mrs fink i must be going along up now mart ll be home for supper soon i ll bring you down that pattern you wanted to morrow mame mrs fink went up to her flat and had a little cry it was a meaningless cry the kind of cry that only a woman knows about a cry from no particular cause altogether an absurd cry the most transient and the most hopeless cry in the repertory of grief why had martin never thrashed her he was as big and strong as jack cassidy did he not care for her at all he never quarrelled he came home and lounged about silent glum idle he was a fairly good provider but he ignored the spices of life mrs fink s ship of dreams was becalmed her captain ranged between plum duff and his hammock if only he would shiver his timbers or stamp his foot on the quarter deck now and then and she had thought to sail so merrily touching at ports in the delectable isles but now to vary the figure she was ready to throw up the sponge tired out without a scratch to show for all those tame rounds with her sparring partner for one moment she almost hated mame mame with her cuts and bruises her salve of presents and kisses her stormy voyage with her fighting brutal loving mate mr fink came home at he was permeated with the curse of domesticity beyond the portals of his cozy home he cared not to roam to roam he was the man who had caught the street car the anaconda that had swallowed its prey the tree that lay as it had fallen like the supper mart asked mrs fink who had striven over it m m m yep grunted mr fink after supper he gathered his newspapers to read he sat in his stocking feet arise some new dante and sing me the befitting corner of perdition for the man who sitteth in the house in his stockinged feet sisters of patience who by reason of ties or duty have endured it in silk yarn cotton lisle thread or woollen does not the new canto belong the next day was labor day the occupations of mr cassidy and mr fink ceased for one passage of the sun labor triumphant would parade and otherwise disport itself mrs fink took mrs cassidy s pattern down early maine had on her new silk waist even her damaged eye managed to emit a holiday gleam jack was fruitfully penitent and there was a hilarious scheme for the day afoot with parks and picnics and pilsener in it a rising indignant jealousy seized mrs fink as she returned to her flat above oh happy mame with her bruises and her quick following balm but was mame to have a monopoly of happiness surely martin fink was as good a man as jack cassidy was his wife to go always unbelabored and uncaressed a sudden brilliant breathless idea came to mrs fink she would show mame that there were husbands as able to use their fists and perhaps to be as tender afterward as any jack the holiday promised to be a nominal one with the finks mrs fink had the stationary washtubs in the kitchen filled with a two weeks wash that had been soaking overnight mr fink sat in his stockinged feet reading a newspaper thus labor day presaged to speed jealousy surged high in mrs fink s heart and higher still surged an audacious resolve if her man would not strike her if he would not so far prove his manhood his prerogative and his interest in conjugal affairs he must be prompted to his duty mr fink lit his pipe and peacefully rubbed an ankle with a stockinged toe he reposed in the state of matrimony like a lump of unblended suet in a pudding this was his level elysium to sit at ease vicariously girdling the world in print amid the wifely splashing of suds and the agreeable smells of breakfast dishes departed and dinner ones to come many ideas were far from his mind but the furthest one was the thought of beating his wife mrs fink turned on the hot water and set the washboards in the suds up from the flat below came the gay laugh of mrs cassidy it sounded like a taunt a flaunting of her own happiness in the face of the unslugged bride above now was mrs fink s time suddenly she turned like a fury upon the man reading you lazy loafer she cried must i work my arms off washing and toiling for the ugly likes of you are you a man or are you a kitchen hound mr fink dropped his paper motionless from surprise she feared that he would not strike that the provocation had been insufficient she leaped at him and struck him fiercely in the face with her clenched hand in that instant she felt a thrill of love for hire such as she had not felt for many a day rise up martin fink and come into your kingdom oh she must feel the weight of his hand now just to show that he cared just to show that he cared mr fink sprang to his feet maggie caught him again on the jaw with a wide swing of her other hand she closed her eyes in that fearful blissful moment before his blow should come she whispered his name to herself she leaned to the expected shock hungry for it in the flat below mr cassidy with a shamed and contrite face was powdering mame s eye in preparation for their junket from the flat above came the sound of a woman s voice high raised a bumping a stumbling and a shufing a chair overturned unmistakable sounds of domestic conflict mart and mag scrapping postulated mr cassidy didn t know they ever indulged shall i trot up and see if they need a sponge holder one of mrs cassidy s eyes sparkled like a diamond the other twinkled at least like paste oh oh she said softly and without apparent meaning in the feminine ejaculatory manner i wonder if wonder if wait jack till i go up and see up the stairs she sped as her foot struck the hallway above out from the kitchen door of her flat wildly flounced mrs fink oh maggie cried mrs cassidy in a delighted whisper did he oh did he mrs fink ran and laid her face upon her chum s shoulder and sobbed hopelessly mrs cassidy took maggie s face between her hands and lifted it gently tear stained it was flushing and paling but its velvety pink and white becomingly freckled surface was unscratched unbruised unmarred by the recreant fist of mr fink tell me maggie pleaded mame or i ll go in there and find out what was it did he hurt you what did he do mrs fink s face went down again despairingly on the bosom of her friend for god s sake don t open that door mame she sobbed and don t ever tell nobody keep it under your hat he he never touched me and he s oh gawd he s washin the clothes he s washin the clothes the guilty party a red haired unshaven untidy man sat in a rocking chair by a window he had just lighted a pipe and was puffing blue clouds with great satisfaction he had removed his shoes and donned a pair of blue faded carpet slippers with the morbid thirst of the confirmed daily news drinker he awkwardly folded back the pages of an evening paper eagerly gulping down the strong black headlines to be followed as a chaser by the milder details of the smaller type in an adjoining room a woman was cooking supper odors from strong bacon and boiling coffee contended against the cut plug fumes from the vespertine pipe outside was one of those crowded streets of the east side in which as twilight falls satan sets up his recruiting office a mighty host of children danced and ran and played in the street some in rags some in clean white and beribboned some wild and restless as young hawks some gentle faced and shrinking some shrieking rude and sinful words some listening awed but soon grown familiar to embrace here were the children playing in the corridors of the house of sin above the playground forever hovered a great bird the bird was known to humorists as the stork but the people of chrystie street were better ornithologists they called it a vulture a little girl of twelve came up timidly to the man reading and resting by the window and said papa won t you play a game of checkers with me if you aren t too tired the red haired unshaven untidy man sitting shoeless by the window answered with a frown checkers no i won t can t a man who works hard all day have a little rest when he comes home why don t you go out and play with the other kids on the sidewalk the woman who was cooking came to the door john she said i don t like for lizzie to play in the street they learn too much there that ain t good for em she s been in the house all day long it seems that you might give up a little of your time to amuse her when you come home let her go out and play like the rest of em if she wants to be amused said the red haired unshaven untidy man and don t bother me you re on said kid mullaly fifty dollars to i take annie to the dance put up the kid s black eyes were snapping with the fire of the baited and challenged he drew out his roll and slapped five tens upon the bar the three or four young fellows who were thus taken more slowly produced their stake the bartender ex officio stakeholder took the money laboriously wrapped it recorded the bet with an inch long pencil and stuffed the whole into a corner of the cash register and oh what ll be done to you ll be a plenty said a bettor with anticipatory glee that s my lookout said the kid sternly fill em up all around mike after the round burke the kid s sponge sponge holder pal mentor and grand vizier drew him out to the bootblack stand at the saloon corner where all the official and important matters of the small hours social club were settled as tony polished the light tan shoes of the club s president and secretary for the fifth time that day burke spake words of wisdom to his chief cut that blond out kid was his advice or there ll be trouble what do you want to throw down that girl of yours for you ll never find one that ll freeze to you like liz has she s worth a hallful of annies i m no annie admirer said the kid dropping a cigarette ash on his polished toe and wiping it off on tony s shoulder but i want to teach liz a lesson she thinks i belong to her she s been bragging that i daren t speak to another girl liz is all right in some ways she s drinking a little too much lately and she uses language that a lady oughtn t you re engaged ain t you asked burke sure we ll get married next year maybe i saw you make her drink her first glass of beer said burke that was two years ago when she used to came down to the corner of chrystie bare headed to meet you after supper she was a quiet sort of a kid then and couldn t speak without blushing she s a little spitfire sometimes now said the kid i hate jealousy that s why i m going to the dance with annie it ll teach her some sense well you better look a little out were burke s last words if liz was my girl and i was to sneak out to a dance coupled up with an annie i d want a suit of chain armor on under my gladsome rags all right through the land of the stork vulture wandered liz her black eyes searched the passing crowds fierily but vaguely now and then she hummed bars of foolish little songs between times she set her small white teeth together and spake crisp words that the east side has added to language liz s skirt was green silk her waist was a large brown and pink plaid well fitting and not without style she wore a cluster ring of huge imitation rubies and a locket that banged her knees at the bottom of a silver chain her shoes were run down over twisted high heels and were strangers to polish her hat would scarcely have passed into a flour barrel the family entrance of the blue jay cafe received her at a table she sat and punched the button with the air of milady ringing for her carriage the waiter came with his large chinned low voiced manner of respectful familiarity liz smoothed her silken skirt with a satisfied wriggle she made the most of it here she could order and be waited upon it was all that her world offered her of the prerogative of woman whiskey tommy she said as her sisters further uptown murmur champagne james sure miss lizzie what ll the chaser be seltzer and say tommy has the kid been around to day why no miss lizzie i haven t saw him to day fluently came the miss lizzie for the kid was known to be one who required rigid upholdment of the dignity of his fiancee i m lookin for m said liz after the chaser had sputtered under her nose it s got to me that he says he ll take annie karlson to the dance let him the pink eyed white rat i m lookin for m you know me tommy two years me and the kid s been engaged look at that ring five hundred he said it cost let him take her to the dance what ll i do i ll cut his heart out another whiskey tommy i wouldn t listen to no such reports miss lizzie said the waiter smoothly from the narrow opening above his chin kid mullaly s not the guy to throw a lady like you down seltzer on the side two years repeated liz softening a little to sentiment under the magic of the distiller s art i always used to play out on the street of evenin s cause there was nothin doin for me at home for a long time i just sat on doorsteps and looked at the lights and the people goin by and then the kid came along one evenin and sized me up and i was mashed on the spot for fair the first drink he made me take i cried all night at home and got a lickin for makin a noise and now say tommy you ever see this annie karlson if it wasn t for peroxide the chloroform limit would have put her out long ago oh i m lookin for m you tell the kid if he comes in me i ll cut his heart out leave it to me another whiskey tommy a little unsteadily but with watchful and brilliant eyes liz walked up the avenue on the doorstep of a brick tenement a curly haired child sat puzzling over the convolutions of a tangled string liz flopped down beside her with a crooked shifting smile on her flushed face but her eyes had grown clear and artless of a sudden let me show you how to make a cat s cradle kid she said tucking her green silk skirt under her rusty shoes and while they sat there the lights were being turned on for the dance in the hall of the small hours social club it was the bi monthly dance a dress affair in which the members took great pride and bestirred themselves huskily to further and adorn at o clock the president kid mullaly paced upon the floor with a lady on his arm as the loreley s was her hair golden her yes was softened to a yah but its quality of assent was patent to the most milesian ears she stepped upon her own train and blushed and she smiled into the eyes of kid mullaly and then as the two stood in the middle of the waxed floor the thing happened to prevent which many lamps are burning nightly in many studies and libraries out from the circle of spectators in the hall leaped fate in a green silk skirt under the nom de guerre of liz her eyes were hard and blacker than jet she did not scream or waver most unwomanly she cried out one oath the kid s own favorite oath and in his own deep voice and then while the small hours social club went frantically to pieces she made good her boast to tommy the waiter made good as far as the length of her knife blade and the strength of her arm permitted and next came the primal instinct of self preservation or was it self annihilation the instinct that society has grafted on the natural branch liz ran out and down the street swift and true as a woodcock flying through a grove of saplings at dusk and then followed the big city s biggest shame its most ancient and rotten surviving canker its pollution and disgrace its blight and perversion its forever infamy and guilt fostered unreproved and cherished handed down from a long ago century of the basest barbarity the hue and cry nowhere but in the big cities does it survive and here most of all where the ultimate perfection of culture citizenship and alleged superiority joins bawling in the chase they pursued a shrieking mob of fathers mothers lovers and maidens howling yelling calling whistling crying for blood well may the wolf in the big city stand outside the door well may his heart the gentler falter at the siege knowing her way and hungry for her surcease she darted down the familiar ways until at last her feet struck the dull solidity of the rotting pier and then it was but a few more panting steps and good mother east river took liz to her bosom soothed her muddily taut quickly and settled in five minutes the problem that keeps lights burning o nights in thousands of pastorates and colleges it s mighty funny what kind of dreams one has sometimes poets call them visions but a vision is only a dream in blank verse i dreamed the rest of this story i thought i was in the next world i don t know how i got there i suppose i had been riding on the ninth avenue elevated or taking patent medicine or trying to pull jim jeffries s nose or doing some such little injudicious stunt but anyhow there i was and there was a great crowd of us outside the courtroom where the judgments were going on and every now and then a very beautiful and imposing court officer angel would come outside the door and call another case while i was considering my own worldly sins and wondering whether there would be any use of my trying to prove an alibi by claiming that i lived in new jersey the bailiff angel came to the door and sang out case no up stepped a plain clothes man there were lots of em there dressed exactly like preachers and hustling us spirits around just like cops do on earth and by the arm he dragged whom do you think why liz the court officer took her inside and closed the door i went up to mr fly cop and inquired about the case a very sad one says he laying the points of his manicured fingers together an utterly incorrigible girl i am special terrestrial officer the reverend jones the case was assigned to me the girl murdered her fiance and committed suicide she had no defense my report to the court relates the facts in detail all of which are substantiated by reliable witnesses the wages of sin is death praise the lord the court officer opened the door and stepped out poor girl said special terrestrial officer the reverend jones with a tear in his eye it was one of the saddest cases that i ever met with of course she was discharged said the court officer come here jonesy first thing you know you ll be switched to the pot pie squad how would you like to be on the missionary force in the south sea islands hey now you quit making these false arrests or you ll be transferred see the guilty party you ve not to look for in this case is a red haired unshaven untidy man sitting by the window reading in his stocking feet while his children play in the streets get a move on you now wasn t that a silly dream according to their lights somewhere in the depths of the big city where the unquiet dregs are forever being shaken together young murray and the captain had met and become friends both were at the lowest ebb possible to their fortunes both had fallen from at least an intermediate heaven of respectability and importance and both were typical products of the monstrous and peculiar social curriculum of their overweening and bumptious civic alma mater the captain was no longer a captain one of those sudden moral cataclysms that sometimes sweep the city had hurled him from a high and profitable position in the police department ripping off his badge and buttons and washing into the hands of his lawyers the solid pieces of real estate that his frugality had enabled him to accumulate the passing of the flood left him low and dry one month after his dishabilitation a saloon keeper plucked him by the neck from his free lunch counter as a tabby plucks a strange kitten from her nest and cast him asphaltward this seems low enough but after that he acquired a pair of cloth top button congress gaiters and wrote complaining letters to the newspapers and then he fought the attendant at the municipal lodging house who tried to give him a bath when murray first saw him he was holding the hand of an italian woman who sold apples and garlic on essex street and quoting the words of a song book ballad murray s fall had been more luciferian if less spectacular all the pretty tiny little kickshaws of gotham had once been his the megaphone man roars out at you to observe the house of his uncle on a grand and revered avenue but there had been an awful row about something and the prince had been escorted to the door by the butler which in said avenue is equivalent to the impact of the avuncular shoe a weak prince hal without inheritance or sword he drifted downward to meet his humorless falstaff and to pick the crusts of the streets with him one evening they sat on a bench in a little downtown park the great bulk of the captain which starvation seemed to increase drawing irony instead of pity to his petitions for aid was heaped against the arm of the bench in a shapeless mass his red face spotted by tufts of vermilion week old whiskers and topped by a sagging white straw hat looked in the gloom like one of those structures that you may observe in a dark third avenue window challenging your imagination to say whether it be something recent in the way of ladies hats or a strawberry shortcake a tight drawn belt last relic of his official spruceness made a deep furrow in his circumference the captain s shoes were buttonless in a smothered bass he cursed his star of ill luck murray at his side was shrunk into his dingy and ragged suit of blue serge his hat was pulled low he sat quiet and a little indistinct like some ghost that had been dispossessed i m hungry growled the captain by the top sirloin of the bull of bashan i m starving to death right now i could eat a bowery restaurant clear through to the stovepipe in the alley can t you think of nothing murray you sit there with your shoulders scrunched up giving an irritation of reginald vanderbilt driving his coach what good are them airs doing you now think of some place we can get something to chew you forget my dear captain said murray without moving that our last attempt at dining was at my suggestion you bet it was groaned the captain you bet your life it was have you got any more like that to make hey i admit we failed sighed murray i was sure malone would be good for one more free lunch after the way he talked baseball with me the last time i spent a nickel in his establishment i had this hand said the captain extending the unfortunate member i had this hand on the drum stick of a turkey and two sardine sandwiches when them waiters grabbed us i was within two inches of the olives said murray stuffed olives i haven t tasted one in a year what ll we do grumbled the captain we can t starve can t we said murray quietly i m glad to hear that i was afraid we could you wait here said the captain rising heavily and puffily to his feet i m going to try to make one more turn you stay here till i come back murray i won t be over half an hour if i turn the trick i ll come back flush he made some elephantine attempts at smartening his appearance he gave his fiery mustache a heavenward twist he dragged into sight a pair of black edged cuffs deepened the crease in his middle by tightening his belt another hole and set off jaunty as a zoo rhinoceros across the south end of the park when he was out of sight murray also left the park hurrying swiftly eastward he stopped at a building whose steps were flanked by two green lights a police captain named maroney he said to the desk sergeant was dismissed from the force after being tried under charges three years ago i believe sentence was suspended is this man wanted now by the police why are ye asking inquired the sergeant with a frown i thought there might be a reward standing explained murray easily i know the man well he seems to be keeping himself pretty shady at present i could lay my hands on him at any time if there should be a reward there s no reward interrupted the sergeant shortly the man s not wanted and neither are ye so get out ye are frindly with um and ye would be selling um out with ye quick or i ll give ye a start murray gazed at the officer with serene and virtuous dignity i would be simply doing my duty as a citizen and gentleman he said severely if i could assist the law in laying hold of one of its ofenders murray hurried back to the bench in the park he folded his arms and shrank within his clothes to his ghost like presentment ten minutes afterward the captain arrived at the rendezvous windy and thunderous as a clog day in kansas his collar had been torn away his straw hat had been twisted and battered his shirt with ox blood stripes split to the waist and from head to knee he was drenched with some vile and ignoble greasy fluid that loudly proclaimed to the nose its component leaven of garlic and kitchen stuff for heaven s sake captain sniffed murray i doubt that i would have waited for you if i had suspected you were so desperate as to resort to swill barrels i cheese it said the captain harshly i m not hogging it yet it s all on the outside i went around on essex and proposed marriage to that catrina that s got the fruit shop there now that business could be built up she s a peach as far as a dago could be i thought i had that senoreena mashed sure last week but look what she done to me i guess i got too fresh well there s another scheme queered you don t mean to say said murray with infinite contempt that you would have married that woman to help yourself out of your disgraceful troubles me said the captain i d marry the empress of china for one bowl of chop suey i d commit murder for a plate of beef stew i d steal a wafer from a waif i d be a mormon for a bowl of chowder i think said murray resting his head on his hands that i would play judas for the price of one drink of whiskey for thirty pieces of silver i would oh come now exclaimed the captain in dismay you wouldn t do that murray i always thought that kike s squeal on his boss was about the lowest down play that ever happened a man that gives his friend away is worse than a pirate through the park stepped a large man scanning the benches where the electric light fell is that you mac he said halting before the derelicts his diamond stickpin dazzled his diamond studded fob chain assisted he was big and smooth and well fed yes i see it s you he continued they told me at mike s that i might find you over here let me see you a few minutes mac the captain lifted himself with a grunt of alacrity if charlie finnegan had come down in the bottomless pit to seek him there must be something doing charlie guided him by an arm into a patch of shadow you know mac he said they re trying inspector pickering on graft charges he was my inspector said the captain o shea wants the job went on finnegan he must have it it s for the good of the organization pickering must go under your testimony will do it he was your man higher up when you were on the force his share of the boodle passed through your hands you must go on the stand and testify against him he was began the captain wait a minute said finnegan a bundle of yellowish stuff came out of his inside pocket five hundred dollars in it for you two fifty on the spot and the rest he was my friend i say finished the captain i ll see you and the gang and the city and the party in the flames of hades before i ll take the stand against dan pickering i m down and out but i m no traitor to a man that s been my friend the captain s voice rose and boomed like a split trombone get out of this park charlie finnegan where us thieves and tramps and boozers are your betters and take your dirty money with you finnegan drifted out by another walk the captain turned to his seat i couldn t avoid hearing said murray drearily i think you are the biggest fool i ever saw what would you have done asked the captain nailed pickering to the cross said murray sonny said the captain huskily and without heat you and me are different new york is divided into two parts above forty second street and below fourteenth you come from the other part we both act according to our lights an illuminated clock above the trees retailed the information that it lacked the half hour of twelve both men rose from the bench and moved away together as if seized by the same idea they left the park struck through a narrow cross street and came into broadway at this hour as dark echoing and de peopled as a byway in pompeii northward they turned and a policeman who glanced at their unkempt and slinking figures withheld the attention and suspicion that he would have granted them at any other hour and place for on every street in that part of the city other unkempt and slinking figures were shuffling and hurrying toward a converging point a point that is marked by no monument save that groove on the pavement worn by tens of thousands of waiting feet at ninth street a tall man wearing an opera hat alighted from a broadway car and turned his face westward but he saw murray pounced upon him and dragged him under a street light the captain lumbered slowly to the corner like a wounded bear and waited growling jerry cried the hatted one how fortunate i was to begin a search for you to morrow the old gentleman has capitulated you re to be restored to favor congratulate you come to the office in the morning and get all the money you want i ve liberal instructions in that respect and the little matrimonial arrangement said murray with his head turned sidewise why er well of course your uncle under stands expects that the engagement between you and miss vanderhurst shall be good night said murray moving away you madman cried the other catching his arm would you give up two millions on account of did you ever see her nose old man asked murray solemnly but listen to reason jerry miss vanderhurst is an heiress and did you ever see it yes i admit that her nose isn t good night said murray my friend is waiting for me i am quoting him when i authorize you to report that there is nothing doing good night a wriggling line of waiting men extended from a door in tenth street far up broadway on the outer edge of the pavement the captain and murray fell in at the tail of the quivering millipede twenty feet longer than it was last night said murray looking up at his measuring angle of grace church half an hour growled the captain before we get our punk the city clocks began to strike the bread line moved forward slowly its leathern feet sliding on the stones with the sound of a hissing serpent as they who had lived according to their lights closed up in the rear a midsummer knight s dream the knights are dead their swords are rust except a few who haze to hust le all the time to raise the dust dear reader it was summertime the sun glared down upon the city with pitiless ferocity it is difficult for the sun to be ferocious and exhibit compunction simultaneously the heat was oh bother thermometers who cares for standard measures anyhow it was so hot that the roof gardens put on so many extra waiters that you could hope to get your gin fizz now as soon as all the other people got theirs the hospitals were putting in extra cots for bystanders for when little woolly dogs loll their tongues out and say woof woof at the fleas that bite em and nervous old black bombazine ladies screech mad dog and policemen begin to shoot somebody is going to get hurt the man from pompton n j who always wears an overcoat in july had turned up in a broadway hotel drinking hot scotches and enjoying his annual ray from the calcium philanthropists were petitioning the legislature to pass a bill requiring builders to make tenement fire escapes more commodious so that families might die all together of the heat instead of one or two at a time so many men were telling you about the number of baths they took each day that you wondered how they got along after the real lessee of the apartment came back to town and thanked em for taking such good care of it the young man who called loudly for cold beef and beer in the restaurant protesting that roast pullet and burgundy was really too heavy for such weather blushed when he met your eye for you had heard him all winter calling in modest tones for the same ascetic viands soup pocketbooks shirt waists actors and baseball excuses grew thinner yes it was summertime a man stood at thirty fourth street waiting for a downtown car a man of forty gray haired pink faced keen nervous plainly dressed with a harassed look around the eyes he wiped his forehead and laughed loudly when a fat man with an outing look stopped and spoke with him no siree he shouted with defiance and scorn none of your old mosquito haunted swamps and skyscraper mountains without elevators for me when i want to get away from hot weather i know how to do it new york sir is the finest summer resort in the country keep in the shade and watch your diet and don t get too far away from an electric fan talk about your adirondacks and your catskills there s more solid comfort in the borough of manhattan than in all the rest of the country together no siree no tramping up perpendicular cliffs and being waked up at in the morning by a million flies and eating canned goods straight from the city for me little old new york will take a few select summer boarders comforts and conveniences of homes that s the ad that i answer every time you need a vacation said the fat man looking closely at the other you haven t been away from town in years better come with me for two weeks anyhow the trout in the beaverkill are jumping at anything now that looks like a fly harding writes me that he landed a three pound brown last week nonsense cried the other man go ahead if you like and boggle around in rubber boots wearing yourself out trying to catch fish when i want one i go to a cool restaurant and order it i laugh at you fellows whenever i think of you hustling around in the heat in the country thinking you are having a good time for me father knickerbocker s little improved farm with the big shady lane running through the middle of it the fat man sighed over his friend and went his way the man who thought new york was the greatest summer resort in the country boarded a car and went buzzing down to his office on the way he threw away his newspaper and looked up at a ragged patch of sky above the housetops three pounds he muttered absently and harding isn t a liar i believe if i could but it s impossible they ve got to have another month another month at least in his office the upholder of urban midsummer joys dived headforemost into the swimming pool of business adkins his clerk came and added a spray of letters memoranda and telegrams at o clock in the afternoon the busy man leaned back in his office

can you make out of simply beef you can make oyster soup without oysters turtle soup without turtles coffee cake without coffee but you can t make beef stew without potatoes and onions but rib beef alone in an emergency can make an ordinary pine door look like a wrought iron gambling house portal to the wolf with salt and pepper and a tablespoonful of flour first well stirred in a little cold water twill serve tis not so deep as a lobster a la newburg nor so wide as a church festival doughnut but twill serve hetty took her stew pan to the rear of the third floor hall according to the advertisements of the vallambrosa there was running water to be found there between you and me and the water meter it only ambled or walked through the faucets but technicalities have no place here there was also a sink where housekeeping roomers often met to dump their coffee grounds and glare at one another s kimonos at this sink hetty found a girl with heavy gold brown artistic hair and plaintive eyes washing two large irish potatoes hetty knew the vallambrosa as well as any one not owning double hextra magnifying eyes could compass its mysteries the kimonos were her encyclopedia her who s what her clearinghouse of news of goers and comers from a rose pink kimono edged with nile green she had learned that the girl with the potatoes was a miniature painter living in a kind of attic or studio as they prefer to call it on the top floor hetty was not certain in her mind what a miniature was but it certainly wasn t a house because house painters although they wear splashy overalls and poke ladders in your face on the street are known to indulge in a riotous profusion of food at home the potato girl was quite slim and small and handled her potatoes as an old bachelor uncle handles a baby who is cutting teeth she had a dull shoemaker s knife in her right hand and she had begun to peel one of the potatoes with it hetty addressed her in the punctiliously formal tone of one who intends to be cheerfully familiar with you in the second round beg pardon she said for butting into what s not my business but if you peel them potatoes you lose out they re new bermudas you want to scrape em lemme show you she took a potato and the knife and began to demonstrate oh thank you breathed the artist i didn t know and i did hate to see the thick peeling go it seemed such a waste but i thought they always had to be peeled when you ve got only potatoes to eat the peelings count you know say kid said hetty staying her knife you ain t up against it too are you the miniature artist smiled starvedly i suppose i am art or at least the way i interpret it doesn t seem to be much in demand i have only these potatoes for my dinner but they aren t so bad boiled and hot with a little butter and salt child said hetty letting a brief smile soften her rigid features fate has sent me and you together i ve had it handed to me in the neck too but i ve got a chunk of meat in my room as big as a lap dog and i ve done everything to get potatoes except pray for em let s me and you bunch our commissary departments and make a stew of em we ll cook it in my room if we only had an onion to go in it say kid you haven t got a couple of pennies that ve slipped down into the lining of your last winter s sealskin have you i could step down to the corner and get one at old giuseppe s stand a stew without an onion is worse n a matinee without candy you may call me cecilia said the artist no i spent my last penny three days ago then we ll have to cut the onion out instead of slicing it in said hetty i d ask the janitress for one but i don t want em hep just yet to the fact that i m pounding the asphalt for another job but i wish we did have an onion in the shop girl s room the two began to prepare their supper cecilia s part was to sit on the couch helplessly and beg to be allowed to do something in the voice of a cooing ring dove hetty prepared the rib beef putting it in cold salted water in the stew pan and setting it on the one burner gas stove i wish we had an onion said hetty as she scraped the two potatoes on the wall opposite the couch was pinned a flaming gorgeous advertising picture of one of the new ferry boats of the p u f f railroad that had been built to cut down the time between los angeles and new york city one eighth of a minute hetty turning her head during her continuous monologue saw tears running from her guest s eyes as she gazed on the idealized presentment of the speeding foam girdled transport why say cecilia kid said hetty poising her knife is it as bad art as that i ain t a critic but i thought it kind of brightened up the room of course a manicure painter could tell it was a bum picture in a minute i ll take it down if you say so i wish to the holy saint potluck we had an onion but the miniature miniature painter had tumbled down sobbing with her nose indenting the hard woven drapery of the couch something was here deeper than the artistic temperament offended at crude

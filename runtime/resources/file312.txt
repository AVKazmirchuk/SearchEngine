climbed to their places david stood for a moment upon one foot the huge gentleman waved a hand you will enter the carriage he said in a voice large like himself but smoothed by art and habit obedience belonged in the path of such a voice brief as was the young poet s hesitation it was cut shorter still by a renewal of the command david s foot went to the step in the darkness he perceived dimly the form of the lady upon the rear seat he was about to seat himself opposite when the voice again swayed him to its will you will sit at the lady s side the gentleman swung his great weight to the forward seat the carriage proceeded up the hill the lady was shrunk silent into her corner david could not estimate whether she was old or young but a delicate mild perfume from her clothes stirred his poet s fancy to the belief that there was loveliness beneath the mystery here was an adventure such as he had often imagined but as yet he held no key to it for no word was spoken while he sat with his impenetrable companions in an hour s time david perceived through the window that the vehicle traversed the street of some town then it stopped in front of a closed and darkened house and a postilion alighted to hammer impatiently upon the door a latticed window above flew wide and a nightcapped head popped out who are ye that disturb honest folk at this time of night my house is closed tis too late for profitable travellers to be abroad cease knocking at my door and be off open spluttered the postilion loudly open for monsiegneur the marquis de beaupertuys ah cried the voice above ten thousand pardons my lord i did not know the hour is so late at once shall the door be opened and the house placed at my lord s disposal inside was heard the clink of chain and bar and the door was

length the huge gentleman seated himself in a chair at the nearer end the lady sank into another against the wall with an air of great weariness david stood considering how best he might now take his leave and continue upon his way my lord said the landlord bowing to the floor h had i ex expected this honour entertainment would have been ready t t there is wine and cold fowl and m m maybe candles said the marquis spreading the fingers of one plump white hand in a gesture he had y yes my lord he fetched half a dozen candles lighted them and set them upon the table if monsieur would perhaps deign to taste a certain burgundy there is a cask candles said monsieur spreading his fingers assuredly quickly i fly my lord a dozen more lighted candles shone in the hall the great bulk of the marquis overflowed his chair he was dressed in fine black from head to foot save for the snowy ruffles at his wrist and throat even the hilt and scabbard of his sword were black his expression was one of sneering pride the ends of an upturned moustache reached nearly to his mocking eyes the lady sat motionless and now david perceived that she was young and possessed of pathetic and appealing beauty he was startled from the contemplation of her forlorn loveliness by the booming voice of the marquis what is your name and pursuit david mignot i am a poet the moustache of the marquis curled nearer

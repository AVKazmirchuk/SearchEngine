you ve told it to me straight i should think a man put on the bum from a good job just in one day would be tearing his hair i believe i ve already remarked said vallance laughing that i would have thought that a man who was expecting to come into a fortune on the next day would be feeling pretty easy and quiet it s funny business philosophized ide about the way people take things anyhow here s your bench dawson right next to mine the light don t shine in your eyes here say dawson i ll get the old man to give you a letter to somebody about a job when i get back home you ve helped me a lot to night i don t believe i could have gone through the night if i hadn t struck you thank you said vallance do you lie down or sit up on these when you sleep for hours vallance gazed almost without winking at the stars through the branches of the trees and listened to the sharp slapping of horses hoofs on the sea of asphalt to the south his mind was active but his feelings were dormant every emotion seemed to have been eradicated ide felt no regrets no fears no pain or discomfort even when be thought of the girl it was as of an inhabitant of one of those remote stars at which be gazed he re membered the absurd antics of his companion and laughed softly yet without a feeling of mirth soon the daily army of milk wagons made of the city a roaring drum to which they marched vallance fell asleep on his comfortless bench at ten o clock on the next day the two stood at the door of lawyer mead s office in ann street ide s nerves fluttered worse than ever when the hour approached and vallance could not decide to leave him a possible prey to the dangers he dreaded when they entered the office lawyer mead looked at them wonderingly he and vallance were old friends after his greeting

there to receive it it will inform you that mr paulding has reconsidered his offer to take you back into favor he has decided not to do so and desires you to understand that no change will be made in the relations existing between you and him ide s trembling suddenly ceased the color came back to his face and be straightened his back his jaw went forward half an inch and a gleam came into his eye he pushed back his battered bat with one hand and extended the other with levelled fin gers toward the lawyer he took a long breath and then laughed sardonically tell old paulding he may go to the devil he said loudly and clearly and turned and walked out of the office with a firm and lively step lawyer mead turned on his heel to vallance and smiled i am glad you came in he said genially your uncle wants you to return home at once he is reconciled to the situation that led to his hasty action and desires to say that all will be as hey adams cried lawyer mead breaking his sentence and

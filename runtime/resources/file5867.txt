looking had her features not been clouded by an expression of keen worry and fatigue she was of a style of figure and possessed coloring and features that were agreeable to my fancy she was in a traveling dress she fixed upon me an earnest look of extreme anxiety and pressed an unsteady hand to her bosom i think she would have started forward but the gentleman arrested her movement with an authoritative motion of his hand he then came himself to meet me he was a man of forty a little gray about the temples and with a strong thoughtful face bellford old man he said cordially i m glad to see you again of course we know everything is all right i warned you you know that you were overdoing it now you ll go back with us and be yourself again in no time i smiled ironically i havae been bellforded so often i said that it has lost its edge still in the end it may grow wearisome would you be willing at all to entertain the hypothesis that my name is edward pinkhammer and that i never saw you before in my life before the man could reply a wailing cry came from the woman she sprang past his detaining arm elwyn she sobbed and cast herself upon me and clung tight elwyn she cried again don t break my heart i am your wife call my name once just once i could see you dead rather than this way i unwound her arms respectfully but firmly madam i said severely pardon me if i suggest that you accept a resemblance too precipitately it is a pity i went on with an amused laugh as the thought occurred to me that this bellford and i could not be kept side by side upon the same shelf like tartrates of sodium and antimony for purposes of identification in order to understand the allusion i concluded airily it may be necessary for you to keep an eye on the proceedings of the druggists national convention the lady turned to her companion and grasped his arm what is it doctor volney oh what is it she moaned go to your room for a while i heard him say i will remain and talk with him his mind no i think not only a portion of the brain yes i am sure he will recover go to your room and leave me with him the lady disappeared the man in dark clothes also went outside still manicuring himself in a thoughtful way i think he waited in the hall i would like to talk with you a while mr pinkhammer if i may said the gentleman who remained very well if you care to i replied and will excuse me if i take it comfortably i am rather tired i stretched myself upon a couch by a window and lit a cigar he drew a chair nearby let us speak to the point he said soothingly your name is not pinkhammer i know that as well as you do i said coolly but a man must have a name of some sort i can assure you that i do not extravagantly admire the name of pinkhammer but when one christens one s self suddenly the fine names do not seem to suggest themselves but suppose it had been scheringhausen or scroggins i think i did very well with pinkhammer your name said the other man seriously is elwyn c bellford you are one of the first lawyers in denver you are suffering from an attack of aphasia which has caused you to forget your identity the cause of it was over application to your profession and perhaps a life too bare of natural recreation and pleasures the lady who has just left the room is your wife she is what i would call a fine looking woman i said after a judicial pause i particularly admire the shade of brown in her hair she is a wife to be proud of since your disappearance nearly two weeks ago she has scarcely closed her eyes we learned that you were in new york through a telegram sent by isidore newman a traveling man from denver he said that he had met you in a hotel here and that you did not recognize him i think i remember the occasion i said the fellow called me bellford if i am not mistaken but don t you think it about time now for you to introduce yourself i am robert volney doctor volney i have been your close friend for twenty years and your physician for fifteen i came with mrs bellford to trace you as soon as we got the telegram try elwyn old man try to remember what s the use to try i asked with a little frown you say you are a physician is aphasia curable when a man loses his memory does it return slowly or suddenly sometimes gradually and imperfectly sometimes as suddenly as it went will you undertake the treatment of my case doctor volney i asked old friend said he i ll do everything in my power and wil have done everything that science can do to cure you very well said i then you will consider that i am your patient everything is in confidence now professional confidence of course said doctor volney i got up from the couch some one had set a vase of white roses on the centre table a cluster of white roses freshly sprinkled and fragrant i threw them far out of the window and then laid myself upon the couch again it will be best bobby i said to have this cure happen suddenly i m rather tired of it all anyway you may go now and bring marian in but oh doc i said with a sigh as i kicked him on the shin good old doc it was glorious a municipal report the cities are full of pride challenging each to each this from her mountainside that from her burthened beach r kipling fancy a novel about chicago or buffalo let us say or nashville tennessee there are justthree big cities in the united states that are story cities new york of course new orleans and best of the lot san francisco frank norris east is east and west is san francisco according to californians californians are a race of people they are not merely inhabitants of a state they are the southerners of the west now chicagoans are no less loyal to their city but when you ask them why they stammer and speak of lake fish and the new odd fellows building but californians go into detail of course they have in the climate an argument that is good for half an hour while you are thinking of your coal bills and heavy underwear but as soon as they come to mistake your silence for conviction madness comes upon them and they picture the city of the golden gate as the bagdad of the new world so far as a matter of opinion no refutation is necessary but dear cousins all from adam and eve descended it is a rash one who will lay his finger on the map and say in this town there can be no romance what could happen here yes it is a bold and a rash deed to challenge in one sentence history romance and rand and mcnally nashville a city port of delivery and the capital of the state of tennessee is on the cumberland river and on the n c st l and the l n railroads this city is regarded as the most important educational centre in the south i stepped off the train at p m having searched the thesaurus in vain for adjectives i must as a substitution hie me to comparison in the form of a recipe take a london fog parts malaria parts gas leaks parts dewdrops gathered in a brick yard at sunrise parts odor of honeysuckle parts mix the mixture will give you an approximate conception of a nashville drizzle it is not so fragrant as a moth ball nor as thick as pea soup but tis enough twill serve i went to a hotel in a tumbril it required strong self suppression for me to keep from climbing to the top of it and giving an imitation of sidney carton the vehicle was drawn by beasts of a bygone era and driven by something dark and emancipated i was sleepy and tired so when i got to the hotel i hurriedly paid it the fifty cents it demanded with approximate lagniappe i assure you i knew its habits and i did not want to hear it prate about its old marster or anything that happened befo de wah the hotel was one of the kind described as renovated that means worth of new marble pillars tiling electric lights and brass cuspidors in the lobby and a new l n time table and a lithograph of lookout mountain in each one of the great rooms above the management was without reproach the attention full of exquisite southern courtesy the service as slow as the progress of a snail and as good humored as rip van winkle the food was worth traveling a thousand miles for there is no other hotel in the world where you can get such chicken livers en brochette at dinner i asked a negro waiter if there was anything doing in town he pondered gravely for a minute and then replied well boss i don t really reckon there s anything at all doin after sundown sundown had been accomplished it had been drowned in the drizzle long before so that spectacle was denied me but i went forth upon the streets in the drizzle to see what might be there it is built on undulating grounds and the streets are lighted by electricity at a cost of per annum as i left the hotel there was a race riot down upon me charged a company of freedmen or arabs or zulus armed with no i saw with relief that they were not rifles but whips and i saw dimly a caravan of black clumsy vehicles and at the reassuring shouts kyar you anywhere in the town boss fuh fifty cents i reasoned that i was merely a fare instead of a victim i walked through long streets all leading uphill i wondered how those streets ever came down again perhaps they didn t until they were graded on a few of the main streets i saw lights in stores here and there saw street cars go by conveying worthy burghers hither and yon saw people pass engaged in the art of conversation and heard a burst of semi lively laughter issuing from a soda water and ice cream parlor the streets other than main seemed to have enticed upon their borders houses consecrated to peace and domesticity in many of them lights shone behind discreetly drawn window shades in a few pianos tinkled orderly and irreproachable music there was indeed little doing i wished i had come before sundown so i returned to my hotel in november the confederate general hood advanced against nashville where he shut up a national force under general thomas the latter then sallied forth and defeated the confederates in a terrible conflict all my life i have heard of admired and witnessed the fine marksmanship of the south in its peaceful conflicts in the tobacco chewing regions but in my hotel a surprise awaited me there were twelve bright new imposing capacious brass cuspidors in the great lobby tall enough to be called urns and so wide mouthed that the crack pitcher of a lady baseball team should have been able to throw a ball into one of them at five paces distant but although a terrible battle had raged and was still raging the enemy had not suffered bright new imposing capacious untouched they stood but shades of jefferson brick the tile floor the beautiful tile floor i could not avoid thinking of the battle of nashville and trying to draw as is my foolish habit some deductions about hereditary marksmanship here i first saw major by misplaced courtesy wentworth caswell i knew him for a type the moment my eyes suffered from the sight of him a rat has no geographical habitat my old friend a tennyson said as he so well said almost everything prophet curse me the blabbing lip and curse me the british vermin the rat let us regard the word british as interchangeable ad lib a rat is a rat this man was hunting about the hotel lobby like a starved dog that had forgotten where he had buried a bone he had a face of great acreage red pulpy and with a kind of sleepy massiveness like that of buddha he possessed one single virtue he was very smoothly shaven the mark of the beast is not indelible upon a man until he goes about with a stubble i think that if he had not used his razor that day i would have repulsed his advances and the criminal calendar of the world would have been spared the addition of one murder i happened to be standing within five feet of a cuspidor when major caswell opened fire upon it i had been observant enough to percieve that the attacking force was using gatlings instead of squirrel rifles so i side stepped so promptly that the major seized the opportunity to apologize to a noncombatant he had the blabbing lip in four minutes he had become my friend and had dragged me to the bar i desire to interpolate here that i am a southerner but i am not one by profession or trade i eschew the string tie the slouch hat the prince albert the number of bales of cotton destroyed by sherman and plug chewing when the orchestra plays dixie i do not cheer i slide a little lower on the leather cornered seat and well order another w urzburger and wish that longstreet had but what s the use major caswell banged the bar with his fist and the first gun at fort sumter re echoed when he fired the last one at appomattox i began to hope but then he began on family trees and demonstrated that adam was only a third cousin of a collateral branch of the caswell family genealogy disposed of he took up to my distaste his private family matters he spoke of his wife traced her descent back to eve and profanely denied any possible rumor that she may have had relations in the land of nod by this time i was beginning to suspect that he was trying to obscure by noise the fact that he had ordered the drinks on the chance that i would be bewildered into paying for them but when they were down he crashed a silver dollar loudly upon the bar then of course another serving was obligatory and when i had paid for that i took leave of him brusquely for i wanted no more of him but before i had obtained my release he had prated loudly of an income that his wife received and showed a handful of silver money when i got my key at the desk the clerk said to me courteously if that man caswell has annoyed you and if you would like to make a complaint we will have him ejected he is a nuisance a loafer and without any known means of support although he seems to have some money most the time but we don t seem to be able to hit upon any means of throwing him out legally why no said i after some reflection i don t see my way clear to making a complaint but i would like to place myself on record as asserting that i do not care for his company your town i continued seems to be a quiet one what manner of entertainment adventure or excitement have you to offer to the stranger within your gates well sir said the clerk there will be a show here next thursday it is i ll look it up and have the announcement sent up to your room with the ice water good night after i went up to my room i looked out the window it was only about ten o clock but i looked upon a silent town the drizzle continued spangled with dim lights as far apart as currants in a cake sold at the ladies exchange a quiet place i said to myself as my first shoe struck the ceiling of the occupant of the room beneath mine nothing of the life here that gives color and variety to the cities in the east and west just a good ordinary humdrum business town nashville occupies a foremost place among the manufacturing centres of the country it is the fifth boot and shoe market in the united states the largest candy and cracker manufacturing city in the south and does an enormous wholesale drygoods grocery and drug business i must tell you how i came to be in nashville and i assure you the digression brings as much tedium to me as it does to you i was traveling elsewhere on my own business but i had a commission from a northern literary magazine to stop over there and establish a personal connection between the publication and one of its contributors azalea adair adair there was no clue to the personality except the handwriting had sent in some essays lost art and poems that had made the editors swear approvingly over their one o clock luncheon so they had commissioned me to round up said adair and corner by contract his or her output at two cents a word before some other publisher offered her ten or twenty at nine o clock the next morning after my chicken livers en brochette try them if you can find that hotel i strayed out into the drizzle which was still on for an unlimited run at the first corner i came upon uncle caesar he was a stalwart negro older than the pyramids with gray wool and a face that reminded me of brutus and a second afterwards of the late king cettiwayo he wore the most remarkable coat that i ever had seen or expect to see it reached to his ankles an had once been a confederate gray in colors but rain and sun and age had so variegated it that joseph s coat beside it would have faded to a pale monochrome i must linger with that coat for it has to do with the story the story that is so long in coming because you can hardly expect anything to happen in nashville once it must have been the military coat of an officer the cape of it had vanished but all adown its front it had been frogged and tasseled magnificently but now the frogs and tassles were gone in their stead had been patiently stitched i surmised by some surviving black mammy new frogs made of cunningly twisted common hempen twine this twine was frayed and disheveled it must have been added to the coat as a substitute for vanished splendors with tasteless but painstaking devotion for it followed faithfully the curves of the long missing frogs and to complete the comedy and pathos of the garment all its buttons were gone save one the second button from the top alone remained the coat was fastened by other twine strings tied through the buttonholes and other holes rudely pierced in the opposite side there was never such a weird garment so fantastically bedecked and of so many mottled hues the lone button was the size of a half dollar made of yellow horn and sewed on with coarse twine this negro stood by a carriage so old that ham himself might have started a hack line with it after he left the ark with the two animals hitched to it as i approached he threw open the door drew out a feather duster waved it without using it and said in deep rumbling tones step right in suh ain t a speck of dust in it jus got back from a funeral suh i inferred that on such gala occasions carriages were given an extra cleaning i looked up and down the street and perceived that there was little choice among the vehicles for hire that lined the curb i looked in my memorandum book for the address of azalea adair i want to go to jessamine street i said and was about to step into the hack but for an instant the thick long gorilla like arm of the old negro barred me on his massive and saturnine face a look of sudden suspicion and enmity flashed for a moment then with quickly returning conviction he asked blandishingly what are you gwine there for boss what is it to you i asked a little sharply nothin suh jus nothin only it s a lonesome kind of part of town and few folks ever has business out there step right in the seats is clean jes got back from a funeral suh a mile and a half it must have been to our journey s end i could hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving i could smell nothing but the drizzle now further flavored with coal smoke and something like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms all i could see through the streaming windows were two rows of dim houses the city has an area of square miles miles of streets of which miles are paved a system of waterworks that cost with miles of mains eight sixty one jessamine street was a decayed mansion thirty yards back from the street it stood outmerged in a splendid grove of trees and untrimmed shrubbery a row of box bushes overflowed and almost hid the paling fence from sight the gate was kept closed by a rope noose that encircled the gate post and the first paling of the gate but when you got inside you saw that was a shell a shadow a ghost of former grandeur and excellence but in the story i have not yet got inside when the hack had ceased from rattling and the weary quadrupeds came to a rest i handed my jehu his fifty cents with an additional quarter feeling a glow of conscious generosity as i did so he refused it it s two dollars suh he said how s that i asked i plainly heard you call out at the hotel fifty cents to any part of the town it s two dollars suh he repeated obstinately it s a long ways from the hotel it is within the city limits and well within them i argued don t think that you have picked up a greenhorn yankee do you see those hills over there i went on pointing toward the east i could not see them myself for the drizzle well i was born and raised on their other side you old fool nigger can t you tell people from other people when you see em the grim face of king cettiwayo softened is you from the south suh i reckon it was them shoes of yourn fooled me they is somethin sharp in the toes for a southern gen lman to wear then the charge is fifty cents i suppose said i inexorably his former expression a mingling of cupidity and hostility returned remained ten seconds and vanished boss he said fifty cents is right but i needs two dollars suh i m obleeged to have two dollars i ain t demandin it now suh after i know whar you s from i m jus sayin that i has to have two dollars to night and business mighty po peace and confidence settled upon his heavy features he had been luckier than he had hoped instead of having picked up a greenhorn ignorant of rates he had come upon an inheritance you confounded old rascal i said reaching down to my pocket you ought to be turned over to the police for the first time i saw him smile he knew he knew he knew i gave him two one dollar bills as i handed them over i noticed that one of them had seen parlous times its upper right hand corner was missing and it had been torn through the middle but joined again a strip of blue tissue paper pasted over the split preserved its negotiability enough of the african bandit for the present i left him happy lifted the rope and opened a creaky gate the house as i said was a shell a paint brush had not touched it in twenty years i could not see why a strong wind should not have bowled it over like a house of cards until i looked again at the trees that hugged it close the trees that saw the battle of nashville and still drew their protecting branches around it against storm and enemy and cold azalea adair fifty years old white haired a descendant of the cavaliers as thin and frail as the house she lived in robed in the cheapest and cleanest dress i ever saw with an air as simple as a queen s received me the reception room seemed a mile square because there was nothing in it except some rows of books on unpainted white pine bookshelves a cracked marble top table a rag rug a hairless horsehair sofa and two or three chairs yes there was a picture on the wall a colored crayon drawing of a cluster of pansies i looked around for the portrait of andrew jackson and the pinecone hanging basket but they were not there azalea adair and i had conversation a little of which will be repeated to you she was a product of the old south gently nurtured in the sheltered life her learning was not broad but was deep and of splendid originality in its somewhat narrow scope she had been educated at home and her knowledge of the world was derived from inference and by inspiration of such is the precious small group of essayists made whle she talked to me i kept brushing my fingers trying unconsciously to rid them guiltily of the absent dust from the half calf backs of lamb chaucer hazlitt marcus aurelius montaigne and hood she was exquisite she was a valuable discovery nearly everybody nowadays knows too much oh so much too much of real life i could perceive clearly that azalea adair was very poor a house and a dress she had not much else i fancied so divided between my duty to the magazine and my loyalty to the poets and essayists who fought thomas in the valley of the cumberland i listened to her voice which was like a harpsichord s and found that i could not speak of contracts in the presence of the nine muses and the three graces one hesitated to lower the topic to two cents there would have to be another colloquy after i had regained my commercialism but i spoke of my mission and three o clock of the next afternoon was set for the discussion of the business proposition your town i said as i began to make ready to depart which is the time for smooth generalities seems to be a quiet sedate place a home town i should say where few things out of the ordinary ever happen it carries on an extensive trade in stoves and hollow ware with the west and south and its flouring mills have a daily capacity of more than barrels azalea adair seemed to reflect i have never thought of it that way she said with a kind of sincere intensity that seemed to belong to her isn t it in the still quiet places that things do happen i fancy that when god began to create the earth on the first monday morning one could have leaned out one s window and heard the drops of mud splashing from his trowel as he built up the everlasting hills what did the noisiest project in the world i mean the building of the tower of bable result in finally a page and a half of esperanto in the north american review of course said i platitudinously human nature is the same everywhere but there is more color er more drama and movement and er romance in some cities than in others on the surface said azalea adair i have traveled many times around the world in a golden airship wafted on two wings print and dreams i have seen on one of my imaginary tours the sultan of turkey bowstring with his own hands one of his wives who had uncovered her face in public i have seen a man in nashville tear up his theatre tickets because his wife was going out with her face covered with rice powder in san francisco s chinatown i saw the slave girl sing yee dipped slowly inch by inch in boiling almond oil to make her swear she would never see her american lover again she gave in when the boiling oil had reached three inches above her knee at a euchre party in east nashville the other night i saw kitty morgan cut dead by seven of her schoolmates and lifelong friends because she had married a house painter the boiling oil was sizzling as high as her heart but i wish you could have seen the fine little smile that she carried from table to table oh yes it is a humdrum town just a few miles of red brick houses and mud and lumber yards some one knocked hollowly at the back of the house azalea adair breathed a soft apology and went to investigate the sound she came back in three minutes with brightened eyes a faint flush on her cheeks and ten years lifted from her shoulders you must have a cup of tea before you go she said and a sugar cake she reached and shook a little iron bell in shuffled a small negro girl about twelve barefoot not very tidy glowering at me with thumb in mouth and bulging eyes azlea adair opened a tiny worn purse and drew out a dollar bill a dollar bill with the upper right hand corner missing torn in two pieces and pasted together again with a strip of blue tissue paper it was one of the bills i had given the piratical negro there was no doubt about it go up to mr baker s store on the corner impy she said handing the girl the dollar bill and get a quarter of a pound of tea the kind he always sends me and ten cents worth of sugar cakes now hurry the supply of tea in the house happens to be exhausted she explained to me impy left by the back way before the scrape of her hard bare feet had died away on the back porch a wild shriek i was sure it was hers filled the hollow house then the deep gruff tones of an angry man s voice mingled with the girl s further squeals and unintelligible words azalea adair rose without surprise or emotion and disappeared for two minutes i heard the hoarse rumble of the man s voice then someting like an oath and a slight scuffle and she returned calmly to her chair this is a roomy house she said and i have a tenant for part of it i am sorry to have to rescind my invitation to tea it was impossible to get the kind i always use at the store perhaps to morrow mr baker will be able to supply me i was sure that impy had not had time to leave the house i inquired concerning street car lines and took my leave after i was well on my way i remembered that i had not learned azalea adair s name but to morrow would do that same day i started in on the course of iniquity that this uneventful city forced upon me i was in the town only two days but in that time i managed to lie shamelessly by telegraph and to be an accomplice after the fact if that is the correct legal term to a murder as i rounded the corner nearest my hotel the afrite coachman of the ploychromatic nonpareil coat seized me swung open the dungeony door of his peripatetic sarcophagus flirted his feather duster and began his ritual step right in boss carriage is clean jus got back from a funeral fifty cents to any and then he knew me and grinned broadly scuse me boss you is de gen l man what rid out with me dis mawnin thank you kindly suh i am going out to again to morrow afternoon at three said i and if you will be here i ll let you drive me so you know miss adair i concluded thinking of my dollar bill i belonged to her father judge adair suh he replied i judge that she is pretty poor i said she hasn t much money to speak of has she for an instant i looked again at the fierce countenance of king cettiwayo and then he changed back to an extortionate old negro hack driver she ain t gwine to starve suh he said slowly she has reso ces suh she has reso ces i shall pay you fifty cents for the trip said i dat is puffeckly correct suh he answered humbly i jus had to have dat two dollars dis mawnin boss i went to the hotel and lied by electricity i wired the magazine a adair holds out for eight cents a word the answer that came back was give it to her quick you duffer just before dinner major wentworth caswell bore down upon me with the greetings of a long lost friend i have seen few men whom i have so instantaneously hated and of whom it was so difficult to be rid i was standing at the bar when he invaded me therefore i could not wave the white ribbon in his face i would have paid gladly for the drinks hoping thereby to escape another but he was one of those despicable roaring advertising bibbers who must have brass bands and fireworks attend upon every cent that they waste in their follies with an air of producing millions he drew two one dollar bills from a pocket and dashed one of them upon the bar i looked once more at the dollar bill with the upper right hand corner missing torn through the middle and patched with a strip of blue tissue paper it was my dollar bill again it could have been no other i went up to my room the drizzle and the monotony of a dreary eventless southern town had made me tired and listless i remember that just before i went to bed i mentally disposed of the mysterious dollar bill which might have formed the clew to a tremendously fine detective story of san francisco by saying to myself sleepily seems as if a lot of people here own stock in the hack driver s trust pays dividends promptly too wonder if then i fell asleep king cettiwayo was at his post the next day and rattled my bones over the stones out to he was to wait and rattle me back again when i was ready azalea adair looked paler and cleaner and frailer than she had looked on the day before after she had signed the contract at eight cents per word she grew still paler and began to slip out of her chair whitout much trouble i managed to get her up on the antediluvian horsehair sofa and then i ran out to the sidewalk and yelled to the coffee colored pirate to bring a doctor with a wisdom that i had not expected in him he abandoned his team and struck off up the street afoot realizing the value of speed in ten minutes he returned with a grave gray haired and capable man of medicine in a few words worth much less than eight cents each i explained to him my presence in the hollow house of mystery he bowed with stately understanding and turned to the old negro uncle caesar he said calmly run up to my house and ask miss lucy to give you a cream pitcher full of fresh milk and half a tumbler of port wine and hurry back don t drive run i want you to get back sometime this week it occurred to me that dr merriman also felt a distrust as to the speeding powers of the land pirate s steeds after uncle caesar was gone lumberingly but swiftly up the street the doctor looked me over with great politeness and as much careful calculation until he had decided that i might do it is only a case of insufficient nutrition he said in other words the result of poverty pride and starvation mrs caswell has many devoted friends who would be glad to aid her but she will accept nothing except from that old negro uncle caesar who was once owned by her family mrs caswell said i in surprise and then i looked at the contract and saw that she had signed it azalea adair caswell i thought she was miss adair i said married to a drunken worthless loafer sir said the doctor it is said that he robs her even of the small sums that her old servant contributes toward her support when the milk and wine had been brought the doctor soon revived azalea adair she sat up and talked of the beauty of the autumn leaves that were then in season and their height of color she referred lightly to her fainting seizure as the outcome of an old palpitation of the heart impy fanned her as she lay on the sofa the doctor was due elsewhere and i followed him to the door i told him that it was within my power and intentions to make a reasonable advance of money to azalea adair on future contributions to the magazine and he seemed pleased by the way he said perhaps you would like to know that you have had royalty for a coachman old caesar s grandfather was a king in congo caesar himself has royal ways as you may have observed as the doctor was moving off i heard uncle caesar s voice inside did he get bofe of dem two dollars from you mis zalea yes caesar i heard azalea adair answer weakly and then i went in and concluded business negotiations with our contributor i assumed the responsibility of advancing fifty dollars putting it as a necessary formality in binding our bargain and then uncle caesar drove me back to the hotel here ends all of the story as far as i can testify as a witness the rest must be only bare statements of facts at about six o clock i went out for a stroll uncle caesar was at his corner he threw open the door of his carriage flourished his duster and began his depressing formula step right in suh fifty cents to anywhere in the city hack s puffickly clean suh jus got back from a funeral and then he recognized me i think his eyesight was getting bad his coat had taken on a few more faded shades of color the twine strings were more frayed and ragged the last remaining button the button of yellow horn was gone a motley descendant of kings was uncle caesar about two hours later i saw an excited crowd besieging the front of a drug store in a desert where nothing happens this was manna so i edged my way inside on an extemporized couch of empty boxes and chairs was stretched the mortal corporeality of major wentworth caswell a doctor was testing him for the immortal ingredient his decision was that it was conspicuous by its absence the erstwhile major had been found dead on a dark street and brought by curious and ennuied citizens to the drug store the late human being had been engaged in terrific battle the details showed that loafer and reprobate though he had been he had been also a warrior but he had lost his hands were yet clinched so tightly that his fingers would not be opened the gentle citizens who had know him stood about and searched their vocabularies to find some good words if it were possible to speak of him one kind looking man said after much thought when cas was about fo teen he was one of the best spellers in school while i stood there the fingers of the right hand of the man that was which hung down the side of a white pine box relaxed and dropped something at my feet i covered it with one foot quietly and a little later on i picked it up and pocketed it i reasoned that in his last struggle his hand must have seized that object unwittingly and held it in a death grip at the hotel that night the main topic of conversation with the possible exceptions of politics and prohibition was the demise of major caswell i heard one man say to a group of listeners in my opinion gentlemen caswell was murdered by somme of these no account niggers for his money he had fifty dollars this afternoon which he showed to several gentlemen in the hotel when he was found the money was not on his person i left the city the next morning at nine and as the train was crossing the bridge over the cumberland river i took out of my pocket a yellow horn overcoat button the size of a fifty cent piece with frayed ends of coarse twine hanging from it and cast it out of the window into the slow muddy waters below i wonder what s doing in buffalo psyche and the pskyscraper if you are a philosopher you can do this thing you can go to the top of a high building look down upon your fellow men feet below and despise them as insects like the irresponsible black waterbugs on summer ponds they crawl and circle and hustle about idiotically without aim or purpose they do not even move with the admirable intelligence of ants for ants always know when they are going home the ant is of a lowly station but he will often reach home and get his slippers on while you are left at your elevated station man then to the housetopped philosopher appears to be but a creeping contemptible beetle brokers poets millionaires bootblacks beauties hod carriers and politicians become little black specks dodging bigger black specks in streets no wider than your thumb from this high view the city itself becomes degraded to an unintelligible mass of distorted buildings and impossible perspectives the revered ocean is a duck pond the earth itself a lost golf ball all the minutiae of life are gone the philosopher gazes into the infinite heavens above him and allows his soul to expand to the influence of his new view he feels that he is the heir to eternity and the child of time space too should be his by the right of his immortal heritage and he thrills at the thought that some day his kind shall traverse theose mysterious aerial roads between planet and planet the tiny world beneath his feet upon which this towering structure of steel rests as a speck of dust upon a himalayan mountain it is but one of a countless number of such whirling atoms what are the ambitions the achievements the paltry conquests and loves of those restless black insects below compared with the serene and awful immensity of the universe that lies above and around their insignificant city it is guaranteed that the philosopher will have these thoughts they have been expressly compiled from the philosophies of the world and set down with the proper interrogation point at the end of them to represent the invariable musings of deep thinkers on high places and when the philosopher takes the elevator down his mind is broader his heart is at peace and his conception of the cosmogony of creation is as wide as the buckle of orion s summer belt but if your name happened to be daisy and you worked in an eighth avenue candy store and lived in a little cold hall bedroom five feet by eight and earned per week and ate ten cent lunches and were nineteen years old and got up at and worked till and never had studied philosophy maybe things wouldn t look that way to you from the top of a skyscraper two sighed for the hand of daisy the unphilosophical one was joe who kept the smallest store in new york it was about the size of a tool box of the d p w and was stuck like a swallow s nest against a corner of a down town skyscraper its stock consisted of fruit candies newspapers song books cigarettes and lemonade in season when stern winter shook his congealed locks and joe had to move himself and the fruit inside there was exactly room in the store for the proprietor his wares a stove the size of a vinegar cruet and one customer joe was not of the nation that keeps us forever in a furore with fugues and fruit he was a capable american youth who was laying by money and wanted daisy to help him spend it three times he had asked her i got money saved up daisy was his love song and you know how bad i want you that store of mine ain t very big but oh ain t it would be the antiphony of the unphilosophical one why i heard wanamaker s was trying to get you to sublet part of your floor space to them for next year daisy passed joe s corner every morning and evening hello two by four was her usual greeting seems to me your store looks emptier you must have sold a pack of chewing gum ain t much room in here sure joe would answer with his slow grin except for you daise me and the store are waitin for you whenever you ll take us don t you think you might before long store a fine scorn was expressed by daisy s uptilted nose sardine box waitin for me you say gee you d have to throw out about a hundred pounds of candy before i could get inside of it joe i wouldn t mind an even swap like that said joe complimentary daisy s existence was limited in every way she had to walk sideways between the counter and the shelves in the candy store in her own hall bedroom coziness had been carried close to cohesiveness the walls were so near to one another that the paper on them made a perfect babel of noise she could light the gas with one hand and close the door with the other without taking her eyes off the reflection of her brown pompadour in the mirror she had joe s picture in a gilt frame on the dresser and sometimes but her next thought would always be of joe s funny little store tacked like a soap box to the corner of that great building and away would go her sentiment in a breeze of laughter daisy s other suitor followed joe by several months he came to board in the house where she lived his name was dabster and he was a philosopher though young attainments stood out upon him like continental labels on a passaic n j suit case knowledge he had kidnapped from cyclopedias and handbooks of useful information but as for wisdom when she passed he was left sniffling in the road without so much as the number of her motor car he could and would tell you the proportion of water and muscle making properties of peas and veal the shortest verse in the bible the number of pounds of shingle nails required to fasten shingles laid four inches to the weather the population of kankakee ill the theories of spinoza the name of mr h mckay twombly s second hall footman the length of the hoosac tunnel the best time to set a hen the salary of the railway post office messenger between driftwood and red bank furnace pa and the number of bones in the foreleg of a cat the weight of learning was no handicap to dabster his statistics were the sprigs of parsley with which he garnished the feast of small talk that he would set before you if he conceived that to be your taste and again he used them as breastworks in foraging at the boardinghouse firing at you a volley of figures concerning the weight of a lineal foot of bar iron x inches and the average annual rainfall at fort snelling minn he would transfix with his fork the best piece of chicken on the dish while you were trying to rally sufficiently to ask him weakly why does a hen cross the road thus brightly armed and further equipped with a measure of good looks of a hair oily shopping district at three in the afternoon kind it seems that joe of the lilliputian emporium had a rival worthy of his steel but joe carried no steel there wouldn t have been room in his store to draw it if he had one saturday afternoon about four o clock daisy and mr dabster stopped before joe s booth dabster wore a silk hat and well daisy was a woman and that hat had no chance to get back in its box until joe had seen it a stick of pineapple chewing gum was the ostensible object of the call joe supplied it through the open side of his store he did not pale or falter at sight of the hat mr dabster s going to take me on top of the building to observe the view said daisy after she had introduced her admirers i never was on a skyscraper i guess it must be awfully nice and funny up there h m said joe the panorama said mr dabster exposed to the gaze from the top of a lofty building is not only sublime but instructive miss daisy has a decided pleasure in store for her it s windy up there too as well as here said joe are you dressed warm enough daise sure thing i m all lined said daisy smiling slyly at his clouded brow you look just like a mummy in a case joe ain t you just put in an invoice of a pint of peanuts or another apple your stock looks awful over stocked daisy giggled at her favorite joke and joe had to smile with her your quarters are somewhat limited mr er er remarked dabster in comparison with the size of this building i understand the area of its side to be about by feet that would make you occupy a proportionate space as if half of beloochistan were placed upon a territory as large as the united states east of the rocky mountains with the province of ontario and belgium added is that so sport said joe genially you are weisenheimer on figures all right how many square pounds of baled hay do you think a jackass could eat if he stopped brayin long enough to keep still a minute and five eighths a few minutes later daisy and mr dabster stepped from an elevator to the top floor of the skyscraper then up a short steep stairway and out upon the roof dabster led her to the parapet so she could look down at the black dots moving in the street below what are they she asked trembling she had never before been on a height like this before and then dabster must needs play the philosopher on the tower and conduct her soul forth to meet the immensity of space bipeds he said solemnly see what they become even at the small elevation of feet mere crawling insects going to and fro at random oh they ain t anything of the kind exclaimed daisy suddenly they re folks i saw an automobile oh gee are we that high up walk over this way said dabster he showed her the great city lying like an orderly array of toys far below starred here and there early as it was by the first beacon lights of the winter afternoon and then the bay and sea to the south and east vanishing mysteriously into the sky i don t like it declared daisy with troubled blue eyes say we go down but the philosopher was not to be denied his opportunity he would let her behold the grandeur of his mind the half nelson he had on the infinite and the memory he had for statistics and then she would nevermore be content to buy chewing gum aat the smallest store in new york and so he began to prate of the smallness of human affairs and how that even so slight a removal from earth made man and his works look like one tenth part of a dollar thrice computed and that one should consider the sidereal system and the maxims of epictetus and be comforted you don t carry me with you said daisy say i think it s awful to be up so high that folks look like fleas one of them we saw might have been joe why jiminy we might as well be in new jersey say i m afraid up here the philosopher smiled fatuously the earth said he is itself only as a grain of wheat in space look up there daisy gazed upward apprehensively the short day was spent and the stars were coming out above yonder star said dabster is venus the evening star she is miles from the sun fudge said daisy with a brief flash of spirit where do you think i come from brooklyn susie price in our store her brother sent her a ticket to go to san francisco that s only three thousand miles the philosopher smiled indulgently our world he said is miles from the sun there are eighteen stars of the first magnitude that are times further from us than the sun is if one of them should be extinguished it would be three years before we would see its light go out there are six thousand stars of the sixth magnitude it takes thirty six years for the light of one of them to reach the earth with an eighteen foot telescope we can see stars including those of the thirteenth magnitude whose light takes years to reach us each of these stars you re lyin cried daisy angrily you re tryin to scare me and you have i want to go down she stamped her foot arcturus began the philosopher soothingly but he was interrupted by a demonstration out of the vastness of the nature that he was endeavoring to portray with his memory instead of his heart for to the heart expounder of nature the stars were set in the firmament expressly to give soft light to lovers wandering happily beneath them and if you stand tiptoe some september night with your sweetheart on your arm you can almost touch them with your hand three years for their light to reach us indeed out of the west leaped a meteor lighting the roof of the skyscraper almost to midday its fiery parabola was limned against the sky toward the east it hissed as it went and daisy screamed take me down she cried vehemently you you mental arithmetic dabster got her to the elevator and inside of it she was wild eyed and she shuddered when the express made its debilitating drop outside the revolving door of the skyscraper the philosopher lost her she vanished and he stood bewildered without figures or statistics to aid him joe had a lull in trade and by squirming among his stock succeeded in lighting a cigarette and getting one cold foot against the attenuated stove the door was burst open and daisy laughing crying scattering fruit and candies tumbled into his arms oh joe i ve been up on the skyscraper ain t it cozy and warm and homelike in here i m ready for you joe whenever you want me a bird of bagdad without a doubt much of the spirit and genius of the caliph harun al rashid descended to the margrave august michael von paulsen quigg quigg s restaurant is in fourth avenue that street that the city seems to have forgotten in its growth fourth avenue born and bred in the bowery staggers northward full of good resolutions where it crosses fourteenth street it struts for a brief moment proudly in the glare of the museums and cheap theatres it may yet become a fit mate for its high born sister boulevard to the west or its roaring polyglot broad waisted cousin to the east it passes union square and here the hoofs of the dray horses seem to thunder in unison recalling the tread of marching hosts hooray but now come the silent and terrible mountains buildings square as forts high as the clouds shutting out the sky where thousands of slaves bend over desks all day on the ground floors are only little fruit shops and laundries and book shops where you see copies of littell s living age and g w m reynold s novels in the windows and next poor fourth avenue the street glides into a mediaeval solitude on each side are shops devoted to antiques let us say it is night men in rusty armor stand in the windows and menace the hurrying cars with raised rusty iron gauntlets hauberks and helms blunderbusses cromwellian breastplates matchlocks creeses and the swords and daggers of an army of dead and gone gallants gleam dully in the ghostly light here and there from a corner saloon lit with jack o lanterns or phosphorus stagger forth shuddering home bound citizens nerved by the tankards within to their fearsome journey adown that eldrich avenue lined with the bloodstained weapons of the fighting dead what street could live inclosed by these mortuary relics and trod by these spectral citizens in whose sunken hearts scarce one good whoop or tra la la remained not fourth avenue not after the tinsel but enlivening glories of the little rialto not after the echoing drum beats of union square there need be no tears ladies and gentlemen tis but the suicide of a street with a shriek and a crash fourth avenue dives headlong into the tunnel at thirty fourth

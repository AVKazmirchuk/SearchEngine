are but two subjects upon which one may discourse with a free imagination and without the possibility of being controverted you may talk of your dreams and you may tell what you heard a parrot say both morpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses and your listener dare not attack your recital the baseless fabric of a vision then shall furnish my theme chosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more limited field of pretty polly s small talk i had a dream that was so far removed from the higher criticism that it had to do with the ancient respectable and lamented bar of judgment theory gabriel had played his trump and those of us who could not follow suit were arraigned for examination i noticed at one side a gathering of professional bondsmen in solemn black and collars that buttoned behind but it seemed there was some trouble about their real estate titles and they did not appear to be getting any of us out a fly cop an angel policeman flew over to me and took me by the left wing near at hand was a group of very prosperous looking spirits arraigned for judgment do you belong with that bunch the policeman asked who are they was my answer why said he they are but this irrelevant stuff is taking up space that the story should occupy dulcie worked in a department store she sold hamburg edging or stuffed peppers or automobiles or other little trinkets such as they keep in department stores of what she earned dulcie received six dollars per week the remainder was credited to her and debited to somebody else s account in the ledger kept by g oh primal energy you say reverend doctor well then in the ledger of primal energy during her first year in the store dulcie was paid five dollars per week it would be instructive to know how she lived on that amount don t care very well probably you are interested in larger amounts six dollars is a larger amount i will tell you how she lived on six dollars per week one afternoon at six when dulcie was sticking her hat pin within an eighth of an inch of her medulla oblongata she said to her chum sadie the girl that waits on you with her left side say sade i made a date for dinner this evening with piggy you never did exclaimed sadie admiringly well ain t you the lucky one piggy s an awful swell and he always takes a girl to swell places he took blanche up to the hoffman house one evening where they have swell music and you see a lot of swells you ll have a swell time dulce dulcie hurried homeward her eyes were shining and her cheeks showed the delicate pink of life s real life s approaching dawn it was friday and she had fifty cents left of her last week s wages the streets were filled with the rush hour floods of people the electric lights of broadway were glowing calling moths from miles from leagues from hundreds of leagues out of darkness around to come in and attend the singeing school men in accurate clothes with faces like those carved on cherry stones by the old salts in sailors homes turned and stared at dulcie as she sped unheeding past them manhattan the night blooming cereus was beginning to unfold its dead white heavy odoured petals dulcie stopped in a store where goods were cheap and bought an imitation lace collar with her fifty cents that money was to have been spent otherwise fifteen cents for supper ten cents for breakfast ten cents for lunch another dime was to be added to her small store of savings and five cents was to be squandered for licorice drops the kind that made your cheek look like the toothache and last as long the licorice was an extravagance almost a carouse but what is life without pleasures dulcie lived in a furnished room there is this difference between a furnished room and a boardinghouse in a furnished room other people do not know it when you go hungry dulcie went up to her room the third floor back in a west side brownstone front she lit the gas scientists tell us that the diamond is the hardest substance known their mistake landladies know of a compound beside which the diamond is as putty they pack it in the tips of gas burners and one may stand on a chair and dig at it in vain until one s fingers are pink and bruised a hairpin will not remove it therefore let us call it immovable so dulcie lit the gas in its one fourth candlepower glow we will observe the room couch bed dresser table washstand chair of this much the landlady was guilty the rest was dulcie s on the dresser were her treasures a gilt china vase presented to her by sadie a calendar issued by a pickle works a book on the divination of dreams some rice powder in a glass dish and a cluster of artificial cherries tied with a pink ribbon against the wrinkly mirror stood pictures of general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini against one wall was a plaster of paris plaque of an o callahan in a roman helmet near it was a violent oleograph of a lemon coloured child assaulting an inflammatory butterfly this was dulcie s final judgment in art but it had never been upset her rest had never been disturbed by whispers of stolen copes no critic had elevated his eyebrows at her infantile entomologist piggy was to call for her at seven while she swiftly makes ready let us discreetly face the other way and gossip for the room dulcie paid two dollars per week on week days her breakfast cost ten cents she made coffee and cooked an egg over the gaslight while she was dressing on sunday mornings she feasted royally on veal chops and pineapple fritters at billy s restaurant at a cost of twenty five cents and tipped the waitress ten cents new york presents so many temptations for one to run into extravagance she had her lunches in the department store restaurant at a cost of sixty cents for the week dinners were the evening papers show me a new yorker going without his daily paper came to six cents and two sunday papers one for the personal column and the other to read were ten cents the total amounts to now one has to buy clothes and i give it up i hear of wonderful bargains in fabrics and of miracles performed with needle and thread but i am in doubt i hold my pen poised in vain when i would add to dulcie s life some of those joys that belong to woman by virtue of all the unwritten sacred natural inactive ordinances of the equity of heaven twice she had been to coney island and had ridden the hobby horses tis a weary thing to count your pleasures by summers instead of by hours piggy needs but a word when the girls named him an undeserving stigma was cast upon the noble family of swine the words of three letters lesson in the old blue spelling book begins with piggy s biography he was fat he had the soul of a rat the habits of a bat and the magnanimity of a cat he wore expensive clothes and was a connoisseur in starvation he could look at a shop girl and tell you to an hour how long it had been since she had eaten anything more nourishing than marshmallows and tea he hung about the shopping districts and prowled around in department stores with his invitations to dinner men who escort dogs upon the streets at the end of a string look down upon him he is a type i can dwell upon him no longer my pen is not the kind intended for him i am no carpenter at ten minutes to seven dulcie was ready she looked at herself in the wrinkly mirror the reflection was satisfactory the dark blue dress fitting without a wrinkle the hat with its jaunty black feather the but slightly soiled gloves all representing self denial even of food itself were vastly becoming dulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was beautiful and that life was about to lift a corner of its mysterious veil for her to observe its wonders no gentleman had ever asked her out before now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and exalted show the girls said that piggy was a spender there would be a grand dinner and music and splendidly dressed ladies to look at and things to eat that strangely twisted the girls jaws when they tried to tell about them no doubt she would be asked out again there was a blue pongee suit in a window that she knew by saving twenty cents a week instead of ten in let s see oh it would run into years but there was a second hand store in seventh avenue where somebody knocked at the door dulcie opened it the landlady stood there with a spurious smile sniffing for cooking by stolen gas a gentleman s downstairs to see you she said name is mr wiggins by such epithet was piggy known to unfortunate ones who had to take him seriously dulcie turned to the dresser to get her handkerchief and then she stopped still and bit her underlip hard while looking in her mirror she had seen fairyland and herself a princess just awakening from a long slumber she had forgotten one that was watching her with sad beautiful stern eyes the only one there was to approve or condemn what she did straight and slender and tall with a look of sorrowful reproach on his handsome melancholy face general kitchener fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the dresser dulcie turned like an automatic doll to the landlady tell him i can t go she said dully tell him i m sick or something tell him i m not going out after the door was closed and locked dulcie fell upon her bed crushing her black tip and cried for ten minutes general kitchener was her only friend he was dulcie s ideal of a gallant knight he looked as if he might have a secret sorrow and his wonderful moustache was a dream and she was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes she used to have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime and ask for her with his sword clanking against his high boots once when a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a lamp post she had opened the window and looked out but there was no use she knew that general kitchener was away over in japan leading his army against the savage turks and he would never step out of his gilt frame for her yet one look from him had vanquished piggy that night yes for that night when her cry was over dulcie got up and took off her best dress and put on her old blue kimono she wanted no dinner she sang two verses of sammy then she became intensely interested in a little red speck on the side of her nose and after that was attended to she drew up a chair to the rickety table and told her fortune with an old deck of cards the horrid impudent thing she said aloud and i never gave him a word or a look to make him think it at nine o clock dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of raspberry jam out of her trunk and had a feast she offered general kitchener some jam on a cracker but he only looked at her as the sphinx would have looked at a butterfly if there are butterflies in the desert don t eat it if you don t want to said dulcie and don t put on so many airs and scold so with your eyes i wonder if you d he so superior and snippy if you had to live on six dollars a week it was not a good sign for dulcie to be rude to general kitchener and then she turned benvenuto cellini face downward with a severe gesture but that was not inexcusable for she had always thought he was henry viii and she did not approve of him at half past nine dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the dresser turned out the light and skipped into bed it s an awful thing to go to bed with a good night look at general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini this story really doesn t get anywhere at all the rest of it comes later sometime when piggy asks dulcie again to dine with him and she is feeling lonelier than usual and general kitchener happens to be looking the other way and then as i said before i dreamed that i was standing near a crowd of prosperous looking angels and a policeman took me by the wing and asked if i belonged with them who are they i asked why said he they are the men who hired working girls and paid em five or six dollars a week to live on are you one of the bunch not on your immortality said i i m only the fellow that set fire to an orphan asylum and murdered a blind man for his pennies the caliph cupid and the clock prince michael of the electorate of valleluna sat on his favourite bench in the park the coolness of the september night quickened the life in him like a rare tonic wine the benches were not filled for park loungers with their stagnant blood are prompt to detect and fly home from the crispness of early autumn the moon was just clearing the roofs of the range of dwellings that bounded the quadrangle on the east children laughed and played about the fine sprayed fountain in the shadowed spots fauns and hamadryads wooed unconscious of the gaze of mortal eyes a hand organ philomel by the grace of our stage carpenter fancy fluted and droned in a side street around the enchanted boundaries of the little park street cars spat and mewed and the stilted trains roared like tigers and lions prowling for a place to enter and above the trees shone the great round shining face of an illuminated clock in the tower of an antique public building prince michael s shoes were wrecked far beyond the skill of the carefullest cobbler the ragman would have declined any negotiations concerning his clothes the two weeks stubble on his face was grey and brown and red and greenish yellow as if it had been made up from individual contributions from the chorus of a musical comedy no man existed who had money enough to wear so bad a hat as his prince michael sat on his favourite bench and smiled it was a diverting thought to him that he was wealthy enough to buy every one of those close ranged bulky window lit mansions that faced him if he chose he could have matched gold equipages jewels art treasures estates and acres with any croesus in this proud city of manhattan and scarcely have entered upon the bulk of his holdings he could have sat at table with reigning sovereigns the social world the world of art the fellowship of the elect adulation imitation the homage of the fairest honours from the highest praise from the wisest flattery esteem credit pleasure fame all the honey of life was waiting in the comb in the hive of the world for prince michael of the electorate of valleluna whenever he might choose to take it but his choice was to sit in rags and dinginess on a bench in a park for he had tasted of the fruit of the tree of life and finding it bitter in his mouth had stepped out of eden for a time to seek distraction close to the unarmoured beating heart of the world these thoughts strayed dreamily through the mind of prince michael as he smiled under the stubble of his polychromatic beard lounging thus clad as the poorest of mendicants in the parks he loved to study humanity he found in altruism more pleasure than his riches his station and all the grosser sweets of life had given him it was his chief solace and satisfaction to alleviate individual distress to confer favours upon worthy ones who had need of succour to dazzle unfortunates by unexpected and bewildering gifts of truly royal magnificence bestowed however with wisdom and judiciousness and as prince michael s eye rested upon the glowing face of the great clock in the tower his smile altruistic as it was became slightly tinged with contempt big thoughts were the prince s and it was always with a shake of his head that he considered the subjugation of the world to the arbitrary measures of time the comings and goings of people in hurry and dread controlled by the little metal moving hands of a clock always made him sad by and by came a young man in evening clothes and sat upon the third bench from the prince for half an hour he smoked cigars with nervous haste and then he fell to watching the face of the illuminated clock above the trees his perturbation was evident and the prince noted in sorrow that its cause was connected in some manner with the slowly moving hands of the timepiece his highness arose and went to the young man s bench i beg your pardon for addressing you he said but i perceive that you are disturbed in mind if it may serve to mitigate the liberty i have taken i will add that i am prince michael heir to the throne of the electorate of valleluna i appear incognito of course as you may gather from my appearance it is a fancy of mine to render aid to others whom i think worthy of it perhaps the matter that seems to distress you is one that would more readily yield to our mutual efforts the young man looked up brightly at the prince brightly but the perpendicular line of perplexity between his brows was not smoothed away he laughed and even then it did not but he accepted the momentary diversion glad to meet you prince he said good humouredly yes i d say you were incog all right thanks for your offer of assistance but i don t see where your butting in would help things any it s a kind of private affair you know but thanks all the same prince michael sat at the young man s side he was often rebuffed but never offensively his courteous manner and words forbade that clocks said the prince are shackles on the feet of mankind i have observed you looking persistently at that clock its face is that of a tyrant its numbers are false as those on a lottery ticket its hands are those of a bunco steerer who makes an appointment with you to your ruin let me entreat you to throw off its humiliating bonds and to cease to order your affairs by that insensate monitor of brass and steel i don t usually said the young man i carry a watch except when i ve got my radiant rags on i know human nature as i do the trees and grass said the prince with earnest dignity i am a master of philosophy a graduate in art and i hold the purse of a fortunatus there are few mortal misfortunes that i cannot alleviate or overcome i have read your countenance and found in it honesty and nobility as well as distress i beg of you to accept my advice or aid do not belie the intelligence i see in your face by judging from my appearance of my ability to defeat your troubles the young man glanced at the clock again and frowned darkly when his gaze strayed from the glowing horologue of time it rested intently upon a four story red brick house in the row of dwellings opposite to where he sat the shades were drawn and the lights in many rooms shone dimly through them ten minutes to nine exclaimed the young man with an impatient gesture of despair he turned his back upon the house and took a rapid step or two in a contrary direction remain commanded prince michael in so potent a voice that the disturbed one wheeled around with a somewhat chagrined laugh i ll give her the ten minutes and then i m off he muttered and then aloud to the prince i ll join you in confounding all clocks my friend and throw in women too sit down said the prince calmly i do not accept your addition women are the natural enemies of clocks and therefore the allies of those who would seek liberation from these monsters that measure our follies and limit our pleasures if you will so far confide in me i would ask you to relate to me your story the young man threw himself upon the bench with a reckless laugh your royal highness i will he said in tones of mock deference do you see yonder house the one with three upper windows lighted well at o clock i stood in that house with the young lady i am that is i was engaged to i had been doing wrong my dear prince i had been a naughty boy and she had heard of it i wanted to be forgiven of course we are always wanting women to forgive us aren t we prince i want time to think it over said she there is one thing certain i will either fully forgive you or i will never see your face again there will be no half way business at half past eight she said at exactly half past eight you may be watching the middle upper window of the top floor if i decide to forgive i will hang out of that window a white silk scarf you will know by that that all is as was before and you may come to me if you see no scarf you may consider that everything between us is ended forever that concluded the young man bitterly is why i have been watching that clock the time for the signal to appear has passed twenty three minutes ago do you wonder that i am a little disturbed my prince of rags and whiskers let me repeat to you said prince michael in his even well modulated tones that women are the natural enemies of clocks clocks are an evil women a blessing the signal may yet appear never on your principality exclaimed the young man hopelessly you don t know marian of course she s always on time to the minute that was the first thing about her that attracted me i ve got the mitten instead of the scarf i ought to have known at that my goose was cooked i ll go west on the to night with jack milburn the jig s up i ll try jack s ranch awhile and top off with the klondike and whiskey good night er er prince prince michael smiled his enigmatic gentle comprehending smile and caught the coat sleeve of the other the brilliant light in the prince s eyes was softening to a dreamier cloudy translucence wait he said solemnly till the clock strikes i have wealth and power and knowledge above most men but when the clock strikes i am afraid stay by me until then this woman shall be yours you have the word of the hereditary prince of valleluna on the day of your marriage i will give you and a palace on the hudson but there must be no clocks in that palace they measure our follies and limit our pleasures do you agree to that of course said the young man cheerfully they re a nuisance anyway always ticking and striking and getting you late for dinner he glanced again at the clock in the tower the hands stood at three minutes to nine i think said prince michael that i will sleep a little the day has been fatiguing he stretched himself upon a bench with the manner of one who had slept thus before you will find me in this park on any evening when the weather is suitable said the prince sleepily come to me when your marriage day is set and i will give you a cheque for the money thanks your highness said the young man seriously it doesn t look as if i would need that palace on the hudson but i appreciate your offer just the same prince michael sank into deep slumber his battered hat rolled from the bench to the ground the young man lifted it placed it over the frowsy face and moved one of the grotesquely relaxed limbs into a more comfortable position poor devil he said as he drew the tattered clothes closer about the prince s breast sonorous and startling came the stroke of from the clock tower the young man sighed again turned his face for one last look at the house of his relinquished hopes and cried aloud profane words of holy rapture from the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving snowy fluttering wonderful divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy by came a citizen rotund comfortable home hurrying unknowing of the delights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly lit parks will you oblige me with the time sir asked the young man and the citizen shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe dragged it out and announced twenty nine and a half minutes past eight sir and then from habit he glanced at the clock in the tower and made further oration by george that clock s half an hour fast first time in ten years i ve known it to be off this watch of mine never varies a but the citizen was talking to vacancy he turned and saw his hearer a fast receding black shadow flying in the direction of a house with three lighted upper windows and in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats they owned the park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that sprawled asleep on a bench they stopped and gazed upon it it s dopy mike said one he hits the pipe every night park bum for twenty years on his last legs i guess the other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp in the hand of the sleeper gee he remarked he s doped out a fifty dollar bill anyway wish i knew the brand of hop that he smokes and then rap rap rap went the club of realism against the shoe soles of prince michael of the electorate of valleluna sisters of the golden circle the rubberneck auto was about ready to start the merry top riders had been assigned to their seats by the gentlemanly conductor the sidewalk was blockaded with sightseers who had gathered to stare at sightseers justifying the natural law that every creature on earth is preyed upon by some other creature the megaphone man raised his instrument of torture the inside of the great automobile began to thump and throb like the heart of a coffee drinker the top riders nervously clung to the seats the old lady from valparaiso indiana shrieked to be put ashore but before a wheel turns listen to a brief preamble through the cardiaphone which shall point out to you an object of interest on life s sightseeing tour swift and comprehensive is the recognition of white man for white man in african wilds instant and sure is the spiritual greeting between mother and babe unhesitatingly do master and dog commune across the slight gulf between animal and man immeasurably quick and sapient are the brief messages between one and one s beloved but all these instances set forth only slow and groping interchange of sympathy and thought beside one other instance which the rubberneck coach shall disclose you shall learn if you have not learned already what two beings of all earth s living inhabitants most quickly look into each other s hearts and souls when they meet face to face the gong whirred and the glaring at gotham car moved majestically upon its instructive tour on the highest rear seat was james williams of cloverdale missouri and his bride capitalise it friend typo that last word word of words in the epiphany of life and love the scent of the flowers the booty of the bee the primal drip of spring waters the overture of the lark the twist of lemon peel on the cocktail of creation such is the bride holy is the wife revered the mother galliptious is the summer girl but the bride is the certified check among the wedding presents that the gods send in when man is married to mortality the car glided up the golden way on the bridge of the great cruiser the captain stood trumpeting the sights of the big city to his passengers wide mouthed and open eared they heard the sights of the metropolis thundered forth to their eyes confused delirious with excitement and provincial longings they tried to make ocular responses to the megaphonic ritual in the solemn spires of spreading cathedrals they saw the home of the vanderbilts in the busy bulk of the grand central depot they viewed wonderingly the frugal cot of russell sage bidden to observe the highlands of the hudson they gaped unsuspecting at the upturned mountains of a new laid sewer to many the elevated railroad was the rialto on the stations of which uniformed men sat and made chop suey of your tickets and to this day in the outlying districts many have it that chuck connors with his hand on his heart leads reform and that but for the noble municipal efforts of one parkhurst a district attorney the notorious bishop potter gang would have destroyed law and order from the bowery to the harlem river but i beg you to observe mrs james williams hattie chalmers that was once the belle of cloverdale pale blue is the bride s if she will and this colour she had honoured willingly had the moss rosebud loaned to her cheeks of its pink and as for the violet her eyes will do very well as they are thank you a useless strip of white chaf oh no he was guiding the auto car of white chiffon or perhaps it was grenadine or tulle was tied beneath her chin pretending to hold her bonnet in place but you know as well as i do that the hatpins did the work and on mrs james williams s face was recorded a little library of the world s best thoughts in three volumes volume no contained the belief that james williams was about the right sort of thing volume no was an essay on the world declaring it to be a very excellent place volume no disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest seat in a rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes all understanding james williams you would have guessed was about twenty four it will gratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate he was exactly twenty three years eleven months and twenty nine days old he was well built active strong jawed good natured and rising he was on his wedding trip dear kind fairy please cut out those orders for money and h p touring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of the boat club instead of any of them turn backward oh turn backward and give us just a teeny weeny bit of our wedding trip over again just an hour dear fairy so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees looked and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin even if it was the hatpins that did the work can t do it very well hurry up with that touring car and the oil stock then just in front of mrs james williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses only in dreams and milliners shops do we alas gather grapes and roses at one swipe this girl gazed with large blue eyes credulous when the megaphone man roared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should be concerned between blasts she resorted to epictetian philosophy in the form of pepsin chewing gum at this girl s right hand sat a young man about twenty four he was well built active strong jawed and good natured but if his description seems to follow that of james williams divest it of anything cloverdalian this man belonged to hard streets and sharp corners he looked keenly about him seeming to begrudge the asphalt under the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch while the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry let me whisper you through the low tuned cardiaphone to sit tight for now things are about to happen and the great city will close over them again as over a scrap of ticker tape floating down from the den of a broad street bear the girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the last seat the other passengers she had absorbed the seat behind her was her bluebeard s chamber her eyes met those of mrs james williams between two ticks of a watch they exchanged their life s experiences histories hopes and fancies and all mind you with the eye before two men could have decided whether to draw steel or borrow a match the bride leaned forward low she and the girl spoke rapidly together their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents a comparison that is not meant to go further two smiles and a dozen nods closed the conference and now in the broad quiet avenue in front of the rubberneck car a man in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand from the sidewalk another hurried to join him the girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm and whispered in his ear that young man exhibited proof of ability to act promptly crouching low he slid over the edge of the car hung lightly for an instant and then disappeared half a dozen of the top riders observed his feat wonderingly but made no comment deeming it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional manner of alighting in this bewildering city the truant passenger dodged a hansom and then floated past like a leaf on a stream between a furniture van and a florist s delivery wagon the girl in the tan jacket turned again and looked in the eyes of mrs james williams then she faced about and sat still while the rubberneck auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the plainclothes man what s eatin you demanded the megaphonist abandoning his professional discourse for pure english keep her at anchor for a minute ordered the officer there s a man on board we want a philadelphia burglar called pinky mcguire there he is on the back seat look out for the side donovan donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at james williams come down old sport he said pleasantly we ve got you back to sleepytown for yours it ain t a bad idea hidin on a rubberneck though i ll remember that softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor better step off sir and explain the car must proceed on its tour james williams belonged among the level heads with necessary slowness he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front of the car his wife followed but she first turned her eyes and saw the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind a tree on the edge of the little park not fifty feet away descended to the ground james williams faced his captors with a smile he was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in cloverdale about having been mistaken for a burglar the rubberneck coach lingered out of respect for its patrons what could be a more interesting sight than this my name is james williams of cloverdale missouri he said kindly so that they would not be too greatly mortified i have letters here that will show you ll come with us please announced the plainclothes man pinky mcguire s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds a detective saw you on the rubberneck up at central park and phoned down to take you in do your explaining at the station house james williams s wife his bride of two weeks looked him in the face with a strange soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks looked him in the face and said go with em quietly pinky and maybe it ll be in your favour and then as the glaring at gotham car rolled away she turned and threw a kiss his wife threw a kiss at some one high up on the seats of the rubberneck your girl gives you good advice mcguire said donovan come on now and then madness descended upon and occupied james williams he pushed his hat far upon the back of his head my wife seems to think i am a burglar he said recklessly i never heard of her being crazy therefore i must be and if i m crazy they can t do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops had to be whistled for and afterwards the reserves to disperse a few thousand delighted spectators at the station house the desk sergeant asked for his name mcdoodle the pink or pinky the brute i forget which was james williams s answer but you can bet i m a burglar don t leave that out and you might add that it took five of em to pluck the pink i d especially like to have that in the records in an hour came mrs james williams with uncle thomas of madison avenue in a respect compelling motor car and proofs of the hero s innocence for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an automobile mfg co after the police had sternly reprimanded james williams for imitating a copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the department was capable of mrs williams rearrested him and swept him into an angle of the station house james williams regarded her with one eye he always said that donovan closed the other while somebody was holding his good right hand never before had he given her a word of reproach or of reproof if you can explain he began rather stiffly why you dear she interrupted listen it was an hour s pain and trial to you i did it for her i mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach i was so happy jim so happy with you that i didn t dare to refuse that happiness to another jim they were married only this morning those two and i wanted him to get away while they were struggling with you i saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park that s all of it dear i had to do it thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one by rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings but bride knoweth bride at the glance of an eye and between them swiftly passes comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of the romance of a busy broker pitcher confidential clerk in the office of harvey maxwell broker allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half past nine in company with his young lady stenographer with a snappy good morning pitcher maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were intending to leap over it and then plunged into the great heap of letters and telegrams waiting there for him the young lady had been maxwell s stenographer for a year she was beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic she forewent the pomp of the alluring pompadour she wore no chains bracelets or lockets she had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to luncheon her dress was grey and plain but it fitted her figure with fidelity and discretion in her neat black turban hat was the gold green wing of a macaw on this morning she was softly and shyly radiant her eyes were dreamily bright her cheeks genuine peachblow her expression a happy one tinged with reminiscence pitcher still mildly curious noticed a difference in her ways this morning instead of going straight into the adjoining room where her desk was she lingered slightly irresolute in the outer office once she moved over by maxwell s desk near enough for him to be aware of her presence the machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man it was a busy new york broker moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs well what is it anything asked maxwell sharply his opened mail lay like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk his keen grey eye impersonal and brusque flashed upon her half impatiently nothing answered the stenographer moving away with a little smile mr pitcher she said to the confidential clerk did mr maxwell say anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer he did answered pitcher he told me to get another one i notified the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning it s o clock and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple chewing gum has showed up yet i will do the work as usual then said the young lady until some one comes to fill the place and she went to her desk at once and hung the black turban hat with the gold green macaw wing in its accustomed place he who has been denied the spectacle of a busy manhattan broker during a rush of business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology the poet sings of the crowded hour of glorious life the broker s hour is not only crowded but the minutes and seconds are hanging to all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms and this day was harvey maxwell s busy day the ticker began to reel out jerkily its fitful coils of tape the desk telephone had a chronic attack of buzzing men began to throng into the office and call at him over the railing jovially sharply viciously excitedly messenger boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams the clerks in the office jumped about like sailors during a storm even pitcher s face relaxed into something resembling animation on the exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and glaciers and volcanoes and those elemental disturbances were reproduced in miniature in the broker s offices maxwell shoved his chair against the wall and transacted business after the manner of a toe dancer he jumped from ticker to phone from desk to door with the trained agility of a harlequin in the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became suddenly aware of a high rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding canopy of velvet and ostrich tips an imitation sealskin sacque and a string of beads as large as hickory nuts ending near the floor with a silver heart there was a self possessed young lady connected with these accessories and pitcher was there to construe her lady from the stenographer s agency to see about the position said pitcher maxwell turned half around with his hands full of papers and ticker tape what position he asked with a frown position of stenographer said pitcher you told me yesterday to call them up and have one sent over this morning you are losing your mind pitcher said maxwell why should i have given you any such instructions miss leslie has given perfect satisfaction during the year she has been here the place is hers as long as she chooses to retain it there s no place open here madam countermand that order with the agency pitcher and don t bring any more of em in here the silver heart left the office swinging and banging itself independently against the office furniture as it indignantly departed pitcher seized a moment to remark to the bookkeeper that the old man seemed to get more absent minded and forgetful every day of the world the rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster on the floor they were pounding half a dozen stocks in which maxwell s customers were heavy investors orders to buy and sell were coming and going as swift as the flight of swallows some of his own holdings were imperilled and the man was working like some high geared delicate strong machine strung to full tension going at full speed accurate never hesitating with the proper word and decision and act ready and prompt as clockwork stocks and bonds loans and mortgages margins and securities here was a world of finance and there was no room in it for the human world or the world of nature when the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the uproar maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and memoranda with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging in disorderly strings over his forehead his window was open for the beloved janitress spring had turned on a little warmth through the waking registers of the earth and through the window came a wandering perhaps a lost odour a delicate sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment immovable for this odour belonged to miss leslie it was her own and hers only the odour brought her vividly almost tangibly before him the world of finance dwindled suddenly to a speck and she was in the next room twenty steps away by george i ll do it now said maxwell half aloud i ll ask her now i wonder i didn t do it long ago he dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to cover he charged upon the desk of the stenographer she looked up at him with a smile a soft pink crept over her cheek and her eyes were kind and frank maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk he still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was above his ear miss leslie he began hurriedly i have but a moment to spare i want to say something in that moment will you he my wife i haven t had time to make love to you in the ordinary way but i really do love you talk quick please those fellows are clubbing the stuffing out of union pacific oh what are you talking about exclaimed the young lady she rose to her feet and gazed upon him round eyed don t you understand said maxwell restively i want you to marry me i love you miss leslie i wanted to tell you and i snatched a minute when things had slackened up a bit they re calling me for the phone now tell em to wait a minute pitcher won t you miss leslie the stenographer acted very queerly at first she seemed overcome with amazement then tears flowed from her wondering eyes and then she smiled sunnily through them and one of her arms slid tenderly about the broker s neck i know now she said softly it s this old business that has driven everything else out of your head for the time i was frightened at first don t you remember harvey we were married last evening at o clock in the little church around the corner after twenty years the policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively the impressiveness was habitual and not for show for spectators were few the time was barely o clock at night but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh depeopled the streets trying doors as he went twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare the officer with his stalwart form and slight swagger made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace the vicinity was one that kept early hours now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all night lunch counter but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed when about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk in the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned with an unlighted cigar in his mouth as the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly it s all right officer he said reassuringly i m just waiting for a friend it s an appointment made twenty years ago sounds a little funny to you doesn t it well i ll explain if you d like to make certain it s all straight about that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands big joe brady s restaurant until five years ago said the policeman it was torn down then the man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar the light showed a pale square jawed face with keen eyes and a little white scar near his right eyebrow his scarfpin was a large diamond oddly set twenty years ago to night said the man i dined here at big joe brady s with jimmy wells my best chum and the finest chap in the world he and i were raised here in new york just like two brothers together i was eighteen and jimmy was twenty the next morning i was to start for the west to make my fortune you couldn t have dragged jimmy out of new york he thought it was the only place on earth well we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come we figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made whatever they were going to be it sounds pretty interesting said the policeman rather a long time between meets though it seems to me haven t you heard from your friend since you left well yes for a time we corresponded said the other but after a year or two we lost track of each other you see the west is a pretty big proposition and i kept hustling around over it pretty lively but i know jimmy will meet me here if he s alive for he always was the truest stanchest old chap in the world he ll never forget i came a thousand miles to stand in this door to night and it s worth it if my old partner turns up the waiting man pulled out a handsome watch the lids of it set with small diamonds three minutes to ten he announced it was exactly ten o clock when we parted here at the restaurant door did pretty well out west didn t you asked the policeman you bet i hope jimmy has done half as well he was a kind of plodder though good fellow as he was i ve had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile a man gets in a groove in new york it takes the west to put a razor edge on him the policeman twirled his club and took a step or two i ll be on my way hope your friend comes around all right going to call time on him sharp i should say not said the other i ll give him half an hour at least if jimmy is alive on earth he ll be here by that time so long officer good night sir said the policeman passing on along his beat trying doors as he went there was now a fine cold drizzle falling and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow the few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands and in the door of the hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment uncertain almost to absurdity with the friend of his youth smoked his cigar and waited about twenty minutes he waited and then a tall man in a long overcoat with collar turned up to his ears hurried across from the opposite side of the street he went directly to the waiting man is that you bob he asked doubtfully is that you jimmy wells cried the man in the door bless my heart exclaimed the new arrival grasping both the other s hands with his own it s bob sure as fate i was certain i d find you here if you were still in existence well well well twenty years is a long time the old gone bob i wish it had lasted so we could have had another dinner there how has the west treated you old man bully it has given me everything i asked it for you ve changed lots jimmy i never thought you were so tall by two or three inches oh i grew a bit after i was twenty doing well in new york jimmy moderately i have a position in one of the city departments come on bob we ll go around to a place i know of and have a good long talk about old times the two men started up the street arm in arm the man from the west his egotism enlarged by success was beginning to outline the history of his career the other submerged in his overcoat listened with interest at the corner stood a drug store brilliant with electric lights when they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other s face the man from the west stopped suddenly and released his arm you re not jimmy wells he snapped twenty years is a long time but not long enough to change a man s nose from a roman to a pug it sometimes changes a good man into a bad one said the tall man you ve been under arrest for ten minutes silky bob chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you going quietly are you that s sensible now before we go on to the station here s a note i was asked to hand you you may read it here at the window it s from patrolman wells the man from the west unfolded the little piece of paper handed him his hand was steady when he began to read but it trembled a little by the time he had finished the note was rather short bob i was at the appointed place on time when you struck the match to light your cigar i saw it was the face of the man wanted in chicago somehow i couldn t do it myself so i went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job jimmy lost on dress parade mr towers chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom one iron was heating on a small gas stove the other was being pushed vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be seen later on extending in straight lines from mr chandler s patent leather shoes to the edge of his low cut vest so much of the hero s toilet may be intrusted to our confidence the remainder may be guessed by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient our next view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging house immaculately and correctly clothed calm assured handsome in appearance the typical new york young clubman setting out slightly bored to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening chandler s honorarium was per week he was employed in the office of an architect he was twenty two years old he considered architecture to be truly an art and he honestly believed though he would not have dared to admit it in new york that the flatiron building was inferior to design to the great cathedral in milan out of each week s earnings chandler set aside at the end of each ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated he purchased one gentleman s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old father time he arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents he took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest and there dined with taste and luxury with ten dollars a man may for a few hours play the wealthy idler to perfection the sum is ample for a well considered meal a bottle bearing a respectable label commensurate tips a smoke cab fare and the ordinary etceteras this one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to chandler a source of renascent bliss to the society bud comes but one debut it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened but to chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen as thrilling as new as the first had been to sit among bon vivants under palms in the swirl of concealed music to look upon the habitues of such a paradise and to be looked upon by them what is a girl s first dance and short sleeved tulle compared with this up broadway chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade for this evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer for the next sixty nine evenings he would be dining in cheviot

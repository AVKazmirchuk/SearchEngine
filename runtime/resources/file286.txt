t give a pipeful of rabbit tobacco whether queen sophia christina or charlie culberson rules these fairy isles and i don t want my name on any list except the list of survivors but i ve noticed you sam says i seeking the bubble notoriety in the cannon s larynx a number of times now what do you do it for is it ambition business or some freckle faced pheebe at home that you are heroing for well ben says sam kind of hefting his sword out from between his knees as your superior officer i could court martial you for attempted cowardice and desertion but i won t and i ll tell you why i m trying for promotion and the usual honors of war and conquest a major gets more pay than a captain and i need the money correct for you says i i can understand that your system of fame seeking is rooted in the deepest soil of patriotism but i can t comprehend says i why willie robbins whose folks at home are well off and who used to be as meek and undesirous of notice as a cat with cream on his whiskers should all at once develop into a warrior bold with the most fire eating kind of proclivities and the girl in his case seems to have been eliminated by marriage to another fellow i reckon says i it s a plain case of just common ambition he wants his name maybe to go thundering down the coroners of time it must be that well without itemizing his deeds willie sure made good as a hero he simply spent most of his time on his knees begging our captain to send him on forlorn hopes and dangerous scouting expeditions in every fight he was the first man to mix it at close quarters with the don alfonsos he got three or four bullets planted in various parts of his autonomy once he went off with a detail of eight men and captured a whole company of spanish he kept captain floyd busy writing out recommendations of his bravery to send in to head quarters and he began to accumulate medals for all kinds of things heroism and target shooting and valor and tactics and uninsubordination and all the little accomplishments that look good to the third assistant secretaries of the war department finally cap floyd got promoted to be a major general or a knight commander of the main herd or something like that he pounded around on a white horse all desecrated up with gold leaf and hen feathers and a good templar s hat and wasn t allowed by the regulations to speak to us and willie robbins was made captain of our company and maybe he didn t go after the wreath of fame then as far as i could see it was him that ended the war he got eighteen of us boys friends of his too killed in battles that he stirred up himself and that didn t seem to me necessary at all one night he took twelve of us and waded through a little nil about a hundred and ninety yards wide and climbed a couple of mountains and sneaked through a mile of neglected shrubbery and a couple of rock quarries and into a rye straw village and captured a spanish general named as they said benny veedus benny seemed to me hardly worth the trouble being a blackish man without shoes or cuffs and anxious to surrender and throw himself on the commissary of his foe but that job gave willie the big boost he wanted the san augustine news and the galveston st louis new york and kansas city papers printed his picture and columns of stuff about him old san augustine simply went crazy over its gallant son the news had an editorial tearfully begging the government to call off the regular army and the national guard and let willie carry on the rest of the war single handed it said that a refusal to do so would be regarded as a proof that the northern jealousy of the south was still as rampant as ever if the war hadn t ended pretty soon i don t know to what heights of gold braid and encomiums willie would have climbed but it did there was a secession of hostilities just three days after he was appointed a colonel and got in three more medals by registered mail and shot two spaniards while they were drinking lemonade in an ambuscade our company went back to san augustine when the war was over there wasn t anywhere else for it to go and what do you think the old town notified us in print by wire cable special delivery and a nigger named saul sent on a gray mule to san antone that they was going to give us the biggest blow out complimentary alimentary and elementary that ever disturbed the kildees on the sand flats outside of the immediate contiguity of the city i say we but it was all meant for ex private captain de facto and colonel elect willie robbins the town was crazy about him they notified us that the reception they were going to put up would make the mardi gras in new orleans look like an afternoon tea in bury st edmunds with a curate s aunt well the san augustine rifles got back home on schedule time everybody was at the depot giving forth roosevelt democrat they used to be called rebel yells there was two brass bands and the mayor and schoolgirls in white frightening the street car horses by throwing cherokee roses in the streets and well maybe you ve seen a celebration by a town that was inland and out of water they wanted brevet colonel willie to get into a carriage and be drawn by prominent citizens and some of the city

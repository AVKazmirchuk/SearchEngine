finger bowls the name of the other waitress was tildy why do you suggest matilda please listen this time tildy tildy tildy was dumpy plain faced and too anxious to please to please repeat the last clause to yourself once or twice and make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite the voice at bogle s was invisible it came from the kitchen and did not shine in the way of originality it was a heathen voice and contented itself with vain repetitions of exclamations emitted by the waitresses concerning food will it tire you to be told again that aileen was beautiful had she donned a few hundred dollars worth of clothes and joined the easter parade and had you seen her you would have hastened to say so yourself the customers at bogle s were her slaves six tables full she could wait upon at once they who were in a hurry restrained their impatience for the joy of merely gazing upon her swiftly moving graceful figure they who had finished eating ate more that they might continue in the light of her smiles every man there and they were mostly men tried to make his impression upon her aileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once and every smile that she sent forth lodged like pellets from a scatter gun in as many hearts and all this while she would be performing astounding feats with orders of pork and beans pot roasts ham and sausage and the wheats and any quantity of things on the iron and in the pan and straight up and on the side with all this feasting and flirting and merry exchange of wit bogle s came mighty near being a salon with aileen for its madame recamier if the transients were entranced by the fascinating aileen the regulars were her adorers there was much rivalry among many of the steady customers aileen could have had an engagement every evening at least twice a week some one took her to a theatre or to a dance one stout gentleman whom she and tildy had privately christened the hog presented her with a turquoise ring another one known as fresby who rode on the traction company s repair wagon was going to give her a poodle as soon as his brother got the hauling contract in the ninth and the man who always ate spareribs and spinach and said he was a stock broker asked her to go to parsifal with him i don t know where this place is said aileen while talking it over with tildy but the wedding ring s got to be on before i put a stitch into a travelling dress ain t that right well i guess but tildy in steaming chattering cabbage scented bogle s there was almost a heart tragedy tildy with the blunt nose the hay coloured hair the freckled skin the bag o meal figure had never had an admirer not a man followed her with his eyes when she went to and fro in the restaurant save now and then when they glared with the beast hunger for food none of them bantered her gaily to coquettish interchanges of wit none of them loudly jollied her of mornings as they did aileen accusing her when the eggs were slow in coming of late hours in the company of envied swains no one had ever given her a turquoise ring or invited her upon a voyage to mysterious distant parsifal tildy was a good waitress and the men tolerated her they who sat at her tables spoke to her briefly with quotations from the bill of fare and then raised their voices in honeyed and otherwise flavoured accents eloquently addressed to the fair aileen they writhed in their chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of tildy that aileen s pulchritude might season and make ambrosia of their bacon and eggs and tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if aileen could receive the flattery and the homage the blunt nose was loyal to the short grecian she was aileen s friend and she was glad to see her rule hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking pot pie and lemon meringue but deep below our freckles and hay coloured hair the unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a princess not vicarious but coming to us alone there was a morning when aileen tripped in to work with a slightly bruised eye and tildy s solicitude was almost enough to heal any optic fresh guy explained aileen last night as i was going home at twenty third and sixth sashayed up so he did and made a break i turned him down cold and he made a sneak but followed me down to eighteenth and tried his hot air again gee but i slapped him a good one side of the face then he give me that eye does it look real awful til i should hate that mr nicholson should see it when he comes in for his tea and toast at ten tildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration no man had ever tried to follow her she was safe abroad at any hour of the twenty four what bliss it must have been to have had a man follow one and black one s eye for love among the customers at bogle s was a young man named seeders who worked in a laundry office mr seeders was thin and had light hair and appeared to have been recently rough dried and starched he was too diffident to aspire to aileen s notice so he usually sat at one of tildy s tables where he devoted himself to silence and boiled weakfish one day when mr seeders came in to dinner he had been

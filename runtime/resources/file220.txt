says i reckon i d better stay with him for five minutes or so in case the waiter comes in i went out the side door and walked half a block up the street and then i came back and sat down at the table andy says i i can t do it it s too much like swearing off taxes i can t go off with this man s money without doing something to earn it like taking advantage of the bankrupt act or leaving a bottle of eczema lotion in his pocket to make it look more like a square deal well says andy it does seem kind of hard on one s professional pride to lope off with a bearded pard s competency especially after he has nominated you custodian of his bundle in the sappy insouciance of his urban indiscrimination suppose we wake him up and see if we can formulate some commercial sophistry by which he will be enabled to give us both his money and a good excuse we wakes up whiskers he stretches himself and yawns out the hypothesis that he must have dropped off for a minute and then he says he wouldn t mind sitting in at a little gentleman s game of poker he used to play some when he attended high school in brooklyn and as he was out for a good time why and so forth andy brights up a little at that for it looks like it might be a solution to our financial troubles so we all three go to our hotel further down broadway and have the cards and chips brought up to andy s room i tried once more to make this babe in the horticultural gardens take his five thousand but no keep that little roll for me mr peters says he and oblige i ll ask you fer it when i want it i guess i know when i m among friends a man that s done business on beekman street for twenty years right in the heart of the wisest old village on earth ought to know what he s about i guess i can tell a gentleman from a con man or a flimflammer when i meet him i ve got some odd change in my clothes enough to start the game with i guess he goes through his pockets and rains gold certificates on the table till it looked like a autumn day in a lemon grove picture by turner in the salons andy almost smiled the first round that was dealt this boulevardier slaps down his hand claims low and jack and big casino and rakes in the pot andy always took a pride in his poker playing he got up from the table and looked sadly out of the window at the street cars well gentlemen says the cigar man i don t blame you for not wanting to play i ve forgotten the fine points of the game i guess it s been so long since i indulged now how long are you gentlemen going to be in the city i told him about a week longer he says that ll suit him fine his cousin is coming over from brooklyn that evening and they are going to see the sights of new york his cousin he says is in the artificial limb and lead casket business and hasn t crossed the bridge in eight years they expect to have the time of their lives and he winds up by asking me to keep his roll of money for him till next day i tried to make him take it but it only insulted him to mention it i ll use what i ve got in loose change says he you keep the rest for me i ll drop in on you and mr tucker to morrow afternoon about or says he and we ll have dinner together be good after whiskers had gone andy looked at me curious and doubtful well jeff says he it looks like the ravens are trying to feed us two elijahs so hard that if we turned em down again we ought to have the audubon society after us it won t do to put the crown aside too often i know this is something like paternalism but don t you think opportunity has skinned its knuckles about enough knocking at our door i put my feet up on the table and my hands in my pockets which is an attitude unfavorable to frivolous thoughts andy says i this man with the hirsute whiskers has got us in a predicament we can t move hand or foot with his money you and me have got a gentleman s agreement with fortune that we can t break we ve done business in the west where it s more of a fair game out there the people we skin are trying to skin us even the farmers and the remittance men that the magazines send out to write up goldfields but there s little sport in new york city for rod reel or gun they hunt here with either one of two things a slungshot or a letter of introduction the town has been stocked so full of carp that the game fish are all gone if you spread a net here do you catch legitimate suckers in it such as the lord intended to be caught fresh guys who know it all sports with a little coin and the nerve to play another man s game street crowds out for the fun of dropping a dollar or two and village smarties who know just where the little pea is no sir says i what the grafters live on here is widows and orphans and foreigners who save up a bag of money and hand it out over the first counter they see with an iron railing to it and factory girls

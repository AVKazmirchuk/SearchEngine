comes some collars and socks and a half a page of a newspaper clipped out bill reads the clipping careful and holds out his hand to the held up party brother says he greetings accept the apologies of friends i am bill bassett the burglar mr peters you must make the acquaintance of mr alfred e ricks shake hands mr peters says bill stands about halfway between me and you mr ricks in the line of havoc and corruption he always gives something for the money he gets i m glad to meet you mr ricks you and mr peters this is the first time i ever attended a full gathering of the national synod of sharks housebreaking swindling and financiering all represented please examine mr rick s credentials mr peters the piece of newspaper that bill bassett handed me had a good picture of this ricks on it it was a chicago paper and it had obloquies of ricks in every paragraph by reading it over i harvested the intelligence that said alleged ricks had laid off all that portion of the state of florida that lies under water into town lots and sold em to alleged innocent investors from his magnificently furnished offices in chicago after he had taken in a hundred thousand or so dollars one of these fussy purchasers that are always making trouble i ve had em actually try gold watches i ve sold em with acid took a cheap excursion down to the land where it is always just before supper to look at his lot and see if it didn t need a new paling or two on the fence and market a few lemons in time for the christmas present trade he hires a surveyor to find his lot for him they run the line out and find the flourishing town of paradise hollow so advertised to be about rods and poles s degrees e of the middle of lake okeechobee this man s lot was under thirty six feet of water and besides had been preempted so long by the alligators and gars that his title looked fishy naturally the man goes back to chicago and makes it as hot for alfred e ricks as the morning after a prediction of snow by the weather bureau ricks defied the allegation but he couldn t deny the alligators one morning the papers came out with a column about it and ricks come out by the fire escape it seems the alleged authorities had beat him to the safe deposit box where he kept his winnings and ricks has to westward ho with only feetwear and a dozen and a half english pokes in his shopping bag he happened to have some mileage left in his book and that took him as far as the town in the wilderness where he was spilled out on me and bill bassett as elijah iii with not a raven in sight for any of us then this alfred e ricks lets out a squeak that he is hungry too and denies the hypothesis that he is good for the value let alone the price of a meal and so there was the three of us representing if we had a mind to draw syllogisms and parabolas labor and trade and capital now when trade has no capital there isn t a dicker to be made and when capital has no money there s a stagnation in steak and onions that put it up to the man with the jimmy brother bushrangers says bill bassett never yet in trouble did i desert a pal hard by in yon wood i seem to see unfurnished lodgings let us go there and wait till dark there was an old deserted cabin in the grove and we three took possession of it after dark bill bassett tells us to wait and goes out for half an hour he comes back with a armful of bread and spareribs and pies panhandled em at a farmhouse on washita avenue says he eat drink and be leary the full moon was coming up bright so we sat on the floor of the cabin and ate in the light of it and this bill bassett begins to brag sometimes says he with his mouth full of country produce i lose all patience with you people that think you are higher up in the profession than i am now what could either of you have done in the present emergency to set us on our feet again could you do it ricksy i must confess mr bassett says ricks speaking nearly inaudible out of a slice of pie that at this immediate juncture i could not perhaps promote an enterprise to relieve the situation large operations such as i direct naturally require careful preparation in advance i i know ricksy breaks in bill bassett you needn t finish you need to make the first payment on a blond typewriter and four roomsful of quartered oak furniture and you need more for advertising contracts and you need two weeks time for the fish to begin to bite your line of relief would be about as useful in an emergency as advocating municipal ownership to cure a man suffocated by eighty cent gas and your graft ain t much swifter brother peters he winds up oh says i i haven t seen you turn anything into gold with your wand yet mr good fairy most anybody could rub the magic ring for a little left over victuals that was only getting the pumpkin ready says bassett braggy and cheerful the coach and six ll drive up to the door before you know it miss cinderella maybe you ve got some scheme under your sleeve holders that will give us a start son says i i m fifteen years older than you are and young enough yet to take out an endowment policy i ve been broke before

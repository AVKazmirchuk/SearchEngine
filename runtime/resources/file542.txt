thirty two bullet make a big hole it s kind of hard luck ain t it could you get me a drink from the sideboard tommy no straight nothing on the side and again continued the editor without pausing for argument when berenice opens the letter from her husband informing her that he has fled with the manicure girl her words are let me see she says interposed the author well what do you think of that absurdly inappropriate words said westbrook presenting an anti climax plunging the story into hopeless bathos worse yet they mirror life falsely no human being ever uttered banal colloquialisms when confronted by sudden tragedy wrong said dawe closing his unshaven jaws doggedly i say no man or woman ever spouts high falutin talk when they go up against a real climax they talk naturally and a little worse the editor rose from the bench with his air of indulgence and inside information say westbrook said dawe pinning him by the lapel would you have accepted the alarum of the soul if you had believed that the actions and words of the characters were true to life in the parts of the story that we discussed it is very likely that i would if i believed that way said the editor but i have explained to you that i do not if i could prove to you that i am right i m sorry shack but i m afraid i haven t time to argue any further just now i don t want to argue said dave i want to demonstrate to you from life itself that my view is the correct one how could you do that asked westbrook in a surprised tone listen said the writer seriously i have thought of a way it is important to me that my theory of true to life fiction be recognized as correct by the magazines i ve fought for it for three years and i m down to my last dollar with two months rent due i have applied the opposite of your theory said the editor in selecting the fiction for the minerva magazine the circulation has gone up from ninety thousand to four hundred thousand said dawe whereas it should have been boosted to a million you said something to me just now about demonstrating your pet theory i will if you ll give me about half an hour of your time i ll prove to you that i am right i ll prove it by louise your wife exclaimed westbrook how well not exactly by her but with her said dawe now you know how devoted and loving louse has always been she thinks i m the only genuine preparation on the market that bears the old doctor s signature she s been fonder and more faithful than ever since i ve been cast for the neglected genius part indeed she is a charming and admirable life companion agreed the editor i remember what inseparable friends she and mrs westbrook once were we are both lucky chaps shack to have such wives you must bring mrs dawe up some evening soon and we ll have one of those informal chafing dish suppers that we used to enjoy so much later said dawe when i get another shirt and now i ll tell you my scheme when i was about to leave home after breakfast if you can call tea and oatmeal breakfast louise told me she was going to visit her aunt in eighty ninth street she said she would return at three o clock she is always on time to a minute it is now dawe glanced toward the editor s watch pocket twenty seven minutes to three said westbrook scanning his time piece we have just enough time said dawe we will go to my flat at once i will write a note address it to her and leave it on the table where she will see it as she enters the door you and i will be in the dining room concealed by the porti eres in that note i ll say that i have fled from her forever with an affinity who understands the need of my artistic soul as she never did when she reads it we will observe her actions and hear her words then we will know which theory is the correct one yours or mine oh never exclaimed the editor shaking his head that would be inexcusably cruel i could not consent to have mrs dawe s feelings played upon in such a manner brace up said the writer i guess i think as much of her as you do it s for her benefit as well as mine i ve got to get a market for my stories in some way it won t hurt louise she s healthy and sound her heart goes as strong as a ninety eight cent watch it ll last for only a minute and then i ll step out and explain to her you really owe it to me to give me the chance westbrook editor westbrook at length yielded though but half willingly and in the half of him that consented lurked the vivisectionist that is in all of us let him who has not used the scalpel rise and stand in his place pity tis that there are not enough rabbits and guinea pigs to go around the two experimenters in art left the square and hurried eastward and then to that south until they arrived in the gramercy neighborhood within its high iron railings the little park had put on its smart coat of vernal green and was admiring itself in its fountain mirror outside the railings the hollow square of crumbling houses shells of a bygone gentry leaned as if in ghostly gossip over the forgotten doings of the vanished quality sic transit gloria urbis a block or two north of the park

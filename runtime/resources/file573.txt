missis telfair began jim oh drop it said the dogman come again whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman they walked on to the ferry the ranchman stepped to the ticket window suddenly the swift landing of three or four heavy kicks was heard the air was rent by piercing canine shrieks and a pained outraged lubberly bow legged pudding of a dog ran frenziedly up the street alone ticket to denver said jim make it two shouted the ex dogman reaching for his inside pocket the champion of the weather if you should speak of the kiowa reservation to the average new yorker he probably wouldn t know whether you were referring to a new political dodge at albany or a leitmotif from parsifal but out in the kiowa reservation advices have been received concerning the existence of new york a party of us were on a hunting trip in the reservation bud kingsbury our guide philosopher and friend was broiling antelope steaks in camp one night one of the party a pinkish haired young man in a correct hunting costume sauntered over to the fire to light a cigarette and remarked carelessly to bud nice night why yes said bud as nice as any night could be that ain t received the broadway stamp of approval now the young man was from new york but the rest of us wondered how bud guessed it so when the steaks were done we besought him to lay bare his system of ratiocination and as bud was something of a territorial talking machine he made oration as follows how did i know he was from new york well i figured it out as soon as he sprung them two words on me i was in new york myself a couple of years ago and i noticed some of the earmarks and hoof tracks of the rancho manhattan found new york rather different from the panhandle didn t you bud asked one of the hunters can t say that

income religion size of collar and his wife s temper and how much he pays for clothes al imony and chewing tobacco it s a gift with me not to be penurious with my conversation but this here new york was inaugurated on the idea of abstemiousness in regard to the parts of speech at the end of three weeks nobody in the city had fired even a blank syllable in my direction except the waiter in the

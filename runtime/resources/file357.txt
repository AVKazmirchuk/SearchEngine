esteem he belonged to one of the oldest french families and was of some distinction as an antiquary and historian he was a bachelor about fifty years of age he lived in quiet comfort at one of those rare old hostelries in royal street he was found in his rooms one morning dead from unknown causes when his affairs came to be looked into it was found that he was practically insolvent his stock of goods and personal property barely but nearly enough to free him from censure covering his liabilities following came the disclosure that he had been entrusted with the sum of twenty thousand dollars by a former upper servant in the morin family one madame tibault which she had received as a legacy from relatives in france the most searching scrutiny by friends and the legal authorities failed to reveal the disposition of the money it had vanished and left no trace some weeks before his death mr morin had drawn the entire amount in gold coin from the bank where it had been placed while he looked about he told madame tibault for a safe investment therefore mr morin s memory seemed doomed to bear the cloud of dishonesty while madame was of course disconsolate then it was that robbins and

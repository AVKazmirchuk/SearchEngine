in the morning on the celtic said honoria plucking a loose thread from her lace sleeve i heard so said young ives dropping his hat and muffing it as he tried to catch it and i came around to wish you a pleasant voyage of course you heard it said honoria coldly sweet since we have had no opportunity of inform ing you ourselves ives looked at her pleadingly but with little hope outside in the street a high pitched voice chanted not unmusically a commercial gamut of cand de ee ee s nice fresh cand ee ee ee ees d it s our old candy man said honoria leaning out the window and beckoning i want some of his motto kisses there s nothing in the broadway shops half so good the candy man stopped his pushcart in front of the old madison avenue home he had a holiday and festival air unusual to street peddlers his tie was new and bright red and a horseshoe pin almost life size glittered speciously from its folds his brown thin face was crinkled into a semi foolish smile striped cuffs with dog head buttons covered the tan on his wrists i do believe he s going to get married said honoria pityingly i never saw him taken that way before and to day is the first time in months that he has cried his wares i am sure ives threw a coin to the sidewalk the candy man knows his customers he filled a paper bag climbed the old fashioned stoop and banded it in i remember said ives wait said honoria she took a small portfolio from the drawer of a writing desk and from the portfolio a slip of flimsy paper one quarter of an inch by two inches in size this said honoria inflexibly was wrapped about the first one we opened it was a year ago apologized ives as he held out his hand for it as long as skies above are blue to you my love i will be true this he read from the slip of flimsy paper we were to have sailed a fortnight ago said honoria gossipingly it has been such a warm summer the town is quite deserted there is no where to go yet i am told that one or two of the roof gardens are amusing the singing and the dancing on one or two seem to have met with ap proval ives did not wince when you are in the ring you are not surprised when your adversary taps you on the ribs i followed the candy man that time said ives irrelevantly and gave him five dollars at the corner of broadway he reached for the paper bag in honoria s lap took out one of the square wrapped confections and slowly unrolled it sara chillingworth s father said honoria has given her an automobile read that said ives handing over the slip that had been wrapped around the square of candy life teaches us how to live love teaches us to forgive honoria s checks turned pink honoria cried ives starting up from his chair miss clinton corrected honoria rising like venus from the head on the surf i warned you not to speak that name again honoria repeated ives you must bear me i know i do not deserve your forgiveness but i must have it there is a madness that possesses one some times for which his better nature is not responsible i throw everything else but you to the winds i strike off the chains that have bound me i re nounce the siren that lured me from you let the bought verse of that street peddler plead for me it is you only whom i can love let your love forgive and i swear to you that mine will be true as long as skies above are blue on the west side between sixth and seventh ave nues an alley cuts the block in the middle it per ishes in a little court in the centre of the block the district is theatrical the inhabitants the bubbling froth of half a dozen nations the atmosphere is bohemian the language polyglot the locality pre carious in the court at the rear of the alley lived the candy man at seven o clock be pushed his cart into the narrow entrance rested it upon the irregular stone slats and sat upon one of the handles to cool himself there was a great draught of cool wind through the alley there was a window above the spot where be al ways stopped his pushcart in the cool of the after noon mlle adele drawing card of the aerial roof garden sat at the window and took the air gen erally her ponderous mass of dark auburn hair was down that the breeze might have the felicity of aid ing sidonie the maid in drying and airing it about her shoulders the point of her that the pho tographers always made the most of was loosely draped a heliotrope scarf her arms to the elbow were bare there were no sculptors there to rave over them but even the stolid bricks in the walls of the alley should not have been so insensate as to disapprove while she sat thus fe ice another maid anointed and bathed the small feet that twinkled and so charmed the nightly aerial audiences gradually mademoiselle began to notice the candy man stopping to mop his brow and cool himself be neath her window in the hands of her maids she was deprived for the time of her vocation the charming and binding to her chariot of man to lose time was displeasing to mademoiselle here was the candy man no fit game for her darts truly but of the sex upon which she had been born to make war after casting upon him looks of unseeing coldness for a dozen times

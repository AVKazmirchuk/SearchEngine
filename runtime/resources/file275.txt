of a london tailor his long well shaped fingers delicate nose and poise of manner raised him high above the class of hermits who fear water and bury money in oyster cans in their caves in spots indicated by rude crosses chipped in the stone wall above the hermit s home was not altogether a cave the cave was an addition to the hermitage which was a rude hut made of poles daubed with clay and covered with the best quality of rust proof zinc roofing in the house proper there were stone slabs for seats a rustic bookcase made of unplaned poplar planks and a table formed of a wooden slab laid across two upright pieces of granite something between the furniture of a druid temple and that of a broadway beefsteak dungeon hung against the walls were skins of wild animals purchased in the vicinity of eighth street and university place new york the rear of the cabin merged into the cave there the hermit cooked his meals on a rude stone hearth with infinite patience and an old axe he had chopped natural shelves in the rocky walls on them stood his stores of flour bacon lard talcum powder kerosene baking powder soda mint tablets pepper salt and olivo cremo emulsion for chaps and roughness of the hands and face the hermit had hermited there for ten years he was an asset of the viewpoint inn to its guests he was second in interest only to the mysterious echo in the haunted glen and the lover s leap beat him only a few inches flat footed he was known far but not very wide on account of the topography as a scholar of brilliant intellect who had forsworn the world because he had been jilted in a love affair every saturday night the viewpoint inn sent to him surreptitiously a basket of provisions he never left the immediate outskirts of his hermitage guests of the inn who visited him said his store of knowledge wit and scintillating philosophy were simply wonderful you know that summer the viewpoint inn was crowded with guests so on saturday nights there were extra cans of tomatoes and sirloin steak instead of rounds in the hermit s basket now you have the material allegations in the case so make way for romance evidently the hermit expected a visitor he carefully combed his long hair and parted his apostolic beard when the ninety eight cent alarm clock on a stone shelf announced the hour of five he picked up his gunny sacking skirts brushed them carefully gathered an oaken staff and strolled slowly into the thick woods that surrounded the hermitage he had not long to wait up the faint pathway slippery with its carpet of pine needles toiled beatrix youngest and fairest of the famous trenholme sisters she was all in blue from hat to canvas pumps varying in tint from the shade of the tinkle of a bluebell at daybreak on a spring saturday to the deep hue of a monday morning at nine when the washer woman has failed to show up beatrix dug her cerulean parasol deep into the pine needles and sighed the hermit on the q t removed a grass burr from the ankle of one sandalled foot with the big toe of his other one she blued and almost starched and ironed him with her cobalt eyes it must be so nice she said in little tremulous gasps to be a hermit and have ladies climb mountains to talk to you the hermit folded his arms and leaned against a tree beatrix with a sigh settled down upon the mat of pine needles like a bluebird upon her nest the hermit followed suit drawing his feet rather awkwardly under his gunny sacking it must be nice to be a mountain said he with ponderous lightness and have angels in blue climb up you instead of flying over you mamma had neuralgia said beatrix and went to bed or i couldn t have come it s dreadfully hot at that horrid old inn but we hadn t the money to go anywhere else this summer last night said the hermit i climbed to the top of that big rock above us i could see the lights of the inn and hear a strain or two of the music when the wind was right i imagined you moving gracefully in the arms of others to the dreamy music of the waltz amid the fragrance of flowers think how lonely i must have been the youngest handsomest and poorest of the famous trenholme sisters sighed you haven t quite hit it she said plaintively i was moving gracefully at the arms of another mamma had one of her periodical attacks of rheumatism in both elbows and shoulders and i had to rub them for an hour with that horrid old liniment i hope you didn t think that smelled like flowers you know there were some west point boys and a yachtload of young men from the city at last evening s weekly dance i ve known mamma to sit by an open window for three hours with one half of her registering degrees and the other half frostbitten and never sneeze once but just let a bunch of ineligibles come around where i am and she ll begin to swell at the knuckles and shriek with pain and i have to take her to her room and rub her arms to see mamma dressed you d be surprised to know the number of square inches of surface there are to her arms i think it must be delightful to be a hermit that cassock gabardine isn t it that you wear is so becoming do you make it or them of course you must have changes yourself and what a blessed relief it must be to wear sandals instead of shoes think how we must suffer no matter

that men in this broad and unfair country will endeavor to secure your fair hand and ostensible money and property through our advertisement out of that number something like thirty hundred will expect to give you in exchange if they should win you the carcass of a lazy and mercenary loafer a failure in life a swindler and contemptible fortune seeker me and andy says i propose to teach these preyers upon society a lesson it was with difficulty says i that me and andy could refrain from forming a corporation under the title of the great moral and millennial malevolent matrimonial agency does that satisfy you it does mr peters says she i might have known you wouldn t have gone into anything that wasn t opprobrious but what will my duties be do i have to reject personally these ramscallions you speak of or can i throw them out in bunches your job mrs trotter says i will be practically a cynosure you will live at a quiet hotel and will have no work to do andy and i will attend to all the correspondence and business end of it of course says i some of the more ardent and impetuous suitors who can raise the railroad fare may come to cairo to personally press their suit or whatever fraction of a suit they may be wearing in that case you will be probably put to the inconvenience of kicking them out face to face we will pay you per week and hotel expenses give me five minutes says mrs trotter to get my powder rag and leave the front door key with a neighbor and you can let my salary begin so i conveys mrs trotter to cairo and establishes her in a family hotel far enough away from mine and andy s quarters to be unsuspicious and available and i tell andy great says andy and now that your conscience is appeased as to the tangibility and proximity of the bait and leaving mutton aside suppose we revenoo a noo fish so we began to insert our advertisement in newspapers covering the country far and wide one ad was all we used we couldn t have used more without hiring so many clerks and marcelled paraphernalia that the sound of the gum chewing would have disturbed the postmaster general we placed in a bank to mrs trotter s credit and gave her the book to show in case anybody might question the honesty and good faith of the agency i knew mrs trotter was square and reliable and it was safe to leave it in her name with that one ad andy and me put in twelve hours a day answering letters about one hundred a day was what came in i never knew there was so many large hearted but indigent men in the country who were willing to acquire a charming widow and assume the burden of investing her money most of them admitted that they ran principally to whiskers and lost jobs and were misunderstood by the world but all of em were sure that they were so chock full of affection and manly qualities that the widow would be making the bargain of her life to get em every applicant got a reply from peters tucker informing him that the widow had been deeply impressed by his straightforward and interesting letter and requesting them to write again stating more particulars and enclosing photograph if convenient peters tucker also informed the applicant that their fee for handing over the second letter to their fair client would be enclosed therewith there you see the simple beauty of the scheme about per cent of them domestic foreign noblemen raised the price somehow and sent it in that was all there was to it except that me and andy complained an amount about being put to the trouble of slicing open them envelopes and taking the money out some few clients called in person we sent em to mrs trotter and she did the rest except for three or four who came back to strike us for carfare after the letters began to get in from the r f d districts andy and me were taking in about a day one afternoon when we were busiest and i was stuffing the two and ones into cigar boxes and andy was whistling no wedding bells for her a small slick man drops in and runs his eye over the walls like he was on the trail of a lost gainesborough painting or two as soon as i saw him i felt a glow of pride because we were running our business on the level i see you have quite a large mail to day says the man i reached and got my hat come on says i we ve been expecting you i ll show you the goods how was teddy when you left washington i took him down to the riverview hotel and had him shake hands with mrs trotter then i showed him her bank book with the to her credit it seems to be all right says the secret service it is says i and if you re not a married man i ll leave you to talk a while with the lady we won t mention the two dollars thanks says he if i wasn t i might good day mrs peters toward the end of three months we had taken in something over and we saw it was time to quit we had a good many complaints made to us and mrs trotter seemed to be tired of the job a good many suitors had been calling to see her and she didn t seem to like that so we decides to pull out and i goes down to mrs trotter s hotel to pay her last week s salary and say farewell and get her check for the when i got there i found her crying like a kid that don t want to go to school now now says i what s it all about somebody sassed you or you getting homesick no mr peters says she i ll tell you you was always a friend of zeke s and i don t mind mr peters i m in love i just love a man so hard i can t bear not to get him he s just the ideal i ve always had in mind then take him says i that is if it s a mutual case does he return the sentiment according to the specifications and painfulness you have described he does says she but he s one of the gentlemen that s been coming to see me about the advertisement and he won t marry me unless i give him the his name is william wilkinson and then she goes off again in the agitations and hysterics of romance mrs trotter says i there s no man more sympathizing with a woman s affections than i am besides you was once the life partner of one of my best friends if it was left to me i d say take this and the man of your choice and be happy we could afford to do that because we have cleaned up over from these suckers that wanted to marry you but says i andy tucker is to be consulted he is a good man but keen in business he is my equal partner financially i will talk to andy says i and see what can be done i goes back to our hotel and lays the case before andy i was expecting something like this all the time says andy you can t trust a woman to stick by you in any scheme that involves her emotions and preferences it s a sad thing andy says i to think that we ve been the cause of the breaking of a woman s heart it is says andy and i tell you what i m willing to do jeff you ve always been a man of a soft and generous heart and disposition perhaps i ve been too hard and worldly and suspicious for once i ll meet you half way go to mrs trotter and tell her to draw the from the bank and give it to this man she s infatuated with and be happy i jumps up and shakes andy s hand for five minutes and then i goes back to mrs trotter and tells her and she cries as hard for joy as she did for sorrow two days afterward me and andy packed up to go wouldn t you like to go down and meet mrs trotter once before we leave i asks him she d like mightily to know you and express her encomiums and gratitude why i guess not says andy i guess we d better hurry and catch that train i was strapping our capital around me in a memory belt like we always carried it when andy pulls a roll of large bills out of his pocket and asks me to put em with the rest what s this says i it s mrs trotter s two thousand says andy how do you come to have it i asks she gave it to me says andy i ve been calling on her three evenings a week for more than a month then are you william wilkinson says i i was says andy a midsummer masquerade satan said jeff peters is a hard boss to work for when other people are having their vacation is when he keeps you the busiest as old dr watts or st paul or some other diagnostician says he always finds somebody for idle hands to do i remember one summer when me and my partner andy tucker tried to take a layoff from our professional and business duties but it seems that our work followed us wherever we went now with a preacher it s different he can throw off his responsibilities and enjoy himself on the st of may he wraps mosquito netting and tin foil around the pulpit grabs his niblick breviary and fishing pole and hikes for lake como or atlantic city according to the size of the loudness with which he has been called by his congregation and sir for three months he don t have to think about business except to hunt around in deuteronomy and proverbs and timothy to find texts to cover and exculpate such little midsummer penances as dropping a couple of looey door on rouge or teaching a presbyterian widow to swim but i was going to tell you about mine and andy s summer vacation that wasn t one we was tired of finance and all the branches of unsanctified ingenuity even andy whose brain rarely ever stopped working began to make noises like a tennis cabinet heigh ho says andy i m tired i ve got that steam up the yacht corsair and ho for the riviera feeling i want to loaf and indict my soul as walt whittier says i want to play pinochle with merry del val or give a knouting to the tenants on my tarrytown estates or do a monologue at a chautauqua picnic in kilts or something summery and outside the line of routine and sand bagging patience says i you ll have to climb higher in the profession before you can taste the laurels that crown the footprints of the great captains of industry now what i d like andy says i would be a summer sojourn in a mountain village far from scenes of larceny labor and overcapitalization i m tired too and a month or so of sinlessness ought to leave us in good shape to begin again to take away the white man s burdens in the fall andy fell in with the rest cure at once so we struck the general passenger agents of all the railroads for summer resort literature and took a week to study out where we should go i reckon the first passenger agent in the world was that man genesis but there wasn t much competition in his day and when he said the lord made the earth in six days and all very good he hadn t any idea to what extent the press agents of the summer hotels would plagiarize from him later on when we finished the booklets we perceived easy that the united states from passadumkeg maine to el paso and from skagway to key west was a paradise of glorious mountain peaks crystal lakes new laid eggs golf girls garages cooling breezes straw rides open plumbing and tennis and all within two hours ride so me and andy dumps the books out the back window and packs our trunk and takes the o clock tortoise flyer for crow knob a kind of a dernier resort in the mountains on the line of tennessee and north carolina we was directed to a kind of private hotel called woodchuck inn and thither me and andy bent and almost broke our footsteps over the rocks and stumps the inn set back from the road in a big grove of trees and it looked fine with its broad porches and a lot of women in white dresses rocking in the shade the rest of crow knob was a post office and some scenery set an angle of forty five degrees and a welkin well sir when we got to the gate who do you suppose comes down the walk to greet us old smoke em out smithers who used to be the best open air painless dentist and electric liver pad faker in the southwest old smoke em out is dressed clerico rural and has the mingled air of a landlord and a claim jumper which aspect he corroborates by telling us that he is the host and perpetrator of woodchuck inn i introduces andy and we talk about a few volatile topics such as will go around at meetings of boards of directors and old associates like us three were old smoke em out leads us into a kind of summer house in the yard near the gate and took up the harp of life and smote on all the chords with his mighty right gents says he i m glad to see you maybe you can help me out of a scrape i m getting a bit old for street work so i leased this dogdays emporium so the good things would come to me two weeks before the season opened i gets a letter signed lieut peary and one from the duke of marlborough each wanting to engage board for part of the summer well sir you gents know what a big thing for an obscure hustlery it would be to have for guests two gentlemen whose names are famous from long association with icebergs and the coburgs so i prints a lot of handbills announcing that woodchuck inn would shelter these distinguished boarders during the summer except in places where it leaked and i sends em out to towns around as far as knoxville and charlotte and fish dam and bowling green and now look up there on the porch gents says smoke em out at them disconsolate specimens of their fair sex waiting for the arrival of the duke and the lieutenant the house is packed from rafters to cellar with hero worshippers there s four normal school teachers and two abnormal there s three high school graduates between and there s two literary old maids and one that can write there s a couple of society women and a lady from haw river two elocutionists are bunking in the corn crib and i ve put cots in the hay loft for the cook and the society editress of the chattanooga opera glass you see how names draw gents well says i how is it that you seem to be biting your thumbs at good luck you didn t use to be that way i ain t through says smoke em out yesterday was the day for the advent of the auspicious personages i goes down to the depot to welcome em two apparently animate substances gets off the train both carrying bags full of croquet mallets and these magic lanterns with pushbuttons i compares these integers with the original signatures to the letters and well gents i reckon the mistake was due to my poor eyesight instead of being the lieutenant the daisy chain and wild verbena explorer was none other than levi t peevy a soda water clerk from asheville and the duke of marlborough turned out to be theo drake of murfreesborough a bookkeeper in a grocery what did i do i kicked em both back on the train and watched em depart for the lowlands the low now you see the fix i m in gents goes on smoke em out smithers i told the ladies that the notorious visitors had been detained on the road by some unavoidable circumstances that made a noise like an ice jam and an heiress but they would arrive a day or two later when they find out that they ve been deceived says smoke em out every yard of cross barred muslin and natural waved switch in the house will pack up and leave it s a hard deal says old smoke em out friend says andy touching the old man on the sophagus why this jeremiad when the polar regions and the portals of blenheim are conspiring to hand you prosperity on a hall marked silver salver we have arrived a light breaks out on smoke em out s face can you do it gents he asks could ye do it could ye play the polar man and the little duke for the nice ladies will ye do it i see that andy is superimposed with his old hankering for the oral and polyglot system of buncoing that man had a vocabulary of about words and synonyms which arrayed themselves into contraband sophistries and parables when they came out listen says andy to old smoke em out can we do it you behold before you mr smithers two of the finest equipped men on earth for inveigling the proletariat whether by word of mouth sleight of hand or swiftness of foot dukes come and go explorers go and get lost but me and jeff peters says andy go after the come ons forever if you say so we re the two illustrious guests you were expecting and you ll find says andy that we ll give you the true local color of the title r les from the aurora borealis to the ducal portcullis old smoke em out is delighted he takes me and andy up to the inn by an arm apiece telling us on the way that the finest fruits of the can and luxuries of the fast freights should be ours without price as long as we would stay on the porch smoke em out says ladies i have the honor to introduce his gracefulness the duke of marlborough and the famous inventor of the north pole lieut peary the skirts all flutter and the rocking chairs squeak as me and andy bows and then goes on in with old smoke em out to register and then we washed up and turned our cuffs and the landlord took us to the rooms he d been saving for us and got out a demijohn of north carolina real mountain dew i expected trouble when andy began to drink he has the artistic metempsychosis which is half drunk when sober and looks down on airships when stimulated after lingering with the demijohn me and andy goes out on the porch where the ladies are to begin to earn our keep we sit in two special chairs and then the schoolma ams and literaterrers hunched their rockers close around us one lady says to me how did that last venture of yours turn out sir now i d clean forgot to have an understanding with andy which i was to be the duke or the lieutenant and i couldn t tell from her question whether she was referring to arctic or matrimonial expeditions so i gave an answer that would cover both cases well ma am says i it was a freeze out right smart of a freeze out ma am and then the flood gates of andy s perorations was opened and i knew which one of the renowned ostensible guests i was supposed to be i wasn t either andy was both and still furthermore it seemed that he was trying to be the mouthpiece of the whole british nobility and of arctic exploration from sir john franklin down it was the union of corn whiskey and the conscientious fictional form that mr w d howletts admires so much ladies says andy smiling semicircularly i am truly glad to visit america i do not consider the magna charta says he or gas balloons or snow shoes in any way a detriment to the beauty and charm of your american women skyscrapers or the architecture of your icebergs the next time says andy that i go after the north pole all the vanderbilts in greenland won t be able to turn me out in the cold i mean make it hot for me tell us about one of your trips lieutenant says one of the normals sure says andy getting the decision over a hiccup it was in the spring of last year that i sailed the castle of blenheim up to latitude degrees fahrenheit and beat the record ladies says andy it was a sad sight to see a duke allied by a civil and liturgical chattel mortgage to one of your first families lost in a region of semiannual days and then he goes on at four bells we sighted westminster abbey but there was not a drop to eat at noon we threw out five sandbags and the ship rose fifteen knots higher at midnight continues andy the restaurants closed sitting on a cake of ice we ate seven hot dogs all around us was snow and ice six times a night the boatswain rose up and tore a leaf off the calendar so we could keep time with the barometer at says andy with a lot of anguish on his face three huge polar bears sprang down the hatchway into the cabin and then what then lieutenant says a schoolma am excitedly andy gives a loud sob the duchess shook me he cries out and slides out of the chair and weeps on the porch well of course that fixed the scheme the women boarders all left the next morning the landlord wouldn t speak to us for two days but when he found we had money to pay our way he loosened up so me and andy had a quiet restful summer after all coming away from crow knob with that we enticed out of old smoke em out playing seven up shearing the wolf jeff peters was always eloquent when the ethics of his profession was under discussion the only times said he that me and andy tucker ever had any hiatuses in our cordial intents was when we differed on the moral aspects of grafting andy had his standards and i had mine i didn t approve of all of andy s schemes for levying contributions from the public and he thought i allowed my conscience to interfere too often for the financial good of the firm we had high arguments sometimes one word led on to another till he said i reminded him of rockefeller i don t know how you mean that andy says i but we have been friends too long for me to take offense at a taunt that you will regret when you cool off i have yet says i to shake hands with a subpoena server one summer me and andy decided to rest up a spell in a fine little town in the mountains of kentucky called grassdale we was supposed to be horse drovers and good decent citizens besides taking a summer vacation the grassdale people liked us and me and andy declared a cessation of hostilities never so much as floating the fly leaf of a rubber concession prospectus or flashing a brazilian diamond while we was there one day the leading hardware merchant of grassdale drops around to the hotel where me and andy stopped and smokes with us sociable on the side porch we knew him pretty well from pitching quoits in the afternoons in the court house yard he was a loud red man breathing hard but fat and respectable beyond all reason after we talk on all the notorious themes of the day this murkison for such was his entitlements takes a letter out of his coat pocket in a careful careless way and hands it to us to read now what do you think of that says he laughing a letter like that to me me and andy sees at a glance what it is but we pretend to read it through it was one of them old time typewritten green goods letters explaining how for you could get in bills that an expert couldn t tell from the genuine and going on to tell how they were made from plates stolen by an employee of the treasury at washington think of em sending a letter like that to me says murkison again lot s of good men get em says andy if you don t answer the first letter they let you drop if you answer it they write again asking you to come on with your money and do business but think of em writing to me says murkison a few days later he drops around again boys says he i know you are all right or i wouldn t confide in you i wrote to them rascals again just for fun they answered and told me to come on to chicago they said telegraph to j smith when i would start when i get there i m to wait on a certain street corner till a man in a gray suit comes along and drops a newspaper in front of me then i am to ask him how the water is and he knows it s me and i know it s him ah yes says andy gaping it s the same old game i ve often read about it in the papers then he conducts you to the private abattoir in the hotel where mr jones is already waiting they show you brand new real money and sell you all you want at five for one you see em put it in a satchel for you and know it s there of course it s brown paper when you come to look at it afterward oh they couldn t switch it on me says murkison i haven t built up the best paying business in grassdale without having witticisms about me you say it s real money they show you mr tucker i ve always i see by the papers that it always is says andy boys says murkison i ve got it in my mind that them fellows can t fool me i think i ll put a couple of thousand in my jeans and go up there and put it all over em if bill murkison gets his eyes once on them bills they show him he ll never take em off of em they offer for and they ll have to stick to the bargain if i tackle em that s the kind of trader bill murkison is yes i jist believe i ll drop up chicago way and take a to shot on j smith i guess the water ll be fine enough me and andy tries to get this financial misquotation out of murkison s head but we might as well have tried to keep the man who rolls peanuts with a toothpick from betting on bryan s election no sir he was going to perform a public duty by catching these green goods swindlers at their own game maybe it would teach em a lesson after murkison left us me and andy sat a while prepondering over our silent meditations and heresies of reason in our idle hours we always improved our higher selves by ratiocination and mental thought jeff says andy after a long time quite unseldom i have seen fit to impugn your molars when you have been chewing the rag with me about your conscientious way of doing business i may have been often wrong but here is a case where i think we can agree i feel that it would be wrong for us to allow mr murkison to go alone to meet those chicago green goods men there is but one way it can end don t you think we would both feel better if we was to intervene in some way and prevent the doing of this deed i got up and shook andy tucker s hand hard and long andy says i i may have had one or two hard thoughts about the heartlessness of your corporation but i retract em now you have a kind nucleus at the interior of your exterior after all it does you credit i was just thinking the same thing that you have expressed it would not be honorable or praiseworthy says i for us to let murkison go on with this project he has taken up if he is determined to go let us go with him and prevent this swindle from coming off andy agreed with me and i was glad to see that he was in earnest about breaking up this green goods scheme i don t call myself a religious man says i or a fanatic in moral bigotry but i can t stand still and see a man who has built up his business by his own efforts and brains and risk be robbed by an unscrupulous trickster who is a menace to the public good right jeff says andy we ll stick right along with murkison if he insists on going and block this funny business i d hate to see any money dropped in it as bad as you would well we went to see murkison no boys says he i can t consent to let the song of this chicago siren waft by me on the summer breeze i ll fry some fat out of this ignis fatuus or burn a hole in the skillet but i d be plumb diverted to death to have you all go along with me maybe you could help some when it comes to cashing in the ticket to that to shot yes i d really take it as a pastime and regalement if you boys would go along too murkison gives it out in grassdale that he is going for a few days with mr peters and mr tucker to look over some iron ore property in west virginia he wires j smith that he will set foot in the spider web on a given date and the three of us lights out for chicago on the way murkison amuses himself with premonitions and advance pleasant recollections in a gray suit says he on the southwest corner of wabash avenue and lake street he drops the paper and i ask how the water is oh my my my and then he laughs all over for five minutes sometimes murkison was serious and tried to talk himself out of his cogitations whatever they was boys says he i wouldn t have this to get out in grassdale for ten times a thousand dollars it would ruin me there but i know you all are all right i think it s the duty of every citizen says he to try to do up these robbers that prey upon the public i ll show em whether the water s fine five dollars for one that s what j smith offers and he ll have to keep his contract if he does business with bill murkison we got into chicago about p m murkison was to meet the gray man at half past we had dinner at a hotel and then went up to murkison s room to wait for the time to come now boys says murkison let s get our gumption together and inoculate a plan for defeating the enemy suppose while i m exchanging airy bandage with the gray capper you gents come along by accident you know and holler hello murk and shake hands with symptoms of surprise and familiarity then i take the capper aside and tell him you all are jenkins and brown of grassdale groceries and feed good men and maybe willing to take a chance while away from home bring em along he ll say of course if they care to invest now how does that scheme strike you what do you say jeff says andy looking at me why i ll tell you what i say says i i say let s settle this thing right here now i don t see any use of wasting any more time i took a nickel plated out of my pocket and clicked the cylinder around a few times you undevout sinful insidious hog says i to murkison get out that two thousand and lay it on the table obey with velocity says i for otherwise alternatives are impending i am preferably a man of mildness but now and then i find myself in the middle of extremities such men as you i went on after he had laid the money out is what keeps the jails and court houses going you come up here to rob these men of their money does it excuse you i asks that they were trying to skin you no sir you was going to rob peter to stand off paul you are ten times worse says i than that green goods man you go to church at home and pretend to be a decent citizen but you ll come to chicago and commit larceny from men that have built up a sound and profitable business by dealing with such contemptible scoundrels as you have tried to be to day how do you know says i that that green goods man hasn t a large family dependent upon his extortions it s you supposedly respectable citizens who are always on the lookout to get something for nothing says i that support the lotteries and wild cat mines and stock exchanges and wire tappers of this country if it wasn t for you they d go out of business the green goods man you was going to rob says i studied maybe for years to learn his trade every turn he makes he risks his money and liberty and maybe his life you come up here all sanctified and vanoplied with respectability and a pleasing post office address to swindle him if he gets the money you can squeal to the police if you get it he hocks the gray suit to buy supper and says nothing mr tucker and me sized you up says i and came along to see that you got what you deserved hand over the money says i you grass fed hypocrite i put the two thousand which was all in bills in my inside pocket now get out your watch says i to murkison no i don t want it says i lay it on the table and you sit in that chair till it ticks off an hour then you can go if you make any noise or leave any sooner we ll handbill you all over grassdale i guess your high position there is worth more than to you then me and andy left on the train andy was a long time silent then he says jeff do you mind my asking you a question two says i or forty was that the idea you had says he when we started out with murkison why certainly says i what else could it have been wasn t it yours too in about half an hour andy spoke again i think there are times when andy don t exactly understand my system of ethics and moral hygiene jeff says he some time when you have the leisure i wish you d draw off a diagram and foot notes of that conscience of yours i d like to have it to refer to occasionally innocents of broadway i hope some day to retire from business said jeff peters and when i do i don t want anybody to be able to say that i ever got a dollar of any man s money without giving him a quid pro rata for it i ve always managed to leave a customer some little gewgaw to paste in his scrapbook or stick between his seth thomas clock and the wall after we are through trading there was one time i came near having to break this rule of mine and do a profligate and illaudable action but i was saved from it by the laws and statutes of our great and profitable country one summer me and andy tucker my partner went to new york to lay in our annual assortment of clothes and gents furnishings we was always pompous and regardless dressers finding that looks went further than anything else in our business except maybe our knowledge of railroad schedules and an autograph photo of the president that loeb sent us probably by mistake andy wrote a nature letter once and sent it in about animals that he had seen caught in a trap lots of times loeb must have read it triplets instead of trap lots and sent the photo anyhow it was useful to us to show people as a guarantee of good faith me and andy never cared much to do business in new york it was too much like pothunting catching suckers in that town is like dynamiting a texas lake for bass all you have to do anywhere between the north and east rivers is to stand in the street with an open bag marked drop packages of money here no checks or loose bills taken you have a cop handy to club pikers who try to chip in post office orders and canadian money and that s all there is to new york for a hunter who loves his profession so me and andy used to just nature fake the town we d get out our spyglasses and watch the woodcocks along the broadway swamps putting plaster casts on their broken legs and then we d sneak away without firing a shot one day in the papier m ch palm room of a chloral hydrate and hops agency in a side street about eight inches off broadway me and andy had thrust upon us the acquaintance of a new yorker we had beer together until we discovered that each of us knew a man named hellsmith traveling for a stove factory in duluth this caused us to remark that the world was a very small place and then this new yorker busts his string and takes off his tin foil and excelsior packing and starts in giving us his ellen terris beginning with the time he used to sell shoelaces to the indians on the spot where tammany hall now stands this new yorker had made his money keeping a cigar store in beekman street and he hadn t been above fourteenth street in ten years moreover he had whiskers and the time had gone by when a true sport will do anything to a man with whiskers no grafter except a boy who is soliciting subscribers to an illustrated weekly to win the prize air rifle or a widow would have the heart to tamper with the man behind with the razor he was a typical city reub i d bet the man hadn t been out of sight of a skyscraper in twenty five years well presently this metropolitan backwoodsman pulls out a roll of bills with an old blue sleeve elastic fitting tight around it and opens it up there s mr peters says he shoving it over the table to me saved during my fifteen years of business put that in your pocket and keep it for me mr peters i m glad to meet you gentlemen from the west and i may take a drop too much i want you to take care of my money for me now let s have another beer you d better keep this yourself says i we are strangers to you and you can t trust everybody you meet put your roll back in your pocket says i and you d better run along home before some farm hand from the kaw river bottoms strolls in here and sells you a copper mine oh i don t know says whiskers i guess little old new york can take care of herself i guess i know a man that s on the square when i see him i ve always found the western people all right i ask you as a favor mr peters says he to keep that roll in your pocket for me i know a gentleman when i see him and now let s have some more beer in about ten minutes this fall of manna leans back in his chair and snores andy looks at me and says i reckon i d better stay with him for five minutes or so in case the waiter comes in i went out the side door and walked half a block up the street and then i came back and sat down at the table andy says i i can t do it it s too much like swearing off taxes i can t go off with this man s money without doing something to earn it like taking advantage of the bankrupt act or leaving a bottle of eczema lotion in his pocket to make it look more like a square deal well says andy it does seem kind of hard on one s professional pride to lope off with a bearded pard s competency especially after he has nominated you custodian of his bundle in the sappy insouciance of his urban indiscrimination suppose we wake him up and see if we can formulate some commercial sophistry by which he will be enabled to give us both his money and a good excuse we wakes up whiskers he stretches himself and yawns out the hypothesis that he must have dropped off for a minute and then he says he wouldn t mind sitting in at a little gentleman s game of poker he used to play some when he attended high school in brooklyn and as he was out for a good time why and so forth andy brights up a little at that for it looks like it might be a solution to our financial troubles so we all three go to our hotel further down broadway and have the cards and chips brought up to andy s room i tried once more to make this babe in the horticultural gardens take his five thousand but no keep that little roll for me mr peters says he and oblige i ll ask you fer it when i want it i guess i know when i m among friends a man that s done business on beekman street for twenty years right in the heart of the wisest old village on earth ought to know what he s about i guess i can tell a gentleman from a con man or a flimflammer when i meet him i ve got some odd change in my clothes enough to start the game with i guess he goes through his pockets and rains gold certificates on the table till it looked like a autumn day in a lemon grove picture by turner in the salons andy almost smiled the first round that was dealt this boulevardier slaps down his hand claims low and jack and big casino and rakes in the pot andy always took a pride in his poker playing he got up from the table and looked sadly out of the window at the street cars well gentlemen says the cigar man i don t blame you for not wanting to play i ve forgotten the fine points of the game i guess it s been so long since i indulged now how long are you gentlemen going to be in the city i told him about a week longer he says that ll suit him fine his cousin is coming over from brooklyn that evening and they are going to see the sights of new york his cousin he says is in the artificial limb and lead casket business and hasn t crossed the bridge in eight years they expect to have the time of their lives and he winds up by asking me to keep his roll of money for him till next day i tried to make him take it but it only insulted him to mention it i ll use what i ve got in loose change says he you keep the rest for me i ll drop in on you and mr tucker to morrow afternoon about or says he and we ll have dinner together be good after whiskers had gone andy looked at me curious and doubtful well jeff says he it looks like the ravens are trying to feed us two elijahs so hard that if we turned em down again we ought to have the audubon society after us it won t do to put the crown aside too often i know this is something like paternalism but don t you think opportunity has skinned its knuckles about enough knocking at our door i put my feet up on the table and my hands in my pockets which is an attitude unfavorable to frivolous thoughts andy says i this man with the hirsute whiskers has got us in a predicament we can t move hand or foot with his money you and me have got a gentleman s agreement with fortune that we can t break we ve done business in the west where it s more of a fair game out there the people we skin are trying to skin us even the farmers and the remittance men that the magazines send out to write up goldfields but there s little sport in new york city for rod reel or gun they hunt here with either one of two things a slungshot or a letter of introduction the town has been stocked so full of carp that the game fish are all gone if you spread a net here do you catch legitimate suckers in it such as the lord intended to be caught fresh guys who know it all sports with a little coin and the nerve to play another man s game street crowds out for the fun of dropping a dollar or two and village smarties who know just where the little pea is no sir says i what the grafters live on here is widows and orphans and foreigners who save up a bag of money and hand it out over the first counter they see with an iron railing to it and factory girls and little shopkeepers that never leave the block they do business on that s what they call suckers here they re nothing but canned sardines and all the bait you need to catch em is a pocketknife and a soda cracker now this cigar man i went on is one of the types he s lived twenty years on one street without learning as much as you would in getting a once over shave from a lockjawed barber in a kansas crossroads town but he s a new yorker and he ll brag about that all the time when he isn t picking up live wires or getting in front of street cars or paying out money to wire tappers or standing under a safe that s being hoisted into a skyscraper when a new yorker does loosen up says i it s like the spring decomposition of the ice jam in the allegheny river he ll swamp you with cracked ice and back water if you don t get out of the way it s mighty lucky for us andy says i that this cigar exponent with the parsley dressing saw fit to bedeck us with his childlike trust and altruism for says i this money of his is an eyesore to my sense of rectitude and ethics we can t take it andy you know we can t says i for we haven t a shadow of a title to it not a shadow if there was the least bit of a way we could put in a claim to it i d be willing to see him start in for another twenty years and make another for himself but we haven t sold him anything we haven t been embroiled in a trade or anything commercial he approached us friendly says i and with blind and beautiful idiocy laid the stuff in our hands we ll have to give it back to him when he wants it your arguments says andy are past criticism or comprehension no we can t walk off with the money as things now stand i admire your conscious way of doing business jeff says andy and i wouldn t propose anything that wasn t square in line with your theories of morality and initiative but i ll be away to night and most of to morrow jeff says andy i ve got some business affairs that i want to attend to when this free greenbacks party comes in to morrow afternoon hold him here till i arrive we ve all got an engagement for dinner you know well sir about the next afternoon in trips the cigar man with his eyes half open been having a glorious time mr peters says he took in all the sights i tell you new york is the onliest only now if you don t mind says he i ll lie down on that couch and doze off for about nine minutes before mr tucker comes i m not used to being up all night and to morrow if you don t mind mr peters i ll take that five thousand i met a man last night that s got a sure winner at the racetrack to morrow excuse me for being so impolite as to go to sleep mr peters and so this inhabitant of the second city in the world reposes himself and begins to snore while i sit there musing over things and wishing i was back in the west where you could always depend on a customer fighting to keep his money hard enough to let your conscience take it from him at half past andy comes in and sees the sleeping form i ve been over to trenton says andy pulling a document out of his pocket i think i ve got this matter fixed up all right jeff look at that i open the paper and see that it is a corporation charter issued by the state of new jersey to the peters tucker consolidated and amalgamated aerial franchise development company limited it s to buy up rights of way for airship lines explained andy the legislature wasn t in session but i found a man at a postcard stand in the lobby that kept a stock of charters on hand there are shares says andy expected to reach a par value of i had one blank certificate of stock printed andy takes out the blank and begins to fill it in with a fountain pen the whole bunch says he goes to our friend in dreamland for did you learn his name make it out to bearer says i we put the certificate of stock in the cigar man s hand and went out to pack our suit cases illustration we put the certificate of stock in the cigarman s hand on the ferryboat andy says to me is your conscience easy about taking the money now jeff why shouldn t it be says i are we any better than any other holding corporation conscience in art i never could hold my partner andy tucker down to legitimate ethics of pure swindling said jeff peters to me one day andy had too much imagination to be honest he used to devise schemes of money getting so fraudulent and high financial that they wouldn t have been allowed in the bylaws of a railroad rebate system myself i never believed in taking any man s dollars unless i gave him something for it something in the way of rolled gold jewelry garden seeds lumbago lotion stock certificates stove polish or a crack on the head to show for his money i guess i must have had new england ancestors away back and inherited some of their stanch and rugged fear of the police but andy s family tree was in different kind i don t think he could have traced his descent any further back than a corporation one summer while we was in the middle west working down the ohio valley with a line of family albums headache powders and roach destroyer andy takes one of his notions of high and actionable financiering jeff says he i ve been thinking that we ought to drop these rutabaga fanciers and give our attention to something more nourishing and prolific if we keep on snapshooting these hinds for their egg money we ll be classed as nature fakers how about plunging into the fastnesses of the skyscraper country and biting some big bull caribous in the chest well says i you know my idiosyncrasies i prefer a square non illegal style of business such as we are carrying on now when i take money i want to leave some tangible object in the other fellow s hands for him to gaze at and to distract his attention from my spoor even if it s only a komical kuss trick finger ring for squirting perfume in a friend s eye but if you ve got a fresh idea andy says i let s have a look at it i m not so wedded to petty graft that i would refuse something better in the way of a subsidy i was thinking says andy of a little hunt without horn hound or camera among the great herd of the midas americanus commonly known as the pittsburg millionaires in new york i asks no sir says andy in pittsburg that s their habitat they don t like new york they go there now and then just because it s expected of em a pittsburg millionaire in new york is like a fly in a cup of hot coffee he attracts attention and comment but he don t enjoy it new york ridicules him for blowing so much money in that town of sneaks and snobs and sneers the truth is he don t spend anything while he is there i saw a memorandum of expenses for a ten days trip to bunkum town made by a pittsburg man worth once here s the way he set it down r r fare to and from cab fare to and from hotel hotel bill per day tips total that s the voice of new york goes on andy the town s nothing but a head waiter if you tip it too much it ll go and stand by the door and make fun of you to the hat check boy when a pittsburger wants to spend money and have a good time he stays at home that s where we ll go to catch him well to make a dense story more condensed me and andy cached our paris green and antipyrine powders and albums in a friend s cellar and took the trail to pittsburg andy didn t have any especial prospectus of chicanery and violence drawn up but he always had plenty of confidence that his immoral nature would rise to any occasion that presented itself as a concession to my ideas of self preservation and rectitude he promised that if i should take an active and incriminating part in any little business venture that we might work up there should be something actual and cognizant to the senses of touch sight taste or smell to transfer to the victim for the money so my conscience might rest easy after that i felt better and entered more cheerfully into the foul play andy says i as we strayed through the smoke along the cinderpath they call smithfield street had you figured out how we are going to get acquainted with these coke kings and pig iron squeezers not that i would decry my own worth or system of drawing room deportment and work with the olive fork and pie knife says i but isn t the entree nous into the salons of the stogie smokers going to be harder than you imagined if there s any handicap at all says andy it s our own refinement and inherent culture pittsburg millionaires are a fine body of plain wholehearted unassuming democratic men they are rough but uncivil in their manners and though their ways are boisterous and unpolished under it all they have a great deal of impoliteness and discourtesy nearly every one of em rose from obscurity says andy and they ll live in it till the town gets to using smoke consumers if we act simple and unaffected and don t go too far from the saloons and keep making a noise like an import duty on steel rails we won t have any trouble in meeting some of em socially well andy and me drifted about town three or four days getting our bearings we got to knowing several millionaires by sight one used to stop his automobile in front of our hotel and have a quart of champagne brought out to him when the waiter opened it he d turn it up to his mouth and drink it out of the bottle that showed he used to be a glassblower before he made his money one evening andy failed to come to the hotel for dinner about o clock he came into my room landed one jeff says he twelve millions oil rolling mills real estate and natural gas he s a fine man no airs about him made all his money in the last five years he s got professors posting him up now in education art and literature and haberdashery and such things when i saw him he d just won a bet of with a steel corporation man that there d be four suicides in the allegheny rolling mills to day so everybody in sight had to walk up and have drinks on him he took a fancy to me and asked me to dinner with him we went

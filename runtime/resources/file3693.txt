her parlor the park is her drawing room the avenue is her garden walk yet for the most part she is as inviolate mis tress of herself in them as is my lady inside her tapestried chamber one evening at dusk two weeks after their first meeting carter and masie strolled arm in arm into a little dimly lit park they found a bench tree shadowed and secluded and sat there for the first time his arm stole gently around her her golden bronze head slid restfully against his shoulder gee sighed masie thankfully why didn t you ever think of that before masie said carter earnestly you surely know that i love you i ask you sincerely to marry me you know me well enough by this time to have no doubts of me i want you and i must have you i care nothing for the difference in our stations what is the difference asked masie curi ously well there isn t any said carter quickly ex cept in the minds of foolish people it is in my power to give you a life of luxury my social position is be yond dispute and my means are ample they all say that remarked masie it s the kid they all give you i suppose you really work in a delicatessen or follow the races i ain t as green as i look i can furnish you all the proofs you want said carter gently and i want you masie i loved you the first day i saw you they all do said masie with an amused laugh to hear em talk if i could meet a man that got stuck on me the third time he d seen me i think i d get mashed on him please don t say such things pleaded carter listen to me dear ever since i first looked into your eyes you have been the only woman in the world for me oh ain t you the kidder smiled masie how many other girls did you ever tell that but carter persisted and at length be reached the flimsy fluttering little soul of the shopgirl that existed somewhere deep down in her lovely bosom his words penetrated the heart whose very lightness was its safest armor she looked up at him with eyes that saw and a warm glow visited her cool cheeks tremblingly awfully her moth wings closed and she seemed about to settle upon the flower of love some faint glimmer of life and its possibilities on the other side of her glove counter dawned upon her carter felt the change and crowded the opportunity marry me masie be whispered softly and we will go away from this ugly city to beautiful ones we will forget work and business and life will be one long holiday i know where i should take you i have been there often just think of a shore where summer is eternal where the waves are always rip pling on the lovely beach and the people are happy and free as children we will sail to those shores and remain there as long as you please in one of those far away cities there are grand and lovely palaces and towers full of beautiful pictures and statues the streets of the city are water and one travels about in i know said masie sitting up suddenly gondolas yes smiled carter i thought so said masie and then continued carter we will travel on and see whatever we wish in the world after the european cities we will visit india and the ancient cities there and ride on elephants and see the wonder ful temples of the hindoos and brahmins and the japanese gardens and the camel trains and chariot races in persia and all the queer sights of foreign countries don t you think you would like it masie masie rose to her feet i think we had better be going home she said coolly it s getting late carter humored her he had come to know her varying thistle down moods and that it was useless to combat them but he felt a certain happy triumph he had held for a moment though but by a silken thread the soul of his wild psyche and hope was stronger within him once she had folded her wings and her cool band bad closed about his own at the biggest store the next day masie s chum lulu waylaid her in an angle of the counter how are you and your swell friend making it she asked oh him said masie patting her side curls he ain t in it any more say lu what do you think that fellow wanted me to do go on the stage guessed lulu breathlessly nit he s too cheap a guy for that he wanted me to marry him and go down to coney island for a wedding tour dougherty s eye opener big jim dougherty was a sport he belonged to that race of men in manhattan it is a distinct race they are the caribs of the north strong artful self sufficient clannish honorable within the laws of their race holding in lenient contempt neigh boring tribes who bow to the measure of society s tapeline i refer of course to the titled nobility of sportdom there is a class which bears as a qualify ing adjective the substantive belonging to a wind in strument made of a cheap and base metal but the tin mines of cornwall never produced the material for manufacturing descriptive nomenclature for big jim dougherty the habitat of the sport is the lobby or the outside corner of certain hotels and combination restaurants and cafes they are mostly men of different sizes running from small to large but they are unanimous in the possession of a recently shaven blue black cheek and chin and dark overcoats in season with black velvet collars of the domestic life of the sport little is known it has been said that cupid and hymen sometimes take a band in the game and copper the queen of hearts to lose daring theorists have averred not content with simply saying that a sport often contracts a spouse and even incurs descendants sometimes he sits in the game of politics and then at chowder picnics there is a revelation of a mrs sport and little sports in glazed hats with tin pails but mostly the sport is oriental he believes his women folk should not be too patent somewhere be bind grilles or flower ornamented fire escapes they await him there no doubt they tread on rugs from teheran and are diverted by the bulbul and play upon the dulcimer and feed upon sweetmeats but away from his home the sport is an integer he does not as men of other races in manhattan do become the convoy in his unoccupied hours of fluttering laces and high heels that tick off delectably the happy seconds of the evening parade he herds with his own race at corners and delivers a commentary in his carib lingo upon the passing show big jim dougherty had a wife but be did not wear a button portrait of her upon his lapel he bad a home in one of those brown stone iron railed streets on the west side that look like a recently ex cavated bowling alley of pompeii to this home of his mr dougherty repaired each night when the hour was so late as to promise no further diversion in the arch domains of sport by that time the occupant of the monogamistic harem would be in dreamland the bulbul silenced and the hour propitious for slumber big jim always arose at twelve meridian for breakfast and soon afterward he would return to the rendezvous of his crowd he was always vaguely conscious that there was a mrs dougherty he would have received without denial the charge that the quiet neat comfortable little woman across the table at home was his wife in fact he remembered pretty well that they bad been married for nearly four years she would often tell him about the cute tricks of spot the canary and the light haired lady that lived in the window of the flat across the street big jim dougherty even listened to this con versation of hers sometimes he knew that she would have a nice dinner ready for him every evening at seven when he came for it she sometimes went to matinees and she bad a talking machine with six dozen records once when her uncle amos blew in on a wind from up state she went with him to the eden musee surely these things were diversions enough for any woman one afternoon mr dougherty finished his break fast put on his bat and got away fairly for the door when his hand was on the knob be heard his wife s voice jim she said firmly i wish you would take me out to dinner this evening it has been three years since you have been outside the door with me big jim was astounded she bad never asked anything like this before it had the flavor of a totally new proposition but he was a game sport all right be said you be ready when i come at seven none of this wait two minutes till i primp an hour or two kind of business now dele i ll be ready said his wife calmly at seven she descended the stone steps in the pom peian bowling alley at the side of big jim dough erty she wore a dinner gown made of a stuff that the spiders must have woven and of a color that a twilight sky must have contributed a light coat with many admirably unnecessary capes and adorably inutile ribbons floated downward from her shoulders fine feathers do make fine birds and the only re proach in the saying is for the man who refuses to give up his earnings to the ostrich tip industry big jim dougherty was troubled there was a being at his side whom be did not know he thought of the sober hued plumage that this bird of paradise was accustomed to wear in her cage and this winged revelation puzzled him in some way she reminded him of the delia cullen that be had married four years before shyly and rather awkwardly he stalked at her right band after dinner i ll take you back home dele said mr dougherty and then i ll drop back up to selt zer s with the boys you can have swell chuck to night if you want it i made a winning on anaconda yesterday so you can go as far as you like mr dougherty had intended to make the outing with his unwonted wife an inconspicuous one uxori ousness was a weakness that the precepts of the caribs did not countenance if any of his friends of the track the billiard cloth or the square circle had wives they had never complained of the fact in public there were a number of table d hote places on the cross streets near the broad and shining way and to one of these he had purposed to escort her so that the bushel might not be removed from the light of his domesticity but while on the way mr dougherty altered those intentions he had been casting stealthy glances at his attractive companion and he was seized with the conviction that she was no selling plater he re solved to parade with his wife past seltzer s cafe where at this time a number of his tribe would be gathered to view the daily evening procession yes and he would take her to dine at hoogley s the swell est slow lunch warehouse on the line he said to himself the congregation of smooth faced tribal gentle men were on watch at seltzer s as mr dougherty and his reorganized delia passed they stared mo mentarily petrified and then removed their hats a performance as unusual to them as was the astonish ing innovation presented to their gaze by big jim on the latter gentleman s impassive face there ap peared a slight flicker of triumph a faint flicker no more to be observed than the expression called there by the draft of little casino to a four card spade flush hoogley s was animated electric lights shone as indeed they were expected to do and the napery the glassware and the flowers also meritoriously per formed the spectacular duties required of them the guests were numerous well dressed and gay a waiter not necessarily obsequious conducted big jim dougherty and his wife to a table play that menu straight across for what you like dele said big jim it s you for a trough of the gilded oats to night it strikes me that maybe we ve been sticking too fast to home fodder big jim s wife gave her order he looked at her with respect she had mentioned truffles and be bad not known that she knew what truffles were from the wine list she designated an appropriate and de sirable brand he looked at her with some admiration she was beaming with the innocent excitement that woman derives from the exercise of her gregarious ness she was talking to him about a hundred things with animation and delight and as the meal pro gressed her cheeks colorless from a life indoors took on a delicate flush big jim looked around the room and saw that none of the women there had her charm and then he thought of the three years she had suffered immurement uncomplaining and a flush of shame warmed him for he carried fair play as an item in his creed but when the honorable patrick corrigan leader in dougherty s district and a friend of his saw them and came over to the table matters got to the three quarter stretch the honorable patrick was a gal lant man both in deeds and words as for the blar ney stone his previous actions toward it must have been pronounced heavy damages for breach of promise could surely have been obtained had the blarney stone seen fit to sue the honorable patrick jimmy old man he called he clapped dough erty on the back be shone like a midday sun upon delia honorable mr corrigan mrs dougherty said big jim the honorable patrick became a fountain of en tertainment and admiration the waiter had to fetch a third chair for him he made another at the table and the wineglasses were refilled you selfish old rascal he exclaimed shaking an arch finger at big jim to have kept mrs dougherty a secret from us and then big jim dougherty who was no talker sat dumb and saw the wife who had dined every evening for three years at home blossom like a fairy flower quick witty charming full of light and ready talk she received the experienced attack of the honorable patrick on the field of repartee and surprised vanquished delighted him she unfolded her long closed petals and around her the room became a garden they tried to include big jim in the conversation but he was without a vocabulary and then a stray bunch of politicians and good fellows who lived for sport came into the room they saw big jim and the leader and over they came and were made acquainted with mrs dougherty and in a few minutes she was holding a salon half a dozen men surrounded her courtiers all and six found her capable of charming big jim sat grim and kept saying to himself three years three years the dinner came to an end the honorable pat rick reached for mrs dougherty s cloak but that was a matter of action instead of words and dough erty s big band got it first by two seconds while the farewells were being said at the door the honorable patrick smote dougherty mightily between the shoulders jimmy me boy he declared in a giant whis per the madam is a jewel of the first water ye re a lucky dog big jim walked homeward with his wife she seemed quite as pleased with the lights and show windows in the streets as with the admiration of the men in hoogley s as they passed seltzer s they heard the sound of many voices in the cafe the boys would be starting the drinks around now and discussing past performances at the door of their home delia paused the pleasure of the outing radiated softly from her countenance she could not hope for jim of evenings but the glory of this one would tighten her lonely hours for a long time thank you for taking me out jim she said gratefully you ll be going back up to seltzer s now of course to with seltzer s said big jim em emphatically and d pat corrigan does he think i haven t got any eyes and the door closed behind both of them little speck in garnered fruit the honeymoon was at its full there was a flat with the reddest of new carpets tasselled portieres and six steins with pewter lids arranged on a ledge above the wainscoting of the dining room the won der of it was yet upon them neither of them had ever seen a yellow primrose by the river s brim but if such a sight had met their eyes at that time it would have seemed like well whatever the poet expected the right kind of people to see in it besides a prim rose the bride sat in the rocker with her feet resting upon the world she was wrapt in rosy dreams and a kimono of the same hue she wondered what the peo ple in greenland and tasmania and beloochistan were saying one to another about her marriage to kid mcgarry not that it made any difference there was no welter weight from london to the southern cross that could stand up four hours no four rounds with her bridegroom and he had been hers for three weeks and the crook of her little finger could sway him more than the fist of any pounder in the world love when it is ours is the other name for self abnegation and sacrifice when it belongs to people across the airshaft it means arrogance and self con ceit the bride crossed her oxfords and looked thought fully at the distemper cupids on the ceiling precious said she with the air of cleopatra asking antony for rome done up in tissue paper and delivered at residence i think i would like a peach kid mcgarry arose and put on his coat and hat he was serious shaven sentimental and spry all right said he as coolly as though be were only agreeing to sign articles to fight the champion of england i ll step down and cop one out for you see don t be long said the bride i ll be lonesome without my naughty boy get a nice ripe one after a series of farewells that would have befitted an imminent voyage to foreign parts the kid went down to the street here he not unreasonably hesitated for the season was yet early spring and there seemed small chance of wresting anywhere from those chill streets and stores the coveted luscious guerdon of summer s golden prime at the italian s fruit stand on the corner be stopped and cast a contemptuous eye over the dis play of papered oranges highly polished apples and wan sun hungry bananas gotta da peach asked the kid in the tongue of dante the lover of lovers ah no sighed the vender not for one mont com a da peach too soon gotta da nice a orange like a da orange scornful the kid pursued his quest he entered the all night chop house cafe and bowling alley of his friend and admirer justus o callahan the o callahan was about in his institution looking for leaks i want it straight said the kid to him the old woman has got a hunch that she wants a peach now if you ve got a peach cal get it out quick i want it and others like it if you ve got em in plural quantities the house is yours said o callahan but there s no peach in it it s too soon i don t sup pose you could even find em at one of the broadway joints that s too bad when a lady fixes her mouth for a certain kind of fruit nothing else won t do it s too late now to find any of the first class fruiterers open but if you think the missis would like some nice oranges i ve just got a box of fine ones in that she might much obliged cal it s a peach proposition right from the ring of the gong i ll try further the time was nearly midnight as the kid walked down the west side avenue few stores were open and such as were practically hooted at the idea of a peach but in her moated flat the bride confidently awaited her persian fruit a champion welter weight not find a peach not stride triumphantly over the seasons and the zodiac and the almanac to fetch an amsden s june or a georgia cling to his owny own the kid s eye caught sight of a window that was lighted and gorgeous with nature s most entrancing colors the light suddenly went out the kid sprinted and caught the fruiterer locking his door peaches said he with extreme deliberation well no sir not for three or four weeks yet i haven t any idea where you might find some there may be a few in town from under the glass but they d be bard to locate maybe at one of the more expen sive hotels some place where there s plenty of money to waste i ve got some very fine oranges though from a shipload that came in to day the kid lingered on the corner for a moment and then set out briskly toward a pair of green lights that flanked the steps of a building down a dark side street captain around anywhere he asked of the desk sergeant of the police station at that moment the captain came briskly forward from the rear he was in plain clothes and had a busy air hello kid he said to the pugilist thought you were bridal touring got back yesterday i m a solid citizen now think i ll take an interest in municipal doings how would it suit you to get into denver dick s place to night cap past performances said the captain twisting his moustache denver was closed up two months ago correct said the kid rafferty chased him out of the forty third he s running in your pre cinct now and his game s bigger than ever i m down on this gambling business i can put you against his game in my precinct growled the captain are you sure kid i ll take it as a favor have you got the entree how is it to be done hammers said the kid they haven t got any steel on the doors yet you ll need ten men no they won t let me in the place denver has been trying to do me he thought i tipped him off for the other raid i didn t though you want to hurry i ve got to get back home the house is only three blocks from here before ten minutes had sped the captain with a dozen men stole with their guide into the hallway of a dark and virtuous looking building in which many businesses were conducted by day third floor rear said the kid softly i ll lead the way two axemen faced the door that he pointed out to them it seems all quiet said the captain doubtfully are you sure your tip is straight cut away said the kid it s on me if it ain t the axes crashed through the as yet unprotected door a blaze of light from within poured through the smashed panels the door fell and the raiders rang into the room with their guns handy the big room was furnished with the gaudy mag nificence dear to denver dick s western ideas vari ous well patronized games were in progress about fifty men who were in the room rushed upon the police in a grand break for personal liberty the plain clothes men had to do a little club swinging more than half the patrons escaped denver dick had graced his game with his own presence that night he led the rush that was in tended to sweep away the smaller body of raiders but when be saw the kid his manner became personal being in the heavyweight class be cast himself joy fully upon his slighter enemy and they rolled down a flight of stairs in each others arms on the land ing they separated and arose and then the kid was able to use some of his professional tactics which had been useless to him while in the excited clutch of a pound sporting gentleman who was about to lose worth of paraphernalia after vanquishing his adversary the kid hurried upstairs and through the gambling room into a smaller apartment connecting by an arched doorway here was a long table set with choicest chinaware and silver and lavishly furnished with food of that expensive and spectacular sort of which the devotees of sport are supposed to be fond here again was to be perceived the liberal and florid taste of the gen tleman with the urban cognomenal prefix a no patent leather shoe protruded a few of its inches outside the tablecloth along the floor the kid seized this and plucked forth a black man in a white tie and the garb of a servitor get up commanded the kid are you in charge of this free lunch yes sah i was has they done pinched us ag in boss looks that way listen to me are there any peaches in this layout if there ain t i ll have to throw up the sponge there was three dozen sah when the game opened this evenin but i reckon the gentlemen done eat em all up if you d like to eat a fust rate orange sah i kin find you some get busy ordered the kid sternly and move whatever peach crop you ve got quick or there ll be trouble if anybody oranges me again to night i ll knock his face off the raid on denver dick s high priced and prodi gal luncheon revealed one lone last peach that had escaped the epicurean jaws of the followers of chance into the kid s pocket it went and that in defatigable forager departed immediately with his prize with scarcely a glance at the scene on the sidewalk below where the officers were loading their prisoners into the patrol wagons be moved homeward with long swift strides his heart was light as be went so rode the knights back to camelot after perils and high deeds done for their ladies fair the kid s lady had com manded him and be had obeyed true it was but a peach that she had craved but it had been no small deed to glean a peach at midnight from that wintry city where yet the february snows lay like iron she had asked for a peach she was his bride in his pocket the peach was warming in his band that held it for fear that it might fall out and be lost on the way the kid turned in at an all night drug store and said to the spectacled clerk say sport i wish you d size up this rib of mine and see if it s broke i was in a little scrap and bumped down a flight or two of stairs the druggist made an examination it isn t broken was his diagnosis but you have a bruise there that looks like you d fallen off the flatiron twice that s all right said the kid let s have your clothesbrush please the bride waited in the rosy glow of the pink lamp shade the miracles were not all passed away by breathing a desire for some slight thing a flower a pomegranate a oh yes a peach she could send forth her man into the night into the world which could not withstand him and he would do her bidding and now be stood by her chair and laid the peach in her band naughty boy she said fondly did i say a peach i think i would much rather have had an orange blest be the bride the harbinger long before the springtide is felt in the dull bosom of the yokel does the city man know that the grass green goddess is upon her throne he sits at his breakfast eggs and toast begirt by stone walls opens his morning paper and sees journalism leave vernal ism at the post for whereas spring s couriers were once the evi dence of our finer senses now the associated press does the trick the warble of the first robin in hackensack the stirring of the maple sap in bennington the bud ding of the pussy willows along main street in syra cuse the first chirp of the bluebird the swan song of the blue point the annual tornado in st louis the plaint of the peach pessimist from pompton n j the regular visit of the tame wild goose with a broken leg to the pond near bilgewater junction the base attempt of the drug trust to boost the price of quinine foiled in the house by congressman jinks the first tall poplar struck by lightning and the usual stunned picknickers who had taken refuge the first crack of the ice jam in the allegheny river the finding of a violet in its mossy bed by the correspondent at round corners these are the advance signs of the burgeoning season that are wired into the wise city while the farmer sees nothing but winter upon his dreary fields but these be mere externals the true harbinger is the heart when strephon seeks his chloe and mike his maggie then only is spring arrived and the newspaper report of the five foot rattler killed in squire pettigrew s pasture confirmed ere the first violet blew mr peters mr ragsdale and mr kidd sat together on a bench in union square and conspired mr peters was the d artag nan of the loafers there he was the dingiest the laziest the sorriest brown blot against the green back ground of any bench in the park but just then he was the most important of the trio mr peters had a wife this had not heretofore affected his standing with ragsy and kidd but to day it invested him with a peculiar interest his friends having escaped matrimony had shown a disposition to deride mr peters for his venture on that troubled sea but at last they had been forced to acknowledge that either he had been gifted with a large foresight or that he was one of fortune s lucky sons for mrs peters had a dollar a whole dollar bill good and receivable by the government for customs taxes and all public dues how to get possession of that dollar was the question up for discussion by the three musty musketeers how do you know it was a dollar asked ragsy the immensity of the sum inclining him to scepticism the coalman seen her have it said mr peters she went out and done some washing yesterday and look what she give me for breakfast the heel of a loaf and a cup of coffee and her with a dollar it s fierce said ragsy say we go up and punch er and stick a towel in er mouth and cop the coin suggested kidd viciously y ain t afraid of a woman are you she might holler and have us pinched demurred ragsy i don t believe in slugging no woman in a houseful of people gent men said mr peters severely through his russet stubble remember that you are speaking of my wife a man who would lift his hand to a lady except in the way of maguire said ragsy pointedly has got his bock beer sign out if we had a dollar we could hush up said mr peters licking his lips we got to get that case note somehow boys ain t what s a man s wife s his leave it to me i ll go over to the house and get it wait here for me i ve seen em give up quick and tell you where it s hid if you kick em in the ribs said kidd no man would kick a woman said peters vir tuously a little choking just a touch on the windpipe that gets away with em and no marks left wait for me i ll bring back that dollar boys high up in a tenement house between second ave nue and the river lived the peterses in a back room so gloomy that the landlord blushed to take the rent for it mrs peters worked at sundry times doing odd jobs of scrubbing and washing mr peters had a pure unbroken record of five years without having earned a penny and yet they clung together shar ing each other s hatred and misery being creatures of habit of habit the power that keeps the earth from flying to pieces though there is some silly theory of gravitation mrs peters reposed her pounds on the safer of the two chairs and gazed stolidly out the one win dow at the brick wall opposite her eyes were red and damp the furniture could have been carried away on a pushcart but no pushcart man would have removed it as a gift the door opened to admit mr peters his fox terrier eyes expressed a wish his wife s diagnosis located correctly the seat of it but misread it hun ger instead of thirst you ll get nothing more to eat till night she said looking out of the window again take your hound dog s face out of the room mr peters s eye calculated the distance between them by taking her by surprise it might be pos sible to spring upon her overthrow her and apply the throttling tactics of which he had boasted to his waiting comrades true it had been only a boast never yet had be dared to lay violent bands upon her but with the thoughts of the delicious cool bock or culmbacher bracing his nerves he was near to upsetting his own theories of the treatment due by a gentleman to a lady but with his loafer s love for the more artistic and less strenuous way he chose diplomacy first the high card in the game the as sumed attitude of success already attained you have a dollar he said loftily but signifi cantly in the tone that goes with the lighting of a cigar when the properties are at hand i have said mrs peters producing the bill from her bosom and crackling it teasingly i am offered a position in a in a tea store said mr peters i am to begin work to morrow but it will be necessary for me to buy a pair of you are a liar said mrs peters reinterring the note no tea store nor no a b c store nor no junk shop would have you i rubbed the skin off both me hands washin jumpers and overalls to make that dollar do you think it come out of them suds to buy the kind you put into you skiddoo get your mind off of money evidently the poses of talleyrand were not worth one hundred cents on that dollar but diplomacy is dexterous the artistic temperament of mr peters lifted him by the straps of his congress gaiters and set him on new ground he called up a look of des perate melancholy to his eyes clara he said hollowly to struggle further is useless you have always misunderstood me heaven knows i have striven with all my might to keep my head above the waves of misfortune but cut out the rainbow of hope and that stuff about walkin one by one through the narrow isles of spain said mrs peters with a sigh i ve heard it so often there s an ounce bottle of carbolic on the shelf behind the empty coffee can drink hearty mr peters reflected what next the old ex pedients had failed the two musty musketeers were awaiting him hard by the ruined chateau that is to say on a park bench with rickety cast iron legs his honor was at stake he had engaged to storm the castle single handed and bring back the treas ure that was to furnish them wassail and solace and all that stood between him and the coveted dollar was his wife once a little girl whom he could aha why not again once with soft words he could as they say twist her around his little finger why not again not for years had he tried it grim poverty and mutual hatred had killed all that but ragsy and kidd were waiting for him to bring the dollar mr peters took a surreptitiously keen look at his wife her formless bulk overflowed the chair she kept her eyes fixed out the window in a strange kind of trance her eyes showed that she had been re cently weeping i wonder said mr peters to himself if there d be anything in it the window was open upon its outlook of brick walls and drab barren back yards except for the mildness of the air that entered it might have been midwinter yet in the city that turns such a frown ing face to besieging spring but spring doesn t come with the thunder of cannon she is a sapper and a miner and you must capitulate i ll try it said mr peters to himself making a wry face he went up to his wife and put his arm across her shoulders clara darling he said in tones that shouldn t have fooled a baby seal why should we have hard words ain t you my own tootsum wootsums a black mark against you mr peters in the sa red ledger of cupid charges of attempted graft are filed against you and of forgery and utterance of two of love s holiest of appellations but the miracle of spring was wrought into the back room over the back alley between the black walls had crept the harbinger it was ridiculous and yet well it is a rat trap and you madam and sir and all of us are in it red and fat and crying like niobe or niagara mrs peters threw her arms around her lord and dissolved upon him mr peters would have striven to extricate the dollar bill from its deposit vault but his arms were bound to his sides do you love me james asked mrs peters madly said james but you are ill exclaimed mrs peters why are you so pale and tired looking i feel weak said mr peters i oh wait i know what it is wait james i ll be back in a minutes with a parting bug that revived in mr peters recollections of the terrible turk his wife hurried out of the room and down the stairs mr peters hitched his thumbs under his sus penders all right he confided to the ceiling i ve got her going i hadn t any idea the old girl was soft any more under the foolish rib well sir ain t i the claude melnotte of the lower east side what it s a to shot that i get the dollar i wonder what she went out for i guess she s gone to tell mrs muldoon on the second floor that we re recon ciled i ll remember this soft soap and ragsy was talking about slugging her mrs peters came back with a bottle of sarsapa rilla i m glad i happened to have that dollar she said you re all run down boney mr peters had a tablespoonful of the stuff in serted into him then mrs peters sat on his lap and murmured call me tootsum wootsums again james he sat still held there by his materialized goddess of spring spring had come on the bench in union square mr ragsdale and mr kidd squirmed tongue parched awaiting d artagnan and his dollar i wish i had choked her at first said mr peters to himself while the auto waits promptly at the beginning of twilight came again to that quiet corner of that quiet small park the girl in gray she sat upon a bench and read a book for there was yet to come a half hour in which print could be accomplished to repeat her dress was gray and plain enough to mask its impeccancy of style and fit a large meshed veil imprisoned her turban hat and a face that shone through it with a calm and unconscious beauty she had come there at the same hour on the day previous and on the day before that and there was one who knew it the young man who knew it hovered near relying upon burnt sacrifices to the great joss luck his piety was rewarded for in turning a page her book slipped from her fingers and bounded from the bench a full yard away the young man pounced upon it with instant avid ity returning it to its owner with that air that seems to flourish in parks and public places a compound of gallantry and hope tempered with respect for the policeman on the beat in a pleasant voice be risked an inconsequent remark upon the weather that in troductory topic responsible for so much of the world s unhappiness and stood poised for a mo ment awaiting his fate the girl looked him over leisurely at his ordinary neat dress and his features distinguished by nothing particular in the way of expression you may sit down if you like she said in a full deliberate contralto really i would like to have you do so the light is too bad for reading i would prefer to talk the vassal of luck slid upon the seat by her side with complaisance do you know be said speaking the formula with which park chairmen open their meetings that you are quite the stunningest girl i have seen in a long time i had my eye on you yesterday didn t know somebody was bowled over by those pretty lamps of yours did you honeysuckle whoever you are said the girl in icy tones you must remember that i am a lady i will excuse the remark you have just made because the mistake was doubtless not an unnatural one in your circle i asked you to sit down if the invitation must con stitute me your honeysuckle consider it with drawn i earnestly beg your pardon pleaded the young ran his expression of satisfaction had changed to one of penitence and humility it was my fault you know i mean there are girls in parks you know that is of course you don t know but abandon the subject if you please of course i know now tell me about these people passing and crowding each way along these paths where are they going why do they hurry so are they happy the young man had promptly abandoned his air of coquetry his cue was now for a waiting part he could not guess the role be would be expected to play it is interesting to watch them he replied pos tulating her mood it is the wonderful drama of life some are going to supper and some to er other places one wonders what their histories are i do not said the girl i am not so inquisi tive i come here to sit because here only can i be tear the great common throbbing heart of hu manity my part in life is cast where its beats are never felt can you surmise why i spoke to you mr parkenstacker supplied the young man then be looked eager and hopeful no said the girl holding up a slender finger and smiling slightly you would recognize it im mediately it is impossible to keep one s name out of print or even one s portrait this veil and this hat of my maid furnish me with an incog you should have seen the chauffeur stare at it when he thought i did not see candidly there are five or six names that belong in the holy of holies and mine by the accident of birth is one of them i spoke to you mr stackenpot parkenstacker corrected the young man mod estly mr parkenstacker because i wanted to talk for once with a natural man one unspoiled by the despicable gloss of wealth and supposed social su periority oh you do not know how weary i am of it money money money and of the men who surround me dancing like little marionettes all cut by the same pattern i am sick of pleasure of jewels of travel of society of luxuries of all kinds i always had an idea ventured the young man hesitatingly that money must be a pretty good thing a competence is to be desired but when you leave so many millions that she concluded the sentence with a gesture of despair it is the mo otony of it she continued that palls drives dinners theatres balls suppers with the gilding of superfluous wealth over it all sometimes the very tinkle of the ice in my champagne glass nearly drives me mad mr parkenstacker looked ingenuously interested i have always liked he said to read and hear about the ways of wealthy and fashionable folks i suppose i am a bit of a snob but i like to have my information accurate now i had formed the opin ion that champagne is cooled in the bottle and not by placing ice in the glass the girl gave a musical laugh of genuine amuse ment you should know she explained in an indul gent tone that we of the non useful class depend for our amusement upon departure from precedent just now it is a fad to put ice in champagne the idea was originated by a visiting prince of tartary while dining at the waldorf it will soon give way to some other whim just as at a dinner party this week on madison avenue a green kid glove was laid by the plate of each guest to be put on and used while eating olives i see admitted the young man humbly these special diversions of the inner circle do not become familiar to the common public sometimes continued the girl acknowledging his confession of error by a slight bow i have thought that if i ever should love a man it would be one of lowly station one who is a worker and not a drone but doubtless the claims of caste and wealth will prove stronger than my inclination just now i am besieged by two one is a grand duke of a german principality i think he has or has bad a wife somewhere driven mad by his intemperance and cruelty the other is an english marquis so cold and mercenary that i even prefer the diabolism of the duke what is it that impels me to tell you these things mr packenstacker parkenstacker breathed the young man in deed you cannot know how much i appreciate your confidences the girl contemplated him with the calm imper sonal regard that befitted the difference in their sta tions what is your line of business mr parken stacker she asked a very humble one but i hope to rise in the world were you really in earnest when you said that you could love a man of lowly position indeed i was but i said might there is the grand duke and the marquis you know yes no calling could be too humble were the man what i would wish him to be i work declared mr parkenstacker in a res taurant the girl shrank slightly not as a waiter she said a little imploringly labor is noble but personal attendance you know valets and i am not a waiter i am cashier in on the street they faced that bounded the opposite side of the park was the brilliant electric sign restau rant i am cashier in that restaurant you am there the girl consulted a tiny watch set in a bracelet of rich design upon her left wrist and rose hurriedly she thrust her book into a glittering reticule sus pended from her waist for which however the book was too large why are you not at work she asked i am on the night turn said the young man it is yet an hour before my period begins may i not hope to see you again i do not know perhaps but the whim may not seize me again i must go quickly now there is a dinner and a box at the play and oh the same old round perhaps you noticed an automobile at the upper corner of the park as you came one with a white body and red running gear asked the young man knitting his brows reflectively yes i always come in that pierre waits for me there he supposes me to be shopping in the de partment store across the square conceive of the bondage of the life wherein we must deceive even our chauffeurs good night but it is dark now said mr parkenstacker and the park is full of rude men may i not walk if you have the slightest regard for my wishes said the girl firmly you will remain at this bench for ten minutes after i have left i do not mean to accuse you but you are probably aware that autos generally bear the monogram of their owner again good night swift and stately she moved away through the dusk the young man watched her graceful form as she reached the pavement at the park s edge and turned up along it toward the corner where stood the automobile then he treacherously and unhesitat ingly began to dodge and skim among the park trees and shrubbery in a course parallel to her route keep ing her well in sight when she reached the corner she turned her head to glance at the motor car and then passed it con tinuing on across the street sheltered behind a con venient standing cab the young man followed her movements closely with his eyes passing down the sidewalk of the street opposite the park she entered the restaurant with the blazing sign the place was one of those frankly glaring establishments all white paint and glass where one may dine cheaply and conspicuously the girl penetrated the restaurant to some retreat at its rear whence she quickly emerged without her bat and veil the cashier s desk was well to the front a red head girl an the stool climbed down glancing pointedly at the clock as she did so the girl in gray mounted in her place the young man thrust his hands into his pockets and walked slowly back along the sidewalk at the corner his foot struck a small paper covered volume lying there sending it sliding to the edge of the turf by its picturesque cover he recognized it as the book the girl had been reading he picked it up carelessly and saw that its title was new arabian nights the author being of the name of stevenson he dropped it again upon the grass and lounged irresolute for a minute then he stepped into the automobile reclined upon the cushions and said two words to the chauffeur club henri a comedy in rubber one may hope in spite of the metaphorists to avoid the breath of the deadly upas tree one may by great good fortune succeed in blacking the eye of the basilisk one might even dodge the attentions of cer berus and argus but no man alive or dead can es cape the gaze of the rubberer new york is the caoutchouc city there are many of course who go their ways making money without turning to the right or the left but there is a tribe abroad wonderfully composed like the martians solely of eyes and means of locomotion these devotees of curiosity swarm like flies in a moment in a struggling breathless circle about the scene of an unusual occurrence if a workman opens a manhole if a street car runs over a man from north tarrytown if a little boy drops an egg on his way home from the grocery if a casual house or two drops into the subway if a lady loses a nickel through a hole in the lisle thread if the police drag a telephone and a racing chart forth from an ibsen society reading room if senator depew or mr chuck connors walks out to take the air if any of these incidents or accidents takes place you will see the mad irresistible rush of the rubber tribe to the spot the importance of the event does not count they gaze with equal interest and absorption at a cho rus girl or at a man painting a liver pill sign they will form as deep a cordon around a man with a club foot as they will around a balked automobile they have the furor rubberendi they are optical glut tons feasting and fattening on the misfortunes of their fellow beings they gloat and pore and glare and squint and stare with their fishy eyes like goggle eyed perch at the book baited with calamity it would seem that cupid would find these ocular vampires too cold game for his calorific shafts but have we not yet to discover an immune even among the protozoa yes beautiful romance descended upon two of this tribe and love came into their hearts as they crowded about the prostrate form of a man who had been run over by a brewery wagon william pry was the first on the spot he was an expert at such gatherings with an expression of in tense happiness on his features be stood over the vic tim of the accident listening to his groans as if to the sweetest music when the crowd of spectators had swelled to a closely packed circle william saw a violent commotion in the crowd opposite him men were hurled aside like ninepins by the impact of some moving body that clove them like the rush of a tor nado with elbows umbrella hat pin tongue and fingernails doing their duty violet seymour forced her way through the mob of onlookers to the first row strong men who even had been able to secure a seat on the harlem express staggered back like chil dren as she bucked centre two large lady spectators who bad seen the duke of roxburgh married and had often blocked traffic on twenty third street fell back into the second row with ripped shirtwaists when violet had finished with them william pry loved her at first sight the ambulance removed the unconscious agent of cupid william and violet remained after the crowd had dispersed they were true rubberers people who leave the scene of an accident with the ambulance have not genuine caoutchouc in the cosmogony of their necks the delicate fine flavor of the affair is to be bad only in the after taste in gloating over the spot in gazing fixedly at the houses opposite in hovering there in a dream more exquisite than the opium eater s ecstasy william pry and violet sey mour were connoisseurs in casualties they knew bow to extract full enjoyment from every incident presently they looked at each other violet had a brown birthmark on her neck as large as a silver half dollar william fixed his eyes upon it william pry had inordinately bowed legs violet allowed her gaze to linger unswervingly upon them face to face they stood thus for moments each staring at the other etiquette would not allow them to speak but in the caoutchouc city it is permitted to gaze with out stint at the trees in the parks and at the physi cal blemishes of a fellow creature at length with a sigh they parted but cupid had been the driver of the brewery wagon and the wheel that broke a leg united two fond hearts the next meeting of the hero and heroine was in front of a board fence near broadway the day had been a disappointing one there had been no fights on the street children had kept from under the wheels of the street cars cripples and fat men in negligee shirts were scarce nobody seemed to be inclined to slip on banana peels or fall down with heart disease even the sport from kokomo ind who claims to be a cousin of ex mayor low and scatters nickels from a cab window had not put in his appearance there was nothing to stare at and william pry had premonitions of ennui but he saw a large crowd scrambling and pushing excitedly in front of a billboard sprinting for it he knocked down an old woman and a child carrying a bottle of milk and fought his way like a demon into the mass of spectators already in the inner line stood violet seymour with one sleeve and two gold fill ings gone a corset steel puncture and a sprained wrist but happy she was looking at what there was to see a man was painting upon the fence eat bricklets they fill your face violet blushed when she saw william pry william jabbed a lady in a black silk raglan in the ribs kicked a boy in the shin bit an old gentleman on the left ear and managed to crowd nearer to violet they stood for an hour looking at the man paint the letters then william s love could be repressed no longer he touched her on the arm come with me he said i know where there is a bootblack without an adam s apple she looked up at him shyly yet with unmistakable love transfiguring her countenance and you have saved it for me she asked trembling with the first dim ecstasy of a woman be loved together they hurried to the bootblack s stand an hour they spent there gazing at the malformed youth a window cleaner fell from the fifth story

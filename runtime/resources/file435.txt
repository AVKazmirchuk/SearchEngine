ll put you to work thus the names of john bascom and charles norwood were added to the pay roll of the diamond cross the two left for the round up camp immediately after dinner their directions were simple but sufficient keep down the arroyo for fifteen miles till you get there both being strangers from afar young spirited and thus thrown together by chance for a long ride it is likely that the comradeship that afterward existed so strongly between them began that afternoon as they meandered along the little valley of the canada verda they reached their destination just after sunset the main camp of the round up was comfortably located on the bank of a long water hole under a fine mott of timber a number of small a tents pitched upon grassy spots and the big wall tent for provisions showed that the camp was intended to be occupied for a considerable length of time the round up had ridden in but a few moments before hungry and tired to a supperless camp the boys were engaged in an emulous display of anathemas supposed to fit the case of the absconding cook while they were unsaddling and hobbling their ponies the newcomer rode in and inquired for pink saunders the boss ol the round up came forth and was given the superintendent s note pink saunders though a boss during working hours was a humorist in camp where everybody from cook to superintendent is equal after reading the note he waved his hand toward the camp and shouted ceremoniously at the top of his voice gentlemen allow me to present to you the marquis and miss sally at the words both the new arrivals betray confusion the newly employed cook started with a surprised look on his face but immediately recollecting that miss sally is the generic name for the male cook in every west texas cow camp he recovered his composure with a grin at his own expense his companion showed little less discomposure even turning angrily with a bitten lip and reaching for his saddle pommel as if to remount his pony but miss sally touched his arm and said laughingly come now marquis that was quite a compliment from saunders it s that distinguished air of yours and aristocratic nose that made him call you that he began to unsaddle and the marquis restored to equanimity followed his example rolling up his sleeves miss sally sprang for the grub wagon shouting i m the new cook b thunder some of you chaps rustle a little wood for a fire and i ll guarantee you a hot square meal inside of thirty minutes miss sally s energy and good humor as he ransacked the grub wagon for coffee flour and bacon won the good opinion of the camp instantly and also in days following the marquis after becoming better acquainted proved to be a cheerful pleasant fellow always a little reserved and taking no part in the rough camp frolics but the boys gradually came to respect this reserve which fitted the title saunders had given him and even to like him for it saunders had assigned him to a place holding the herd during the cuttings he proved to be a skilful rider and as good with the lariat or in the branding pen as most of them the marquis and miss sally grew to be quite close comrades after supper was over and everything cleaned up you would generally find them together miss sally smoking his brier root pipe and the marquis plaiting a quirt or scraping rawhide for a new pair of hobbles the superintendent did not forget his promise to keep an eye on the cook several times when visiting the camp he held long talks with him he seemed to have taken a fancy to miss sally one afternoon he rode up on his way back to the ranch from a tour of the camps and said to him there ll be a man here in the morning to take your place as soon as he shows up you come to the ranch i want you to take charge of the ranch accounts and correspondence i want somebody that i can depend upon to keep things straight when i m away the wages ll be all right the diamond cross ll hold its end up with a man who ll look after its interests all right said miss sally as quietly as if he had expected the notice all along any objections to my bringing my wife down to the ranch you married said the superintendent frowning a little you didn t mention it when we were talking because i m not said the cook but i d like to be thought i d wait till i got a job under roof i couldn t ask her to live in a cow camp right agreed the superintendent a camp isn t quite the place for a married man but well there s plenty of room at the house and if you suit us as well as i think you will you can afford it you write to her to come on all right said miss sally again i ll ride in as soon as i am relieved to morrow it was a rather chilly night and after supper the cow punchers were lounging about a big fire of dried mesquite chunks their usual exchange of jokes and repartee had dwindled almost to silence but silence in a cow camp generally betokens the brewing of mischief miss sally and the marquis were seated upon a log discussing the relative merits of the lengthened or shortened stirrup in long distance riding the marquis arose presently and went to a tree near by to examine some strips of rawhide he was seasoning for making a lariat just as he left a little puff of wind blew some scraps of tobacco from a

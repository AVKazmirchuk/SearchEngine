coast with wretched exiles that make men forget their trusts that drag the lady interrupted him with a weary gesture there is no need to continue your insults she said coldly i do not understand what you are saying nor do i know what mad blunder you are making but if the inspection of the contents of a gentleman s portmanteau will rid me of you let us delay it no longer she passed quickly and noiselessly into the other room and returned with the heavy leather valise which she handed to the american with an air of patient contempt goodwin set the valise quickly upon the table and began to unfasten the straps the lady stood by with an expression of infinite scorn and weariness upon her face the valise opened wide to a powerful sidelong wrench goodwin dragged out two or three articles of clothing exposing the bulk of its contents package after package of tightly packed united states bank and treasury notes of large denomination reckoning from the high figures written upon the paper bands that bound them the total must have come closely upon the hundred thousand mark goodwin glanced swiftly at the woman and saw with surprise and a thrill of pleasure that he wondered at that she had experienced an unmistakeable shock her eyes grew wide she gasped and leaned heavily against the table she had been ignorant then he inferred that her companion had looted the government treasury but why he angrily asked himself should he be so well pleased to think this wandering and unscrupulous singer not so black as report had painted her a noise in the other room startled them both the door swung open and a tall elderly dark complexioned man recently shaven hurried into the room all the pictures of president miraflores represent him as the possessor of a luxuriant supply of dark and carefully tended whiskers but the story of the barber esteban had prepared goodwin for the change the man stumbled in from the dark room his eyes blinking at the lamplight and heavy from sleep what does this mean he demanded in excellent english with a keen and perturbed look at the american robbery very near it answered goodwin but i rather think i m in time to prevent it i represent the people to whom this money belongs and i have come to convey it back to them he thrust his hand into a pocket of his loose linen coat the other man s hand went quickly behind him don t draw called goodwin sharply i ve got you covered from my pocket the lady stepped forward and laid one hand upon the shoulder of her hesitating companion she pointed to the table tell me the truth the truth she said in a low voice whose money is that the man did not answer he gave a deep long drawn sigh leaned and kissed her on the forehead stepped back into the other room and closed the door goodwin foresaw his purpose and jumped for the door but the report of the pistol echoed as his hand touched the knob a heavy fall followed and some one swept him aside and struggled into the room of the fallen man a desolation thought goodwin greater than that derived from the loss of cavalier and gold must have been in the heart of the enchantress to have wrung from her in that moment the cry of one turning to the all forgiving all comforting earthly consoler to have made her call out from that bloody and dishonored room oh mother mother mother but there was an alarm outside the barber esteban at the sound of the shot had raised his voice and the shot itself had aroused half the town a pattering of feet came up the street and official orders rang out on the still air goodwin had a duty to perform circumstances had made him the custodian of his adopted country s treasure swiftly cramming the money into the valise he closed it leaned far out of the window and dropped it into a thick orange tree in the little inclosure below they will tell you in coralio as they delight in telling the stranger of the conclusion of that tragic flight they will tell you how the upholders of the law came apace when the alarm was sounded the comandante in red slippers and a jacket like a head waiter s and girded sword the soldiers with their interminable guns followed by outnumbering officers struggling into their gold and lace epaulettes the bare footed policemen the only capables in the lot and ruffled citizens of every hue and description they say that the countenance of the dead man was marred sadly by the effects of the shot but he was identified as the fallen president by both goodwin and the barber esteban on the next morning messages began to come over the mended telegraph wire and the story of the flight from the capital was given out to the public in san mateo the revolutionary party had seized the sceptre of government without opposition and the vivas of the mercurial populace quickly effaced the interest belonging to the unfortunate miraflores they will relate to you how the new government sifted the towns and raked the roads to find the valise containing anchuria s surplus capital which the president was known to have carried with him but all in vain in coralio senor goodwin himself led the searching party which combed that town as carefully as a woman combs her hair but the money was not found so they buried the dead man without honors back of the town near the little bridge that spans the mangrove swamp and for a real a boy will show you his grave they say that the old woman in whose hut the barber shaved the president placed the wooden slab at his head and burned the inscription

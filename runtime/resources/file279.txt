onions chip it in toward the dinner and line yourself inside with the best stew you ever licked a spoon over must two ladies knock a young gentleman down and drag him inside for the honor of dining with em no harm shall befall you little brother loosen up and fall into line the young man s pale face relaxed into a grin believe i ll go you he said brightening if my onion is good as a credential i ll accept the invitation gladly it s good as that but better as seasoning said hetty you come and stand outside the door till i ask my lady friend if she has any objections and don t run away with that letter of recommendation before i come out hetty went into her room and closed the door the young man waited outside cecilia kid said the shop girl oiling the sharp saw of her voice as well as she could there s an onion outside with a young man attached i ve asked him in to dinner you ain t going to kick are you oh dear said cecilia sitting up and patting her artistic hair she cast a mournful glance at the ferry boat poster on the wall nit said hetty it ain t him you re up against real life now i believe you said your hero friend had money and automobiles this is a poor skeezicks that s got nothing to eat but an onion but he s easy spoken and not a freshy i imagine he s been a gentleman he s so low down now and we need the onion shall i bring him in i ll guarantee his behavior hetty dear sighed cecilia i m so hungry what difference does it make whether he s a prince or a burglar i don t care bring him in if he s got anything to eat with him hetty went back into the hall the onion man was gone her heart missed a beat and a gray look settled over her face except on her nose and cheek bones and then the tides of life flowed in again for she saw him leaning out of the front window at the other end of the hall she hurried there he was shouting to some one below the noise of the street overpowered the sound of her footsteps she looked down over his shoulder saw whom he was speaking to and heard his words he pulled himself in from the window sill and saw her standing over him hetty s eyes bored into him like two steel gimlets don t lie to me she said calmly what were you going to do with that onion the young man suppressed a cough and faced her resolutely his manner was that of one who had been bearded sufficiently i was going to eat it said he with emphatic slowness just as i told you before and you have nothing else to eat at home not a thing what kind of work do you do i am not working at anything just now then why said hetty with her voice set on its sharpest edge do you lean out of windows and give orders to chauffeurs in green automobiles in the street below the young man flushed and his dull eyes began to sparkle because madam said he in accelerando tones i pay the chauffeur s wages and i own the automobile and also this onion this onion madam he flourished the onion within an inch of hetty s nose the shop lady did not retreat a hair s breadth then why do you eat onions she said with biting contempt and nothing else i never said i did retorted the young man heatedly i said i had nothing else to eat where i live i am not a delicatessen store keeper then why pursued hetty inflexibly were you going to eat a raw onion my mother said the young man always made me eat one for a cold pardon my referring to a physical infirmity but you may have noticed that i have a very very severe cold i was going to eat the onion and go to bed i wonder why i am standing here and apologizing to you for it how did you catch this cold went on hetty suspiciously the young man seemed to have arrived at some extreme height of feeling there were two modes of descent open to him a burst of rage or a surrender to the ridiculous he chose wisely and the empty hall echoed his hoarse laughter you re a dandy said he and i don t blame you for being careful i don t mind telling you i got wet i was on a north river ferry a few days ago when a girl jumped overboard of course i hetty extended her hand interrupting his story give me the onion she said the young man set his jaw a trifle harder give me the onion she repeated he grinned and laid it in her hand then hetty s infrequent grim melancholy smile showed itself she took the young man s arm and pointed with her other hand to the door of her room little brother she said go in there the little fool you fished out of the river is there waiting for you go on in i ll give you three minutes before i come potatoes is in there waiting go on in onions after he had tapped at the door and entered hetty began to peel and wash the onion at the sink she gave a gray look at the gray roofs outside and the smile on her face vanished by little jerks and twitches but it s us she said grimly to herself it s us that furnishes the beef the hiding of black bill a lank strong red faced man with a wellington beak and small fiery eyes tempered by flaxen lashes sat on the station platform at los pinos swinging his legs to and fro at his side sat another man fat melancholy and seedy who seemed to be his friend they had the appearance of men to whom life had appeared as a reversible coat seamy on both sides ain t seen you in about four years ham said the seedy man which way you been travelling texas said the red faced man it was too cold in alaska for me and i found it warm in texas i ll tell you about one hot spell i went through there one morning i steps off the international at a water tank and lets it go on without me twas a ranch country and fuller of spite houses than new york city only out there they build em twenty miles away so you can t smell what they ve got for dinner instead of running em up two inches from their neighbors windows there wasn t any roads in sight so i footed it cross country the grass was shoe top deep and the mesquite timber looked just like a peach orchard it was so much like a gentleman s private estate that every minute you expected a kennelful of bulldogs to run out and bite you but i must have walked twenty miles before i came in sight of a ranch house it was a little one about as big as an elevated railroad station there was a little man in a white shirt and brown overalls and a pink handkerchief around his neck rolling cigarettes under a tree in front of the door greetings says i any refreshment welcome emoluments or even work for a comparative stranger oh come in says he in a refined tone sit down on that stool please i didn t hear your horse coming he isn t near enough yet says i i walked i don t want to be a burden but i wonder if you have three or four gallons of water handy you do look pretty dusty says he but our bathing arrangements it s a drink i want says i never mind the dust that s on the outside he gets me a dipper of water out of a red jar hanging up and then goes on do you want work for a time says i this is a rather quiet section of the country isn t it it is says he sometimes so i have been told one sees no human being pass for weeks at a time i ve been here only a month i bought the ranch from an old settler who wanted to move farther west it suits me says i quiet and retirement are good for a man sometimes and i need a job i can tend bar salt mines lecture float stock do a little middle weight slugging and play the piano can you herd sheep asks the little ranch man do you mean have i heard sheep says i can you herd em take charge of a flock of em says he oh says i now i understand you mean chase em around and bark at em like collie dogs well i might says i i ve never exactly done any sheep herding but i ve often seen em from car windows masticating daisies and they don t look dangerous i m short a herder says the ranchman you never can depend on the mexicans i ve only got two flocks you may take out my bunch of muttons there are only eight hundred of em in the morning if you like the pay is twelve dollars a month and your rations furnished you camp in a tent on the prairie with your sheep you do your own cooking but wood and water are brought to your camp it s an easy job i m on says i i ll take the job even if i have to garland my brow and hold on to a crook and wear a loose effect and play on a pipe like the shepherds do in pictures so the next morning the little ranchman helps me drive the flock of muttons from the corral to about two miles out and let em graze on a little hillside on the prairie he gives me a lot of instructions about not letting bunches of them stray off from the herd and driving em down to a water hole to drink at noon i ll bring out your tent and camping outfit and rations in the buckboard before night says he fine says i and don t forget the rations nor the camping outfit and be sure to bring the tent your name s zollicoffer ain t it my name says he is henry ogden all right mr ogden says i mine is mr percival saint clair i herded sheep for five days on the rancho chiquito and then the wool entered my soul that getting next to nature certainly got next to me i was lonesomer than crusoe s goat i ve seen a lot of persons more entertaining as companions than those sheep were i d drive em to the corral and pen em every evening and then cook my corn bread and mutton and coffee and lie down in a tent the size of a table cloth and listen to the coyotes and whippoorwills singing around the camp the fifth evening after i had corralled my costly but uncongenial muttons i walked over to the ranch house and stepped in the door mr ogden says i you and me have got to get sociable sheep are all very well to dot the landscape and furnish eight dollar cotton suitings for man but for table talk and fireside companions they rank along with five o clock teazers if you ve got a deck of cards or a parcheesi outfit or a game of authors get em out and let s get on a mental basis i ve got to do something in an intellectual line if it s only to knock somebody s brains out this henry ogden was a peculiar kind of ranchman he wore finger rings and a big gold watch and careful neckties and his face was calm and his nose spectacles was kept very shiny i saw once in muscogee an outlaw hung for murdering six men who was a dead ringer for him but i knew a preacher in arkansas that you would have taken to be his brother i didn t care much for him either way what i wanted was some fellowship and communion with holy saints or lost sinners anything sheepless would do well saint clair says he laying down the book he was reading i guess it must be pretty lonesome for you at first and i don t deny that it s monotonous for me are you sure you corralled your sheep so they won t stray out they re shut up as tight as the jury of a millionaire murderer says i and i ll be back with them long before they ll need their trained nurse so ogden digs up a deck of cards and we play casino after five days and nights of my sheep camp it was like a toot on broadway when i caught big casino i felt as excited as if i had made a million in trinity and when h o loosened up a little and told the story about the lady in the pullman car i laughed for five minutes that showed what a comparative thing life is a man may see so much that he d be bored to turn his head to look at a fire or joe weber or the adriatic sea but let him herd sheep for a spell and you ll see him splitting his ribs laughing at curfew shall not ring to night or really enjoying himself playing cards with ladies by and by ogden gets out a decanter of bourbon and then there is a total eclipse of sheep do you remember reading in the papers about a month ago says he about a train hold up on the m k t the express agent was shot through the shoulder and about in currency taken and it s said that only one man did the job seems to me i do says i but such things happen so often they don t linger long in the human texas mind did they overtake overhaul seize or lay hands upon the despoiler he escaped says ogden and i was just reading in a paper to day that the officers have tracked him down into this part of the country it seems the bills the robber got were all the first issue of currency to the second national bank of espinosa city and so they ve followed the trail where they ve been spent and it leads this way ogden pours out some more bourbon and shoves me the bottle i imagine says i after ingurgitating another modicum of the royal boose that it wouldn t be at all a disingenuous idea for a train robber to run down into this part of the country to hide for a spell a sheep ranch now says i would be the finest kind of a place who d ever expect to find such a desperate character among these song birds and muttons and wild flowers and by the way says i kind of looking h ogden over was there any description mentioned of this single handed terror was his lineaments or height and thickness or teeth fillings or style of habiliments set forth in print why no says ogden they say nobody got a good sight of him because he wore a mask but they know it was a train robber called black bill because he always works alone and because he dropped a handkerchief in the express car that had his name on it all right says i i approve of black bill s retreat to the sheep ranges i guess they won t find him there s one thousand dollars reward for his capture says ogden i don t need that kind of money says i looking mr sheepman straight in the eye the twelve dollars a month you pay me is enough i need a rest and i can save up until i get enough to pay my fare to texarkana where my widowed mother lives if black bill i goes on looking significantly at ogden was to have come down this way say a month ago and bought a little sheep ranch and stop says ogden getting out of his chair and looking pretty vicious do you mean to insinuate nothing says i no insinuations i m stating a hypodermical case i say if black bill had come down here and bought a sheep ranch and hired me to little boy blue em and treated me square and friendly as you ve done he d never have anything to fear from me a man is a man regardless of any complications he may have with sheep or railroad trains now you know where i stand ogden looks black as camp coffee for nine seconds and then he laughs amused you ll do saint clair says he if i was black bill i wouldn t be afraid to trust you let s have a game or two of seven up to night that is if you don t mind playing with a train robber i ve told you says i my oral sentiments and there s no strings to em while i was shuffling after the first hand i asks ogden as if the idea was a kind of a casualty where he was from oh says he from the mississippi valley that s a nice little place says i i ve often stopped over there but didn t you find the sheets a little damp and the food poor now i hail says i from the pacific slope ever put up there too draughty says ogden but if you ve ever in the middle west just mention my name and you ll get foot warmers and dripped coffee well says i i wasn t exactly fishing for your private telephone number and the middle name of your aunt that carried off the cumberland presbyterian minister it don t matter i just want you to know you are safe in the hands of your shepherd now don t play hearts on spades and don t get nervous still harping says ogden laughing again don t you suppose that if i was black bill and thought you suspected me i d put a winchester bullet into you and stop my nervousness if i had any not any says i a man who s got the nerve to hold up a train single handed wouldn t do a trick like that i ve knocked about enough to know that them are the kind of men who put a value on a friend not that i can claim being a friend of yours mr ogden says i being only your sheep herder but under more expeditious circumstances we might have been forget the sheep temporarily i beg says ogden and cut for deal about four days afterward while my muttons was nooning on the water hole and i deep in the interstices of making a pot of coffee up rides softly on the grass a mysterious person in the garb of the being he wished to represent he was dressed somewhere between a kansas city detective buffalo bill and the town dog catcher of baton rouge his chin and eye wasn t molded on fighting lines so i knew he was only a scout herdin sheep he asks me well says i to a man of your evident gumptional endowments i wouldn t have the nerve to state that i am engaged in decorating old bronzes or oiling bicycle sprockets you don t talk or look like a sheep herder to me says he but you talk like what you look like to me says i and then he asks me who i was working for and i shows him rancho chiquito two miles away in the shadow of a low hill and he tells me he s a deputy sheriff there s a train robber called black bill supposed to be somewhere in these parts says the scout he s been traced as far as san antonio and maybe farther have you seen or heard of any strangers around here during the past month i have not says i except a report of one over at the mexican quarters of loomis ranch on the frio what do you know about him asks the deputy he s three days old says i what kind of a looking man is the man you work for he asks does old george ramey own this place yet he s run sheep here for the last ten years but never had no success the old man has sold out and gone west i tells him another sheep fancier bought him out about a month ago what kind of a looking man is he asks the deputy again oh says i a big fat kind of a dutchman with long whiskers and blue specs i don t think he knows a sheep from a ground squirrel i guess old george soaked him pretty well on the deal says i after indulging himself in a lot more non communicative information and two thirds of my dinner the deputy rides away that night i mentions the matter to ogden they re drawing the tendrils of the octopus around black bill says i and then i told him about the deputy sheriff and how i d described him to the deputy and what the deputy said about the matter oh well says ogden let s don t borrow any of black bill s troubles we ve a few of our own get the bourbon out of the cupboard and we ll drink to his health unless says he with his little cackling laugh you re prejudiced against train robbers i ll drink says i to any man who s a friend to a friend and i believe that black bill i goes on would be that so here s to black bill and may he have good luck and both of us drank about two weeks later comes shearing time the sheep had to be driven up to the ranch and a lot of frowzy headed mexicans would snip the fur off of them with back action scissors so the afternoon before the barbers were to come i hustled my underdone muttons over the hill across the dell down by the winding brook and up to the ranch house where i penned em in a corral and bade em my nightly adieus i went from there to the ranch house i find h ogden esquire lying asleep on his little cot bed i guess he had been overcome by anti insomnia or diswakefulness or some of the diseases peculiar to the sheep business his mouth and vest were open and he breathed like a second hand bicycle pump i looked at him and gave vent to just a few musings imperial caesar says i asleep in such a way might shut his mouth and keep the wind away a man asleep is certainly a sight to make angels weep what good is all his brain muscle backing nerve influence and family connections he s at the mercy of his enemies and more so of his friends and he s about as beautiful as a cab horse leaning against the metropolitan opera house at a m dreaming of the plains of arabia now a woman asleep you regard as different no matter how she looks you know it s better for all hands for her to be that way well i took a drink of bourbon and one for ogden and started in to be comfortable while he was taking his nap he had some books on his table on indigenous subjects such as japan and drainage and physical culture and some tobacco which seemed more to the point after i d smoked a few and listened to the sartorial breathing of h o i happened to look out the window toward the shearing pens where there was a kind of a road coming up from a kind of a road across a kind of a creek farther away i saw five men riding up to the house all of em carried guns across their saddles and among em was the deputy that had talked to me at my camp they rode up careful in open formation with their guns ready i set apart with my eye the one i opinionated to be the boss muck raker of this law and order cavalry good evening gents says i won t you light and tie your horses the boss rides up close and swings his gun over till the opening in it seems to cover my whole front elevation don t you move your hands none says he till you and me indulge in a adequate amount of necessary conversation i will not says i i am no deaf mute and therefore will not have to disobey your injunctions in replying we are on the lookout says he for black bill the man that held up the katy for in may we are searching the ranches and everybody on em what is your name and what do you do on this ranch captain says i percival saint clair is my occupation and my name is sheep herder i ve got my flock of veals no muttons penned here to night the shearers are coming to morrow to give them a hair cut with baa a rum i suppose where s the boss of this ranch the captain of the gang asks me wait just a minute cap n says i wasn t there a kind of a reward offered for the capture of this desperate character you have referred to in your preamble there s a thousand dollars reward offered says the captain but it s for his capture and conviction there don t seem to be no provision made for an informer it looks like it might rain in a day or so says i in a tired way looking up at the cerulean blue sky if you know anything about the locality disposition or secretiveness of this here black bill says he in a severe dialect you are amiable to the law in not reporting it i heard a fence rider say says i in a desultory kind of voice that a mexican told a cowboy named jake over at pidgin s store on the nueces that he heard that black bill had been seen in matamoras by a sheepman s cousin two weeks ago tell you what i ll do tight mouth says the captain after looking me over for bargains if you put us on so we can scoop black bill i ll pay you a hundred dollars out of my own out of our own pockets that s liberal says he you ain t entitled to anything now what do you say cash down now i asks the captain has a sort of discussion with his helpmates and they all produce the contents of their pockets for analysis out of the general results they figured up in cash and worth of plug tobacco come nearer capitan meeo says i and listen he so did i am mighty poor and low down in the world says i i am working for twelve dollars a month trying to keep a lot of animals together whose only thought seems to be to get asunder although says i i regard myself as some better than the state of south dakota it s a come down to a man who has heretofore regarded sheep only in the form of chops i m pretty far reduced in the world on account of foiled ambitions and rum and a kind of cocktail they make along the p r r all the way from scranton to cincinnati dry gin french vermouth one squeeze of a lime and a good dash of orange bitters if you re ever up that way don t fail to let one try you and again says i i have never yet went back on a friend i ve stayed by em when they had plenty and when adversity s overtaken me i ve never forsook em but i goes on this is not exactly the case of a friend twelve dollars a month is only bowing acquaintance money and i do not consider brown beans and corn bread the food of friendship i am a poor man says i and i have a widowed mother in texarkana you will find black bill says i lying asleep in this house on a cot in the room to your right he s the man you want as i know from his words and conversation he was in a way a friend i explains and if i was the man i once was the entire product of the mines of gondola would not have tempted me to betray him but says i every week half of the beans was wormy and not nigh enough wood in camp better go in careful gentlemen says i he seems impatient at times and when you think of his late professional pursuits one would look for abrupt actions if he was come upon sudden so the whole posse unmounts and ties their horses and unlimbers their ammunition and equipments and tiptoes into the house and i follows like delilah when she set the philip stein on to samson the leader of the posse shakes ogden and wakes him up and then he jumps up and two more of the reward hunters grab him ogden was mighty tough with all his slimness and he gives em as neat a single footed tussle against odds as i ever see what does this mean he says after they had him down you re scooped in mr black bill says the captain that s all it s an outrage says h ogden madder yet it was says the peace and good will man the katy wasn t bothering you and there s a law against monkeying with express packages and he sits on h ogden s stomach and goes through his pockets symptomatically and careful i ll make you perspire for this says ogden perspiring some himself i can prove who i am so can i says the captain as he draws from h ogden s inside coat pocket a handful of new bills of the second national bank of espinosa city your regular engraved tuesdays and fridays visiting card wouldn t have a louder voice in proclaiming your indemnity than this here currency you can get up now and prepare to go with us and expatriate your sins h ogden gets up and fixes his necktie he says no more after they have taken the money off of him a well greased idea says the sheriff captain admiring to slip off down here and buy a little sheep ranch where the hand of man is seldom heard it was the slickest hide out i ever see says the captain so one of the men goes to the shearing pen and hunts up the other herder a mexican they call john sallies and he saddles ogden s horse and the sheriffs all ride tip close around him with their guns in hand ready to take their prisoner to town before starting ogden puts the ranch in john sallies hands and gives him orders about the shearing and where to graze the sheep just as if he intended to be back in a few days and a couple of hours afterward one percival saint clair an ex sheep herder of the rancho chiquito might have been seen with a hundred and nine dollars wages and blood money in his pocket riding south on another horse belonging to said ranch the red faced man paused and listened the whistle of a coming freight train sounded far away among the low hills the fat seedy man at his side sniffed and shook his frowzy head slowly and disparagingly what is it snipy asked the other got the blues again no i ain t said the seedy one sniffing again but i don t like your talk you and me have been friends off and on for fifteen year and i never yet knew or heard of you giving anybody up to the law not no one and here was a man whose saleratus you had et and at whose table you had played games of cards if casino can be so called and yet you inform him to the law and take money for it it never was like you i say this h ogden resumed the red faced man through a lawyer proved himself free by alibis and other legal terminalities as i so heard afterward he never suffered no harm he did me favors and i hated to hand him over how about the bills they found in his pocket asked the seedy man i put em there said the red faced man while he was asleep when i saw the posse riding up i was black bill look out snipy here she comes we ll board her on the bumpers when she takes water at the tank schools and schools i old jerome warren lived in a hundred thousand dollar house at east fifty soforth street he was a down town broker so rich that he could afford to walk for his health a few blocks in the direction of his office every morning and then call a cab he had an adopted son the son of an old friend named gilbert cyril scott could play him nicely who was becoming a successful painter as fast as he could squeeze the paint out of his tubes another member of the household was barbara ross a stepniece man is born to trouble so as old jerome had no family of his own he took up the burdens of others gilbert and barbara got along swimmingly there was a tacit and tactical understanding all round that the two would stand up under a floral bell some high noon and promise the minister to keep old jerome s money in a state of high commotion but at this point complications must be introduced thirty years before when old jerome was young jerome there was a brother of his named dick dick went west to seek his or somebody else s fortune nothing was heard of him until one day old jerome had a letter from his brother it was badly written on ruled paper that smelled of salt bacon and coffee grounds the writing was asthmatic and the spelling st vitusy it appeared that instead of dick having forced fortune to stand and deliver he had been held up himself and made to give hostages to the enemy that is as his letter disclosed he was on the point of pegging out with a complication of disorders that even whiskey had failed to check all that his thirty years of prospecting had netted him was one daughter nineteen years old as per invoice whom he was shipping east charges prepaid for jerome to clothe feed educate comfort and cherish for the rest of her natural life or until matrimony should them part old jerome was a board walk everybody knows that the world is supported by the shoulders of atlas and that atlas stands on a rail fence and that the rail fence is built on a turtle s back now the turtle has to stand on something and that is a board walk made of men like old jerome i do not know whether immortality shall accrue to man but if not so i would like to know when men like old jerome get what is due them they met nevada warren at the station she was a little girl deeply sunburned and wholesomely good looking with a manner that was frankly unsophisticated yet one that not even a cigar drummer would intrude upon without thinking twice looking at her somehow you would expect to see her in a short skirt and leather leggings shooting glass balls or taming mustangs but in her plain white waist and black skirt she sent you guessing again with an easy exhibition of strength she swung along a heavy valise which the uniformed porters tried in vain to wrest from her i am sure we shall be the best of friends said barbara pecking at the firm sunburned cheek i hope so said nevada dear little niece said old jerome you are as welcome to my home as if it were your father s own thanks said nevada and i am going to call you cousin said gilbert with his charming smile take the valise please said nevada it weighs a million pounds it s got samples from six of dad s old mines in it she explained to barbara i calculate they d assay about nine cents to the thousand tons but i promised him to bring them along ii it is a common custom to refer to the usual complication between one man and two ladies or one lady and two men or a lady and a man and a nobleman or well any of those problems as the triangle but they are never unqualified triangles they are always isosceles never equilateral so upon the coming of nevada warren she and gilbert and barbara ross lined up into such a figurative triangle and of that triangle barbara formed the hypotenuse one morning old jerome was lingering long after breakfast over the dullest morning paper in the city before setting forth to his down town fly trap he had become quite fond of nevada finding in her much of his dead brother s quiet independence and unsuspicious frankness a maid brought in a note for miss nevada warren a messenger boy delivered it at the door please she said he s waiting for an answer nevada who was whistling a spanish waltz between her teeth and watching the carriages and autos roll by in the street took the envelope she knew it was from gilbert before she opened it by the little gold palette in the upper left hand corner after tearing it open she pored over the contents for a while absorbedly then with a serious face she went and stood at her uncle s elbow uncle jerome gilbert is a nice boy isn t he why bless the child said old jerome crackling his paper loudly of course he is i raised him myself he wouldn t write anything to anybody that wasn t exactly i mean that everybody couldn t know and read would he i d just like to see him try it said uncle tearing a handful from his newspaper why what read this note he just sent me uncle and see if you think it s all right and proper you see i don t know much about city people and their ways old jerome threw his paper down and set both his feet upon it he took gilbert s note and fiercely perused it twice and then a third time why child said he you had me almost excited although i was sure of that boy he s a duplicate of his father and he was a gilt edged diamond he only asks if you and barbara will be ready at four o clock this afternoon for an automobile drive over to long island i don t see anything to criticise in it except the stationery i always did hate that shade of blue would it be all right to go asked nevada eagerly yes yes yes child of course why not still it pleases me to see you so careful and candid go by all means i didn t know said nevada demurely i thought i d ask you couldn t you go with us uncle i no no no no i ve ridden once in a car that boy was driving never again but it s entirely proper for you and barbara to go yes yes but i will not no no no no nevada flew to the door and said to the maid you bet we ll go i ll answer for miss barbara tell the boy to say to mr warren you bet we ll go nevada called old jerome pardon me my dear but wouldn t it be as well to send him a note in reply just a line would do no i won t bother about that said nevada gayly gilbert will understand he always does i never rode in an automobile in my life but i ve paddled a canoe down little devil river through the lost horse canon and if it s any livelier than that i d like to know iii two months are supposed to have elapsed barbara sat in the study of the hundred thousand dollar house it was a good place for her many places are provided in the world where men and women may repair for the purpose of extricating themselves from divers difficulties there are cloisters wailing places watering places confessionals hermitages lawyer s offices beauty parlors air ships and studies and the greatest of these are studies it usually takes a hypotenuse a long time to discover that it is the longest side of a triangle but it s a long line that has no turning barbara was alone uncle jerome and nevada had gone to the theatre barbara had not cared to go she wanted to stay at home and study in the study if you miss were a stunning new york girl and saw every day that a brown ingenuous western witch was getting hobbles and a lasso on the young man you wanted for yourself you too would lose taste for the oxidized silver setting of a musical comedy barbara sat by the quartered oak library table her right arm rested upon the table and her dextral fingers nervously manipulated a sealed letter the letter was addressed to nevada warren and in the upper left hand corner of the envelope was gilbert s little gold palette it had been delivered at nine o clock after nevada had left barbara would have given her pearl necklace to know what the letter contained but she could not open and read it by the aid of steam or a pen handle or a hair pin or any of the generally approved methods because her position in society forbade such an act she had tried to read some of the lines of the letter by holding the envelope up to a strong light and pressing it hard against the paper but gilbert had too good a taste in stationery to make that possible at eleven thirty the theatre goers returned it was a delicious winter night even so far as from the cab to the door they were powdered thickly with the big flakes downpouring diagonally from the cast old jerome growled good naturedly about villanous cab service and blockaded streets nevada colored like a rose with sapphire eyes babbled of the stormy nights in the mountains around dad s cabin during all these wintry apostrophes barbara cold at heart sawed wood the only appropriate thing she could think of to do old jerome went immediately up stairs to hot water bottles and quinine nevada fluttered into the study the only cheerfully lighted room subsided into an arm chair and while at the interminable task of unbuttoning her elbow gloves gave oral testimony as to the demerits of the show yes i think mr fields is really amusing sometimes said barbara here is a letter for you dear that came by special delivery just after you had gone who is it from asked nevada tugging at a button well really said barbara with a smile i can only guess the envelope has that queer little thing in one corner that gilbert calls a palette but which looks to me rather like a gilt heart on a school girl s valentine i wonder what he s writing to me about remarked nevada listlessly we re all alike said barbara all women we try to find out what is in a letter by studying the postmark as a last resort we use scissors and read it from the bottom upward here it is she made a motion as if to toss the letter across the table to nevada great catamounts exclaimed nevada these centre fire buttons are a nuisance i d rather wear buckskins oh barbara please shuck the hide off that letter and read it it ll be midnight before i get these gloves off why dear you don t want me to open gilbert s letter to you it s for you and you wouldn t wish any one else to read it of course nevada raised her steady calm sapphire eyes from her gloves nobody writes me anything that everybody mightn t read she said go on barbara maybe gilbert wants us to go out in his car again to morrow curiosity can do more things than kill a cat and if emotions well recognized as feminine are inimical to feline life then jealousy would soon leave the whole world catless barbara opened the letter with an indulgent slightly bored air well dear said she i ll read it if you want me to she slit the envelope and read the missive with swift travelling eyes read it again and cast a quick shrewd glance at nevada who for the time seemed to consider gloves as the world of her interest and letters from rising artists as no more than messages from mars for a quarter of a minute barbara looked at nevada with a strange steadfastness and then a smile so small that it widened her mouth only the sixteenth part of an inch and narrowed her eyes no more than a twentieth flashed like an inspired thought across her face since the beginning no woman has been a mystery to another woman swift as light travels each penetrates the heart and mind of another sifts her sister s words of their cunningest disguises reads her most hidden desires and plucks the sophistry from her wiliest talk like hairs from a comb twiddling them sardonically between her thumb and fingers before letting them float away on the breezes of fundamental doubt long ago eve s son rang the door bell of the family residence in paradise park bearing a strange lady on his arm whom he introduced eve took her daughter in law aside and lifted a classic eyebrow the land of nod said the bride languidly flirting the leaf of a palm i suppose you ve been there of course not lately said eve absolutely unstaggered don t you think the apple sauce they serve over there is execrable i rather like that mulberry leaf tunic effect dear but of course the real fig goods are not to be had over there come over behind this lilac bush while the gentlemen split a celery tonic i think the caterpillar holes have made your dress open a little in the back so then and there according to the records was the alliance formed by the only two who s who ladies in the world then it was agreed that woman should forever remain as clear as a pane of glass though glass was yet to be discovered to other women and that she should palm herself off on man as a mystery barbara seemed to hesitate really nevada she said with a little show of embarrassment you shouldn t have insisted on my opening this i i m sure it wasn t meant for any one else to know nevada forgot her gloves for a moment then read it aloud she said since you ve already read it what s the difference if mr warren has written to me something that any one else oughtn t to know that is all the more reason why everybody should know it well said barbara this is what it says dearest nevada come to my studio at twelve o clock to night do not fail barbara rose and dropped the note in nevada s lap i m awfully sorry she said that i knew it isn t like gilbert there must be some mistake just consider that i am ignorant of it will you dear i must go up stairs now i have such a headache i m sure i don t understand the note perhaps gilbert has been dining too well and will explain good night iv nevada tiptoed to the hall and heard barbara s door close upstairs the bronze clock in the study told the hour of twelve was fifteen minutes away she ran swiftly to the front door and let herself out into the snow storm gilbert warren s studio was six squares away by aerial ferry the white silent forces of the storm attacked the city from beyond the sullen east river already the snow lay a foot deep on the pavements the drifts heaping themselves like scaling ladders against the walls of the besieged town the avenue was as quiet as a street in pompeii cabs now and then skimmed past like white winged gulls over a moonlit ocean and less frequent motor cars sustaining the comparison hissed through the foaming waves like submarine boats on their jocund perilous journeys nevada plunged like a wind driven storm petrel on her way she looked up at the ragged sierras of cloud capped buildings that rose above the streets shaded by the night lights and the congealed vapors to gray drab ashen lavender dun and cerulean tints they were so like the wintry mountains of her western home that she felt a satisfaction such as the hundred thousand dollar house had seldom brought her a policeman caused her to waver on a corner just by his eye and weight hello mabel said he kind of late for you to be out ain t it i i am just going to the drug store said nevada hurrying past him the excuse serves as a passport for the most sophisticated does it prove that woman never progresses or that she sprang from adam s rib full fledged in intellect and wiles turning eastward the direct blast cut down nevada s speed one half she made zigzag tracks in the snow but she was as tough as a pinon sapling and bowed to it as gracefully suddenly the studio building loomed before her a familiar landmark like a cliff above some well remembered canon the haunt of business and its hostile neighbor art was darkened and silent the elevator stopped at ten up eight flights of stygian stairs nevada climbed and rapped firmly at the door numbered she had been there many times before with barbara and uncle jerome gilbert opened the door he had a crayon pencil in one hand a green shade over his eyes and a pipe in his mouth the pipe dropped to the floor am i late asked nevada i came as quick as i could uncle and me were at the theatre this evening here i am gilbert gilbert did a pygmalion and galatea act he changed from a statue of stupefaction to a young man with a problem to tackle he admitted nevada got a whiskbroom and began to brush the snow from her clothes a great lamp with a green shade hung over an easel where the artist had been sketching in crayon you wanted me said nevada simply and i came you said so in your letter what did you send for me for you read my letter inquired gilbert sparring for wind barbara read it to me i saw it afterward it said come to my studio at twelve to night and do not fail i thought you were sick of course but you don t seem to be aha said gilbert irrelevantly i ll tell you why i asked you to come nevada i want you to marry me immediately to night what s a little snow storm will you do it you might have noticed that i would long ago said nevada and i m rather stuck on the snow storm idea myself i surely would hate one of these flowery church noon weddings gilbert i didn t know you had grit enough to propose it this way let s shock em it s our funeral ain t it you bet said gilbert where did i hear that expression he added to himself wait a minute nevada i want to do a little phoning he shut himself in a little dressing room and called upon the lightnings of tile heavens condensed into unromantic numbers and districts that you jack you confounded sleepyhead yes wake up this is me or i oh bother the difference in grammar i m going to be married right away yes wake up your sister don t answer me back bring her along too you must remind agnes of the time i saved her from drowning in lake ronkonkoma i know it s caddish to refer to it but she must come with you yes nevada is here waiting we ve been engaged quite a while some opposition among the relatives you know and we have to pull it off this way we re waiting here for you don t let agnes out talk you bring her you will good old boy i ll order a carriage to call for you double quick time confound you jack you re all right gilbert returned to the room where nevada waited my old friend jack peyton and his sister were to have been here at a quarter to twelve he explained but jack is so confoundedly slow i ve just phoned them to hurry they ll be here in a few minutes i m the happiest man in the world nevada what did you do with the letter i sent you to day i ve got it cinched here said nevada pulling it out from beneath her opera cloak gilbert drew the letter from the envelope and looked it over carefully then he looked at nevada thoughtfully didn t you think it rather queer that i should ask you to come to my studio at midnight he asked why no said nevada rounding her eyes not if you needed me out west when a pal sends you a hurry call ain t that what you say here we get there first and talk about it after the row is over and it s usually snowing there too when things happen so i didn t mind gilbert rushed into another room and came back burdened with overcoats warranted to turn wind rain or snow put this raincoat on he said holding it for her we have a quarter of a mile to go old jack and his sister will be here in a few minutes he began to struggle into a heavy coat oh nevada he said just look at the head lines on the front page of that evening paper on the table will you it s about your section of the west and i know it will interest you he waited a full minute pretending to find trouble in the getting on of his overcoat and then turned nevada had not moved she was looking at him with strange and pensive directness her cheeks had a flush on them beyond the color that had been contributed by the wind and snow but her eyes were steady i was going to tell you she said anyhow before you before we before well before anything dad never gave me a day of schooling i never learned to read or write a darned word now if pounding their uncertain way up stairs the feet of jack the somnolent and agnes the grateful were heard v when mr and mrs gilbert warren were spinning softly homeward in a closed carriage after the ceremony gilbert s said nevada would you really like to know what i wrote you in the letter that you received to night fire away said his bride word for word said gilbert it was this my dear miss warren you were right about the flower it was a hydrangea and not a lilac all right said nevada but let s forget it the joke s on barbara anyway thimble thimble these are the directions for finding the i office of carteret carteret mill supplies and leather belting you follow the broadway trail down until you pass the crosstown line the bread line and the dead line and come to the big canons of the moneygrubber tribe then you turn to the left to the right dodge a push cart and the tongue of a two ton four horse dray and hop skip and jump to a granite ledge on the side of a twenty one story synthetic mountain of stone and iron in the twelfth story is the office of carteret carteret the factory where they make the mill supplies and leather belting is in brooklyn those commodities to say nothing of brooklyn not being of interest to you let us hold the incidents within the confines of a one act one scene play thereby lessening the toil of the reader and the expenditure of the publisher so if you have the courage to face four pages of type and carteret carteret s office boy percival you shall sit on a varnished chair in the inner office and peep at the little comedy of the old nigger man the hunting case watch and the open faced question mostly borrowed from the late mr frank stockton as you will conclude first biography but pared to the quick must intervene i am for the inverted sugar coated quinine pill the bitter on the outside the carterets were or was columbia college professors please rule an old virginia family long time ago the gentlemen of the family had worn lace ruffles and carried tinless foils and owned plantations and had slaves to burn but the war had greatly reduced their holdings of course you can perceive at once that this flavor has been shoplifted from mr f hopkinson smith in spite of the et after carter well anyhow in digging up the carteret history i shall not take you farther back than the year the two original american carterets came over in that year but by different means of transportation one brother named john came in the mayflower and became a pilgrim father you ve seen his picture on the covers of the thanksgiving magazines hunting turkeys in the deep snow with a blunderbuss blandford carteret the other brother crossed the pond in his own brigantine landed on the virginia coast and became an f f v john became distinguished for piety and shrewdness in business blandford for his pride juleps marksmanship and vast slave cultivated plantations then came the civil war i must condense this historical interpolation stonewall jackson was shot lee surrendered

southern traditions he was its foreordained fit and logical editor so a committee of the patriotic georgia citizens who had subscribed the founding fund of called upon colonel telfair at his residence cedar heights fearful lest the enterprise and the south should suffer by his possible refusal the colonel received them in his great library where he spent most of his days the library had descended to him from his father it contained ten thousand volumes some of which had been published as late as the year when the deputation arrived colonel telfair was seated at his massive white pine centre table reading burton s anatomy of melancholy he arose and shook hands punctiliously with each member of the committee if you were familiar with the rose of dixie you will remember the colonel s portrait which appeared in it from time to time you could not forget the long carefully brushed white hair the hooked high bridged nose slightly twisted to the left the keen eyes under the still black eyebrows the classic mouth beneath the drooping white mustache slightly frazzled at the ends the committee solicitously offered him the position of managing editor humbly presenting an outline of the field that the publication was designed to cover and mentioning a comfortable salary the colonel s lands were growing poorer each year and were much cut up by red gullies besides the honor was not one to be refused in a forty minute speech of acceptance colonel telfair gave an outline of english literature from chaucer to macaulay re fought the battle of chancellorsville and said that god helping him he would so conduct the rose of dixie that its fragrance and beauty would permeate the entire world hurling back into the teeth of the northern minions their belief that no genius or good could exist in the brains and hearts of the people whose property they had destroyed and whose rights they had curtailed offices for the magazine were partitioned off and furnished in the second floor of the first national bank building and it was for the colonel to cause the rose of dixie to blossom and flourish or to wilt in the balmy air of the land of flowers the staff of assistants and contributors that editor colonel telfair drew about him was a peach it was a whole crate of georgia peaches the first assistant editor tolliver lee fairfax had had a father killed during pickett s charge the second assistant keats unthank was the nephew of one of morgan s raiders the book reviewer jackson rockingham had been the youngest soldier in the confederate army having appeared on the field of battle with a sword in one hand and a milk bottle in the other the art editor roncesvalles sykes was a third cousin to a nephew of jefferson davis miss lavinia terhune the colonel s stenographer and typewriter had an aunt who had once been kissed by stonewall jackson tommy webster the head office boy got his job by having recited father ryan s poems complete at the commencement exercises of the toombs city high school the girls who wrapped and addressed the magazines were members of old southern families in reduced circumstances the cashier was a scrub named hawkins from ann arbor michigan who had recommendations and a bond from a guarantee company filed with the owners even georgia stock companies sometimes realize that it takes live ones to bury the dead well sir if you believe me the rose of dixie blossomed five times before anybody heard of it except the people who buy their hooks and eyes in toombs city then hawkins climbed off his stool and told on em to the stock company even in ann arbor he had been used to having his business propositions heard of at least as far away as detroit so an advertising manager was engaged beauregard fitzhugh banks a young man in a lavender necktie whose grandfather had been the exalted high pillow slip of the kuklux klan in spite of which the rose of dixie kept coming out every month although in every issue it ran photos of either the taj mahal or the luxembourg gardens or carmencita or la follette a certain number of people bought it and subscribed for it as a boom for it editor colonel telfair ran three different views of andrew jackson s old home the hermitage a full page engraving of the second battle of manassas entitled lee to the rear and a five thousand word biography of belle boyd in the same number the subscription list that month advanced also there were poems in the same issue by leonina vashti haricot pen name related to the haricots of charleston south carolina and bill thompson nephew of one of the stockholders and an article from a special society correspondent describing a tea party given by the swell boston and english set where a lot of tea was spilled overboard by some of the guests masquerading as indians one day a person whose breath would easily cloud a mirror he was so much alive entered the office of the rose of dixie he was a man about the size of a real

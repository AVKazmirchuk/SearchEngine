become a big factor in her life and she hadn t been aware of it mr ramonti she said sorrowfully this was not on the stage remember it was in the old home near abingdon square i m awfully sorry but i m a married woman and then she told him the sad story of her life as a heroine must do sooner or later either to a theatrical manager or to a reporter ramonti took her hand bowed low and kissed it and went up to his room helen sat down and looked mournfully at her hand well she might three suitors had kissed it mounted their red roan steeds and ridden away in an hour entered the mysterious stranger with the haunting eyes helen was in the willow rocker knitting a useless thing in cotton wool he ricocheted from the stairs and stopped for a chat sitting across the table from her he also poured out his narrative of love and then he said helen do you not remember me i think i have seen it in your eyes can you forgive the past and remember the love that has lasted for twenty years i wronged you deeply i was afraid to come back to you but my love overpowered my reason can you will you forgive me helen stood up the mysterious stranger held one of her hands in a strong and trembling clasp there she stood and i pity the stage that it has not acquired a scene like that and her emotions to portray for she stood with a divided heart the fresh unforgettable virginal love for her bridegroom was hers the treasured sacred honored memory of her first choice filled half her soul she leaned to that pure feeling honor and faith and sweet abiding romance bound her to it but the other half of her heart and soul was filled with something else a later fuller nearer influence and so the old fought against the new and while she hesitated from the room above came the soft racking petitionary music of a violin the hag music bewitches some of the noblest the daws may peck upon one s sleeve without injury but whoever wears his heart upon his tympanum gets it not far from the neck this music and the musician caller her and at her side honor and the old love held her back forgive me he pleaded twenty years is a long time to remain away from the one you say you love she declared with a purgatorial touch how could i tell he begged i will conceal nothing from you that night when he left i followed him i was mad with jealousy on a dark street i struck him down he did not rise i examined him his head had struck a stone i did not intend to kill him i was mad with love and jealousy i hid near by and saw an ambulance take him away although you married him helen who are you cried the woman with wide open eyes snatching her hand away don t you remember me helen the one who has always loved you best i am john delaney if you can forgive but she was gone leaping stumbling hurrying flying up the stairs toward the music and him who had forgotten but who had known her for his in each of his two existences and as she climbed up she sobbed cried and sang frank frank frank three mortals thus juggling with years as though they were billiard balls and my friend the reporter couldn t see anything funny in it a ramble in aphasia my wife and i parted on that morning in precisely our usual manner she left her second cup of tea to follow me to the front door there she plucked from my lapel the invisible strand of lint the universal act of woman to proclaim ownership and bade me to take care of my cold i had no cold next came her kiss of parting the lever kiss of domesticity flavored with young hyson there was no fear of the extemporaneous of variety spicing her infinite custom with the deft touch of long malpractice she dabbed awry my well set scarf pin and then as i closed the door i heard her morning slippers pattering back to her cooling tea when i set out i had no thought or premonition of what was to occur the attack came suddenly for many weeks i had been toiling almost night and day at a famous railroad law case that i won triumphantly but a few days previously in fact i had been digging away at the law almost without cessation for many years once or twice good doctor volney my friend and physician had warned me if you don t slacken up belford he said you ll go suddenly to pieces either your nerves or your brain will give way tell me does a week pass in which you do not read in the papers of a case of aphasia of some man lost wandering nameless with his past and his identity blotted out and all from that little brain clot made by overwork or worry i always thought said i that the clot in those instances was really to be found on the brains of the newspaper reporters doctor volney shook his head the disease exists he said you need a change or a rest court room office and home there is the only route you travel for recreation you read law books better take warning in time on thursday nights i said defensively my wife and i play cribbage on sundays she reads to me the weekly letter from her mother that law books are not a recreation remains yet to be established that morning as i walked i was thinking of doctor volney s words i was feeling as well as i usually did possibly in better spirits than usual i woke with stiff and cramped muscles from having slept long on the incommodious seat of a day coach i leaned my head against the seat and tried to think after a long time i said to myself i must have a name of some sort i searched my pockets not a card not a letter not a paper or monogram could i find but i found in my coat pocket nearly in bills of large denomination i must be some one of course i repeated to myself and began again to consider the car was well crowded with men among whom i told myself there must have been some common interest for they intermingled freely and seemed in the best good humor and spirits one of them a stout spectacled gentleman enveloped in a decided odor of cinnamon and aloes took the vacant half of my seat with a friendly nod and unfolded a newspaper in the intervals between his periods of reading we conversed as travelers will on current affairs i found myself able to sustain the conversation on such subjects with credit at least to my memory by and by my companion said you are one of us of course fine lot of men the west sends in this time i m glad they held the convention in new york i ve never been east before my name s r p bolder bolder son of hickory grove missouri though unprepared i rose to the emergency as men will when put to it now must i hold a christening and be at once babe parson and parent my senses came to the rescue of my slower brain the insistent odor of drugs from my compainion supplied one idea a glance at his newspaper where my eye met a conspicuous advertisement assisted me further my name said i glibly is edward pinkhammer i am a druggist and my home is in cornopolis kansas i knew you were a druggist said my fellow traveler affably i saw the callous spot on your right forefinger where the handle of the pestle rubs of course you are a delegate to our national convention are all these men druggists i asked wonderingly they are this car came through from the west and they re your old time druggists too none of your patent tablet and granule pharmashootists that use slot machines instead of a prescription desk we percolate our own paregoric and roll our own pills and we ain t above handling a few garden seeds in the spring and carrying a side line of confectionery and shoes i tell you hampinker i ve got an idea to spring on this convention new ideas is what they want now you know the shelf bottles of tartar emetic and rochelle salt ant et pot tart and sod et pot tart one s poison you know and the other s harmless it s easy to mistake one label for the other where do druggists mostly keep em why as far apart as possible on different shelves that s wrong i say keep em side by side so when you want one you can always compare it with the other and avoid mistakes do you catch the idea it seems to me a very good one i said all right when i spring it on the convention you back it up we ll make some of these eastern orange phosphate and massage cream professors that think they re the only lozenges in the market look like hypodermic tablets if i can be of any aid i said warming the two bottles of er tartrate of antimony and potash and tartrate of soda and potash shall henceforth sit side by side i concluded firmly now there s another thing said mr bolder for an excipient in manipulating a pill mass which do you prefer the magnesia carbonate or the pulverised glycerrhiza radix the er magnesia i said it was easier to say than the other word mr bolder glanced at me distrustfully through his spectacles give me the glycerrhiza said he magnesia cakes here s another one of these fake aphasia cases he said presently handing me his newspaper and laying his finger upon an article i don t believe in em i put nine out of ten of em down as frauds a man gets sick of his business and his folks and wants to have a good time he skips out somewhere and when they find him he pretends to have lost his memory don t know his own name and won t even recognize the strawberry mark on his wife s left shoulder aphasia tut why can t they stay at home and forget i took the paper and read after the pungent headlines the following denver june elwyn c belford a prominent lawyer is mysteriously missing from his home since three days ago and all efforts to locate him have been in vain mr bellford is a well known citizen of the highest standing and has enjoyed a large and lucrative law practice he is married and owns a fine home and the most extensive private library in the state on the day of his disappearance he drew quite a large sum of money from his bank no one can be found who saw him after he left the bank mr bellford was a man of singularly quiet and domestic tastes and seemed to find his happiness in his home and profession if any clue at all exists to his strange disappearance it my be found in the fact that for some months he has been deeply absorbed in an important law case in connection with the q y and z railroad company it is feared that overwork may have affected his mind every effort is being made to discover the whereabouts of the missing man it seems to me you are not altogether uncynical mr bolder i said after i had read the despatch this has the sound to me of a genuine case why should this man prosperous happily married and respected choose suddenly to abandon everything i know that these lapses of memory do occur and that men do find themselves adrift without a name a history or a home oh gammon and jalap said mr bolder it s larks they re after there s too much education nowadays men know about aphasia and they use it for an excuse the women are wise too when it s all over they look you in the eye as scientific as you please and say he hypnotized me thus mr bolder diverted but did not aid me with his comments and philosophy we arrived in new york about ten at night i rode in a cab to a hotel and i wrote my name edward pinkhammer in the register as i did so i felt pervade me a splendid wild intoxicating buoyancy a sense of unlimited freedom of newly attained possibilities i was just born into the world the old fetters whatever they had been were stricken from my hands and feet the future lay before me a clear road such as an infant enters and i could set out upon it equipped with a man s learning and experience i thought the hotel clerk looked at me five seconds too long i had no baggage the druggists convention i said my trunk has somehow failed to arrive i drew out a roll of money ah said he showing an auriferous tooth we have quite a number of the western delegates stopping here he struck a bell for the boy i endeavored to give color to my r ole there is an important movement on foot among us westerners i said in regard to a recommendation to the convention that the bottles containing the tartrate of antimoney and potash and the tartrate of sodium and potash be kept in a contiguous position on the shelf gentleman to three fourteen said the clerk hastily i was whisked away to my room the next day i bought a trunk and clothing and began to live the life of edward pinkhammer i did not tax my brain with endeavors to solve problems of the past it was a piquant and sparkling cup that the great island city held up to my lips i drank of it gratefully the keys of manhattan belong to him who is able to bear them you must be either the city s guest or its victim the following few days were as gold and silver edward pinkhammer yet counting back to his birth by hours only knew the rare joy of having come upon so diverting a world full fledged and unrestrained i sat entranced on the magic carpets provided in theatres and roof gardens that transported one into strange and delightful lands full of frolicsome music pretty girls and grotesque drolly extravagant parodies upon human kind i went here and there at my own dear will bound by no limits of space time or comportment i dined in weird cabarets at weirder tables d h te to the sound of hungarian music and the wild shouts of mercurial artists and sculptors or again where the night life quivers in the electric glare like a kinetoscopic picture and the millinery of the world and its jewels and the ones whom they adorn and the men who make all three possible are met for good cheer and the spectacular effect and among all these scenes that i have mentioned i learned one thing that i never knew before and that is that the key to liberty is not in the hands of license but convention holds it comity has a toll gate at which you must pay or you may not enter the land of freedom in all the glitter the seeming disorder the parade the abandon i saw this law unobtrusive yet like iron prevail therefore in manhattan you must obey these unwritten laws and then you will be freest of the free if you decline to be bound by them you put on shackles sometimes as my mood urged me i would seek the stately softly murmuring palm rooms redolent with high born life and delicate restraint in which to dine again i would go down to the waterways in steamers packed with vociferous bedecked unchecked love making clerks and shop girls to their crude pleasures on the island shores and there was always broadway glistening opulent wily varying desirable broadway growing upon one like an opium habit one afternoon as i entered my hotel a stout man with a big nose and a black mustache blocked my way in the corridor when i would have passed around him he greet me with offensive familiarity hello bellford he cried loudly what the deuce are you doing in new york didn t know anything could drag you away from that old book den of yours is mrs b along or is this a little business run alone eh you have made a mistake sir i said coldly releasing my hand from his grasp my name is pinkhammer you will excuse me the man dropped to one side apparently astonished as i walked to the clerk s desk i heard him call to a bell boy and say something about telegraph blanks you will give me my bill i said to the clerk and have my baggage brought down in half an hour i do not care to remain where i am annoyed by confidence men i moved that afternoon to another hotel a sedate old fashioned one on lower fifth avenue there was a restaurant a little way off broadway where one could be served almost al fresco in a tropic array of screening flora quiet and luxury and a perfect service made it an ideal place in which to take luncheon or refreshment one afternoon i was there picking my way to a table among the ferns when i felt my sleeve caught mr bellford exclaimed an amazingly sweet voice i turned quickly to see a lady seated alone a lady of about thirty with exceedingly handsome eyes who looked at me as though i had been her very dear friend you were about to pass me she said accusingly don t tell me you do not know me why should we not shake hands at least once in fifteen years i shook hands with her at once i took a chair opposite her at the table i summoned with my eyebrows a hovering waiter the lady was philandering with an orange ice i ordered a cr me de menthe her hair was reddish bronze you could not look at it because you could not look away from her eyes but you were conscious of it as you are conscious of sunset while you look into the profundities of a wood at twilight are you sure you know me i asked no she said smiling i was never sure of that what would you think i said a little anxiously if i were to tell you that my name is edward pinkhammer from cornopolis kansas what would i think she repeated with a merry glance why that you had not brought mrs bellford to new york with you of course i do wish you had i would have liked to see marian her voice lowered slightly you haven t changed much elwyn i felt her wonderful eyes searching mine and my face more closely yes you have she amended and there was a soft exultant note in her latest tones i see it now you haven t forgotten you haven t forgotten for a year or a day or an hour i told you you never could i poked my straw anxiously in the cr me de menthe i m sure i beg your pardon i said a little uneasy at her gaze but that is just the trouble i have forgotten i ve forgotten everything she flouted my denial she laughed deliciously at something she seemed to see in my face i ve heard of you at times she went on you re quite a big lawyer out west denver isn t it or los angeles marian must be very proud of you you knew i suppose that i married six months after you did you may have seen it in the papers the flowers alone cost two thousand dollars she had mentioned fifteen years fifteen years is a long time would it be too late i asked somewhat timorously to offer you congratulations not if you dare do it she answered with such fine intrepidity that i was silent and began to crease patterns on the cloth with my thumb nail tell me one thing she said leaning toward me rather eagerly a thing i have wanted to know for many years just from a woman s curiosity of course have you ever dared since that night to touch smell or look at white roses at white roses wet with rain and dew i took a sip of cr me de menthe it would be useless i suppose i said with a sigh for me to repeat that i have no recollection at all about these things my memory is completely at fault i need not say how much i regret it the lady rested her arms upon the table and again her eyes disdained my words and went traveling by their own route direct to my soul she laughed softly with a strange quality in the sound it was a laugh of happiness yes and of content and of misery i tried to look away from her you lie elwyn bellford she breathed blissfully oh i know you lie i gazed dully into the ferns my name is edward pinkhammer i said i came with the delegates to the druggists national convention there is a movement on foot for arranging a new position for the bottles of tartrate of antimony and tartrate of potash in which very likely you would take little interest a shining landau stopped before the entrance the lady rose i took her hand and bowed i am deeply sorry i said to her that i cannot remember i could explain but fear you would not understand you will not concede pinkhammer and i really cannot at all conceive of the the roses and other things good by mr bellford she said with her happy sorrowful smile as she stepped into her carriage i attended the theatre that night when i returned to my hotel a quiet man in dark clothes who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief appeared magically at my side mr pinkhammer he said giving the bulk of his attention to his forefinger may i request you to step aside with me for a little conversation there is a room here certainly i answered he conducted me into a small private parlor a lady and a gentleman were there the lady i surmised would have been unusually good looking had her features not been clouded by an expression of keen worry and fatigue she was of a style of figure and possessed coloring and features that were agreeable to my fancy she was in a traveling dress she fixed upon me an earnest look of extreme anxiety and pressed an unsteady hand to her bosom i think she would have started forward but the gentleman arrested her movement with an authoritative motion of his hand he then came himself to meet me he was a man of forty a little gray about the temples and with a strong thoughtful face bellford old man he said cordially i m glad to see you again of course we know everything is all right i warned you you know that you were overdoing it now you ll go back with us and be yourself again in no time i smiled ironically i havae been bellforded so often i said that it has lost its edge still in the end it may grow wearisome would you be willing at all to entertain the hypothesis that my name is edward pinkhammer and that i never saw you before in my life before the man could reply a wailing cry came from the woman she sprang past his detaining arm elwyn she sobbed and cast herself upon me and clung tight elwyn she cried again don t break my heart i am your wife call my name once just once i could see you dead rather than this way i unwound her arms respectfully but firmly madam i said severely pardon me if i suggest that you accept a resemblance too precipitately it is a pity i went on with an amused laugh as the thought occurred to me that this bellford and i could not be kept side by side upon the same shelf like tartrates of sodium and antimony for purposes of identification in order to understand the allusion i concluded airily it may be necessary for you to keep an eye on the proceedings of the druggists national convention the lady turned to her companion and grasped his arm what is it doctor volney oh what is it she moaned go to your room for a while i heard him say i will remain and talk with him his mind no i think not only a portion of the brain yes i am sure he will recover go to your room and leave me with him the lady disappeared the man in dark clothes also went outside still manicuring himself in a thoughtful way i think he waited in the hall i would like to talk with you a while mr pinkhammer if i may said the gentleman who remained very well if you care to i replied and will excuse me if i take it comfortably i am rather tired i stretched myself upon a couch by a window and lit a cigar he drew a chair nearby let us speak to the point he said soothingly your name is not pinkhammer i know that as well as you do i said coolly but a man must have a name of some sort i can assure you that i do not extravagantly admire the name of pinkhammer but when one christens one s self suddenly the fine names do not seem to suggest themselves but suppose it had been scheringhausen or scroggins i think i did very well with pinkhammer your name said the other man seriously is elwyn c bellford you are one of the first lawyers in denver you are suffering from an attack of aphasia which has caused you to forget your identity the cause of it was over application to your profession and perhaps a life too bare of natural recreation and pleasures the lady who has just left the room is your wife she is what i would call a fine looking woman i said after a judicial pause i particularly admire the shade of brown in her hair she is a wife to be proud of since your disappearance nearly two weeks ago she has scarcely closed her eyes we learned that you were in new york through a telegram sent by isidore newman a traveling man from denver he said that he had met you in a hotel here and that you did not recognize him i think i remember the occasion i said the fellow called me bellford if i am not mistaken but don t you think it about time now for you to introduce yourself i am robert volney doctor volney i have been your close friend for twenty years and your physician for fifteen i came with mrs bellford to trace you as soon as we got the telegram try elwyn old man try to remember what s the use to try i asked with a little frown you say you are a physician is aphasia curable when a man loses his memory does it return slowly or suddenly sometimes gradually and imperfectly sometimes as suddenly as it went will you undertake the treatment of my case doctor volney i asked old friend said he i ll do everything in my power and wil have done everything that science can do to cure you very well said i then you will consider that i am your patient everything is in confidence now professional confidence of course said doctor volney i got up from the couch some one had set a vase of white roses on the centre table a cluster of white roses freshly sprinkled and fragrant i threw them far out of the window and then laid myself upon the couch again it will be best bobby i said to have this cure happen suddenly i m rather tired of it all anyway you may go now and bring marian in but oh doc i said with a sigh as i kicked him on the shin good old doc it was glorious a municipal report the cities are full of pride challenging each to each this from her mountainside that from her burthened beach r kipling fancy a novel about chicago or buffalo let us say or nashville tennessee there are justthree big cities in the united states that are story cities new york of course new orleans and best of the lot san francisco frank norris east is east and west is san francisco according to californians californians are a race of people they are not merely inhabitants of a state they are the southerners of the west now chicagoans are no less loyal to their city but when you ask them why they stammer and speak of lake fish and the new odd fellows building but californians go into detail of course they have in the climate an argument that is good for half an hour while you are thinking of your coal bills and heavy underwear but as soon as they come to mistake your silence for conviction madness comes upon them and they picture the city of the golden gate as the bagdad of the new world so far as a matter of opinion no refutation is necessary but dear cousins all from adam and eve descended it is a rash one who will lay his finger on the map and say in this town there can be no romance what could happen here yes it is a bold and a rash deed to challenge in one sentence history romance and rand and mcnally nashville a city port of delivery and the capital of the state of tennessee is on the cumberland river and on the n c st l and the l n railroads this city is regarded as the most important educational centre in the south i stepped off the train at p m having searched the thesaurus in vain for adjectives i must as a substitution hie me to comparison in the form of a recipe take a london fog parts malaria parts gas leaks parts dewdrops gathered in a brick yard at sunrise parts odor of honeysuckle parts mix the mixture will give you an approximate conception of a nashville drizzle it is not so fragrant as a moth ball nor as thick as pea soup but tis enough twill serve i went to a hotel in a tumbril it required strong self suppression for me to keep from climbing to the top of it and giving an imitation of sidney carton the vehicle was drawn by beasts of a bygone era and driven by something dark and emancipated i was sleepy and tired so when i got to the hotel i hurriedly paid it the fifty cents it demanded with approximate lagniappe i assure you i knew its habits and i did not want to hear it prate about its old marster or anything that happened befo de wah the hotel was one of the kind described as renovated that means worth of new marble pillars tiling electric lights and brass cuspidors in the lobby and a new l n time table and a lithograph of lookout mountain in each one of the great rooms above the management was without reproach the attention full of exquisite southern courtesy the service as slow as the progress of a snail and as good humored as rip van winkle the food was worth traveling a thousand miles for there is no other hotel in the world where you can get such chicken livers en brochette at dinner i asked a negro waiter if there was anything doing in town he pondered gravely for a minute and then replied well boss i don t really reckon there s anything at all doin after sundown sundown had been accomplished it had been drowned in the drizzle long before so that spectacle was denied me but i went forth upon the streets in the drizzle to see what might be there it is built on undulating grounds and the streets are lighted by electricity at a cost of per annum as i left the hotel there was a race riot down upon me charged a company of freedmen or arabs or zulus armed with no i saw with relief that they were not rifles but whips and i saw dimly a caravan of black clumsy vehicles and at the reassuring shouts kyar you anywhere in the town boss fuh fifty cents i reasoned that i was merely a fare instead of a victim i walked through long streets all leading uphill i wondered how those streets ever came down again perhaps they didn t until they were graded on a few of the main streets i saw lights in stores here and there saw street cars go by conveying worthy burghers hither and yon saw people pass engaged in the art of conversation and heard a burst of semi lively laughter issuing from a soda water and ice cream parlor the streets other than main seemed to have enticed upon their borders houses consecrated to peace and domesticity in many of them lights shone behind discreetly drawn window shades in a few pianos tinkled orderly and irreproachable music there was indeed little doing i wished i had come before sundown so i returned to my hotel in november the confederate general hood advanced against nashville where he shut up a national force under general thomas the latter then sallied forth and defeated the confederates in a terrible conflict all my life i have heard of admired and witnessed the fine marksmanship of the south in its peaceful conflicts in the tobacco chewing regions but in my hotel a surprise awaited me there were twelve bright new imposing capacious brass cuspidors in the great lobby tall enough to be called urns and so wide mouthed that the crack pitcher of a lady baseball team should have been able to throw a ball into one of them at five paces distant but although a terrible battle had raged and was still raging the enemy had not suffered bright new imposing capacious untouched they stood but shades of jefferson brick the tile floor the beautiful tile floor i could not avoid thinking of the battle of nashville and trying to draw as is my foolish habit some deductions about hereditary marksmanship here i first saw major by misplaced courtesy wentworth caswell i knew him for a type the moment my eyes suffered from the sight of him a rat has no geographical habitat my old friend a tennyson said as he so well said almost everything prophet curse me the blabbing lip and curse me the british vermin the rat let us regard the word british as interchangeable ad lib a rat is a rat this man was hunting about the hotel lobby like a starved dog that had forgotten where he had buried a bone he had a face of great acreage red pulpy and with a kind of sleepy massiveness like that of buddha he possessed one single virtue he was very smoothly shaven the mark of the beast is not indelible upon a man until he goes about with a stubble i think that if he had not used his razor that day i would have repulsed his advances and the criminal calendar of the world would have been spared the addition of one murder i happened to be standing within five feet of a cuspidor when major caswell opened fire upon it i had been observant enough to percieve that the attacking force was using gatlings instead of squirrel rifles so i side stepped so promptly that the major seized the opportunity to apologize to a noncombatant he had the blabbing lip in four minutes he had become my friend and had dragged me to the bar i desire to interpolate here that i am a southerner but i am not one by profession or trade i eschew the string tie the slouch hat the prince albert the number of bales of cotton destroyed by sherman and plug chewing when the orchestra plays dixie i do not cheer i slide a little lower on the leather cornered seat and well order another w urzburger and wish that longstreet had but what s the use major caswell banged the bar with his fist and the first gun at fort sumter re echoed when he fired the last one at appomattox i began to hope but then he began on family trees and demonstrated that adam was only a third cousin of a collateral branch of the caswell family genealogy disposed of he took up to my distaste his private family matters he spoke of his wife traced her descent back to eve and profanely denied any possible rumor that she may have had relations in the land of nod by this time i was beginning to suspect that he was trying to obscure by noise the fact that he had ordered the drinks on the chance that i would be bewildered into paying for them but when they were down he crashed a silver dollar loudly upon the bar then of course another serving was obligatory and when i had paid for that i took leave of him brusquely for i wanted no more of him but before i had obtained my release he had prated loudly of an income that his wife received and showed a handful of silver money when i got my key at the desk the clerk said to me courteously if that man caswell has annoyed you and if you would like to make a complaint we will have him ejected he is a nuisance a loafer and without any known means of support although he seems to have some money most the time but we don t seem to be able to hit upon any means of throwing him out legally why no said i after some reflection i don t see my way clear to making a complaint but i would like to place myself on record as asserting that i do not care for his company your town i continued seems to be a quiet one what manner of entertainment adventure or excitement have you to offer to the stranger within your gates well sir said the clerk there will be a show here next thursday it is i ll look it up and have the announcement sent up to your room with the ice water good night after i went up to my room i looked out the window it was only about ten o clock but i looked upon a silent town the drizzle continued spangled with dim lights as far apart as currants in a cake sold at the ladies exchange a quiet place i said to myself as my first shoe struck the ceiling of the occupant of the room beneath mine nothing of the life here that gives color and variety to the cities in the east and west just a good ordinary humdrum business town nashville occupies a foremost place among the manufacturing centres of the country it is the fifth boot and shoe market in the united states the largest candy and cracker manufacturing city in the south and does an enormous wholesale drygoods grocery and drug business i must tell you how i came to be in nashville and i assure you the digression brings as much tedium to me as it does to you i was traveling elsewhere on my own business but i had a commission from a northern literary magazine to stop over there and establish a personal connection between the publication and one of its contributors azalea adair adair there was no clue to the personality except the handwriting had sent in some essays lost art and poems that had made the editors swear approvingly over their one o clock luncheon so they had commissioned me to round up said adair and corner by contract his or her output at two cents a word before some other publisher offered her ten or twenty at nine o clock the next morning after my chicken livers en brochette try them if you can find that hotel i strayed out into the drizzle which was still on for an unlimited run at the first corner i came upon uncle caesar he was a stalwart negro older than the pyramids with gray wool and a face that reminded me of brutus and a second afterwards of the late king cettiwayo he wore the most remarkable coat that i ever had seen or expect to see it reached to his ankles an had once been a confederate gray in colors but rain and sun and age had so variegated it that joseph s coat beside it would have faded to a pale monochrome i must linger with that coat for it has to do with the story the story that is so long in coming because you can hardly expect anything to happen in nashville once it must have been the military coat of an officer the cape of it had vanished but all adown its front it had been frogged and tasseled magnificently but now the frogs and tassles were gone in their stead had been patiently stitched i surmised by some surviving black mammy new frogs made of cunningly twisted common hempen twine this twine was frayed and disheveled it must have been added to the coat as a substitute for vanished splendors with tasteless but painstaking devotion for it followed faithfully the curves of the long missing frogs and to complete the comedy and pathos of the garment all its buttons were gone save one the second button from the top alone remained the coat was fastened by other twine strings tied through the buttonholes and other holes rudely pierced in the opposite side there was never such a weird garment so fantastically bedecked and of so many mottled hues the lone button was the size of a half dollar made of yellow horn and sewed on with coarse twine this negro stood by a carriage so old that ham himself might have started a hack line with it after he left the ark with the two animals hitched to it as i approached he threw open the door drew out a feather duster waved it without using it and said in deep rumbling tones step right in suh ain t a speck of dust in it jus got back from a funeral suh i inferred that on such gala occasions carriages were given an extra cleaning i looked up and down the street and perceived that there was little choice among the vehicles for hire that lined the curb i looked in my memorandum book for the address of azalea adair i want to go to jessamine street i said and was about to step into the hack but for an instant the thick long gorilla like arm of the old negro barred me on his massive and saturnine face a look of sudden suspicion and enmity flashed for a moment then with quickly returning conviction he asked blandishingly what are you gwine there for boss what is it to you i asked a little sharply nothin suh jus nothin only it s a lonesome kind of part of town and few folks ever has business out there step right in the seats is clean jes got back from a funeral suh a mile and a half it must have been to our journey s end i could hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving i could smell nothing but the drizzle now further flavored with coal smoke and something like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms all i could see through the streaming windows were two rows of dim houses the city has an area of square miles miles of streets of which miles are paved a system of waterworks that cost with miles of mains eight sixty one jessamine street was a decayed mansion thirty yards back from the street it stood outmerged in a splendid grove of trees and untrimmed shrubbery a row of box bushes overflowed and almost hid the paling fence from sight the gate was kept closed by a rope noose that encircled the gate post and the first paling of the gate but when you got inside you saw that was a shell a shadow a ghost of former grandeur and excellence but in the story i have not yet got inside when the hack had ceased from rattling and the weary quadrupeds came to a rest i handed my jehu his fifty cents with an additional quarter feeling a glow of conscious generosity as i did so he refused it it s two dollars suh he said how s that i asked i plainly heard you call out at the hotel fifty cents to any part of the town it s two dollars suh he repeated obstinately it s a long ways from the hotel it is within the city limits and well within them i argued don t think that you have picked up a greenhorn yankee do you see those hills over there i went on pointing toward the east i could not see them myself for the drizzle well i was born and raised on their other side you old fool nigger can t you tell people from other people when you see em the grim face of king cettiwayo softened is you from the south suh i reckon it was them shoes of yourn fooled me they is somethin sharp in the toes for a southern gen lman to wear then the charge is fifty cents i suppose said i inexorably his former expression a mingling of cupidity and hostility returned remained ten seconds and vanished boss he said fifty cents is right but i needs two dollars suh i m obleeged to have two dollars i ain t demandin it now suh after i know whar you s from i m jus sayin that i has to have two dollars to night and business mighty po peace and confidence settled upon his heavy features he had been luckier than he had hoped instead of having picked up a greenhorn ignorant of rates he had come upon an inheritance you confounded old rascal i said reaching down to my pocket you ought to be turned over to the police for the first time i saw him smile he knew he knew he knew i gave him two one dollar bills as i handed them over i noticed that one of them had seen parlous times its upper right hand corner was missing and it had been torn through the middle but joined again a strip of blue tissue paper pasted over the split preserved its negotiability enough of the african bandit for the present i left him happy lifted the rope and opened a creaky gate the house as i said was a shell a paint brush had not touched it in twenty years i could not see why a strong wind should not have bowled it over like a house of cards until i looked again at the trees that hugged it close the trees that saw the battle of nashville and still drew their protecting branches around it against storm and enemy and cold azalea adair fifty years old white haired a descendant of the cavaliers as thin and frail as the house she lived in robed in the cheapest and cleanest dress i ever saw with an air as simple as a queen s received me the reception room seemed a mile square because there was nothing in it except some rows of books on unpainted white pine bookshelves a cracked marble top table a rag rug a hairless horsehair sofa and two or three chairs yes there was a picture on the wall a colored crayon drawing of a cluster of pansies i looked around for the portrait of andrew jackson and the pinecone hanging basket but they were not there azalea adair and i had conversation a little of which will be repeated to you she was a product of the old south gently nurtured in the sheltered life her learning was not broad but was deep and of splendid originality in its somewhat narrow scope she had been educated at home and her knowledge of the world was derived from inference and by inspiration of such is the precious small group of essayists made whle she talked to me i kept brushing my fingers trying unconsciously to rid them guiltily of the absent dust from the half calf backs of lamb chaucer hazlitt marcus aurelius montaigne and hood she was exquisite she was a valuable discovery nearly everybody nowadays knows too much oh so much too much of real life i could perceive clearly that azalea adair was very poor a house and a dress she had not much else i fancied so divided between my duty to the magazine and my loyalty to the poets and essayists who fought thomas in the valley of the cumberland i listened to her voice which was like a harpsichord s and found that i could not speak of contracts in the presence of the nine muses and the three graces one hesitated to lower the topic to two cents there would have to be another colloquy after i had regained my commercialism but i spoke of my mission and three o clock of the next afternoon was set for the discussion of the business proposition your town i said as i began to make ready to depart which is the time for smooth generalities seems to be a quiet sedate place a home town i should say where few things out of the ordinary ever happen it carries on an extensive trade in stoves and hollow ware with the west and south and its flouring mills have a daily capacity of more than barrels azalea adair seemed to reflect i have never thought of it that way she said with a kind of sincere intensity that seemed to belong to her isn t it in the still quiet places that things do happen i fancy that when god began to create the earth on the first monday morning one could have leaned out one s window and heard the drops of mud splashing from his trowel as he built up the everlasting hills what did the noisiest project in the world i mean the building of the tower of bable result in finally a page and a half of esperanto in the north american review of course said i platitudinously human nature is the same everywhere but there is more color er more drama and movement and er romance in some cities than in others on the surface said azalea adair i have traveled many times around the world in a golden airship wafted on two wings print and dreams i have seen on one of my imaginary tours the sultan of turkey bowstring with his own hands one of his wives who had uncovered her face in public i have seen a man in nashville tear up his theatre tickets because his wife was going out with her face covered with rice powder in san francisco s chinatown i saw the slave girl sing yee dipped slowly inch by inch in boiling almond oil to make her swear she would never see her american lover again she gave in when the boiling oil had reached three inches above her knee at a euchre party in east nashville the other night i saw kitty morgan cut dead by seven of her schoolmates and lifelong friends because she had married a house painter the boiling oil was sizzling as high as her heart but i wish you could have seen the fine little smile that she carried from table to table oh yes it is a humdrum town just a few miles of red brick houses and mud and lumber yards some one knocked hollowly at the back of the house azalea adair breathed a soft apology and went to investigate the sound she came back in three minutes with brightened eyes a faint flush on her cheeks and ten years lifted from her shoulders you must have a cup of tea before you go she said and a sugar cake she reached and shook a little iron bell in shuffled a small negro girl about twelve barefoot not very tidy glowering at me with thumb in mouth and bulging eyes azlea adair opened a tiny worn purse and drew out a dollar bill a dollar bill with the upper right hand corner missing torn in two pieces and pasted together again with a strip of blue tissue paper it was one of the bills i had given the piratical negro there was no doubt about it go up to mr baker s store on the corner impy she said handing the girl the dollar bill and get a quarter of a pound of tea the kind he always sends me and ten cents worth of sugar cakes now hurry the supply of tea in the house happens to be exhausted she explained to me impy left by the back way before the scrape of her hard bare feet had died away on the back porch a wild shriek i was sure it was hers filled the hollow house then the deep gruff tones of an angry man s voice mingled with the girl s further squeals and unintelligible words azalea adair rose without surprise or emotion and disappeared for two minutes i heard the hoarse rumble of the man s voice then someting like an oath and a slight scuffle and she returned calmly to her chair this is a roomy house she said and i have a tenant for part of it i am sorry to have to rescind my invitation to tea it was impossible to get the kind i always use at the store perhaps to morrow mr baker will be able to supply me i was sure that impy had not had time to leave the house i inquired concerning street car lines and took my leave after i was well on my way i remembered that i had not learned azalea adair s name but to morrow would do that same day i started in on the course of iniquity that this uneventful city forced upon me i was in the town only two days but in that time i managed to lie shamelessly by telegraph and to be an accomplice after the fact if that is the correct legal term to a murder as i rounded the corner nearest my hotel the afrite coachman of the ploychromatic nonpareil coat seized me swung open the dungeony door of his peripatetic sarcophagus flirted his feather duster and began his ritual step right in boss carriage is clean jus got back from a funeral fifty cents to any and then he knew me and grinned broadly scuse me boss you is de gen l man what rid out with me dis mawnin thank you kindly suh i am going out to again to morrow afternoon at three said i and if you will be here i ll let you drive me so you know miss adair i concluded thinking of my dollar bill i belonged to her father judge adair suh he replied i judge that she is pretty poor i said she hasn t much money to speak of has she for an instant i looked again at the fierce countenance of king cettiwayo and then he changed back to an extortionate old negro hack driver she ain t gwine to starve suh he said slowly she has reso ces suh she has reso ces i shall pay you fifty cents for the trip said i dat is puffeckly correct suh he answered humbly i jus had to have dat two dollars dis mawnin boss i went to the hotel and lied by electricity i wired the magazine a adair holds out for eight cents a word the answer that came back was give it to her quick you duffer just before dinner major wentworth caswell bore down upon me with the greetings of a long lost friend i have seen few men whom i have so instantaneously hated and of whom it was so difficult to be rid i was standing at the bar when he invaded me therefore i could not wave the white ribbon in his face i would have paid gladly for the drinks hoping thereby to escape another but he was one of those despicable roaring advertising bibbers who must have brass bands and fireworks attend upon every cent that they waste in their follies with an air of producing millions he drew two one dollar bills from a pocket and dashed one of them upon the bar i looked once more at the dollar bill with the upper right hand corner missing torn through the middle and patched with a strip of blue tissue paper it was my dollar bill again it could have been no other i went up to my room the drizzle and the monotony of a dreary eventless southern town had made me tired and listless i remember that just before i went to bed i mentally disposed of the mysterious dollar bill which might have formed the clew to a tremendously fine detective story of san francisco by saying to myself sleepily seems as if a lot of people here own stock in the hack driver s trust pays dividends promptly too wonder if then i fell asleep king cettiwayo was at his post the next day and rattled my bones over the stones out to he was to wait and rattle me back again when i was ready azalea adair looked paler and cleaner and frailer than she had looked on the day before after she had signed the contract at eight cents per word she grew still paler and began to slip out of her chair whitout much trouble i managed to get her up on the antediluvian horsehair sofa and then i ran out to the sidewalk and yelled to the coffee colored pirate to bring a doctor with a wisdom that i had not expected in him he abandoned his team and struck off up the street afoot realizing the value of speed in ten

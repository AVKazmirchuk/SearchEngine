door she certainly was good looking but i knew how joe granberry stood with her so did willie but he kept on ba a a ing after her and following her around he had a system of persistence that didn t coincide with pale hair and light eyes hello willie says myra what are you doing to yourself in the glass i m trying to look fly says willie well you never could be fly says myra with her special laugh which was the provokingest sound i ever heard except the rattle of an empty canteen against my saddle horn i looked around at willie after myra had gone he had a kind of a lily white look on him which seemed to show that her remark had as you might say disrupted his soul i never noticed anything in what she said that sounded particularly destructive to a man s ideas of self consciousness but he was set back to an extent you could scarcely imagine after we went down stairs with our clean collars on willie never went near myra again that night after all he seemed to be a diluted kind of a skim milk sort of a chap and i never wondered that joe granberry beat him out the next day the battleship maine was blown up and then pretty soon somebody i reckon it was joe bailey or ben tillman or maybe the government declared war against spain well everybody south of mason hamlin s line knew that the north by itself couldn t whip a whole country the size of spain so the yankees commenced to holler for help and the johnny rebs answered the call we re coming father william a hundred thousand strong and then some was the way they sang it and the old party lines drawn by sherman s march and the kuklux and nine cent cotton and the jim crow street car ordinances faded away we became one undivided country with no north very little east a good sized chunk of west and a south that loomed up as big as the first foreign label on a new eight dollar suit case of course the dogs of war weren t a complete pack without a yelp from the san augustine rifles company d of the fourteenth texas regiment our company was among the first to land in cuba and strike terror into the hearts of the foe i m not going to give you a history of the war i m just dragging it in to fill out my story about willie robbins just as the republican party dragged it in to help out the election in if anybody ever had heroitis it was that willie robbins from the minute he set foot on the soil of the tyrants of castile he seemed to engulf danger as a cat laps up cream he certainly astonished every man in our company from the captain up you d have expected him to gravitate naturally to the job of an orderly to the colonel or typewriter in the commissary but not any he created the part of the flaxen haired boy hero who lives and gets back home with the goods instead of dying with an important despatch in his hands at his colonel s feet our company got into a section of cuban scenery where one of the messiest and most unsung portions of the campaign occurred we were out every day capering around in the bushes and having little skirmishes with the spanish troops that looked more like kind of tired out feuds than anything else the war was a joke to us and of no interest to them we never could see it any other way than as a howling farce comedy that the san augustine rifles were actually fighting to uphold the stars and stripes and the blamed little senors didn t get enough pay to make them care whether they were patriots or traitors now and then somebody would get killed it seemed like a waste of life to me i was at coney island when i went to new york once and one of them down hill skidding apparatuses they call roller coasters flew the track and killed a man in a brown sack suit whenever the spaniards shot one of our men it struck me as just about as unnecessary and regrettable as that was but i m dropping willie robbins out of the conversation he was out for bloodshed laurels ambition medals recommendations and all other forms of military glory and he didn t seem to be afraid of any of the recognized forms of military danger such as spaniards cannon balls canned beef gunpowder or nepotism he went forth with his pallid hair and china blue eyes and ate up spaniards like you would sardines a la canopy wars and rumbles of wars never flustered him he would stand guard duty mosquitoes hardtack treat and fire with equally perfect unanimity no blondes in history ever come in comparison distance of him except the jack of diamonds and queen catherine of russia i remember one time a little caballard of spanish men sauntered out from behind a patch of sugar cane and shot bob turner the first sergeant of our company while we were eating dinner as required by the army regulations we fellows went through the usual tactics of falling into line saluting the enemy and loading and firing kneeling that wasn t the texas way of scrapping but being a very important addendum and annex to the regular army the san augustine rifles had to conform to the red tape system of getting even by the time we had got out our upton s tactics turned to page fifty seven said one two three one two three a couple of times and got blank cartridges into our springfields the spanish outfit had smiled repeatedly rolled and lit cigarettes by squads and walked

investigated the scenes of the robberies and was heard to remark that s dandy jim valentine s autograph he s resumed business look at that combination knob jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in wet weather he s got the only clamps that can do it and look how clean those tumblers were punched out jimmy never has to drill but one hole yes i guess i want mr valentine he ll do his bit next time without any short time or clemency foolishness ben price knew jimmy s habits he had learned them while working on the springfield case long jumps quick get aways no confederates and a taste for good society these ways had helped mr valentine to become noted as a successful dodger of retribution it was given out that ben price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman and other people with burglar proof safes felt more at ease one afternoon jimmy valentine and his suit case climbed out of the mail hack in elmore a little town five miles off the railroad down in the black jack country of arkansas jimmy looking like an athletic young senior just home from college went down the board side walk toward the hotel a young lady crossed the street passed him at the corner and entered a door over which was the sign the elmore bank jimmy valentine looked into her eyes forgot what he was and became another man she lowered her eyes and coloured slightly young men of jimmy s style and looks were scarce in elmore jimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if he were one of the stockholders and began to ask him questions about the town feeding him dimes at intervals by and by the young lady came out looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suit case and went her way isn that young lady polly simpson asked jimmy with specious guile naw said the boy she s annabel adams her pa owns this bank why d you come to elmore for is that a gold watch chain i m going to get a bulldog got any more dimes jimmy went to the planters hotel registered as ralph d spencer and engaged a room he leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the clerk he said he had come to elmore to look for a location to go into business how was the shoe business now in the town he had thought of the shoe business was there an opening the clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of jimmy he himself was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded youth of elmore but he now perceived his shortcomings while trying to figure out jimmy s manner of tying his four in hand he cordially gave information yes there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line there wasn t an exclusive shoe store in the place the dry goods and general stores handled them business in all lines was fairly good hoped mr spencer would decide to locate in elmore he would find it a pleasant town to live in and the people very sociable mr spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look over the situation no the clerk needn t call the boy he would carry up his suit case himself it was rather heavy mr ralph spencer the phoenix that arose from jimmy valentine s ashes ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love remained in elmore and prospered he opened a shoe store and secured a good run of trade socially he was also a success and made many friends and he accomplished the wish of his heart he met miss annabel adams and became more and more captivated by her charms at the end of a year the situation of mr ralph spencer was this he had won the respect of the community his shoe store was flourishing and he and annabel were engaged to be married in two weeks mr adams the typical plodding country banker approved of spencer annabel s pride in him almost equalled her affection he was as much at home in the family of mr adams and that of annabel s married sister as if he were already a member one day jimmy sat down in his room and wrote this letter which he mailed to the safe address of one of his old friends in st

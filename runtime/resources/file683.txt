front flat he sat upon a hornblende couch and gazed with satiated eyes at art brought home to the people in the shape of the storm tacked against the wall mrs hop kins discoursed droningly of the dinner smells from the flat across the ball the flea bitten terrier gave hopkins a look of disgust and showed a man hating tooth here was neither poverty love nor war but upon such barren stems may be grafted those essentials of a complete life john hopkins sought to inject a few raisins of conversation into the tasteless dough of existence putting a new elevator in at the office he said discarding

stopped suddenly stricken by a need that made itself known to him i believe i ll walk down to the corner and get a five cent cigar he concluded john hopkins took his bat aid picked his way down the musty halls and stairs of the flat house the evening air was mild and the streets shrill with the careless cries of children playing games con trolled by mysterious rhythms and phrases their elders

corner cigar store aimed at by john hopkins was kept by a man named freshmayer who looked upon the earth as a sterile promontory hopkins unknown in the store entered and called genially for his bunch

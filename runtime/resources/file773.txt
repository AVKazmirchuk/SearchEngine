looked up wonderingly reeves found the sheriff s mild eye resting upon him he flushed a little see here he said with some asperity my name s reeves and i don t want you too but the comedy of the thing came to his rescue and he ended with a laugh i suppose mr plunkett said morgan carefully seasoning an alligator pear that you are aware of the fact that you will import a good deal of trouble for your self into kentucky if you take back the wrong man that is of course if you take anybody back thank you for the salt said the sheriff oh i ll take somebody back it ll be one of you two gentlemen yes i know i d get stuck for damages if i make a mis take but i m going to try to get the right man i ll tell you what you do said morgan leaning for ward with a jolly twinkle in his eyes you take me i ll go without any trouble the cocoanut business hasn t panned out well this year and i d like to make some extra money out of your bondsmen that s not fair chimed in reeves i got only a thousand for my last shipment take me mr plunkett i ll take wade williams said the sheriff patiently or i ll come pretty close to it it s like dining with a ghost remarked morgan with a pretended shiver the ghost of a murderer too will somebody pass the toothpicks to the shade of the naughty mr williams plunkett seemed as unconcerned as if he were dining at his own table in chatham county he was a gallant trencherman and the strange tropic viands tickled his palate heavy commonplace almost slothful in his movements he appeared to be devoid of all the cunning and watchfulness of the sleuth he even ceased to observe with any sharpness or attempted discrimination the two men one of whom he had undertaken with sur prising self confidence to drag away upon the serious charge of wife murder here indeed was a problem set before him that if wrongly solved would have amounted to his serious discomfiture yet there he sat puzzling his soul to all appearances over the novel flavour of a broiled iguana cutlet the consul felt a decided discomfort reeves and morgan were his friends and pals yet the sheriff from kentucky had a certain right to his official aid and moral support so bridger sat the silentest around the board and tried to estimate the peculiar situation his con clusion was that both reeves and morgan quickwitted as he knew them to be had conceived at the moment of plunkett s disclosure of his mission and in the brief space of a lightning flash the idea that the other might be the guilty williams and that each of them had decided in that moment loyally to protect his comrade against the doom that threatened him this was the consul s theory and if he had been a bookmaker at a race of wits for life and liberty he would have offered heavy odds against the plodding sheriff from chatham county kentucky when the meal was concluded the carib woman came and removed the dishes and cloth reeves strewed them table with excellent cigars and plunkett with the others lighted one of these with evident gratification i may be dull said morgan with a grin and a wink at bridger but i want to know if i am now i say this is all a joke of mr plunkett s concocted to frighten two babes in the woods is this williamson to be taken seriously or not williams corrected plunkett gravely i never got off any jokes in my life i know i wouldn t travel miles to get off a poor one as this would be if i didn t take wade williams back with me gentlemen continued the sheriff now letting his mild eyes travel impartially from one of the company to another see if you can find any joke in this case wade williams is listening to the words i utter now but out of politeness i will speak of him as a third person for five years he made his wife lead the life of a dog no i ll take that back no dog in kentucky was ever treated as she was he spent the money that she brought him spent it at races at the card table and on horses and hunting he was a good fellow to his friends but a cold sullen demon at home he wound up the five years of neglect by strik ing her with his closed hand a hand as hard as a stone when she was ill and weak from suffering she died the next day and he skipped that s all there is to it it s enough i never saw williams but i knew his wife i m not a man to tell half she and i were keep ing company when she met him she went to louisville on a visit and saw him there i ll admit that he spoilt my chances in no time i lived then on the edge of the cumberland mountains i was elected sheriff of chatham county a year after wade williams killed his wife my official duty sends me out here after him but i ll admit that there s personal feeling too and he s going back with me mr er reeves will you pass me a match awfully imprudent of williams said morgan putting his feet up against the wall to strike a kentucky lady seems to me i ve heard they were scrappers bad bad williams said reeves pouring out more scotch the two men spoke lightly but the consul saw and felt the tension and the carefulness in their actions and words good old fellows he

men in town everybody called him dicky everybody cheered up at the sight of him especially the natives to whom his marvellous red hair and his free and easy style were a constant delight and envy wherever you went in the town you would soon see dicky or hear his genial laugh and find around him a group of admirers who appreciated him both for his good nature and the white wine he was always so ready to buy a considerable amount of speculation was had concerning the object of his sojourn there until one day he silenced this by opening a small shop for the sale of tobacco dulces and the handiwork of the interior indians fibre and silk woven goods deerskin zapatos and basketwork of tule reeds even then he did not change his habits for he was drinking and playing cards half the day and night with the comandante the collector of customs the jefe politico and other gay dogs among the native officials one day dicky saw pasa the daughter of madama ortiz sitting in the side door of the hotel de los extranjeros he stopped in his tracks still for the first time in coralio and then he sped swift as a deer to find vasquez a gilded native youth to present him the young men had named pasa la santita naranjadita naranjadita is a spanish word for a certain color that you must go to more trouble to describe in english by saying the little saint tinted the most beautiful delicate slightly orange golden you will approximate the description of madama ortiz s daughter la madama ortiz sold rum in addition to other liquors now you must know that the rum expiates whatever opprobrium attends upon the other commodities for rum making mind you is a government monopoly and to keep a government dispensary assures respectability if not preeminence moreover the saddest of precisians could find no fault with the conduct of the shop customers drank there in the lowest of spirits and fearsomely as in the shadow of the dead for madama s ancient and vaunted lineage counteracted even the rum s behest to be merry for was she not of the iglesias who landed with pizarro and had not her deceased husband been comisionado de caminos y puentes for the district in the evenings pasa sat by the window in the room next to the one where they drank and strummed dreamily upon her guitar and then by twos and threes would come visiting young caballeros and occupy the prim line of chairs set against the wall of this room they were there to besiege the heart of la santita their method which is not proof against intelligent competition consisted of expanding the chest looking valorous and consuming a gross or two of cigarettes even saints delicately oranged prefer to be wooed differently dona pasa would tide over the vast chasms of nicotinized silence with music from her guitar while she wondered if the romances she had read about gallant and more more contiguous cavaliers were all lies at somewhat regular intervals madama would glide in from the dispensary with a sort of drought suggesting gleam in her eye and there would be a rustling of stiffly starched white trousers as one of the caballeros would propose an adjournment to the bar that dicky maloney would sooner or later explore this field was a thing to be foreseen there were few doors in coralio into which his red head had not been poked in an incredibly short space of time after his first sight of her he was there

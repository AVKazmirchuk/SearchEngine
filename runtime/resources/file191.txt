a good long talk about old times the two men started up the street arm in arm the man from the west his egotism enlarged by success was beginning to outline the history of his career the other submerged in his overcoat listened with interest at the corner stood a drug store brilliant with electric lights when they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other s face the man from the west stopped suddenly and released his arm you re not jimmy wells he snapped twenty years is a long time but not long enough to change a man s nose from a roman to a pug it sometimes changes a good man into a bad one said the tall man you ve been under arrest for ten minutes silky bob chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you going quietly are you that s sensible now before we go on to the station here s a note i was asked to hand you you may read it here at the window it s from patrolman wells the man from the west unfolded the little piece of paper handed him his hand was steady when he began to read but it trembled a little by the time he had finished the note was rather short bob i was at the appointed place on time when you struck the match to light your cigar i saw it was the face of the man wanted in chicago somehow i couldn t do it myself so i went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job jimmy lost on dress parade mr towers chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom one iron was heating on a small gas stove the other was being pushed vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be seen later on extending in straight lines from mr chandler s patent leather shoes to the edge of his low cut vest so much of the hero s toilet may be intrusted to our confidence the remainder may be guessed by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient our next view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging house immaculately and correctly clothed calm assured handsome in appearance the typical new york young clubman setting out slightly bored to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening chandler s honorarium was per week he was employed in the office of an architect he was twenty two years old he considered architecture to be truly an art and he honestly believed though he would not have dared to admit it in new york that the flatiron building was inferior to design to the great cathedral in milan out of each week s earnings chandler set aside at the end of each ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated he purchased one gentleman s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old father time he arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents he took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest and there dined with taste and luxury with ten dollars a man may for a few hours play the wealthy idler to perfection the sum is ample for a well considered meal a bottle bearing a respectable label commensurate tips a smoke cab fare and the ordinary etceteras this one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to chandler a source of renascent bliss to the society bud comes but one debut it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened but to chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen as thrilling as new as the first had been to sit among bon vivants under palms in the swirl of concealed music to look upon the habitues of such a paradise and to be looked upon by them what is a girl s first dance and short sleeved tulle compared with this up broadway chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade for this evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer for the next sixty nine evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious table d hotes at whirlwind lunch counters on sandwiches and beer in his hall bedroom he was willing to do that for he was a true son of the great city of razzle dazzle and to him one evening in the limelight made up for many dark ones chandler protracted his walk until the forties began to intersect the great and glittering primrose way for the evening was yet young and when one is of the beau monde only one day in seventy one loves to protract the pleasure eyes bright sinister curious admiring provocative alluring were bent upon him for his garb and air proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure at a certain corner he came to a standstill proposing to himself the question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury just then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner slipped on a patch of icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy the girl hobbled to the wall of the building leaned against it and thanked him demurely i think my ankle is strained she said it twisted when i fell does it pain you much inquired chandler only when i rest my weight upon it i think i will be able to walk in a minute or two if i can be of any further service suggested the young man i will call a cab or thank you said the girl softly but heartily i am sure you need not trouble yourself any further

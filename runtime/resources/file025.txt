s the menger and the maverick and and the fi th av noo and the waldorf astoria mimicked mcguire told you i went broke i m on de bum proper i ve got one dime left maybe a trip to europe or a sail in me private yacht would fix me up pa per he flung his dime at a newsboy got his express propped his back against the truck and was at once rapt in the account of his waterloo as expanded by the ingenious press curtis raidler interrogated an enormous gold watch and laid his hand on mcguire s shoulder come on bud he said we got three minutes to catch the train sarcasm seemed to be mcguire s vein you ain t seen me cash in any chips or call a turn since i told you i was broke a minute ago have you friend chase yourself away you re going down to my ranch said the cattleman and stay till you get well six months ll fix you good as new he lifted mcguire with one hand and half dragged him in the direction of the train what about the money said mcguire struggling weakly to escape money for what asked raidler puzzled they eyed each other not understanding for they touched only as at the gear of bevelled cog wheels at right angles and moving upon different axes passengers on the south bound saw them seated together and wondered at the conflux of two such antipodes mcguire was five feet one with a countenance belonging to either yokohama or dublin bright beady of eye bony of cheek and jaw scarred toughened broken and reknit indestructible grisly gladiatorial as a hornet he was a type neither new nor unfamiliar raidler was the product of a different soil six feet two in height miles broad and no deeper than a crystal brook he represented the union of the west and south few accurate pictures of his kind have been made for art galleries are so small and the mutoscope is as yet unknown in texas after all the only possible medium of portrayal of raidler s kind would be the fresco something high and simple and cool and unframed they were rolling southward on the international the timber was huddling into little dense green motts at rare distances before the inundation of the downright vert prairies this was the land of the ranches the domain of the kings of the kine mcguire sat

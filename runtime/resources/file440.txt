right is the foot of a stairway a man there holds out his hand goodall extends his full of silver the man selects therefrom a coin goodall goes upstairs and sees there two galleries extending along the sides of a concert hall which he now perceives to lie below and beyond the anteroom he first entered these galleries are divided into boxes or stalls which bestow with the aid of hanging lace curtains a certain privacy upon their occupants passing with aimless feet down the aisle contiguous to these saucy and discreet compartments he is half checked by the sight in one of them of a young woman alone and seated in an attitude of reflection this young woman becomes aware of his approach a smile from her brings him to a standstill and her subsequent invitation draws him though hesitating to the other chair in the box a little table between them goodall is only nineteen there are some whom when the terrible god phthisis wishes to destroy be first makes beautiful and the boy is one of these his face is wax and an awful pulchritude is born of the menacing flame in his cheeks his eyes reflect an unearthly vista engendered by the certainty of his doom as it is forbidden man to guess accurately concerning his fate it is inevitable that he shall tremble at the slightest lifting of the veil the young woman is well dressed and exhibits a beauty of distinctly feminine and tender sort an eve like comeliness that scarcely seems predestined to fade it is immaterial the steps by which the two mount to a certain plane of good understanding they are short and few as befits the occasion a button against the wall of the partition is frequently disturbed and a waiter comes and goes at signal pensive beauty would nothing of wine two thick plaits of her blond hair hang almost to the floor she is a lineal descendant of the lorelei so the waiter brings the brew effervescent icy greenish golden the orchestra on the stage is playing oh rachel the youngsters have exchanged a good bit of information she calls him walter and he calls her miss rosa goodall s tongue is loosened and he has told her everything about himself about his home in tennessee the old pillared mansion under the oaks the stables the hunting the friends he has down to the chickens and the box bushes bordering the walks about his coming south for the climate hoping to escape the hereditary foe of his family all about his three months on a ranch the deer hunts the rattlers and the rollicking in the cow camps then of his advent to santone where he had indirectly learned from a great specialist that his life s calendar probably contains but two more leaves and then of this death white choking night which has come and strangled his fortitude and sent him out to seek a port amid its depressing billows my weekly letter from home failed to come he told her and i was pretty blue i knew i had to go before long and i was tired of waiting i went out and bought morphine at every drug store where they would sell me a few tablets i got thirty six quarter grains and was going back to my room and take them but i met a queer fellow on a bridge who had a new idea goodall fillips a little pasteboard box upon the table i put em all together in there miss rosa being a woman must raise the lid and gave a slight shiver at the innocent looking triturates horrid things but those little white bits they could never kill one indeed they could walter knew better nine grains of morphia why half the amount might miss rosa demands to know about mr hurd of toledo and is told she laughs like a delighted child what a funny fellow but tell me more about your home and your sisters walter i know enough about texas and tarantulas and cowboys the theme is dear just now to his mood and he lays before her the simple details of a true home the little ties and endearments that so fill the exile s heart of his sisters one alice furnishes him a theme he loves to dwell upon she is like you miss rosa he says maybe not quite so pretty but just as nice and good and there walter says miss rosa sharply now talk about something else but a shadow falls upon the wall outside preceding a big softly treading man finely dressed who pauses a second before the curtains and then passes on presently comes the waiter with a message mr rolfe says tell rolfe i m engaged i don t know why it is says goodall of memphis but i don t feel as bad as i did an hour ago i wanted to die but since i ve met you miss rosa i d like so much to live the young woman whirls around the table lays an arm behind his neck and kisses him on the cheek you must dear boy she says i know what was the matter it was the miserable foggy weather that has lowered your spirit and mine too a little but look now with a little spring she has drawn back the curtains a window is in the wall opposite and lo the mist is cleared away the indulgent moon is out again revoyaging the plumbless sky roof and parapet and spire are softly pearl enamelled twice thrice the retrieved river flashes back between the houses the light of the firmament a tonic day will dawn sweet and prosperous talk

over the footlights and offer you fifty a week as a starter i ll let you draw it down from my own salary every monday night now am i talking on the level or am i not amateur night at creary s eighth avenue theatre is cut by the same pattern as amateur nights elsewhere after the regular performance the humblest talent may by previous arrangement with the management make its debut upon the public stage ambitious non professionals mostly self instructed display their skill and powers of entertainment along the broadest lines they may sing dance mimic juggle contort recite or disport themselves along any of the ragged boundary lines of art from the ranks of these anxious tyros are chosen the professionals that adorn or otherwise make conspicuous the full blown stage press agents delight in recounting to open mouthed and close eared reporters stories of the humble beginnings of the brilliant stars whose orbits they control such and such a prima donna they will tell you made her initial bow to the public while turning handsprings on an amateur night one great matinee favorite made his debut on a generous friday evening singing coon songs of his own composition a tragedian famous on two continents and an island first attracted attention by an amateur impersonation of a newly landed scandinavian peasant girl one broadway comedian that turns em away got a booking on a friday night by reciting seriously the graveyard scene in hamlet thus they get their chance amateur night is a kindly boon it is charity divested of almsgiving it is a brotherly hand reached down by members of the best united band of coworkers in the world to raise up less fortunate ones without labelling them beggars it gives you the chance if you can grasp it to step for a few minutes before some badly painted scenery and during the playing by the orchestra of some ten or twelve bars of music and while the soles of your shoes may be clearly holding to the uppers to secure a salary equal to a congressman s or any orthodox minister s could an ambitious student of literature or financial methods get a chance like that by spending twenty minutes in a carnegie library i do not not trow so but shall we look in at creary s let us say that the specific friday night had arrived on which the fortunate mac mcgowan was to justify the flattering predictions of his distinguished patron and incidentally drop his silver talent into the slit of the slot machine of fame and fortune that gives up reputation and dough i offer sure of your acquiescence that we now forswear hypocritical philosophy and bigoted comment permitting the story to finish itself in the dress of material allegations a medium more worthy when held to the line than the most laborious creations of the word milliners page of o henry s manuscript missing here easily among the wings with his patron the great del delano for whatever footlights shone in the city that would be amused the freedom of their unshaded side was del s and if he should take up an amateur see and bring him around see and winking one of his cold blue eyes say to the manager take it from me he s got the goods see you wouldn t expect that amateur to sit on an unpainted bench sudorifically awaiting his turn would you so mac strolled around largely with the nonpareil and the seven waited clammily on the bench a giant in shirt sleeves with a grim kind face in which many stitches had been taken by surgeons from time to time i e with a long stick looped at the end he was the man with the hook the manager with his close smoothed blond hair his one sided smile and his abnormally easy manner pored with patient condescension over the difficult program of the amateurs the last of the professional turns the grand march of the happy huzzard had been completed the last wrinkle and darn of their blue silkolene cotton tights had vanished from the stage the man in the orchestra who played the kettle drum cymbals triangle sandpaper whang doodle hoof beats and catcalls and fired the pistol shots had wiped his brow the illegal holiday of the romans had arrived while the orchestra plays the famous waltz from the dismal wife let us bestow two hundred words upon the psychology of the audience the orchestra floor was filled by people the boxes contained persons in the galleries was the foreordained verdict the claque was there as it had originated in the stone age and was afterward adapted by the french every micky and maggie who sat upon creary s amateur bench wise beyond their talents knew that their success or doom lay already meted out to them by that crowded whistling roaring mass of romans in the three galleries they knew that the winning or the losing of the game for each one lay in the strength of the gang aloft that could turn the applause to its favorite on a broadway first night a wooer of fame may win it from the ticket buyers over the heads of the cognoscenti but not so at creary s the amateur s fate is arithmetical the number of his supporting admirers present at his try out decides it in advance but how these outlying friday nights put to a certain shame the mondays tuesdays wednesdays thursdays saturdays and matinees of the broadway stage you should know here the manuscript ends aristocracy versus hash from the rolling stone the snake reporter of the rolling stone was wandering up the avenue last night on his way home from the y m c a rooms when he was approached by a gaunt hungry looking man with wild eyes and dishevelled hair he accosted the reporter in a hollow weak voice can you tell me sir where i can find in this town a family of scrubs i don t understand exactly let me tell you how it is said the stranger inserting his forefinger in the reporter s buttonhole and badly damaging his chrysanthemum i am a representative from soapstone county and i and my family are houseless homeless and shelterless we have not tasted food for over a week i brought my family with me as i have indigestion and could not get around much with the boys some days ago i started out to find a boarding house as i cannot afford to put up at a hotel i found a nice aristocratic looking place that suited me and went in and asked for the proprietress a very stately lady with a roman nose came in the room she had one hand laid across her stom across her waist and the other held a lace handkerchief i told her i wanted board for myself and family and she condescended to take us i asked for her terms and she said per week i had two dollars in my pocket and i gave her that for a fine teapot that i broke when i fell over the table when she spoke you appear surprised says she you will please remembah that i am the widow of governor riddle of georgiah my family is very highly connected i give you board as a favah i nevah considah money any equivalent for the advantage of my society i well i got out of there and i went to some other places the next lady was a cousin of general mahone of virginia and wanted four dollars an hour for a back room with a pink motto and a burnet granite bed in it the next one was an aunt of davy crockett and asked eight dollars a day for a room furnished in imitation of the alamo with prunes for breakfast and one hour s conversation with her for dinner another one said she was a descendant of benedict arnold on her father s side and captain kidd on the other she took more after captain kidd she only had one meal and prayers a day and counted her society worth a week i found nine widows of supreme judges twelve relicts of governors and generals and twenty two ruins left by various happy colonels professors and majors who valued their aristocratic worth from to per week with weak kneed hash and dried apples on the side i admire people of fine descent but my stomach yearns for pork and beans instead of culture am i not right your words said the reporter convince me that you have uttered what you have said thanks you see how it is i am not wealthy i have only my per diem and my perquisites and i cannot afford to pay for high lineage and moldy ancestors a little corned beef goes further with me than a coronet and when i am cold a coat of arms does not warm me i greatly fear said the reporter with a playful hiccough that you have run against a high toned town most all the first class boarding houses here are run by ladies of the old southern families the very first in the land i am now desperate said the representative as he chewed a tack awhile thinking it was a clove i want to find a boarding house where the proprietress was an orphan found in a livery stable whose father was a dago from east austin and whose grandfather was never placed on the map i want a scrubby ornery low down snuff dipping back woodsy piebald gang who never heard of finger bowls or ward mcallister but who can get up a mess of hot cornbread and irish stew at regular market quotations is there such a place in austin the snake reporter sadly shook his head i do not know he said but i will shake you for the beer ten minutes later the slate in the blue ruin saloon bore two additional characters the prisoner of zembla from the rolling stone so the king fell into a furious rage so that none durst go near him for fear and he gave out that since the princess ostla had disobeyed him there would be a great tourney and to the knight who should prove himself of the greatest valor he would give the hand of the princess and he sent forth a herald to proclaim that he would do this and the herald went about the country making his desire known blowing a great tin horn and riding a noble steed that pranced and gambolled and the villagers gazed upon him and said lo that is one of them tin horn gamblers concerning which the chroniclers have told us and when the day came the king sat in the grandstand holding the gage of battle in his band and by his side sat the princess ostla looking very pale and beautiful but with mournful eyes from which she scarce could keep the tears and the knights which came to the tourney gazed upon the princess in wonder at her beauty and each swore to win so that he could marry her and board with the king suddenly the heart of the princess gave a great bound for she saw among the knights one of the poor students with whom she had been in love the knights mounted and rode in a line past the grandstand and the king stopped the poor student who had the worst horse and the poorest caparisons of any of the knights and said sir knight prithee tell me of what that marvellous shacky and rusty looking armor of thine is made oh king said the young knight seeing that we are about to engage in a big fight i would call it scrap iron wouldn t you ods bodkins said the king the youth hath a pretty wit about this time the princess ostla who began to feel better at the sight of her lover slipped a piece of gum into her mouth and closed her teeth upon it and even smiled a little and showed the beautiful pearls with which her mouth was set whereupon as soon as the knights perceived this of them went over to the king s treasurer and settled for their horse feed and went home it seems very hard said the princess that i cannot marry when i chews but two of the knights were left one of them being the princess lover here s enough for a fight anyhow said the king come hither o knights will ye joust for the hand of this fair lady we joust will said the knights the two knights fought for two hours and at length the princess lover prevailed and stretched the other upon the ground the victorious knight made his horse caracole before the king and bowed low in his saddle on the princess ostla s cheeks was a rosy flush in her eyes the light of excitement vied with the soft glow of love her lips were parted her lovely hair unbound and she grasped the arms of her chair and leaned forward with heaving bosom and happy smile to hear the words of her lover you have foughten well sir knight said the king and if there is any boon you crave you have but to name it then said the knight i will ask you this i have bought the patent rights in your kingdom for schneider s celebrated monkey wrench and i want a letter from you endorsing it you shall have it said the king but i must tell you that there is not a monkey in my kingdom with a yell of rage the victorious knight threw himself on his horse and rode away at a furious gallop the king was about to speak when a horrible suspicion flashed upon him and he fell dead upon the grandstand my god he cried he has forgotten to take the princess with him a strange story from the rolling stone in the northern part of austin there once dwelt an honest family by the name of smothers the family consisted of john smothers his wife himself their little daughter five years of age and her parents making six people toward the population of the city when counted for a special write up but only three by actual count one night after supper the little girl was seized with a severe colic and john smothers hurried down town to get some medicine he never came back the little girl recovered and in time grew up to womanhood the mother grieved very much over her husband s disappearance and it was nearly three months before she married again and moved to san antonio the little girl also married in time and after a few years had rolled around she also had a little girl five years of age she still lived in the same house where they dwelt when her father had left and never returned one night by a remarkable coincidence her little girl was taken with cramp colic on the anniversary of the disappearance of john smothers who would now have been her grandfather if he had been alive and had a steady job i will go downtown and get some medicine for her said john smith for it was none other than he whom she had married no no dear john cried his wife you too might disappear forever and then forget to come back so john smith did not go and together they sat by the bedside of little pansy for that was pansy s name after a little pansy seemed to grow worse and john smith again attempted to go for medicine but his wife would not let him suddenly the door opened and an old man stooped and bent with long white hair entered the room hello here is grandpa said pansy she had recognized him before any of the others the old man drew a bottle of medicine from his pocket and gave pansy a spoonful she got well immediately i was a little late said john smothers as i waited for a street car fickle fortune or how gladys hustled from the rolling stone press me no more mr snooper said gladys vavasour smith i can never be yours you have led me to believe different gladys said bertram d snooper the setting sun was flooding with golden light the oriel windows of a magnificent mansion situated in one of the most aristocratic streets west of the brick yard bertram d snooper a poor but ambitious and talented young lawyer had just lost his first suit he had dared to aspire to the hand of gladys vavasour smith the beautiful and talented daughter of one of the oldest and proudest families in the county the bluest blood flowed in her veins her grandfather had sawed wood for the hornsbys and an aunt on her mother s side had married a man who had been kicked by general lee s mule the lines about bertram d snooper s hands and mouth were drawn tighter as he paced to and fro waiting for a reply to the question he intended to ask gladys as soon as he thought of one at last an idea occurred to him why will you not marry me he asked in an inaudible tone because said gladys firmly speaking easily with great difficulty the progression and enlightenment that the woman of to day possesses demand that the man shall bring to the marriage altar a heart and body as free from the debasing and hereditary iniquities that now no longer exist except in the chimerical imagination of enslaved custom it is as i expected said bertram wiping his heated brow on the window curtain you have been reading books besides that continued gladys ignoring the deadly charge you have no money the blood of the snoopers rose hastily and mantled the cheek of bertram d he put on his coat and moved proudly to the door stay here till i return he said i will be back in fifteen years when he had finished speaking he ceased and left the room when he had gone gladys felt an uncontrollable yearning take possession of her she said slowly rather to herself than for publication i wonder if there was any of that cold cabbage left from dinner she then left the room when she did so a dark complexioned man with black hair and gloomy desperate looking clothes came out of the fireplace where he had been concealed and stated aha i have you in my power at last bertram d snooper gladys vavasour smith shall be mine i am in the possession of secrets that not a soul in the world suspects i have papers to prove that bertram snooper is the heir to the footnote an estate famous in texas legal history it took many many years for adjustment and a large part of the property was of course consumed as expenses of litigation tom bean estate and i have discovered that gladys grandfather who sawed wood for the hornsby s was also a cook in major rhoads fisher s command during the war therefore the family repudiate her and she will marry me in order to drag their proud name down in the dust ha ha ha as the reader has doubtless long ago discovered this man was no other than henry r grasty mr grasty then proceeded to gloat some more and then with a sardonic laugh left for new york fifteen years have elapsed of course our readers will understand that this is only supposed to the the case it really took less than a minute to make the little stars that represent an interval of time we could not afford to stop a piece in the middle and wait fifteen years before continuing it we hope this explanation will suffice we are careful not to create any wrong impressions gladys vavasour smith and henry r grasty stood at the marriage altar mr grasty had evidently worked his rabbit s foot successfully although he was quite a while in doing so just as the preacher was about to pronounce the fatal words on which he would have realized ten dollars and had the laugh on mr grasty the steeple of the church fell off and bertram d snooper entered the preacher fell to the ground with a dull thud he could ill afford to lose ten dollars he was hastily removed and a cheaper one secured bertram d snooper held a statesman in his hand aha he said i thought i would surprise you i just got in this morning here is a paper noticing my arrival he handed it to henry r grasty mr grasty looked at the paper and turned deadly pale it was dated three weeks after mr snooper s arrival foiled again he hissed speak bertram d snooper said gladys why have you come between me and henry i have just discovered that i am the sole heir to tom bean s estate and am worth two million dollars with a glad cry gladys threw herself in bertram s arms henry r grasty drew from his breast pocket a large tin box and opened it took therefrom pages of closely written foolscap what you say is true mr snooper but i ask you to read that he said handing it to bertram snooper mr snooper had no sooner read the document than he uttered a piercing shriek and bit off a large chew of tobacco all is lost he said what is that document asked gladys governor hogg s message it is not as bad as that said bertram but it deprives me of my entire fortune but i care not for that gladys since i have won you what is it speak i implore you said gladys those papers said henry r grasty are the proofs of my appointment as administrator of the tom bean estate with a loving cry gladys threw herself in henry r grasty s arms twenty minutes later bertram d snooper was seen deliberately to enter a beer saloon on seventeenth street an apology this appeared in the rolling stone shortly before it suspended publication never to resume the person who sweeps the office translates letters from foreign countries deciphers communications from graduates of business colleges and does most of the writing for this paper has been confined for the past two weeks to the under side of a large red quilt with a joint caucus of la grippe and measles we have missed two issues of the rolling stone and are now slightly convalescent for which we desire to apologize and express our regrets everybody s term of subscription will be extended enough to cover all missed issues and we hope soon to report that the goose remains suspended at a favorable altitude people who have tried to run a funny paper and entertain a congregation of large piebald measles at the same time will understand something of the tact finesse and hot sassafras tea required to do so we expect to get out the paper regularly from this time on but are forced to be very careful as improper treatment and deleterious after effects of measles combined with the high price of paper and presswork have been known to cause a relapse any one not getting their paper regularly will please come down and see about it bringing with them a ham or any little delicacy relished by invalids lord oakhurst s curse this story was sent to dr beall of greensboro n c in a letter in and so is one of o henry s earliest attempts at writing i lord oakhurst lay dying in the oak chamber in the eastern wing of oakhurst castle through the open window in the calm of the summer evening came the sweet fragrance of the early violets and budding trees and to the dying man it seemed as if earth s loveliness and beauty were never so apparent as on this bright june day his last day of life his young wife whom he loved with a devotion and strength that the presence of the king of terrors himself could not alter moved about the apartment weeping and sorrowful sometimes arranging the sick man s pillow and inquiring of him in low mournful tones if anything could be done to give him comfort and again with stifled sobs eating some chocolate caramels which she carried in the pocket of her apron the servants went to and fro with that quiet and subdued tread which prevails in a house where death is an expected guest and even the crash of broken china and shivered glass which announced their approach seemed to fall upon the ear with less violence and sound than usual lord oakhurst was thinking of days gone by when he wooed and won his beautiful young wife who was then but a charming and innocent girl how clearly and minutely those scenes rose up at the call of his memory he seemed to be standing once more beneath the old chestnut grove where they had plighted their troth in the twilight under the stars while the rare fragrance of the june roses and the smell of supper came gently by on the breeze there he had told her his love how that his whole happiness and future joy lay in the hope that he might win her for a bride that if she would trust her future to his care the devotedness of his lifetime should be hers and his only thought would be to make her life one long day of sunshine and peanut candy how plainly he remembered how she had with girlish shyness and coyness at first hesitated and murmured something to herself about an old bald beaded galoot but when he told her that to him life without her would be a blasted mockery and that his income was a year she threw herself on to him and froze there with the tenacity of a tick on a brindled cow and said with tears of joy hen ery i am thine and now he was dying in a few short hours his spirit would rise up at the call of the destroyer and quitting his poor weak earthly frame would go forth into that dim and dreaded unknown land and solve with certainty that mystery which revealeth itself not to mortal man ii a carriage drove rapidly up the avenue and stopped at the door sir everhard fitzarmond the famous london physician who had been telegraphed for alighted and quickly ascended the marble steps lady oakhurst met him at the door her lovely face expressing great anxiety and grief oh sir everhard i am so glad you have come he seems to be sinking rapidly did you bring the cream almonds i mentioned in the telegram sir everhard did not reply but silently handed her a package and slipping a couple of cloves into his mouth ascended the stairs that led to lord oakhurst s apartment lady oakhurst followed sir everhard approached the bedside of his patient and laid his hand gently on this sick man s diagnosis a shade of feeling passed over his professional countenance as lie gravely and solemnly pronounced these words madam your husband has croaked lady oakhurst at first did not comprehend his technical language and her lovely mouth let up for a moment on the cream almonds but soon his meaning flashed upon her and she seized an axe that her husband was accustomed to keep by his bedside to mangle his servants with and struck open lord oakhurst s cabinet containing his private papers and with eager hands opened the document which she took therefrom then with a wild unearthly shriek that would have made a steam piano go out behind a barn and kick itself in despair she fell senseless to the floor sir everhard fitzarmond picked up the paper and read its contents it was lord oakhurst s will bequeathing all his property to a scientific institution which should have for its object the invention of a means for extracting peach brandy from sawdust sir everhard glanced quickly around the room no one was in sight dropping the will he rapidly transferred some valuable ornaments and rare specimens of gold and silver filigree work from the centre table to his pockets and rang the bell for the servants iii the curse sir everhard fitzarmond descended the stairway of oakhurst castle and passed out into the avenue that led from the doorway to the great iron gates of the park lord oakhurst had been a great sportsman during his life and always kept a well stocked kennel of curs which now rushed out from their hiding places and with loud yelps sprang upon the physician burying their fangs in his lower limbs and seriously damaging his apparel sir everllard startled out of his professional dignity and usual indifference to human suffering by the personal application of feeling gave vent to a most horrible and blighting curse and ran with great swiftness to his carriage and drove off toward the city bexar scrip no from the rolling stone saturday march whenever you visit austin you should by all means go to see the general land office as you pass up the avenue you turn sharp round the corner of the court house and on a steep hill before you you see a medieval castle you think of the rhine the castled crag of drachenfels the lorelei and the vine clad slopes of germany and german it is in every line of its architecture and design the plan was drawn by an old draftsman from the vaterland whose heart still loved the scenes of his native land and it is said he reproduced the design of a certain castle near his birthplace with remarkable fidelity under the present administration a new coat of paint has vulgarized its ancient and venerable walls modern tiles have replaced the limestone slabs of its floors worn in hollows by the tread of thousands of feet and smart and gaudy fixtures have usurped the place of the time worn furniture that has been consecrated by the touch of hands that texas will never cease to honor but even now when you enter the building you lower your voice and time turns backward for you for the atmosphere which you breathe is cold with the exudation of buried generations the building is stone with a coating of concrete the walls are immensely thick it is cool in the summer and warm in the winter it is isolated and sombre standing apart from the other state buildings sullen and decaying brooding on the past twenty years ago it was much the same as now twenty years from now the garish newness will be worn off and it will return to its appearance of gloomy decadence people living in other states can form no conception of the vastness and importance of the work performed and the significance of the millions of records and papers composing the archives of this office the title deeds patents transfers and legal documents connected with every foot of land owned in the state of texas are filed here volumes could be filled with accounts of the knavery the double dealing the cross purposes the perjury the lies the bribery the alteration and erasing the suppressing and destroying of papers the various schemes and plots that for the sake of the almighty dollar have left their stains upon the records of the general land office no reference is made to the employees no more faithful competent and efficient force of men exists in the clerical portions of any government but there is or was for their day is now over a class of land speculators commonly called land sharks unscrupulous and greedy who have left their trail in every department of this office in the shape of titles destroyed patents cancelled homes demolished and torn away forged transfers and lying affidavits before the modern tiles were laid upon the floors there were deep hollows in the limestone slabs worn by the countless feet that daily trod uneasily through its echoing corridors pressing from file room to business room from commissioner s sanctum to record books and back again the honest but ignorant settler bent on saving the little plot of land he called home elbowed the wary land shark who was searching the records for evidence to oust him the lordly cattle baron relying on his influence and money stood at the commissioner s desk side by side with the preemptor whose little potato patch lay like a minute speck of island in the vast billowy sea of his princely pastures and played the old game of freeze out which is as old as cain and abel the trail of the serpent is through it all honest earnest men have wrought for generations striving to disentangle the shameful coil that certain years of fraud and infamy have wound look at the files and see the countless endorsements of those in authority transfer doubtful locked up certificate a forgery locked up signature a forgery patent refused duplicate patented elsewhere field notes forged certificates stolen from office and soon ad infinitum the record books spread upon long tables in the big room upstairs are open to the examination of all open them and you will find the dark and greasy finger prints of half a century s handling the quick hand of the land grabber has fluttered the leaves a million times the damp clutch of the perturbed tiller of the soil has left traces of his calling on the ragged leaves interest centres in the file room this is a large room built as a vault fireproof and entered by but a single door there is no admission on the portal and the precious files are handed out by a clerk in charge only on presentation of an order signed by the commissioner or chief clerk in years past too much laxity prevailed in its management and the files were handled by all corners simply on their request and returned at their will or not at all in these days most of the mischief was done in the file room there are about files each in a paper wrapper and comprising the title papers of a particular tract of land you ask the clerk in charge for the papers relating to any survey in texas they are arranged simply in districts and numbers he disappears from the door you hear the sliding of a tin box the lid snaps and the file is in your hand go up there some day and call for bexar scrip no the file clerk stares at you for a second says shortly out of file it has been missing twenty years the history of that file has never been written before twenty years ago there was a shrewd land agent living in austin who devoted his undoubted talents and vast knowledge of land titles and the laws governing them to the locating of surveys made by illegal certificates or improperly made and otherwise of no value through non compliance with the statutes or whatever flaws his ingenious and unscrupulous mind could unearth he found a fatal defect in the title of the land as on file in bexar scrip no and placed a new certificate upon the survey in his own name the law was on his side every sentiment of justice of right and humanity was against him the certificate by virtue of which the original survey had been made was missing it was not be found in the file and no memorandum or date on the wrapper to show that it had ever been filed under the law the land was vacant unappropriated public domain and open to location the land was occupied by a widow and her only son and she supposed her title good the railroad had surveyed a new line through the property and it had doubled in value sharp the land agent did not communicate with her in any way until he had filed his papers rushed his claim through the departments and into the patent room for patenting then he wrote her a letter offering her the choice of buying from him or vacating at once he received no reply one day he was looking through some files and came across the missing certificate some one probably an employee of the office had by mistake after making some examination placed it in the wrong file and curiously enough another inadvertence in there being no record of its filing on the wrapper had completed the appearance of its having never been filed sharp called for the file in which it belonged and scrutinized it carefully fearing he might have overlooked some endorsement regarding its return to the office on the back of the certificate was plainly endorsed the date of filing according to law and signed by the chief clerk if this certificate should be seen by the examining clerk his own claim when it came up for patenting would not be worth the paper on which it was written sharp glanced furtively around a young man or rather a boy about eighteen years of age stood a few feet away regarding him closely with keen black eyes sharp a little confused thrust the certificate into the file where it properly belonged and began gathering up the other papers the boy came up and leaned on the desk beside him a right interesting office sir he said i have never been in here before all those papers now they are about lands are they not the titles and deeds and such things yes said sharp they are supposed to contain all the title papers this one now said the boy taking up bexar scrip no what land does this represent the title of ah i see six hundred and forty acres in b country absalom harris original grantee please tell me i am so ignorant of these things how can you tell a good survey from a bad one i am told that there are a great many illegal and fraudulent surveys in this office i suppose this one is all right no said sharp the certificate is missing it is invalid that paper i just saw you place in that file i suppose is something else field notes or a transfer probably yes said sharp hurriedly corrected field notes excuse me i am a little pressed for time the boy was watching him with bright alert eyes it would never do to leave the certificate in the file but he could not take it out with that inquisitive boy watching him he turned to the file room with a dozen or more files in his hands and accidentally dropped part of them on the floor as he stooped to pick them up he swiftly thrust bexar scrip no in the inside breast pocket of his coat this happened at just half past four o clock and when the file clerk took the files he threw them in a pile in his room came out and locked the door the clerks were moving out of the doors in long straggling lines it was closing time sharp did not desire to take the file from the land office the boy might have seen him place the file in his pocket and the penalty of the law for such an act was very severe some distance back from the file room was the draftsman s room now entirely vacated by its occupants sharp dropped behind the outgoing stream of men and slipped slyly into this room the clerks trooped noisily down the iron stairway singing whistling and talking below the night watchman awaited their exit ready to close and bar the two great doors to the south and cast it is his duty to take careful note each day that no one remains in the building after the hour of closing sharp waited until all sounds had ceased it was his intention to linger until everything was quiet and then to remove the certificate from the file and throw the latter carelessly on some draftsman s desk as if it had been left there during the business of the day he knew also that he must remove the certificate from the office or destroy it as the chance finding of it by a clerk would lead to its immediately being restored to its proper place and the consequent discovery that his location over the old survey was absolutely worthless as he moved cautiously along the stone floor the loud barking of the little black dog kept by the watchman told that his sharp ears had heard the sounds of his steps the great hollow rooms echoed loudly move as lightly as he could sharp sat down at a desk and laid the file before him in all his queer practices and cunning tricks he had not yet included any act that was downright criminal he had always kept on the safe side of the law but in the deed he was about to commit there was no compromise to be made with what little conscience he had left there is no well defined boundary line between honesty and dishonesty the frontiers of one blend with the outside limits of the other and he who attempts to tread this dangerous ground may be sometimes in one domain and sometimes in the other so the only safe road is the broad highway that leads straight through and has been well defined by line and compass sharp was a man of what is called high standing in the community that is his word in a trade was as good as any man s his check was as good as so much cash and so regarded he went to church regularly went in good society and owed no man anything he was regarded as a sure winner in any land trade he chose to make but that was his occupation the act he was about to commit now would place him forever in the ranks of those who chose evil for their portion if it was found out more than that it would rob a widow and her son of property soon to be of great value which if not legally theirs was theirs certainly by every claim of justice but he had gone too far to hesitate his own survey was in the patent room for patenting his own title was about to be perfected by the state s own hand the certificate must be destroyed he leaned his head on his hands for a moment and as he did so a sound behind him caused his heart to leap with guilty fear but before he could rise a hand came over his shoulder and grasped the file he rose quickly as white as paper rattling his chair loudly on the stone floor the boy who land spoken to him earlier stood contemplating him with contemptuous and flashing eyes and quietly placed the file in the left breast pocket of his coat so mr sharp by nature as well as by name he said it seems that i was right in waiting behind the door in order to see you safely out you will appreciate the pleasure i feel in having done so when i tell you my name is harris my mother owns the land on which you have filed and if there is any justice in texas she shall hold it i am not certain but i think i saw you place a paper in this file this afternoon and it is barely possible that it may be of value to me i was also impressed with the idea that you desired to remove it again but had not the opportunity anyway i shall keep it until to morrow and let the commissioner decide far back among mr sharp s ancestors there must have been some of the old berserker blood for his caution his presence of mind left him and left him possessed of a blind devilish unreasoning rage that showed itself in a moment in the white glitter of his eye give me that file boy he said thickly holding out his hand i am no such fool mr sharp said the youth this file shall be laid before the commissioner to morrow for examination if he finds help help sharp was upon him like a tiger and bore him to the floor the boy was strong and vigorous but the suddenness of the attack gave him no chance to resist he struggled up again to his feet but it was an animal with blazing eyes and cruel looking teeth that fought him instead of a man mr sharp a man of high standing and good report was battling for his reputation presently there was a dull sound and another and still one more and a blade flashing white and then red and edward harris dropped down like some stuffed effigy of a man that boys make for sport with his limbs all crumpled and lax on the stone floor of the land office the old watchman was deaf and heard nothing the little dog barked at the foot of the stairs until his master made him come into his room sharp stood there for several minutes holding in his hand his bloody clasp knife listening to the cooing of the pigeons on the roof and the loud ticking of the clock above the receiver s desk a map rustled on the wall and his blood turned to ice a rat ran across some strewn papers and his scalp prickled and he could scarcely moisten his dry lips with his tongue between the file room and the draftsman s room there is a door that opens on a small dark spiral stairway that winds from the lower floor to the ceiling at the top of the house this stairway was not used then nor is it now it is unnecessary inconvenient dusty and dark as night and was a blunder of the architect who designed the building this stairway ends above at the tent shaped space between the roof and the joists that space is dark and forbidding and being useless is rarely visited sharp opened this door and gazed for a moment up this narrow cobwebbed stairway after dark that night a man opened cautiously one of the lower windows of the land office crept out with great circumspection and disappeared in the shadows one afternoon a week after this time sharp lingered behind again after the clerks had left and the office closed the next morning the first comers noticed a broad mark in the dust on the upstairs floor and the same mark was observed below stairs near a window it appeared as if some heavy and rather bulky object had been dragged along through the limestone dust a memorandum book with e harris written on the flyleaf was picked up on the stairs but nothing particular was thought of any of these signs circulars and advertisements appeared for a long time in the papers asking for information concerning edward harris who left his mother s home on a certain date and had never been heard of since after a while these things were succeeded by affairs of more recent interest and faded from the public mind sharp died two years ago respected and regretted the last two years of his life were clouded with a settled melancholy for which his friends could assign no reason the bulk of his comfortable fortune was made from the land he obtained by fraud and crime the disappearance of the file was a mystery that created some commotion in the land office but he got his patent it is a well known tradition in austin and vicinity that there is a buried treasure of great value somewhere on the banks of shoal creek about a mile west of the city three young men living in austin recently became possessed of what they thought was a clue of the whereabouts of the treasure and thursday night they repaired to the place after dark and plied the pickaxe and shovel with great diligence for about three hours at the end of that time their efforts were rewarded by the finding of a box buried about four feet below the surface which they hastened to open the light of a lantern disclosed to their view the fleshless bones of a human skeleton with clothing still wrapping its uncanny limbs they immediately left the scene and notified the proper authorities of their ghastly find on closer examination in the left breast pocket of the skeleton s coat there was found a flat oblong packet of papers cut through and through in three places by a knife blade and so completely soaked and clotted with blood that it had become an almost indistinguishable mass with the aid of a microscope and the exercise of a little imagination this much can be made out of the letter at the top of the papers b x a rip n queries and answers from the rolling stone june can you inform me where i can buy an interest in a newspaper of some kind i have

follow have been found in files of the rolling stone in the houston post s postscripts and in manuscript there are many others but these few have been selected rather arbitrarily to round out this collection the pewee in the hush of the drowsy afternoon when the very wind on the breast of june lies settled and hot white tracery of the shattered sunlight filters free through the unstinted leaves to the pied cool sward on a dead tree branch sings the saddest bard of the birds that be tis the lone pewee its note is a sob and its note is pitched in a single key like a soul bewitched to a mournful minstrelsy pewee pewee doth it ever cry a sad sweet minor threnody that threads the aisles of the dim hot grove like a tale of a wrong or a vanished love and the fancy comes that the wee dun bird perchance was a maid and her heart was stirred by some lover s rhyme in a golden time and broke when the world turned false and cold and her dreams grew dark and her faith grew cold in some fairy far off clime and her soul crept into the pewee s breast and forever she cries with a strange unrest for something lost in the afternoon for something missed from the lavish june for the heart that died in the long ago for the livelong pain that pierceth so thus the pewee cries while the evening lies steeped in the languorous still sunshine rapt to the leaf and the bough rind the vine of some hopeless paradise you can tell your paper the great man said i refused an interview i have nothing to say on the question sir nothing to say to you and then he talked till the sun went down and the chickens went to roost and he seized the collar of the poor young man and never his hold he loosed and the sun went down and the moon came up and he talked till the dawn of day though he said on this subject mentioned by you i have nothing whatever to say and down the reporter dropped to sleep and flat on the floor he lay and the last he heard was the great man s words i have nothing at all to say the murderer i push my boat among the reeds i sit and stare about queer slimy things crawl through the weeds put to a sullen rout i paddle under cypress trees all fearfully i peer through oozy channels when the breeze comes rustling at my ear the long moss hangs perpetually gray scalps of buried years blue crabs steal out and stare at me and seem to gauge my fears i start to hear the eel swim by i shudder when the crane strikes at his prey i turn to fly at drops of sudden rain in every little cry of bird i hear a tracking shout from every sodden leaf that s stirred i see a face frown out my soul shakes when the water rat cowed by the blue snake flies black knots from tree holes glimmer at me with accusive eyes through all the murky silence rings a cry not born of earth an endless deep unechoing thing that owns not human birth i see no colors in the sky save red as blood is red i pray to god to still that cry from pallid lips and dead one spot in all that stagnant waste i shun as moles shun light and turn my prow to make all haste to fly

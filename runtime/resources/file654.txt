linguist one of the men fetched him a fat cringing man with a discursive eye and the odors of many kinds of meats upon him take a whirl at this importation with your jaw breakers sloviski requested mike dowling we can t quite figure out whether he s from the hackensack bottoms or hongkong on the ganges sloviski addressed the stranger in several dialects that ranged in rhythm and cadence from the sounds produced by a tonsilitis gargle to the opening of a can of tomatoes with a pair of scissors the immigrant replied in accents resembling the uncorking of a bottle of ginger ale i have you his name reported sloviski you shall not pronounce it writing of it in paper is better they gave him paper and he wrote demetre svangvsk looks like short hand said the desk man he speaks some language continued the interpreter wiping his forehead of austria and mixed with a little turkish and den he have some magyar words and a polish or two and many like the roumanian but not without talk of one tribe in bessarabia i do not him quite understand would you call him a dago or a polocker or what asked mike frowning at the polyglot description he is a answered sloviski he is a i dink he come from i dink he is a fool he concluded impatient at his linguistic failure and if you pleases i will go back at mine delicatessen whatever he is he s a bird said mike dowling and you want to watch him fly taking by the wing the alien fowl that had fluttered into the nest of liberty mike led him to the door of the engine house and bestowed upon him a kick hearty enough to convey the entire animus of company demetre svangvsk hustled away down the sidewalk turning once to show his ineradicable grin to the aggrieved firemen in three weeks john byrnes was back at his post from the hospital with great gusto he proceeded to bring his war map up to date my money on the japs every time he declared why look at them russians they re nothing but wolves wipe em out i say and the little old jiu jitsu gang are just the cherry blossoms to do the trick and don t you forget it the second day after byrnes s reappearance came demetre svangvsk the unidentified to the engine house with a broader grin than ever he managed to convey the idea that he wished to congratulate the hose cart driver on his recovery and to apologize for having caused the accident this he accomplished by so many extravagant gestures and explosive noises that the company was diverted for half an hour then they kicked him out again and on the next day he came back grinning how or where he lived no one knew and then john byrnes s nine year old son chris who brought him convalescent delicacies from home to eat took a fancy to svangvsk and they allowed him to loaf about the door of the engine house occasionally one afternoon the big drab automobile of the deputy fire commissioner buzzed up to the door of no and the deputy stepped inside for an informal inspection the men kicked svangvsk out a little harder than usual and proudly escorted the deputy around in which everything shone like my lady s mirror the deputy respected the sorrow of the company concerning the loss of erebus and he had come to promise it another mate for joe that would do him credit so they let joe out of his stall and showed the deputy how deserving he was of the finest mate that could be in horsedom while they were circling around joe confabbing chris climbed into the deputy s auto and threw the power full on the men heard a monster puffing and a shriek from the lad and sprang out too late the big auto shot away luckily taking a straight course down the street the boy knew nothing of its machinery he sat clutching the cushions and howling with the power on nothing could have stopped that auto except a brick house and there was nothing for chris to gain by such a stoppage demetre svangvsk was just coming in again with a grin for another kick when chris played his merry little prank while the others sprang for the door demetre sprang for joe he glided upon the horse s bare back like a snake and shouted something at him like the crack of a dozen whips one of the firemen afterward swore that joe answered him back in the same language ten seconds after the auto started the big horse was eating up the asphalt behind it like a strip of macaroni some people two blocks and a half away saw the rescue they said that the auto was nothing but a drab noise with a black speck in the middle of it for chris when a big bay horse with a lizard lying on its back cantered up alongside of it and the lizard reached over and picked the black speck out of the noise only fifteen minutes after svangvsk s last kicking at the hands or rather the feet of engine company no he rode joe back through the door with the boy safe but acutely conscious of the licking he was going to receive svangvsk slipped to the floor leaned his head against joe s and made a noise like a clucking hen joe nodded and whistled loudly through his nostrils putting to shame the knowledge of sloviski of the delicatessen john byrnes walked up to svangvsk who grinned expecting to be kicked byrnes gripped the outlander so strongly by the hand that demetre grinned anyhow conceiving it to be a new form of punishment the heathen rides like a cossack remarked a fireman who had seen a wild west show

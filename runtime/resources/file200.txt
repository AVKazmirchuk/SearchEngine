egg if you want to break an egg you have to do it from the outside the only way to break up a trust is from the inside keep sitting on it until it hatches look at the brood of young colleges and libraries that s chirping and peeping all over the country yes sir every trust bears in its own bosom the seeds of its destruction like a rooster that crows near a georgia colored methodist camp meeting or a republican announcing himself a candidate for governor of texas i asked jeff jestingly if he had ever during his checkered plaided mottled pied and dappled career conducted an enterprise of the class to which the word trust had been applied somewhat to my surprise he acknowledged the corner once said he and the state seal of new jersey never bit into a charter that opened up a solider and safer piece of legitimate octopusing we had everything in our favor wind water police nerve and a clean monopoly of an article indispensable to the public there wasn t a trust buster on the globe that could have found a weak spot in our scheme it made rockefeller s little kerosene speculation look like a bucket shop but we lost out some unforeseen opposition came up i suppose i said no sir it was just as i said we were self curbed it was a case of auto suppression there was a rift within the loot as albert tennyson says you remember i told you that me and andy tucker was partners for some years that man was the most talented conniver at stratagems i ever saw whenever he saw a dollar in another man s hands he took it as a personal grudge if he couldn t take it any other way andy was educated too besides having a lot of useful information he had acquired a big amount of experience out of books and could talk for hours on any subject connected with ideas and discourse he had been in every line of graft from lecturing on palestine with a lot of magic lantern pictures of the annual custom made clothiers association convention at atlantic city to flooding connecticut with bogus wood alcohol distilled from nutmegs one spring me and andy had been over in mexico on a flying trip during which a philadelphia capitalist had paid us for a half interest in a silver mine in chihuahua oh yes the mine was all right the other half interest must have been worth two or three thousand i often wondered who owned that mine in coming back to the united states me and andy stubbed our toes against a little town in texas on the bank of the rio grande the name of it was bird city but it wasn t the town had about inhabitants mostly men i figured out that their principal means of existence was in living close to tall chaparral some of em were stockmen and some gamblers and some horse peculators and plenty were in the smuggling line me and andy put up at a hotel that was built like something between a roof garden and a sectional bookcase it began to rain the day we got there as the saying is juniper aquarius was sure turning on the water plugs on mount amphibious now there were three saloons in bird city though neither andy nor me drank but we could see the townspeople making a triangular procession from one to another all day and half the night everybody seemed to know what to do with as much money as they had the third day of the rain it slacked up awhile in the afternoon so me and andy walked out to the edge of town to view the mudscape bird city was built between the rio grande and a deep wide arroyo that used to be the old bed of the river the bank between the stream and its old bed was cracking and giving away when we saw it on account of the high water caused by the rain andy looks at it a long time that man s intellects was never idle and then he unfolds to me a instantaneous idea that has occurred to him right there was organized a trust and we walked back into town and put it on the market first we went to the main saloon in bird city called the blue snake and bought it it cost us and then we dropped in casual at mexican joe s place referred to the rain and bought him out for the other one came easy at the next morning bird city woke up and found itself an island the river had busted through its old channel and the town was surrounded by roaring torrents the rain was still raining and there was heavy clouds in the northwest that presaged about six more mean annual rainfalls during the next two weeks but the worst was yet to come bird city hopped out of its nest waggled its pin feathers and strolled out for its matutinal toot lo mexican joe s place was closed and likewise the other little dobe life saving station so naturally the body politic emits thirsty ejaculations of surprise and ports hellum for the blue snake and what does it find there behind one end of the bar sits jefferson peters octopus with a sixshooter on each side of him ready to make change or corpses as the case may be there are three bartenders and on the wall is a ten foot sign reading all drinks one dollar andy sits on the safe in his neat blue suit and gold banded cigar on the lookout for emergencies the town marshal is there with two deputies to keep order having been promised free drinks by the trust well sir it took bird city just ten minutes to realize that it was in a cage

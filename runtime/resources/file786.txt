her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness and yet with all her north ern clearness and frankness of line and colouring there seemed to be something of the tropics in her something of languor in the droop of her pose of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing something that seemed to claim for her a right as a

ll never regret coming with me no one else will ever give you as pleasant a home the girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands a sudden jealous suspicion seized hartley tell me vivienne he asked regarding her keenly is there another is there some one else a rosy flush crept slowly over her fair cheeks and neck you shouldn t ask that mr hartley she said in some confusion but i will tell you there is one other but he has no right i have promised him nothing his name demanded hartley sternly townsend rafford townsend exclaimed hartley with a grim tightening of his jaw how did that man come

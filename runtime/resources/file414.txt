left dazed stupefied stunned the entire scene in the death chamber the witnesses the spectators the preparations for execution become unreal to him the thought flashes through his brain that a terrible mistake is being made why is he being strapped to the chair what has he done what crime has he committed in the few moments while the straps are being adjusted a vision comes to him he dreams a dream he sees a little country cottage bright sun lit nestling in a bower of flowers a woman is there and a little child he speaks with them and finds that they are his wife his child and the cottage their home so after all it is a mistake some one has frightfully irretrievably blundered the accusation the trial the conviction the sentence to death in the electric chair all a dream he takes his wife in his arms and kisses the child yes here is happiness it was a dream then at a sign from the prison warden the fatal current is turned on murray had dreamed the wrong dream a ruler of men written at the prime of his popularity and power this characteristic and amusing story was published in everybody s magazine in august i walked the streets of the city of insolence thirsting for the sight of a stranger face for the city is a desert of familiar types as thick and alike as the grains in a sand storm and you grow to hate them as you do a friend who is always by you or one of your own kin and my desire was granted for i saw near a corner of broadway and twenty ninth street a little flaxen haired man with a face like a scaly bark hickory nut selling to a fast gathering crowd a tool that omnigeneously proclaimed itself a can opener a screw driver a button hook a nail file a shoe horn a watch guard a potato peeler and an ornament to any gentleman s key ring and then a stall fed cop shoved himself through the congregation of customers the vender plainly used to having his seasons of trade thus abruptly curtailed closed his satchel and slipped like a weasel through the opposite segment of the circle the crowd scurried aimlessly away like ants from a disturbed crumb the cop suddenly becoming oblivious of the earth and its inhabitants stood still swelling his bulk and putting his club through an intricate drill of twirls i hurried after kansas bill bowers and caught him by an arm without his looking at me or slowing his pace i found a five dollar bill crumpled neatly into my hand i wouldn t have thought kansas bill i said that you d hold an old friend that cheap then he turned his head and the hickory nut cracked into a wide smile give back the money said he or i ll have the cop after you for false pretenses i thought you was the cop i want to talk to you bill i said when did you leave oklahoma where is reddy mcgill now why are you selling those impossible contraptions on the street how did your big horn gold mine pan out how did you get so badly sunburned what will you drink a year ago answered kansas bill systematically putting up windmills in arizona for pin money to buy etceteras with salted been down in the tropics beer we foregathered in a propitious place and became elijahs while a waiter of dark plumage played the raven to perfection reminiscence needs must be had before i could steer bill into his epic mood yes said he i mind the time timoteo s rope broke on that cow s horns while the calf was chasing you you and that cow i d never forget it the tropics said i are a broad territory what part of cancer of capricorn have you been honoring with a visit down along china or peru or maybe the argentine confederacy said kansas bill anyway twas among a great race of people off colored but progressive i was there three months no doubt you are glad to be back among the truly great race i surmised especially among new yorkers the most progressive and independent citizens of any country in the world i continued with the fatuity of the provincial who has eaten the broadway lotus do you want to start an argument asked bill can there be one i answered has an irishman humor do you think asked he i have an hour or two to spare said i looking at the cafe clock not that the americans aren t a great commercial nation conceded bill but the fault laid with the people who wrote lies for fiction what was this irishman s name i asked was that last beer cold enough said he i see there is talk of further outbreaks among the russian peasants i remarked his name was barney o connor said bill thus because of our ancient prescience of each other s trail of thought we travelled ambiguously to the point where kansas bill s story began i met o connor in a boarding house on the west side he invited me to his hall room to have a drink and we became like a dog and a cat that had been raised together there he sat a tall fine handsome man with his feet against one wall and his back against the other looking over a map on the bed and sticking three feet out of it was a beautiful gold sword with tassels on it and rhinestones in the handle what s this says i for by that time we were well acquainted the annual parade in vilification of the ex snakes of ireland and what s the line of march up broadway to forty second thence east to mccarty s cafe thence sit down on the wash

a delightful sensation many like her here asked merriam not anywhere said bibb with a comfortable sigh she s the only white woman in la paz the rest range from a dappled dun to the colour of a b flat piano key she s been here a year comes from well you know how a woman can talk ask em to say string and they ll say crow s foot or cat s cradle some times you d think she was from oshkosh and again from jacksonville florida and the next day from cape cod mystery ventured merriam m well she looks it but her talk s translucent enough but that s a woman i suppose if the sphinx were to begin talking she d merely say goodness me more visitors coming for dinner and nothing to eat but the sand which is here but you won t think about that when you meet her merriam you ll propose to her too to make a hard story soft merriam did meet her and propose to her he found her to be a woman in black with hair the colour of a bronze turkey s wings and mysterious remembering eyes that well that looked as if she might have been a trained nurse looking on when eve was created her words and manner though were translucent as bibb had said she spoke vaguely of friends in california and some of the lower parishes in louisiana the tropical climate and indolent life suited her she had thought of buying an orange grove later on la paz all in all charmed her merriam s courtship of the sphinx lasted three months although be did not know that he was courting her he was using her as an antidote for remorse until he found too late that he had acquired the habit during that time he had received no news from home wade did not know where he was and he was not sure of wade s exact address and was afraid to write he thought he had better let matters rest as they were for a while one afternoon he and mrs conant hired two ponies and rode out along the mountain trail as far as the little cold river that came tumbling down the foothills there they stopped for a drink and merriam spoke his piece he proposed as bibb had prophesied mrs conant gave him one glance of brilliant tenderness and then her face took on such a strange haggard look that merriam was shaken out of his intoxication and back to his senses i beg your pardon florence he said releasing her hand but i ll have to hedge on part of what i said i can t ask you to marry me of course i killed a man in new york a man who was my friend shot him down in quite a cowardly manner i understand of course the drinking didn t excuse it well i couldn t resist having my say and i ll always mean it i m here as a fugitive from justice and i suppose that ends our acquaintance mrs conant plucked little leaves assiduously from the low hanging branch of a lime tree i suppose so she said in low and oddly uneven tones but that depends upon you i ll be as honest as you were i poisoned my husband i am a self made widow a man cannot love a murderess so i suppose that ends our acquaintance she looked up at him slowly his face turned a little pale and he stared at her blankly like a deaf and dumb man who was wondering what it was all about she took a swift step toward him with stiffened arms and eyes blazing don t look at me like that she cried as though she were in acute pain curse me or turn your back on me but don t look that way am i a woman to be beaten if i could show you here on my arms and on my back are scars and it has been more than a year scars that he made in his brutal rages a holy nun would have risen and struck the fiend down yes i killed him the foul and horrible words that he hurled at me that last day are repeated in my ears every night when i sleep and then came his blows and the end of my endurance i got the poison that afternoon it was his custom to drink every night in the library before going to bed a hot punch made of rum and wine only from my fair hands would he receive it because he knew the fumes of spirits always sickened me that night when the maid brought it to me i sent her downstairs on an errand before taking him his drink i went to my little private cabinet and poured into it more than a tea spoonful of tincture of aconite enough to kill three men so i had learned i had drawn that i had in bank and with that and a few things in a satchel i left the house without any one seeing me as i passed the library i heard him stagger up and fall heavily on a couch i took a night train for new orleans and from there i sailed to the bermudas i finally cast anchor in la paz and now what have you to say can you open your mouth merriam came back to life florence he said earnestly i want you i don t care what you ve done if the world ralph she interrupted almost with a scream be my world her eyes melted she relaxed magnificentlv and swayed toward merriam so suddenly that he had to jump to catch her dear me in such scenes how the talk runs into artificial prose but it can t be helped it s the subconscious

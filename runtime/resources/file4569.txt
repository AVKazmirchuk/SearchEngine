the back fences slowly retreated toward mukden by these signs sarah knew that it was time for her to read she got out the cloister and the hearth the best non selling book of the month settled her feet on her trunk and began to wander with gerard the front door bell rang the landlady answered it sarah left gerard and denys treed by a bear and listened oh yes you would just as she did and then a strong voice was heard in the hall below and sarah jumped for her door leaving the book on the floor and the first round easily the bear s you have guessed it she reached the top of the stairs just as her farmer came up three at a jump and reaped and garnered her with nothing left for the gleaners why haven t you written oh why cried sarah new york is a pretty large town said walter franklin i came in a week ago to your old address i found that you went away on a thursday that consoled some it eliminated the possible friday bad luck but it didn t prevent my hunting for you with police and otherwise ever since i wrote said sarah vehemently never got it then how did you find me the young farmer smiled a springtime smile i dropped into that home restaurant next door this evening said he i don t care who knows it i like a dish of some kind of greens at this time of the year i ran my eye down that nice typewritten bill of fare looking for something in that line when i got below cabbage i turned my chair over and hollered for the proprietor he told me where you lived i remember sighed sarah happily that was dandelions below cabbage i d know that cranky capital w way above the line that your typewriter makes anywhere in the world said franklin why there s no w in dandelions said sarah in surprise the young man drew the bill of fare from his pocket and pointed to a line sarah recognised the first card she had typewritten that afternoon there was still the rayed splotch in the upper right hand corner where a tear had fallen but over the spot where one should have read the name of the meadow plant the clinging memory of their golden blossoms had allowed her fingers to strike strange keys between the red cabbage and the stuffed green peppers was the item dearest walter with hard boiled egg the green door suppose you should be walking down broadway after dinner with ten minutes allotted to the consummation of your cigar while you are choosing between a diverting tragedy and something serious in the way of vaudeville suddenly a hand is laid upon your arm you turn to look into the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman wonderful in diamonds and russian sables she thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll flashes out a tiny pair of scissors snips off the second button of your overcoat meaningly ejaculates the one word parallelogram and swiftly flies down a cross street looking back fearfully over her shoulder that would be pure adventure would you accept it not you you would flush with embarrassment you would sheepishly drop the roll and continue down broadway fumbling feebly for the missing button this you would do unless you are one of the blessed few in whom the pure spirit of adventure is not dead true adventurers have never been plentiful they who are set down in print as such have been mostly business men with newly invented methods they have been out after the things they wanted golden fleeces holy grails lady loves treasure crowns and fame the true adventurer goes forth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate a fine example was the prodigal son when he started back home half adventurers brave and splendid figures have been numerous from the crusades to the palisades they have enriched the arts of history and fiction and the trade of historical fiction but each of them had a prize to win a goal to kick an axe to grind a race to run a new thrust in tierce to deliver a name to carve a crow to pick so they were not followers of true adventure in the big city the twin spirits romance and adventure are always abroad seeking worthy wooers as we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and challenge us in twenty different guises without knowing why we look up suddenly to see in a window a face that seems to belong to our gallery of intimate portraits in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry of agony and fear coming from an empty and shuttered house instead of at our familiar curb a cab driver deposits us before a strange door which one with a smile opens for us and bids us enter a slip of paper written upon flutters down to our feet from the high lattices of chance we exchange glances of instantaneous hate affection and fear with hurrying strangers in the passing crowds a sudden douse of rain and our umbrella may be sheltering the daughter of the full moon and first cousin of the sidereal system at every corner handkerchiefs drop fingers beckon eyes besiege and the lost the lonely the rapturous the mysterious the perilous changing clues of adventure are slipped into our fingers but few of us are willing to hold and follow them we are grown stiff with the ramrod of convention down our backs we pass on and some day we come at the end of a very dull life to reflect that our romance has been a pallid thing of a marriage or two a satin rosette kept in a safe deposit drawer and a lifelong feud with a steam radiator rudolf steiner was a true adventurer few were the evenings on which he did not go forth from his hall bedchamber in search of the unexpected and the egregious the most interesting thing in life seemed to him to be what might lie just around the next corner sometimes his willingness to tempt fate led him into strange paths twice he had spent the night in a station house again and again he had found himself the dupe of ingenious and mercenary tricksters his watch and money had been the price of one flattering allurement but with undiminished ardour he picked up every glove cast before him into the merry lists of adventure one evening rudolf was strolling along a crosstown street in the older central part of the city two streams of people filled the sidewalks the home hurrying and that restless contingent that abandons home for the specious welcome of the thousand candle power table d hote the young adventurer was of pleasing presence and moved serenely and watchfully by daylight he was a salesman in a piano store he wore his tie drawn through a topaz ring instead of fastened with a stick pin and once he had written to the editor of a magazine that junie s love test by miss libbey had been the book that had most influenced his life during his walk a violent chattering of teeth in a glass case on the sidewalk seemed at first to draw his attention with a qualm to a restaurant before which it was set but a second glance revealed the electric letters of a dentist s sign high above the next door a giant negro fantastically dressed in a red embroidered coat yellow trousers and a military cap discreetly distributed cards to those of the passing crowd who consented to take them this mode of dentistic advertising was a common sight to rudolf usually he passed the dispenser of the dentist s cards without reducing his store but tonight the african slipped one into his hand so deftly that he retained it there smiling a little at the successful feat when he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card indifferently surprised he turned it over and looked again with interest one side of the card was blank on the other was written in ink three words the green door and then rudolf saw three steps in front of him a man throw down the card the negro had given him as he passed rudolf picked it up it was printed with the dentist s name and address and the usual schedule of plate work and bridge work and specious promises of painless operations the adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered then he crossed the street walked down a block recrossed and joined the upward current of people again without seeming to notice the negro as he passed the second time he carelessly took the card that was handed him ten steps away he inspected it in the same handwriting that appeared on the first card the green door was inscribed upon it three or four cards were tossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following and leading him these fell blank side up rudolf turned them over every one bore the printed legend of the dental parlours rarely did the arch sprite adventure need to beckon twice to rudolf steiner his true follower but twice it had been done and the quest was on rudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of rattling teeth this time as he passed he received no card in spite of his gaudy and ridiculous garb the ethiopian displayed a natural barbaric dignity as he stood offering the cards suavely to some allowing others to pass unmolested every half minute he chanted a harsh unintelligible phrase akin to the jabber of car conductors and grand opera and not only did he withhold a card this time but it seemed to rudolf that he received from the shining and massive black countenance a look of cold almost contemptuous disdain the look stung the adventurer he read in it a silent accusation that he had been found wanting whatever the mysterious written words on the cards might mean the black had selected him twice from the throng for their recipient and now seemed to have condemned him as deficient in the wit and spirit to engage the enigma standing aside from the rush the young man made a rapid estimate of the building in which he conceived that his adventure must lie five stories high it rose a small restaurant occupied the basement the first floor now closed seemed to house millinery or furs the second floor by the winking electric letters was the dentist s above this a polyglot babel of signs struggled to indicate the abodes of palmists dressmakers musicians and doctors still higher up draped curtains and milk bottles white on the window sills proclaimed the regions of domesticity after concluding his survey rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of stone steps into the house up two flights of the carpeted stairway he continued and at its top paused the hallway there was dimly lighted by two pale jets of gas one far to his right the other nearer to his left he looked toward the nearer light and saw within its wan halo a green door for one moment he hesitated then he seemed to see the contumelious sneer of the african juggler of cards and then he walked straight to the green door and knocked against it moments like those that passed before his knock was answered measure the quick breath of true adventure what might not be behind those green panels gamesters at play cunning rogues baiting their traps with subtle skill beauty in love with courage and thus planning to be sought by it danger death love disappointment ridicule any of these might respond to that temerarious rap a faint rustle was heard inside and the door slowly opened a girl not yet twenty stood there white faced and tottering she loosed the knob and swayed weakly groping with one hand rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch that stood against the wall he closed the door and took a swift glance around the room by the light of a flickering gas jet neat but extreme poverty was the story that he read the girl lay still as if in a faint rudolf looked around the room excitedly for a barrel people must be rolled upon a barrel who no no that was for drowned persons he began to fan her with his hat that was successful for he struck her nose with the brim of his derby and she opened her eyes and then the young man saw that hers indeed was the one missing face from his heart s gallery of intimate portraits the frank grey eyes the little nose turning pertly outward the chestnut hair curling like the tendrils of a pea vine seemed the right end and reward of all his wonderful adventures but the face was wofully thin and pale the girl looked at him calmly and then smiled fainted didn t i she asked weakly well who wouldn t you try going without anything to eat for three days and see himmel exclaimed rudolf jumping up wait till i come back he dashed out the green door and down the stairs in twenty minutes he was back again kicking at the door with his toe for her to open it with both arms he hugged an array of wares from the grocery and the restaurant on the table he laid them bread and butter cold meats cakes pies pickles oysters a roasted chicken a bottle of milk and one of redhot tea this is ridiculous said rudolf blusteringly to go without eating you must quit making election bets of this kind supper is ready he helped her to a chair at the table and asked is there a cup for the tea on the shelf by the window she answered when he turned again with the cup he saw her with eyes shining rapturously beginning upon a huge dill pickle that she had rooted out from the paper bags with a woman s unerring instinct he took it from her laughingly and poured the cup full of milk drink that first he ordered and then you shall have some tea and then a chicken wing if you are very good you shall have a pickle to morrow and now if you ll allow me to be your guest we ll have supper he drew up the other chair the tea brightened the girl s eyes and brought back some of her colour she began to eat with a sort of dainty ferocity like some starved wild animal she seemcd to regard the young man s presence and the aid he had rendered her as a natural thing not as though she undervalued the conventions but as one whose great stress gave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human but gradually with the return of strength and comfort came also a sense of the little conventions that belong and she began to tell him her little story it was one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every day the shop girl s story of insufficient wages further reduced by fines that go to swell the store s profits of time lost through illness and then of lost positions lost hope and the knock of the adventurer upon the green door but to rudolf the history sounded as big as the iliad or the crisis in junie s love test to think of you going through all that he exclaimed it was something fierce said the girl solemnly and you have no relatives or friends in the city none whatever i am all alone in the world too said rudolf after a pause i am glad of that said the girl promptly and somehow it pleased the young man to hear that she approved of his bereft condition very suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply i m awfully sleepy she said and i feel so good then rudolf rose and took his hat i ll say good night a long night s sleep will be fine for you he held out his hand and she took it and said good night but her eyes asked a question so eloquently so frankly and pathetically that he answered it with words oh i m coming back to morrow to see how you are getting along you can t get rid of me so easily then at the door as though the way of his coming had been so much less important than the fact that he had come she asked how did you come to knock at my door he looked at her for a moment remembering the cards and felt a sudden jealous pain what if they had fallen into other hands as adventurous as his quickly he decided that she must never know the truth he would never let her know that he was aware of the strange expedient to which she had been driven by her great distress one of our piano tuners lives in this house he said i knocked at your door by mistake the last thing he saw in the room before the green door closed was her smile at the head of the stairway he paused and looked curiously about him and then he went along the hallway to its other end and coming back ascended to the floor above and continued his puzzled explorations every door that he found in the house was painted green wondering he descended to the sidewalk the fantastic african was still there rudolf confronted him with his two cards in his hand will you tell me why you gave me these cards and what they mean he asked in a broad good natured grin the negro exhibited a splendid advertisement of his master s profession dar it is boss he said pointing down the street but i spect you is a little late for de fust act looking the way he pointed rudolf saw above the entrance to a theatre the blazing electric sign of its new play the green door i m informed dat it s a fust rate show sah said the negro de agent what represents it pussented me with a dollar sah to distribute a few of his cards along with de doctah s may i offer you one of de doctah s cards sah at the corner of the block in which he lived rudolf stopped for a glass of beer and a cigar when he had come out with his lighted weed he buttoned his coat pushed back his hat and said stoutly to the lamp post on the corner all the same i believe it was the hand of fate that doped out the way for me to find her which conclusion under the circumstances certainly admits rudolf steiner to the ranks of the true followers of romance and adventure from the cabby s seat the cabby has his point of view it is more single minded perhaps than that of a follower of any other calling from the high swaying seat of his hansom he looks upon his fellow men as nomadic particles of no account except when possessed of migratory desires he is jehu and you are goods in transit be you president or vagabond to cabby you are only a fare he takes you up cracks his whip joggles your vertebrae and sets you down when time for payment arrives if you exhibit a familiarity with legal rates you come to know what contempt is if you find that you have left your pocketbook behind you are made to realise the mildness of dante s imagination it is not an extravagant theory that the cabby s singleness of purpose and concentrated view of life are the results of the hansom s peculiar construction the cock of the roost sits aloft like jupiter on an unsharable seat holding your fate between two thongs of inconstant leather helpless ridiculous confined bobbing like a toy mandarin you sit like a rat in a trap you before whom butlers cringe on solid land and must squeak upward through a slit in your peripatetic sarcophagus to make your feeble wishes known then in a cab you are not even an occupant you are contents you are a cargo at sea and the cherub that sits up aloft has davy jones s street and number by heart one night there were sounds of revelry in the big brick tenement house next door but one to mcgary s family cafe the sounds seemed to emanate from the apartments of the walsh family the sidewalk was obstructed by an assortment of interested neighbours who opened a lane from time to time for a hurrying messenger bearing from mcgary s goods pertinent to festivity and diversion the sidewalk contingent was engaged in comment and discussion from which it made no effort to eliminate the news that norah walsh was being married in the fulness of time there was an eruption of the merry makers to the sidewalk the uninvited guests enveloped and permeated them and upon the night air rose joyous cries congratulations laughter and unclassified noises born of mcgary s oblations to the hymeneal scene close to the curb stood jerry o donovan s cab night hawk was jerry called but no more lustrous or cleaner hansom than his ever closed its doors upon point lace and november violets and jerry s horse i am within bounds when i tell you that he was stuffed with oats until one of those old ladies who leave their dishes unwashed at home and go about having expressmen arrested would have smiled yes smiled to have seen him among the shifting sonorous pulsing crowd glimpses could be had of jerry s high hat battered by the winds and rains of many years of his nose like a carrot battered by the frolicsome athletic progeny of millionaires and by contumacious fares of his brass buttoned green coat admired in the vicinity of mcgary s it was plain that jerry had usurped the functions of his cab and was carrying a load indeed the figure may be extended and he be likened to a bread waggon if we admit the testimony of a youthful spectator who was heard to remark jerry has got a bun from somewhere among the throng in the street or else out of the thin stream of pedestrians a young woman tripped and stood by the cab the professional hawk s eye of jerry caught the movement he made a lurch for the cab overturning three or four onlookers and himself no he caught the cap of a water plug and kept his feet like a sailor shinning up the ratlins during a squall jerry mounted to his professional seat once he was there mcgary s liquids were baffled he seesawed on the mizzenmast of his craft as safe as a steeple jack rigged to the flagpole of a skyscraper step in lady said jerry gathering his lines the young woman stepped into the cab the doors shut with a bang jerry s whip cracked in the air the crowd in the gutter scattered and the fine hansom dashed away crosstown when the oat spry horse had hedged a little his first spurt of speed jerry broke the lid of his cab and called down through the aperture in the voice of a cracked megaphone trying to please where now will ye be drivin to anywhere you please came up the answer musical and contented tis drivin for pleasure she is thought jerry and then he suggested as a matter of course take a thrip around in the park lady twill be ilegant cool and fine just as you like answered the fare pleasantly the cab headed for fifth avenue and sped up that perfect street jerry bounced and swayed in his seat the potent fluids of mcgary were disquieted and they sent new fumes to his head he sang an ancient song of killisnook and brandished his whip like a baton inside the cab the fare sat up straight on the cushions looking to right and left at the lights and houses even in the shadowed hansom her eyes shone like stars at twilight when they reached fifty ninth street jerry s head was bobbing and his reins were slack but his horse turned in through the park gate and began the old familiar nocturnal round and then the fare leaned back entranced and breathed deep the clean wholesome odours of grass and leaf and bloom and the wise beast in the shafts knowing his ground struck into his by the hour gait and kept to the right of the road habit also struggled successfully against jerry s increasing torpor he raised the hatch of his storm tossed vessel and made the inquiry that cabbies do make in the park like shtop at the cas sino lady gezzer r freshm s n lish n the music ev body shtops i think that would be nice said the fare they reined up with a plunge at the casino entrance the cab doors flew open the fare stepped directly upon the floor at once she was caught in a web of ravishing music and dazzled by a panorama of lights and colours some one slipped a little square card into her hand on which was printed a number she looked around and saw her cab twenty yards away already lining up in its place among the waiting mass of carriages cabs and motor cars and then a man who seemed to be all shirt front danced backward before her and next she was seated at a little table by a railing over which climbed a jessamine vine there seemed to be a wordless invitation to purchase she consulted a collection of small coins in a thin purse and received from them license to order a glass of beer there she sat inhaling and absorbing it all the new coloured new shaped life in a fairy palace in an enchanted wood at fifty tables sat princes and queens clad in all the silks and gems of the world and now and then one of them would look curiously at jerry s fare they saw a plain figure dressed in a pink silk of the kind that is tempered by the word foulard and a plain face that wore a look of love of life that the queens envied twice the long hands of the clocks went round royalties thinned from their al fresco thrones and buzzed or clattered away in their vehicles of state the music retired into cases of wood and bags of leather and baize waiters removed cloths pointedly near the plain figure sitting almost alone jerry s fare rose and held out her numbered card simply is there anything coming on the ticket she asked a waiter told her it was her cab check and that she should give it to the man at the entrance this man took it and called the number only three hansoms stood in line the driver of one of them went and routed out jerry asleep in his cab he swore deeply climbed to the captain s bridge and steered his craft to the pier his fare entered and the cab whirled into the cool fastnesses of the park along the shortest homeward cuts at the gate a glimmer of reason in the form of sudden suspicion seized upon jerry s beclouded mind one or two things occurred to him he stopped his horse raised the trap and dropped his phonographic voice like a lead plummet through the aperture i want to see four dollars before goin any further on th thrip have ye got th dough four dollars laughed the fare softly dear me no i ve only got a few pennies and a dime or two jerry shut down the trap and slashed his oat fed horse the clatter of hoofs strangled but could not drown the sound of his profanity he shouted choking and gurgling curses at the starry heavens he cut viciously with his whip at passing vehicles he scattered fierce and ever changing oaths and imprecations along the streets so that a late truck driver crawling homeward heard and was abashed but he knew his recourse and made for it at a gallop at the house with the green lights beside the steps he pulled up he flung wide the cab doors and tumbled heavily to the ground come on you he said roughly his fare came forth with the casino dreamy smile still on her plain face jerry took her by the arm and led her into the police station a gray moustached sergeant looked keenly across the desk he and the cabby were no strangers sargeant began jerry in his old raucous martyred thunderous tones of complaint i ve got a fare here that jerry paused he drew a knotted red hand across his brow the fog set up by mcgary was beginning to clear away a fare sargeant he continued with a grin that i want to inthroduce to ye it s me wife that i married at ould man walsh s this avening and a divil of a time we had tis thrue shake hands wid th sargeant norah and we ll be off to home before stepping into the cab norah sighed profoundly i ve had such a nice time jerry said she an unfinished story we no longer groan and heap ashes upon our heads when the flames of tophet are mentioned for even the preachers have begun to tell us that god is radium or ether or some scientific compound and that the worst we wicked ones may expect is a chemical reaction this is a pleasing hypothesis but there lingers yet some of the old goodly terror of orthodoxy there are but two subjects upon which one may discourse with a free imagination and without the possibility of being controverted you may talk of your dreams and you may tell what you heard a parrot say both morpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses and your listener dare not attack your recital the baseless fabric of a vision then shall furnish my theme chosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more limited field of pretty polly s small talk i had a dream that was so far removed from the higher criticism that it had to do with the ancient respectable and lamented bar of judgment theory gabriel had played his trump and those of us who could not follow suit were arraigned for examination i noticed at one side a gathering of professional bondsmen in solemn black and collars that buttoned behind but it seemed there was some trouble about their real estate titles and they did not appear to be getting any of us out a fly cop an angel policeman flew over to me and took me by the left wing near at hand was a group of very prosperous looking spirits arraigned for judgment do you belong with that bunch the policeman asked who are they was my answer why said he they are but this irrelevant stuff is taking up space that the story should occupy dulcie worked in a department store she sold hamburg edging or stuffed peppers or automobiles or other little trinkets such as they keep in department stores of what she earned dulcie received six dollars per week the remainder was credited to her and debited to somebody else s account in the ledger kept by g oh primal energy you say reverend doctor well then in the ledger of primal energy during her first year in the store dulcie was paid five dollars per week it would be instructive to know how she lived on that amount don t care very well probably you are interested in larger amounts six dollars is a larger amount i will tell you how she lived on six dollars per week one afternoon at six when dulcie was sticking her hat pin within an eighth of an inch of her medulla oblongata she said to her chum sadie the girl that waits on you with her left side say sade i made a date for dinner this evening with piggy you never did exclaimed sadie admiringly well ain t you the lucky one piggy s an awful swell and he always takes a girl to swell places he took blanche up to the hoffman house one evening where they have swell music and you see a lot of swells you ll have a swell time dulce dulcie hurried homeward her eyes were shining and her cheeks showed the delicate pink of life s real life s approaching dawn it was friday and she had fifty cents left of her last week s wages the streets were filled with the rush hour floods of people the electric lights of broadway were glowing calling moths from miles from leagues from hundreds of leagues out of darkness around to come in and attend the singeing school men in accurate clothes with faces like those carved on cherry stones by the old salts in sailors homes turned and stared at dulcie as she sped unheeding past them manhattan the night blooming cereus was beginning to unfold its dead white heavy odoured petals dulcie stopped in a store where goods were cheap and bought an imitation lace collar with her fifty cents that money was to have been spent otherwise fifteen cents for supper ten cents for breakfast ten cents for lunch another dime was to be added to her small store of savings and five cents was to be squandered for licorice drops the kind that made your cheek look like the toothache and last as long the licorice was an extravagance almost a carouse but what is life without pleasures dulcie lived in a furnished room there is this difference between a furnished room and a boardinghouse in a furnished room other people do not know it when you go hungry dulcie went up to her room the third floor back in a west side brownstone front she lit the gas scientists tell us that the diamond is the hardest substance known their mistake landladies know of a compound beside which the diamond is as putty they pack it in the tips of gas burners and one may stand on a chair and dig at it in vain until one s fingers are pink and bruised a hairpin will not remove it therefore let us call it immovable so dulcie lit the gas in its one fourth candlepower glow we will observe the room couch bed dresser table washstand chair of this much the landlady was guilty the rest was dulcie s on the dresser were her treasures a gilt china vase presented to her by sadie a calendar issued by a pickle works a book on the divination of dreams some rice powder in a glass dish and a cluster of artificial cherries tied with a pink ribbon against the wrinkly mirror stood pictures of general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini against one wall was a plaster of paris plaque of an o callahan in a roman helmet near it was a violent oleograph of a lemon coloured child assaulting an inflammatory butterfly this was dulcie s final judgment in art but it had never been upset her rest had never been disturbed by whispers of stolen copes no critic had elevated his eyebrows at her infantile entomologist piggy was to call for her at seven while she swiftly makes ready let us discreetly face the other way and gossip for the room dulcie paid two dollars per week on week days her breakfast cost ten cents she made coffee and cooked an egg over the gaslight while she was dressing on sunday mornings she feasted royally on veal chops and pineapple fritters at billy s restaurant at a cost of twenty five cents and tipped the waitress ten cents new york presents so many temptations for one to run into extravagance she had her lunches in the department store restaurant at a cost of sixty cents for the week dinners were the evening papers show me a new yorker going without his daily paper came to six cents and two sunday papers one for the personal column and the other to read were ten cents the total amounts to now one has to buy clothes and i give it up i hear of wonderful bargains in fabrics and of miracles performed with needle and thread but i am in doubt i hold my pen poised in vain when i would add to dulcie s life some of those joys that belong to woman by virtue of all the unwritten sacred natural inactive ordinances of the equity of heaven twice she had been to coney island and had ridden the hobby horses tis a weary thing to count your pleasures by summers instead of by hours piggy needs but a word when the girls named him an undeserving stigma was cast upon the noble family of swine the words of three letters lesson in the old blue spelling book begins with piggy s biography he was fat he had the soul of a rat the habits of a bat and the magnanimity of a cat he wore expensive clothes and was a connoisseur in starvation he could look at a shop girl and tell you to an hour how long it had been since she had eaten anything more nourishing than marshmallows and tea he hung about the shopping districts and prowled around in department stores with his invitations to dinner men who escort dogs upon the streets at the end of a string look down upon him he is a type i can dwell upon him no longer my pen is not the kind intended for him i am no carpenter at ten minutes to seven dulcie was ready she looked at herself in the wrinkly mirror the reflection was satisfactory the dark blue dress fitting without a wrinkle the hat with its jaunty black feather the but slightly soiled gloves all representing self denial even of food itself were vastly becoming dulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was beautiful and that life was about to lift a corner of its mysterious veil for her to observe its wonders no gentleman had ever asked her out before now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and exalted show the girls said that piggy was a spender there would be a grand dinner and music and splendidly dressed ladies to look at and things to eat that strangely twisted the girls jaws when they tried to tell about them no doubt she would be asked out again there was a blue pongee suit in a window that she knew by saving twenty cents a week instead of ten in let s see oh it would run into years but there was a second hand store in seventh avenue where somebody knocked at the door dulcie opened it the landlady stood there with a spurious smile sniffing for cooking by stolen gas a gentleman s downstairs to see you she said name is mr wiggins by such epithet was piggy known to unfortunate ones who had to take him seriously dulcie turned to the dresser to get her handkerchief and then she stopped still and bit her underlip hard while looking in her mirror she had seen fairyland and herself a princess just awakening from a long slumber she had forgotten one that was watching her with sad beautiful stern eyes the only one there was to approve or condemn what she did straight and slender and tall with a look of sorrowful reproach on his handsome melancholy face general kitchener fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the dresser dulcie turned like an automatic doll to the landlady tell him i can t go she said dully tell him i m sick or something tell him i m not going out after the door was closed and locked dulcie fell upon her bed crushing her black tip and cried for ten minutes general kitchener was her only friend he was dulcie s ideal of a gallant knight he looked as if he might have a secret sorrow and his wonderful moustache was a dream and she was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes she used to have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime and ask for her with his sword clanking against his high boots once when a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a lamp post she had opened the window and looked out but there was no use she knew that general kitchener was away over in japan leading his army against the savage turks and he would never step out of his gilt frame for her yet one look from him had vanquished piggy that night yes for that night when her cry was over dulcie got up and took off her best dress and put on her old blue kimono she wanted no dinner she sang two verses of sammy then she became intensely interested in a little red speck on the side of her nose and after that was attended to she drew up a chair to the rickety table and told her fortune with an old deck of cards the horrid impudent thing she said aloud and i never gave him a word or a look to make him think it at nine o clock dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of raspberry jam out of her trunk and had a feast she offered general kitchener some jam on a cracker but he only looked at her as the sphinx would have looked at a butterfly if there are butterflies in the desert don t eat it if you don t want to said dulcie and don t put on so many airs and scold so with your eyes i wonder if you d he so superior and snippy if you had to live on six dollars a week it was not a good sign for dulcie to be rude to general kitchener and then she turned benvenuto cellini face downward with a severe gesture but that was not inexcusable for she had always thought he was henry viii and she did not approve of him at half past nine dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the dresser turned out the light and skipped into bed it s an awful thing to go to bed with a good night look at general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini this story really doesn t get anywhere at all the rest of it comes later sometime when piggy asks dulcie again to dine with him and she is feeling lonelier than usual and general kitchener happens to be looking the other way and then as i said before i dreamed that i was standing near a crowd of prosperous looking angels and a policeman took me by the wing and asked if i belonged with them who are they i asked why said he they are the men who hired working girls and paid em five or six dollars a week to live on are you one of the bunch not on your immortality said i i m only the fellow that set fire to an orphan asylum and murdered a blind man for his pennies the caliph cupid and the clock prince michael of the electorate of valleluna sat on his favourite bench in the park the coolness of the september night quickened the life in him like a rare tonic wine the benches were not filled for park loungers with their stagnant blood are prompt to detect and fly home from the crispness of early autumn the moon was just clearing the roofs of the range of dwellings that bounded the quadrangle on the east children laughed and played about the fine sprayed fountain in the shadowed spots fauns and hamadryads wooed unconscious of the gaze of mortal eyes a hand organ philomel by the grace of our stage carpenter fancy fluted and droned in a side street around the enchanted boundaries of the little park street cars spat and mewed and the stilted trains roared like tigers and lions prowling for a place to enter and above the trees shone the great round shining face of an illuminated clock in the tower of an antique public building prince michael s shoes were wrecked far beyond the skill of the carefullest cobbler the ragman would have declined any negotiations concerning his clothes the two weeks stubble on his face was grey and brown and red and greenish yellow as if it had been made up from individual contributions from the chorus of a musical comedy no man existed who had money enough to wear so bad a hat as his prince michael sat on his favourite bench and smiled it was a diverting thought to him that he was wealthy enough to buy every one of those close ranged bulky window lit mansions that faced him if he chose he could have matched gold equipages jewels art treasures estates and acres with any croesus in this proud city of manhattan and scarcely have entered upon the bulk of his holdings he could have sat at table with reigning sovereigns the social world the world of art the fellowship of the elect adulation imitation the homage of the fairest honours from the highest praise from the wisest flattery esteem credit pleasure fame all the honey of life was waiting in the comb in the hive of the world for prince michael of the electorate of valleluna whenever he might choose to take it but his choice was to sit in rags and dinginess on a bench in a park for he had tasted of the fruit of the tree of life and finding it bitter in his mouth had stepped out of eden for a time to seek distraction close to the unarmoured beating heart of the world these thoughts strayed dreamily through the mind of prince michael as he smiled under the stubble of his polychromatic beard lounging thus clad as the poorest of mendicants in the parks he loved to study humanity he found in altruism more pleasure than his riches his station and all the grosser sweets of life had given him it was his chief solace and satisfaction to alleviate individual distress to confer favours upon worthy ones who had need of succour to dazzle unfortunates by unexpected and bewildering gifts of truly royal magnificence bestowed however with wisdom and judiciousness and as prince michael s eye rested upon the glowing face of the great clock in the tower his smile altruistic as it was became slightly tinged with contempt big thoughts were the prince s and it was always with a shake of his head that he considered the subjugation of the world to the arbitrary measures of time the comings and goings of people in hurry and dread controlled by the little metal moving hands of a clock always made him sad by and by came a young man in evening clothes and sat upon the third bench from the prince for half an hour he smoked cigars with nervous haste and then he fell to watching the face of the illuminated clock above the trees his perturbation was evident and the prince noted in sorrow that its cause was connected in some manner with the slowly moving hands of the timepiece his highness arose and went to the young man s bench i beg your pardon for addressing you he said but i perceive that you are disturbed in mind if it may serve to mitigate the liberty i have taken i will add that i am prince michael heir to the throne of the electorate of valleluna i appear incognito of course as you may gather from my appearance it is a fancy of mine to render aid to others whom i think worthy of it perhaps the matter that seems to distress you is one that would more readily yield to our mutual efforts the young man looked up brightly at the prince brightly but the perpendicular line of perplexity between his brows was not smoothed away he laughed and even then it did not but he accepted the momentary diversion glad to meet you prince he said good humouredly yes i d say you were incog all right thanks for your offer of assistance but i don t see where your butting in would help things any it s a kind of private affair you know but thanks all the same prince michael sat at the young man s side he was often rebuffed but never offensively his courteous manner and words forbade that clocks said the prince are shackles on the feet of mankind i have observed you looking persistently at that clock its face is that of a tyrant its numbers are false as those on a lottery ticket its hands are those of a bunco steerer who makes an appointment with you to your ruin let me entreat you to throw off its humiliating bonds and to cease to order your affairs by that insensate monitor of brass and steel i don t usually said the young man i carry a watch except when i ve got my radiant rags on i know human nature as i do the trees and grass said the prince with earnest dignity i am a master of philosophy a graduate in art and i hold the purse of a fortunatus there are few mortal misfortunes that i cannot alleviate or overcome i have read your countenance and found in it honesty and nobility as well as distress i beg of you to accept my advice or aid do not belie the intelligence i see in your face by judging from my appearance of my ability to defeat your troubles the young man glanced at the clock again and frowned darkly when his gaze strayed from the glowing horologue of time it rested intently upon a four story red brick house in the row of dwellings opposite to where he sat the shades were drawn and the lights in many rooms shone dimly through them ten minutes to nine exclaimed the young man with an impatient gesture of despair he turned his back upon the house and took a rapid step or two in a contrary direction remain commanded prince michael in so potent a voice that the disturbed one wheeled around with a somewhat chagrined laugh i ll give her the ten minutes and then i m off he muttered and then aloud to the prince i ll join you in confounding all clocks my friend and throw in women too sit down said the prince calmly i do not accept your addition women are the natural enemies of clocks and therefore the allies of those who would seek liberation from these monsters that measure our follies and limit our pleasures if you will so far confide in me i would ask you to relate to me your story the young man threw himself upon the bench with a reckless laugh your royal highness i will he said in tones of mock deference do you see yonder house the one with three upper windows lighted well at o clock i stood in that house with the young lady i am that is i was engaged to i had been doing wrong my dear prince i had been a naughty boy and she had heard of it i wanted to be forgiven of course we are always wanting women to forgive us aren t we prince i want time to think it over said she there is one thing certain i will either fully forgive you or i will never see your face again there will be no half way business at half past eight she said at exactly half past eight you may be watching the middle upper window of the top floor if i decide to forgive i will hang out of that window a white silk scarf you will know by that that all is as was before and you may come to me if you see no scarf you may consider that everything between us is ended forever that concluded the young man bitterly is why i have been watching that clock the time for the signal to appear has passed twenty three minutes ago do you wonder that i am a little disturbed my prince of rags and whiskers let me repeat to you said prince michael in his even well modulated tones that women are the natural enemies of clocks clocks are an evil women a blessing the signal may yet appear never on your principality exclaimed the young man hopelessly you don t know marian of course she s always on time to the minute that was the first thing about her that attracted me i ve got the mitten instead of the scarf i ought to have known at that my goose was cooked i ll go west on the to night with jack milburn the jig s up i ll try jack s ranch awhile and top off with the klondike and whiskey good night er er prince prince michael smiled his enigmatic gentle comprehending smile and caught the coat sleeve of the other the brilliant light in the prince s eyes was softening to a dreamier cloudy translucence wait he said solemnly till the clock strikes i have wealth and power and knowledge above most men but when the clock strikes i am afraid stay by me until then this woman shall be yours you have the word of the hereditary prince of valleluna on the day of your marriage i will give you and a palace on the hudson but there must be no clocks in that palace they measure our follies and limit our pleasures do you agree to that of course said the young man cheerfully they re a nuisance anyway always ticking and striking and getting you late for dinner he glanced again at the clock in the tower the hands stood at three minutes to nine i think said prince michael that i will sleep a little the day has been fatiguing he stretched himself upon a bench with the manner of one who had slept thus before you will find me in this park on any evening when the weather is suitable said the prince sleepily come to me when your marriage day is set and i will give you a cheque for the money thanks your highness said the young man seriously it doesn t look as if i would need that palace on the hudson but i appreciate your offer just the same prince michael sank into deep slumber his battered hat rolled from the bench to the ground the young man lifted it placed it over the frowsy face and moved one of the grotesquely relaxed limbs into a more comfortable position poor devil he said as he drew the tattered clothes closer about the prince s breast sonorous and startling came the stroke of from the clock tower the young man sighed again turned his face for one last look at the house of his relinquished hopes and cried aloud profane words of holy rapture from the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving snowy fluttering wonderful divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy by came a citizen rotund comfortable home hurrying unknowing of the delights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly lit parks will you oblige me with the time sir asked the young man and the citizen shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe dragged it out and announced twenty nine and a half minutes past eight sir and then from habit he glanced at the clock in the tower and made further oration by george that clock s half an hour fast first time in ten years i ve known it to be off this watch of mine never varies a but the citizen was talking to vacancy he turned and saw his hearer a fast receding black shadow flying in the direction of a house with three lighted upper windows and in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats they owned the park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that sprawled asleep on a bench they stopped and gazed upon it it s dopy mike said one he hits the pipe every night park bum for twenty years on his last legs i guess the other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp in the hand of the sleeper gee he remarked he s doped out a fifty dollar bill anyway wish i knew the brand of hop that he smokes and then rap rap rap went the club of realism against the shoe soles of prince michael of the electorate

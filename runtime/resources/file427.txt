hear that said william trotter let me tell you about it a year ago i landed on this coast with one solitary dollar i have the same sum in my pocket to day i was second cook on a tramp fruiter and they marooned me here early one morning without benefit of clergy just because i poulticed the face of the first mate with cheese omelette at dinner the fellow had kicked because i d put horseradish in it instead of cheese when they threw me out of the yawl into three feet of surf i waded ashore and sat down under a palm tree by and by a fine looking white man with a red face and white clothes genteel as possible but somewhat under the influence came and sat down beside me i had noticed there was a kind of a village back of the beach and enough scenery to outfit a dozen moving picture shows but i thought of course it was a cannibal suburb and i was wondering whether i was to be served with carrots or mushrooms and as i say this dressed up man sits beside me and we become friends in the space of a minute or two for an hour we talked and he told me all about it it seems that he was a man of parts conscientiousness and plausibility besides being educated and a wreck to his appetites he told me all about it colleges had turned him out and distilleries had taken him in did i tell you his name it was clifford wainwright i didn t exactly catch the cause of his being cast away on that particular stretch of south america but i reckon it was his own business i asked him if he d ever been second cook on a tramp fruiter and he said no so that concluded my line of surmises but he talked like the encyclopedia from a berlin to trilo zyria and he carried a watch a silver arrangement with works and up to date within twenty four hours anyhow i m pleased to have met you says wainwright i m a devotee to the great joss booze but my ruminating facilities are unrepaired says he or words to that effect and i hate says he to see fools trying to run the world i never touch a drop says i and there are many kinds of fools and the world runs on its own apex according to science with no meddling from me i was referring says he to the president of this republic his country is in a desperate condition its treasury is empty it s on the verge of war with nicamala and if it wasn t for the hot weather the people would be starting revolutions in every town here is a nation goes on wainwright on the brink of destruction a man of intelligence could rescue it from its impending doom in one day by issuing the necessary edicts and orders president gomez knows nothing of statesmanship or policy do you know adam smith lemme see says i there was a one eared man named smith in fort worth texas but i think his first name was i am referring to the political economist says wainwright s mother smith then says i the one i speak of never was arrested so wainwright boils some more with indignation at the insensibility of people who are not corpulent to fill public positions and then he tells me he is going out to the president s summer palace which is four miles from aguas frescas to instruct him in the art of running steam heated republics come along with me trotter says he and i ll show you what brains can do anything in it i asks the satisfaction says he of redeeming a country of two hundred thousand population from ruin back to prosperity and peace great says i i ll go with you i d prefer to eat a live broiled lobster just now but give me liberty as second choice if i can t be in at the death wainwright and me permeates through the town and he halts at a rum dispensary have you any money he asks i have says i fishing out my silver dollar i always go about with adequate sums of money then we ll drink says wainwright not me says i not any demon ruin or any of its ramifications for mine it s one of my non weaknesses it s my failing says he what s your particular soft point industry says i promptly i m hard working diligent industrious and energetic my dear mr trotter says he surely i ve known you long enough to tell you you are a liar every man must have his own particular weakness and his own particular strength in other things now you will buy me a drink of rum and we will call on president gomez iii well sir trotter went on we walks the four miles out through a virgin conservatory of palms and ferns and other roof garden products to the president s summer white house it was blue and reminded you of what you see on the stage in the third act which they describe as same as the first on the programs there was more than fifty people waiting outside the iron fence that surrounded the house and grounds there was generals and agitators and epergnes in gold laced uniforms and citizens in diamonds and panama hats all waiting to get an audience with the royal five card draw and in a kind of a summer house in front of the mansion we could see a burnt sienna man eating breakfast out of gold dishes and taking his time i judged that the crowd outside had come out for their morning orders and requests and was afraid to intrude but c wainwright wasn t the gate was open

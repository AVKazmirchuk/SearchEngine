unto each turn is the evil thereof no one cares how many romances the singing comedienne may have had if she can capably sustain the limelight and a high note or two the audiences reck not if the performing dogs get to the pound the moment they have jumped through their last hoop they do not desire bulletins about the possible injuries received by the comic cyclist who retires head first from the stage in a crash of property china ware neither do they consider that their seat coupons entitle them to be instructed whether or no there is a sentiment between the lady solo banjoist and the irish monologist therefore let us have no lifting of the curtain upon a tableau of the united lovers backgrounded by defeated villainy and derogated by the comic osculating maid and butler thrown in as a sop to the cerberi of the fifty cent seats but our program ends with a brief turn or two and then to the exits whoever sits the show out may find if he will the slender thread that binds together

young man of prepossessing appearance sits in a dejected attitude amid a litter of sketches with his head resting upon his hand an oil stove stands on a pine box in the center of the studio the artist rises tightens his waist belt to another hole and lights the stove he goes to a tin bread box half hidden by a screen takes out a solitary link of sausage turns the box upside down to show that there is no more and chucks the sausage into a frying pan which he sets upon the stove the flame of the stove goes out showing that there is no more oil the artist in evident despair seizes the sausage in a sudden access of rage and hurls it violently from him at the same time a door opens and a man who enters receives the sausage forcibly against his nose he seems to cry out and is observed to make a dance step or two vigorously the newcomer is a ruddy faced active keen looking man apparently of irish ancestry next he is observed to laugh immoderately he kicks over the stove he claps the artist who is vainly striving to grasp his hand vehemently upon the back then he goes through a pantomime which to the sufficiently intelligent spectator reveals that he has acquired large sums of money by trading pot metal hatchets and razors to the indians of the cordillera mountains for gold dust he draws a roll of money as large as a small loaf of bread from his pocket and waves it above his head while at the same time he makes pantomime of drinking from a glass the artist hurriedly secures his hat and the two leave the studio together the writing on the sands scene the beach at nice a woman

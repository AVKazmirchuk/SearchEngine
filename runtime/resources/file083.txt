of the walrus it shall come with most avail for in it there are indeed shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbage palms and presidents instead of kings add to these a little love and counterplotting and scatter everywhere throughout the maze a trail of tropical dollars dollars warmed no more by the torrid sun than by the hot palms of the scouts of fortune and after all here seems to be life itself with talk enough to weary the most garrulous of walruses i fox in the morning coralio reclined in the mid day heat like some vacuous beauty lounging in a guarded harem the town lay at the sea s edge on a strip of alluvial coast it was set like a little pearl in an emerald band behind it and seeming almost to topple imminent above it rose the sea following range of the cordilleras in front the sea was spread a smiling jailer but even more incorruptible than the frowning mountains the waves swished along the smooth beach the parrots screamed in the orange and ceiba trees the palms waved their limber fronds foolishly like an awkward chorus at the prima donna s cue to enter suddenly the town was full of excitement a native boy dashed down a grass grown street shrieking busca el senor goodwin ha venido un telegrafo por el the word passed quickly telegrams do not come to any one in coralio the cry for senor goodwin was taken up by a dozen officious voices the main street running parallel to the beach became populated with those who desired to expedite the delivery of the dispatch knots of women with complexions varying from palest olive to deepest brown gathered at street corners and plaintively carolled un telegrafo por senor goodwin the comandante don senor el coronel encarnacion rios who was loyal to the ins and suspected goodwin s devotion to the outs hissed aha and wrote in his secret memorandum book the accusive fact that senor goodwin had on that momentous date received a telegram in the midst of the hullabaloo a man stepped to the door of a small wooden building and looked out above the door was a sign that read keogh and clancy a nomenclature that seemed not to be indigenous to that tropical soil the man in the door was billy keogh scout of fortune and progress and latter day rover of the spanish main tintypes and photographs were the weapons with which keogh and clancy were at that time assailing the hopeless shores outside the shop were set two large frames filled with specimens fo their art and skill keogh leaned in the doorway his bold and humorous countenance wearing a look of interest at the unusual influx of life and sound in the street when the meaning of the disturbance became clear to him he placed a hand beside his mouth and shouted hey frank in such a robustious voice that the feeble clamor of the natives was drowned and silenced fifty yards away on the seaward side of the street stood the abode of the consul for the united states out from the door of this building tumbled goodwin at the call he had been smoking with willard geddie the consul on the back porch of the consulate which was conceded to be the coolest spot in coralio hurry up shouted keogh there s a riot in town on account of a telegram that s come for you you want to be careful about these things my boy it won t do to trifle with the feelings of the public this way you ll be getting a pink note some day with violet scent on it and then the country ll be steeped in the throes of a revolution goodwin had strolled up the street and met the boy with the message the ox eyed women gazed at him with shy admiration for his type drew them he was big blond and jauntily dressed in white linen with buckskin zapatos his manner was courtly with a merciful eye when the telegram had been delivered and the bearer of it dismissed with a gratuity the relieved populace returned to the contiguities of shade from which curiosity had drawn it the women to their baking in the mud ovens under the orange trees or to the interminable combing of their long straight hair the men to their cigarettes and gossip in the cantinas goodwin sat on keogh s doorstep and read his telegram it was from bob englehart an american who lived in san mateo the capital city of anchuria eighty miles in the interior englehart was a gold miner an ardent revolutionist and good people that he was a man of resource and imagination was proven by the telegram he had sent it had

through the fingers of curious officials and came to the eye of goodwin his nibs skedaddled yesterday per jack rabbit line with all the coin in the kitty and the bundle of muslin he s spoony about the

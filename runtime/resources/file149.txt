the capital of me and tobin being exhausted by prediction but tobin is sore and drinks quiet with the red showing in his eye by and by we moved out for twas eleven o clock and stands a bit upon the sidewalk and then the man says he must be going home and invites me and tobin to walk that way we arrives on a side street two blocks away where there is a stretch of brick houses with high stoops and iron fences the man stops at one of them and looks up at the top windows which he finds dark tis me humble dwelling says he and i begin to perceive by the signs that me wife has retired to slumber therefore i will venture a bit in the way of hospitality tis me wish that ye enter the basement room where we dine and partake of a reasonable refreshment there will be some fine cold fowl and cheese and a bottle or two of ale ye will be welcome to enter and eat for i am indebted to ye for diversions the appetite and conscience of me and tobin was congenial to the proposition though twas sticking hard in danny s superstitions to think that a few drinks and a cold lunch should represent the good fortune promised by the palm of his hand step down the steps says the man with the crooked nose and i will enter by the door above and let ye in i will ask the new girl we have in the kitchen says he to make ye a pot of coffee to drink before ye go tis fine coffee katie mahorner makes for a green girl just landed three months step in says the man and i ll send her down to ye the gift of the magi one dollar and eighty seven cents that was all and sixty cents of it was in pennies pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied three times della counted it one dollar and eighty seven cents and the next day would be christmas there was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl so della did it which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs sniffles and smiles with sniffles predominating while the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second take a look at the home a furnished flat at per week it did not exactly beggar description but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad in the vestibule below was a letter box into which no letter would go and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name mr james dillingham young the dillingham had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid per week now when the income was shrunk to the letters of dillingham looked blurred as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming d but whenever mr james dillingham young came home and reached his flat above he was called jim and greatly hugged by mrs james dillingham young already introduced to you as della which is all very good della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag she stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard tomorrow would be christmas day and she had only with which to buy jim a present she had been saving every penny she could for months with this result twenty dollars a week doesn t go far expenses had been greater than she had calculated they always are only to buy a present for jim her jim many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him something fine and rare and sterling something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by jim there was a pier glass between the windows of the room perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an flat a very thin and very agile person may by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks della being slender

his grandfather s the other was della s hair had the queen of sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate her majesty s jewels and gifts had king solomon been the janitor with all his treasures piled up in the basement jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed just to see him pluck at his beard from envy so now della s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters it reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her and then she did it up

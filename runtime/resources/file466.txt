would go forth into that dim and dreaded unknown land and solve with certainty that mystery which revealeth itself not to mortal man ii a carriage drove rapidly up the avenue and stopped at the door sir everhard fitzarmond the famous london physician who had been telegraphed for alighted and quickly ascended the marble steps lady oakhurst met him at the door her lovely face expressing great anxiety and grief oh sir everhard i am so glad you have come he seems to be sinking rapidly did you bring the cream almonds i mentioned in the telegram sir everhard did not reply but silently handed her a package and slipping a couple of cloves into his mouth ascended the stairs that led to lord oakhurst s apartment lady oakhurst followed sir everhard approached the bedside of his patient and laid his hand gently on this sick man s diagnosis a shade of feeling passed over his professional countenance as lie gravely and solemnly pronounced these words madam your husband has croaked lady oakhurst at first did not comprehend his technical language and her lovely mouth let up for a moment on the cream almonds but soon his meaning flashed upon her and she seized an axe that her husband was accustomed to keep by his bedside to mangle his servants with and struck open lord oakhurst s cabinet containing his private papers and with eager hands opened the document which she took therefrom then with a wild unearthly shriek that would have made a steam piano go out behind a barn and kick itself in despair she fell senseless to the floor sir everhard fitzarmond picked up the paper and read its contents it was lord oakhurst s will bequeathing all his property to a scientific institution which should have for its object the invention of a means for extracting peach brandy

architecture and design the plan was drawn by an old draftsman from the vaterland whose heart still loved the scenes of his native land and it is said he reproduced the design of a certain castle near his birthplace with remarkable fidelity under the present administration a new coat of paint has vulgarized its ancient and venerable walls modern tiles have replaced the limestone slabs of its floors

how small i buy my shoes they always pinch my toes oh why can t there be lady hermits too the beautifulest and most adolescent trenholme sister extended two slender blue ankles that ended in two

mamma will force me into settlement work or trimming hats it isn t because i m getting old or ugly but we haven t enough money left to butt in at any of the swell places any more and i don t want to

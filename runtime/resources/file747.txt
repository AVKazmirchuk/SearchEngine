he said a trifle piqued i rather imagine it concerns you more than it does me cut the tub by all means if you think best but it has been the usual thing you know this was my victory but after van sweller emerged from his apartments in the beaujolie i was vanquished in a dozen small but well contested skirmishes i allowed him a cigar but routed him on the question of naming its brand but he worsted me when i objected to giving him a coat unmistakably english in its cut i allowed him to stroll down broadway and even permitted passers by god knows there s nowhere to pass but by to turn their heads and gaze with evident admiration at his erect figure i demeaned myself and as a barber gave him a smooth dark face with its keen frank eye and firm jaw later on he looked in at the club and saw freddy vavasour polo team captain dawdling over grilled bone no dear old boy began van sweller but in an instant i had seized him by the collar and dragged him aside with the scantiest courtesy for heaven s sake talk like a man i said sternly do you think it is manly to use those mushy and inane forms of address that man is neither dear nor old nor a boy to my surprise van sweller turned upon me a look of frank pleasure i am glad to hear you say that he said heartily i used those words because i have been forced to say them so often they really are contemptible thanks for correcting me dear old boy still i must admit that van sweller s conduct in the park that morning was almost without flaw the courage the dash the modesty the skill and fidelity that he displayed atoned for everything this is the way the story runs van sweller has been a gentleman member of the rugged riders the company that made a war with a foreign country famous among his comrades was lawrence o roon a man whom van sweller liked a strange thing and a hazardous one in fiction was that van sweller and o roon resembled each other mightily in face form and general appearance after the war van sweller pulled wires and o roon was made a mounted policeman now one night in new york there are commemorations and libations by old comrades and in the morning mounted policeman o roon unused to potent liquids another premise hazardous in fiction finds the earth bucking and bounding like a bronco with no stirrup into which he may insert foot and save his honor and his badge noblesse oblige surely so out along the driveways and bridle paths trots hudson van sweller in the uniform of his incapacitated comrade as like unto him as one french pea is unto a petit pois it is of course jolly larks for van sweller who has wealth and social position enough for him to masquerade safely even as a police commissioner doing his duty if he wished to do so but society not given to scanning the countenances of mounted policemen sees nothing unusual in the officer on the beat and then comes the runaway that is a fine scene the swaying victoria the impetuous daft horses plunging through the line of scattering vehicles the driver stupidly holding his broken reins and the ivory white face of amy ffolliott as she clings desperately with each slender hand fear has come and gone it has left her expression pensive and just a little pleading for life is not so bitter and then the clatter and swoop of mounted policeman van sweller oh it was but the story has not yet been printed when it is you shall learn bow he sent his bay like a bullet after the imperilled victoria a crichton a croesus and a centaur in one he hurls the invincible combination into the chase when the story is printed you will admire the breathless scene where van sweller checks the headlong team and then he looks into amy ffolliott s eyes and sees two things the possibilities of a happiness he has long sought and a nascent promise of it he is unknown to her but he stands in her sight illuminated by the hero s potent glory she his and he hers by all the golden fond unreasonable laws of love and light literature ay that is a rich moment and it will stir you to find van sweller in that fruitful nick of time thinking of his comrade o roon who is cursing his gyrating bed and incapable legs in an unsteady room in a west side hotel while van sweller holds his badge and his honor van sweller hears miss ffolliott s voice thrillingly asking the name of her preserver if hudson van sweller in policeman s uniform has saved the life of palpitating beauty in the park where is mounted policeman o roon in whose territory the deed is done how quickly by a word can the hero reveal himself thus discarding his masquerade of ineligibility and doubling the romance but there is his friend van sweller touches his cap it s nothing miss he says sturdily that s what we are paid for to do our duty and away he rides but the story does not end there as i have said van sweller carried off the park scene to my decided satisfaction even to me he was a hero when he foreswore for the sake of his friend the romantic promise of his adventure it was later in the day amongst the more exacting conventions that encompass the society hero when we had our liveliest disagreement at noon he went to o roon s room and found him far enough recovered to return to his post which he at once did at about six o clock in the afternoon van sweller fingered his watch and flashed at me a brief look full of such shrewd cunning that i suspected him at once time to dress for dinner old man he said with exaggerated carelessness very well i answered without giving him a clew to my suspicions i will go with you to your rooms and see that you do the thing properly i suppose that every author must be a valet to his own hero he affected cheerful acceptance of my somewhat officious proposal to accompany him i could see that he was annoyed by it and that fact fastened deeper in my mind the conviction that he was meditating some act of treachery when he had reached his apartments he said to me with a too patronizing air there are as you perhaps know quite a number of little distinguishing touches to be had out of the dressing process some writers rely almost wholly upon them i suppose that i am to ring for my man and that he is to enter noiselessly with an expressionless countenance he may enter i said with decision and only enter valets do not usually enter a room shouting college songs or with st vitus s dance in their faces so the contrary may be assumed without fatuous or gratuitous asseveration i must ask you to pardon me continued van sweller gracefully for annoying you with questions but some of your methods are a little new to me shall i don a full dress suit with an immaculate white tie or is there another tradition to be upset you will wear i replied evening dress such as a gentleman wears if it is full your tailor should be responsible for its bagginess and i will leave it to whatever erudition you are supposed to possess whether a white tie is rendered any whiter by being immaculate and i will leave it to the consciences of you and your man whether a tie that is not white and therefore not immaculate could possibly form any part of a gentleman s evening dress if not then the perfect tie is included and understood in the term dress and its expressed addition predicates either a redundancy of speech or the spectacle of a man wearing two ties at once with this mild but deserved rebuke i left van sweller in his dressing room and waited for him in his library about an hour later his valet came out and i heard him telephone for an electric cab then out came van sweller smiling but with that sly secretive design in his eye that was puzzling me i believe he said easily as he smoothed a glove that i will drop in at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers for dinner i sprang up angrily at his words this then was the paltry trick he had been scheming to play upon me i faced him with a look so grim that even his patrician poise was flustered you will never do so i exclaimed with my permission what kind of a return is this i continued hotly for the favors i have granted you i gave you a van to your name when i might have called you perkins or simpson i have humbled myself so far as to brag of your polo ponies your automobiles and the iron muscles that you acquired when you were stroke oar of your varsity eight or eleven whichever it is i created you for the hero of this story and i will not submit to having you queer it i have tried to make you a typical young new york gentleman of the highest social station and breeding you have no reason to complain of my treatment to you amy ffolliott the girl you are to win is a prize for any man to be thankful for and cannot be equalled for beauty provided the story is illustrated by the right artist i do not understand why you should try to spoil everything i had thought you were a gentleman what it is you are objecting to old man asked van sweller in a surprised tone to your dining at i answered see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the pleasure would be yours no doubt but the responsibility would fall upon me you intend deliberately to make me out a tout for a restaurant where you dine tonight has not the slightest connection with the thread of our story you know very well that the plot requires that you be in front of the alhambra opera house at where you are to rescue miss ffolliott a second time as the fire engine crashes into her cab until that time your movements are immaterial to the reader why can t you dine out of sight somewhere as many a hero does instead of insisting upon an inapposite and vulgar exhibition of yourself my dear fellow said van sweller politely but with a stubborn tightening of his lips i m sorry it doesn t please you but there s no help for it even a character in a story has rights that an author cannot ignore the hero of a story of new york social life must dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers at least once during its action must i echoed disdainfully why must who demands it the magazine editors answered van sweller giving me a glance of significant warning but why i persisted to please subscribers around kankakee ill said van sweller without hesitation how do you know these things i inquired with sudden suspicion you never came into existence until this morning you are only a character in fiction anyway i myself created you how is it possible for you to know anything pardon me for referring to it said van sweller with a sympathetic smile but i have been the hero of hundreds of stories of this kind i felt a slow flush creeping into my face i thought i stammered i was hoping that is oh well of course an absolutely original conception in fiction is impossible in these days metropolitan types continued van sweller kindly do not offer a hold for much originality i ve sauntered through every story in pretty much the same way now and then the women writers have made me cut some rather strange capers for a gentleman but the men generally pass me along from one to another without much change but never yet in any story have i failed to dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers you will fail this time i said emphatically perhaps so admitted van sweller looking out of the window into the street below but if so it will be for the first time the authors all send me there i fancy that many of them would have liked to accompany me but for the little matter of the expense i say i will be touting for no restaurant i repeated loudly you are subject to my will and i declare that you shall not appear of record this evening until the time arrives for you to rescue miss ffolliott again if the reading public cannot conceive that you have dined during that interval at some one of the thousands of establishments provided for that purpose that do not receive literary advertisement it may suppose for aught i care that you have gone fasting thank you said van sweller rather coolly you are hardly courteous but take care it is at your own risk that you attempt to disregard a fundamental principle in metropolitan fiction one that is dear alike to author and reader i shall of course attend to my duty when it comes time to rescue your heroine but i warn you that it will be your loss if you fail to send me to night to dine at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i will take the consequences if there are to be any i replied i am not yet come to be sandwich man for an eating house i walked over to a table where i had left my cane and gloves i heard the whirr of the alarm in the cab below and i turned quickly van sweller was gone i rushed down the stairs and out to the curb an empty hansom was just passing i hailed the driver excitedly see that auto cab halfway down the block i shouted follow it don t lose sight of it for an instant and i will give you two dollars if i only had been one of the characters in my story instead of myself i could easily have offered or or even but was all i felt justified in expending with fiction at its present rates the cab driver instead of lashing his animal into a foam proceeded at a deliberate trot that suggested a by the hour arrangement but i suspected van sweller s design and when we lost sight of his cab i ordered my driver to proceed at once to see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i found van sweller at a table under a palm just glancing over the menu with a hopeful waiter hovering at his elbow come with me i said inexorably you will not give me the slip again under my eye you shall remain until van sweller countermanded the order for his dinner and arose to accompany me he could scarcely do less a fictitious character is but poorly equipped for resisting a hungry but live author who comes to drag him forth from a restaurant all he said was you were just in time but i think you are making a mistake you cannot afford to ignore the wishes of the great reading public i took van sweller to my own rooms to my room he had never seen anything like it before sit on that trunk i said to him while i observe whether the landlady is stalking us if she is not i will get things at a delicatessen store below and cook something for you in a pan over the gas jet it will not be so bad of course nothing of this will appear in the story jove old man said van sweller looking about him with interest this is a jolly little closet you live in where the devil do you sleep oh that pulls down and i say what is this under the corner of the carpet oh a frying pan i see clever idea fancy cooking over the gas what larks it will be think of anything you could eat i asked try a chop or what anything said van sweller enthusiastically except a grilled bone two weeks afterward the postman brought me a large fat envelope i opened it and took out something that i had seen before and this typewritten letter from a magazine that encourages society fiction your short story the badge of policeman o roon is herewith returned we are sorry that it has been unfavorably passed upon but it seems to lack in some of the essential requirements of our publication the story is splendidly constructed its style is strong and inimitable and its action and character drawing deserve the highest praise as a story per se it has merit beyond anything that we have read for some time but as we have said it fails to come up to some of the standards we have set could you not re write the story and inject into it the social atmosphere and return it to us for further consideration it is suggested to you that you have the hero van sweller drop in for luncheon or dinner once or twice at or at the see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers which will be in line with the changes desired very truly yours the editors sound and fury o henry wrote this for ainslee s

him the fairest sight that earth had ever offered to his gaze miss lore oh mr penne dictates kate had abandoned herself to the joy of her new found love so completely that no shadow of her former grief was cast upon it cortland with his arm firmly entwined about her waist knew nothing of her sighs miss lore goodness if he couldn t tell her size with his arm around mr penne frowning of her sighs and tears of the previous night miss lore oh mr penne dictates to cortland the chief charm of this girl was her look of innocence and unworldiness never had nun miss lore how about changing that

discovered after a fond farewell she turned and sped lightly away cortland s gaze followed her he watched her rise miss lore excuse me mr penne but how could he watch her eyes while her back was turned toward him mr penne with extreme politeness possibly you would gather my meaning more intelligently if you would wait for the conclusion of the sentence dictates watched her rise as gracefully as a fawn as she mounted the eastern terrace miss lore oh mr penne dictates and yet cortland s position was so far above that of this rustic maiden that he dreaded to consider the social upheaval that would ensue should he marry her in no uncertain tones the traditional voices of his caste and world cried out loudly to him to let her go what should follow miss lore looking up with a start i m sure i can t say mr penne unless with a giggle you would want to add gallegher mr penne coldly pardon me i was not seeking to impose upon you the task of a collaborator kindly consider the question a part

the rarest vintage afterward he set out for a stroll with as kate on miss lore excuse me mr penne for venturing a suggestion but don t you think you might state that in a less coarse manner mr penne astounded wh wh i m afraid i fail to understand you miss lore his condition why not say he was full or intoxicated it would sound much more elegant than the way you express it mr penne still darkly wandering will you kindly point out miss lore where i have intimated that cortland was full if you prefer that word miss lore calmly consulting her stenographic notes it is right here word for word reads afterward he set out for a stroll with a skate on mr penne with peculiar emphasis ah and now will you kindly take down the expurgated phrase dictates afterward he set out for a stroll with as

cups miss lore oh mr penne dictates the earliest trolley scattering the birds from its pathway like some marauding cat brought cortland over from oldport he had forgotten his fair miss lore hm wonder

nice one mr penne faintly the last sentence was my own we will discontinue for the day miss lore miss lore shall i come again to morrow mr penne helpless under the spell if you will be so good exit miss lore asbestos curtain tictocq these two farcical stories about tictocq appeared in the rolling stone they are reprinted here with all of their local references because written hurriedly and for neighborly reading they nevertheless have an interest for the admirer of o henry they were written in the great french detective in austin a successful political intrigue chapter i it is not generally known that tictocq the famous french detective was in austin last week he registered at the avenue hotel under an assumed name and his quiet and reserved manners singled him out at once for one not to be singled out no one knows why he came to austin but to one or two he vouchsafed the information that his mission was an important one from the french government one report is that the french minister of state has discovered an old statute among the laws of the empire resulting from a treaty between the emperor charlemagne and governor roberts which expressly provides for the north gate of the capital grounds being kept open but this is merely a conjecture last wednesday afternoon a well dressed gentleman knocked at the door of tictocq s room in the hotel the detective opened the door monsieur tictocq i believe said the gentleman you will see on the register that i sign my name q x jones said tictocq and gentlemen would understand that i wish to be known as such if you do not like

question every person connected with the hotel the proprietor has already been spoken to everything and everybody is at your service tictocq consulted his watch come to this room to morrow afternoon

the rising and gifted night watchman at the lone star slaughter house and mabel grubb the daughter of the millionaire owner of the humped backed camel saloon are standing under the oleanders as they go by she is very beautiful says luderic rats says mabel a keen observer would have noted all this time the figure of a solitary man who seemed to avoid the company but by adroit changing of his position and perfectly cool and self possessed manner avoided drawing any especial attention to himself the lion of the evening is herr professor ludwig von bum the pianist he had been found drinking beer in a saloon on east pecan street by colonel st vitus about a week before and according to the austin custom in such cases was invited home by the colonel and the next day accepted into society with large music classes at his service professor von bum is playing the lovely symphony in g minor from beethoven s songs without music the grand chords fill the room with exquisite harmony he plays the extremely difficult passages in the obligato home run in a masterly manner and when he finishes with that grand te deum with arpeggios on the side there is that complete hush in the room that is dearer to the artist s heart than the loudest applause the professor looks around the room is empty empty with the exception of tictocq the great french detective who springs from behind a mass of tropical plants to his side the professor rises in alarm hush says tictocq make no noise at all you have already made enough footsteps are heard outside be quick says tictocq give me those socks there is not a moment to spare vas sagst du ah he confesses says tictocq no socks will do but those you carried off from the populist candidate s room the company is returning no longer hearing the music tictooq hesitates not he seizes the professor throws him upon the floor tears off his shoes and socks and escapes with the latter through the open window into the garden chapter iii tictocq s room in the avenue hotel a knock is heard at the door tictocq opens it and looks at his watch ah he says it is just six entrez messieurs the messieurs entrez there are seven of them the populist candidate who is there by invitation not knowing for what purpose the chairman of the democratic executive committee platform no the hotel proprietor and three or four democrats and populists as near as could be found out i don t know begins the populist candidate what in the h excuse me says tictocq firmly you will oblige me by keeping silent until i make my report i have been employed in this case and i have unravelled it for the honor of france i request that i be heard with attention certainly says the chairman we will be pleased to listen tictocq stands in the centre of the room the electric light burns brightly above him he seems the incarnation of alertness vigor cleverness and cunning the company seat themselves in chairs along the wall when informed of the robbery begins tictocq i first questioned the bell boy he knew nothing i went to the police headquarters they knew nothing i invited one of them to the bar to drink he said there used to be a little colored boy in the tenth ward who stole things and kept them for recovery by the police but failed to be at the place agreed upon for arrest one time and had been sent to jail i then began to think i reasoned no man said i would carry a populist s socks in his pocket without wrapping them up he would not want to do so in the hotel he would want a paper where would he get one at the statesman office of course i went there a young man with his hair combed down on his forehead sat behind the desk i knew he was writing society items for a young lady s slipper a piece of cake a fan a half emptied bottle of cocktail a bunch of roses and a police whistle lay on the desk before him can you tell me if a man purchased a paper here in the last three months i said yes he replied we sold one last night can you describe the man accurately he had blue whiskers a wart between his shoulder blades a touch of colic and an occupation tax on his breath which way did he go out i then went wait a minute said the populist candidate rising i don t see why in the h once more i must beg that you will be silent said tictocq rather sharply you should not interrupt me in the midst of my report i made one false arrest continued tictocq i was passing two finely dressed gentlemen on the street when one of them remarked that he had stole his socks i handcuffed him and dragged him to a lighted store when his companion explained to me that he was somewhat intoxicated and his tongue was not entirely manageable he had been speaking of some business transaction and what he intended to say was that he had sold his stocks i then released him an hour afterward i passed a saloon and saw this professor von bum drinking beer at a table i knew him in paris i said here is my man he worshipped wagner lived on limburger cheese beer and credit and would have stolen anybody s socks i shadowed him to the reception at colonel st vitus s and in an opportune moment i seized him and tore the socks from his feet there they are with a dramatic gesture tictocq threw a pair of dingy socks upon the table folded his arms and threw back his head with a loud cry of rage the populist candidate sprang once more to his feet gol darn it i will say what i want to i the two other populists in the room gazed at him coldly and sternly is this tale true they demanded of the candidate no by gosh it ain t he replied pointing a trembling finger at the democratic chairman there stands the man who has concocted the whole scheme it is an infernal unfair political trick to lose votes for our party how far has thing gone he added turning savagely to the detective all the newspapers have my written report on the matter and the statesman will have it in plate matter next week said tictocq complacently all is lost said the populists turning toward the door for god s sake my friends pleaded the candidate following them listen to me i swear before high heaven that i never wore a pair of socks in my life it is all a devilish campaign lie the populists turn their backs the damage is already done they said the people have heard the story you have yet time to withdraw decently before the race all left the room except tictocq and the democrats let s all go down and open a bottle of fizz on the finance committee said the chairman of the executive committee platform no tracked to doom or the mystery of the rue de peychaud

and the knowledge that his business never allowed him to scrape his feet in the hall or snore parbleu marie snarls the gray wolf que voulez vous avez vous le beau cheval de mon frere oule joli chien de votre pere no no gray wolf shouts the motley group of assassins rogues and pickpockets even their hardened hearts appalled at his fearful words mon dieu you cannot be so cruel tiens shouts the gray wolf now maddened to desperation and drawing his gleaming knife voila canaille tout le monde carte blanche enbonpoint sauve que peut entre nous revenez nous a nous moutons the horrifed sans culottes shrink back in terror as the gray wolf seizes maria by the hair and cuts her into twenty nine pieces each exactly the same size as he stands with reeking hands above the corpse amid a deep silence the old gray bearded man who has been watching the scene springs forward tears off his false beard and locks and tictocq the famous french detective stands before them spellbound and immovable the denizens of the cellar gaze at the greatest modern detective as he goes about the customary duties of his office he first measures the distance from the murdered woman to a point on the wall then he takes down the name of the bartender and the day of the month and the year then drawing from his pocket a powerful microscope he examines a little of the blood that stands upon the floor in little pools mon dieu he mutters it is as i feared human blood he then enters rapidly in a memorandum book the result of his investigations and leaves the cellar tictocq bends his rapid steps in the direction of the headquarters of the paris gendarmerie but suddenly pausing he strikes his hand upon his brow with a gesture of impatience mille tonnerre he mutters i should have asked the name of that man with the knife in his hand it is reception night at the palace of the duchess valerie du bellairs the apartments are flooded with a mellow light from paraffine candles in solid silver candelabra the company is the most aristocratic and wealthy in paris three or four brass bands are playing behind a portiere between the coal shed and also behind time footmen in gay laced livery bring in beer noiselessly and carry out apple peelings dropped by the guests valerie seventh duchess du bellairs leans back on a solid gold ottoman on eiderdown cushions surrounded by the wittiest the bravest and the handsomest courtiers in the capital ah madame said the prince champvilliers of palms royale corner of seventy third street as montesquiaux says rien de plus bon tutti frutti youth seems your inheritance you are to night the most beautiful the wittiest in your own salon i can scarce believe my own senses when i remember that thirty one years ago you saw it off says the duchess peremptorily the prince bows low and drawing a jewelled dagger stabs himself to the heart the displeasure of your grace is worse than death he says as he takes his overcoat and hat from a corner of the mantelpiece and leaves the room voila says beebe francillon fanning herself languidly that is the way with men flatter them and they kiss your hand loose but a moment the silken leash that holds them captive through their vanity and self opinionativeness and the son of a gun gets on his ear at once the devil go with him i say ah mon princesse sighs the count pumpernickel stooping and whispering with eloquent eyes into her ear you are too hard upon us balzac says all women are not to themselves what no one else is to another do you not agree with him cheese it says the princess philosophy palls upon me i ll shake you hosses says the count arm and arm they go out to the salon au beurre armande de fleury the young pianissimo danseuse from the folies bergere is about to sing she slightly clears her throat and lays a voluptuous cud of chewing gum upon the piano as the first notes of the accompaniment ring through the salon as she prepares to sing the duchess du bellairs grasps the arm of her ottoman in a vice like grip and she watches with an expression of almost anguished suspense she scarcely breathes then as armande de fleury before uttering a note reels wavers turns white as snow and falls dead upon the floor the duchess breathes a sigh of relief the duchess had poisoned her then the guests crowd about the piano gazing with bated breath and shuddering as they look upon the music rack and observe that the song that armande came so near singing is sweet marie twenty minutes later a dark and muffled figure was seen to emerge from a recess in the mullioned wall of the arc de triomphe and pass rapidly northward it was no other than tictocq the detective the network of evidence was fast being drawn about the murderer of marie cusheau it is midnight on the steeple of the cathedral of notadam it is also the same time at other given points in the vicinity the spire of the cathedral is feet above the pavement and a casual observer by making a rapid mathematical calculation would have readily perceived that this cathedral is at least double the height of others that measure only feet at the summit of the spire there is a little wooden platform on which there is room for but one man to stand crouching on this precarious footing which swayed dizzily with every breeze that blew was a man closely muffled and disguised as a wholesale grocer old francois beongfallong the great astronomer who is studying the sidereal spheres from his attic window in the rue de bologny shudders as he turns his telescope upon the solitary figure upon the spire sacre bleu he hisses between his new celluloid teeth it is tictocq the detective i wonder whom he is following now while tictocq is watching with lynx like eyes the hill of montmartre he suddenly hears a heavy breathing beside him and turning gazes into the ferocious eyes of the gray wolf carnaignole cusheau had put on his w u tel co climbers and climbed the steeple parbleu monsieur says tictocq to whom am i indebted for the honor of this visit the gray wolf smiled softly and depreciatingly you are tictocq the detective he said i am then listen i am the murderer of marie cusheau she was my wife and she had cold feet and ate onions what was i to do yet life is sweet to me i do not wish to be guillotined i have heard that you are on my track is it true that the case is in your hands it is thank le bon dieu then i am saved the gray wolf carefully adjusts the climbers on his feet and descends the spire tictocq takes out his notebook and writes in it at last he says i have a clue monsieur le compte carnaignole cusheau once known as the gray wolf stands in the magnificent drawing room of his palace on east th street three days after his confession to tictocq he happened to look in the pockets of a discarded pair of pants and found twenty million francs in gold suddenly the door opens and tictocq the detective with a dozen gensd arme enters the room you are my prisoner says the detective on what charge the murder of marie cusheau on the night of august th your proofs i saw you do it and your own confession on the spire of notadam the count laughed and took a paper from his pocket read this he said here is proof that marie cusheau died of heart failure tictocq looked at the paper it was a check for francs tictocq dismissed the gensd arme with a wave of his hand we have made a mistake monsieurs he said but as he turns to leave the room count carnaignole stops him one moment monsieur the count carnaignole tears from his own face a false beard and reveals the flashing eyes and well known features of tictocq the detective then springing forward he snatches a wig and false eyebrows from his visitor and the gray wolf grinding his teeth in rage stands before him the murderer of marie cusheau was never discovered a snapshot at the president this is the kind of waggish editorial o henry was writing in for the readers of the rolling stone the reader will do well to remember that the paper was for local consumption and that the allusions are to a very special place and time it will be remembered that about a month ago there were special rates offered to the public for a round trip to the city of washington the price of the ticket being exceedingly low we secured a loan of twenty dollars from a public spirited citizen of austin by mortgaging our press and cow with the additional security of our brother s name and a slight draught on major hutchinson for we purchased a round trip ticket two loaves of vienna bread and quite a large piece of cheese which we handed to a member of our reportorial staff with instructions to go to washington interview president cleveland and get a scoop if possible on all other texas papers our reporter came in yesterday morning via the manor dirt road with a large piece of folded cotton bagging tied under each foot it seems that he lost his ticket in washington and having divided the vienna bread and cheese with some disappointed office seekers who were coming home by the same route he arrived home hungry desiring food and with quite an appetite although somewhat late we give his description of his interview with president cleveland i am chief reporter on the staff of the rolling stone about a month ago the managing editor came into the room where we were both sitting engaged in conversation and said oh by the way go to washington and interview president cleveland all right said i take care of yourself five minutes later i was seated in a palatial drawing room car bounding up and down quite a good deal on the elastic plush covered seat i shall not linger upon the incidents of the journey i was given carte blanche to provide myself with every comfort and to spare no expense that i could meet for the regalement of my inside the preparations had been lavish both vienna and germany had been called upon to furnish dainty viands suitable to my palate i changed cars and shirts once only on the journey a stranger wanted me to also change a two dollar bill but i haughtily declined the scenery along the entire road to washington is diversified you find a portion of it on one hand by looking out of the window and upon turning the gaze upon the other side the eye is surprised and delighted by discovering some more of it there were a great many knights of pythias on the train one of them insisted upon my giving him the grip i had with me but he was unsuccessful on arriving in washington which city i instantly recognized from reading the history of george i left the car so hastily that i forgot to fee mr pullman s representative i went immediately to the capitol in a spirit of jeu d esprit i had had made a globular representation of a rolling stone it was of wood painted a dark color and about the size of a small cannon ball i had attached to it a twisted pendant about three inches long to indicate moss i had resolved to use this in place of a card thinking people would readily recognize it as an emblem of my paper i had studied the arrangement of the capitol and walked directly to mr cleveland s private office i met a servant in the hall and held up my card to him smilingly i saw his hair rise on his head and he ran like a deer to the door and lying down rolled down the long flight of steps into the yard ah said i to myself he is one of our delinquent subscribers a little farther along i met the president s private secretary who had been writing a tariff letter and cleaning a duck gun for mr cleveland when i showed him the emblem of my paper he sprang out of a high window into a hothouse filled with rare flowers this somewhat surprised me i examined myself my hat was on straight and there was nothing at all alarming about my appearance i went into the president s private office he was alone he was conversing with tom ochiltree mr ochiltree saw my little sphere and with a loud scream rushed out of the room president cleveland slowly turned his eyes upon me he also saw what i had in my hand and said in a husky voice wait a moment please he searched his coat pocket and presently found a piece of paper on which some words were written he laid this on his desk and rose to his feet raised one hand above him and said in deep tones i die for free trade my country and and all that sort of thing i saw him jerk a string and a camera snapped on another table taking our picture as we stood don t die in the house mr president i said go over into the senate chamber peace murderer he said let your bomb do its deadly work i m no bum i said with spirit i represent the rolling stone of austin texas and this i hold in my hand does the same thing but it seems unsuccessfully the president sank back in his chair greatly relieved i thought you were a dynamiter he said let me see texas texas he walked to a large wall map of the united states and placing his finger thereon at about the location of idaho ran it down in a zigzag doubtful way until he reached texas oh yes here it is i have so many things on my mind i sometimes forget what i should know well let s see texas oh yes that s the state where ida wells and a lot of colored people lynched a socialist named hogg for raising a riot at a camp meeting so you are from texas i know a man from texas named dave culberson how is dave and his family has dave got any children he has a boy in austin i said working around the capitol who is president of texas now i don t exactly oh excuse me i forgot again i thought i heard some talk of its having been made a republic again now mr cleveland i said you answer some of my questions a curious film came over the president s eyes he sat stiffly in his chair like an automaton proceed he said what do you think of the political future of this country i will state that political exigencies demand emergentistical promptitude and while the united states is indissoluble in conception and invisible in intent treason and internecine disagreement have ruptured the consanguinity of patriotism and one moment mr president i interrupted would you mind changing that cylinder i could have gotten all that from the american press association if i had wanted plate matter do you wear flannels what is your favorite poet brand of catsup bird flower and what are you going to do when you are out of a job young man said mr cleveland sternly you are going a little too far my private affairs do not concern the public i begged his pardon and he recovered his good humor in a moment you texans have a great representative in senator mills he said i think the greatest two speeches i ever heard were his address before the senate advocating the removal of the tariff on salt and increasing it on chloride of sodium tom ochiltree is also from our state i said oh no he isn t you must be mistaken replied mr cleveland for he says he is i really must go down to texas some time and see the state i want to go up into the panhandle and see if it is really shaped like it is on the map well i must be going said i when you get back to texas said the president rising you must write to me your visit has awakened in me quite an interest in your state which i fear i have not given the attention it deserves there are many historical and otherwise interesting places that you have revived in my recollection the alamo where davy jones fell goliad sam houston s surrender to montezuma the petrified boom found near austin five cent cotton and the siamese democratic platform born in dallas i should so much like to see the gals in galveston and go to the wake in waco i am glad i met you turn to the left as you enter the hall and keep straight on out i made a low bow to signify that the interview was at an end and withdrew immiediately i had no difficulty in leaving the building as soon as i was outside i hurried downtown in order to obtain refreshments at some place where viands had been placed upon the free list i shall not describe my journey back to austin i lost my return ticket somewhere in the white house and was forced to return home in a manner not especially beneficial to my shoes everybody was well in washington when i left and all send their love an unfinished christmas story probably begun several years before his death published as it here appears in short stories january now a christmas story should be one for a good many years the ingenious writers have been putting forth tales for the holiday numbers that employed every subtle evasive indirect and strategic scheme they could invent to disguise the christmas flavor so far has this new practice been carried that nowadays when you read a story in a holiday magazine the only way you can tell it is a christmas story is to look at the footnote which reads the incidents in the above story happened on december th ed there is progress in this but it is all very sad there are just as many real christmas stories as ever if we would only dig em up me i am for the scrooge and marley christmas story and the annie and willie s prayer poem and the long lost son coming home on the stroke of twelve to the poorly thatched cottage with his arms full of talking dolls and popcorn balls and zip you hear the second mortgage on the cottage go flying off it into the deep snow so this is to warn you that there is no subterfuge about this story and you might come upon stockings hung to the mantel and plum puddings and hark the chimes and wealthy misers loosening up and handing over penny whistles to lame newsboys if you read further once i knocked at a door i have so many things to tell you i keep on losing sight of the story it was the front door of a furnished room house in west teenth street i was looking for a young illustrator named paley originally and irrevocably from terre haute paley doesn t enter even into the first serial rights of this christmas story i mention him simply in explaining why i came to knock at the door some people have so much curiosity the door was opened by the landlady i had seen hundreds like her and i had smelled before that cold dank furnished draught of air that hurried by her to escape immurement in the furnished house she was stout and her face and lands were as white as though she had been drowned in a barrel of vinegar one hand held together at her throat a buttonless flannel dressing sacque whose lines had been cut by no tape or butterick known to mortal woman beneath this a too long flowered black sateen skirt was draped about her reaching the floor in stiff wrinkles and folds the rest of her was yellow her hair in some bygone age had been dipped in the fountain of folly presided over by the merry nymph hydrogen but now except at the roots it had returned to its natural grim and grizzled white her eyes and teeth and finger nails were yellow her chops hung low and shook when she moved the look on her face was exactly that smileless look of fatal melancholy that you may have seen on the countenance of a hound left sitting on the doorstep of a deserted cabin i inquired for paley after a long look of cold suspicion the landlady spoke and her voice matched the dingy roughness of her flannel sacque paley was i sure that was the name and wasn t it likely mr sanderson i meant in the third floor rear no it was paley i wanted again that frozen shrewd steady study of my soul from her pale yellow unwinking eyes trying to penetrate my mask of deception and rout out my true motives from my lying lips there was a mr tompkins in the front hall bedroom two flights up perhaps it was he i was seeking he worked of nights he never came in till seven in the morning or if it was really mr tucker thinly disguised as paley that i was hunting i would have to call between five and but no i held firmly to paley there was no such name among her lodgers click the door closed swiftly in my face and i heard through the panels the clanking of chains and bolts i went down the steps and stopped to consider the number of this house was i was sure paley had said or perhaps it was or i decided to try the second house farther along i rang the bell the door opened and there stood the same woman i wasn t confronted by just a resemblance it was the same woman holding together the same old sacque at her throat and looking at me with the same yellow eyes as if she had never seen me before on earth i saw on the knuckle of her second finger the same red and black spot made probably by a recent burn against a hot stove i stood speechless and gaping while one with moderate haste might have told fifty i couldn t have spoken paley s name even if i had remembered it i did the only thing that a brave man who believes there are mysterious forces in nature that we do not yet fully comprehend could have done in the circumstances i backed down the steps to the sidewalk and then hurried away frontward fully understanding how incidents like that must bother the psychical research people and the census takers of course i heard an explanation of it afterward as we always do about inexplicable things the landlady was mrs kannon and she leased three adjoining houses which she made into one by cutting arched doorways through the walls she sat in the middle house and answered the three bells i wonder why i have maundered so slowly through the prologue i have it it was simply to say to you in the form of introduction rife through the middle west shake hands with mrs kannon for it was in her triple house that the christmas story happened and it was there where i picked up the incontrovertible facts from the gossip of many roomers and met stickney and saw the necktie christmas came that year on thursday and snow came with it stickney harry clarence fowler stickney to whomsoever his full baptismal cognominal burdens may be of interest reached his address at six thirty wednesday afternoon address is new yorkese for home stickney roomed at west teenth street third floor rear hall room he was twenty years and four months old and he worked in a cameras of all kinds photographic supplies and films developed store i don t know what kind of work he did in the store but you must have seen him he is the young man who always comes behind the counter to wait on you and lets you talk for five minutes telling him what you want when you are done he calls the proprietor at the top of his voice to wait on you and walks away whistling between his teeth i don t want to bother about describing to you his appearance but if you are a man reader i will say that stickncy looked precisely like the young chap that you always find sitting in your chair smoking a cigarette after you have missed a shot while playing pool not billiards but pool when you want to sit down yourself there are some to whom christmas gives no christmassy essence of course prosperous people and comfortable people who have homes or flats or rooms with meals and even people who live in apartment houses with hotel service get something of the christmas flavor they give one another presents with the cost mark scratched off with a penknife and they hang holly wreaths in the front windows and when they are asked whether they prefer light or dark meat from the turkey they say both please and giggle and have lots of fun and the very poorest people have the best time of it the army gives em a dinner and the a m issue of the night final edition of the newspaper with the largest circulation in the city leaves a basket at their door full of an apple a lake ronkonkoma squab a scrambled eggplant and a bunch of kalamazoo bleached parsley the poorer you are the more christmas does for you but i ll tell you to what kind of a mortal christmas seems to be only the day before the twenty sixth day of december it s the chap in the big city earning sixteen dollars a week with no friends and few acquaintances who finds himself with only fifty cents in his pocket on christmas eve he can t accept charity he can t borrow he knows no one who would invite him to dinner i have a fancy that when the shepherds left their flocks to follow the star of bethlehem there was a bandy legged young fellow among them who was just learning the sheep business so they said to him bobby we re going to investigate this star route and see what s in it if it should turn out to be the first christmas day we don t want to miss it and as you are not a wise man and as you couldn t possibly purchase a present to take along suppose you stay behind and mind the sheep so as we may say harry stickney was a direct descendant of the shepherd who was left behind to take care of the flocks getting back to facts stickney rang the doorbell of he had a habit of forgetting his latchkey instantly the door opened and there stood mrs kannon clutching her sacque together at the throat and gorgonizing him with her opaque yellow eyes to give you good measure here is a story within a story once a roomer in who had the scotch habit not kilts but a habit of drinking scotch began to figure to himself what might happen if two persons should ring the doorbells of and at the same time visions of two halves of mrs kannon appearing respectively and simultaneously at the two entrances each clutching at a side of an open flapping sacque that could never meet overpowered him bellevue got him evening said stickney cheerlessly as he distributed little piles of muddy slush along the hall matting think we ll have snow you left your key said here the manuscript ends the unprofitable servant left unfinished and published as it here appears in everybody s magazine december i am the richer by the acquaintance of four newspaper men singly they are my encyclopedias friends mentors and sometimes bankers but now and then it happens that all of them will pitch upon the same printworthy incident of the passing earthly panorama and will send in reportorial constructions thereof to their respective journals it is then that for me it is to laugh for it seems that to each of them trained and skilled as he may be the same occurrence presents a different facet of the cut diamond life one will have it let us say that mme andre macarte s apartment was looted by six burglars who descended via the fire escape and bore away a ruby tiara valued at two thousand dollars and a five hundred dollar prize spitz dog which in violation of the expectoration ordinance was making free with the halls of the wuttapesituckquesunoowetunquah apartments my second chiel will take notes to the effect that while a friendly game of pinochle was in progress in the tenement rooms of mrs andy mccarty a lady guest named ruby o hara threw a burglar down six flights of stairs where he was pinioned and held by a two thousand dollar english bulldog amid a crowd of five hundred excited spectators my third chronicler and friend will gather the news threads of the happening in his own happy way setting forth on the page for you to read that the house of antonio macartini was blown up at a m by the black hand society on his refusing to leave two thousand dollars at a certain street corner killing a pet five hundred dollar pomeranian belonging to alderman rubitara s little daughter see photo and diagram opposite number four of my history makers will simply construe from the premises the story that while an audience of two thousand enthusiasts was listening to a rubinstein concert on sixth street a woman who said she was mrs andrew m carter threw a brick through a plate glass window valued at five hundred dollars the carter woman claimed that some one in the building had stolen her dog now the discrepancies in these registrations of the day s doings need do no one hurt surely one newspaper is enough for any man to prop against his morning water bottle to fend off the smiling hatred of his wife s glance if he be foolish enough to read four he is no wiser than a higher critic i remember probably as well as you do having read the parable of the talents a prominent citizen about to journey into a far country first hands over to his servants his goods to one he gives five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his several ability as the text has it there are two versions of this parable as you well know there may be more i do not know when the p c returns he requires an accounting two servants have put their talents out at usury and gained one hundred per cent good the unprofitable one simply digs up the talent deposited with him and hands it out on demand a pattern of behavior for trust companies and banks surely in one version we read that he had wrapped it in a napkin and laid it away but the commentator informs us that the talent mentioned was composed of ounces of silver about worth so the chronicler who mentioned the napkin had either to reduce the amount of the deposit or do a lot of explaining about the size of the napery used in those davs therefore in his version we note that he uses the word pound instead of talent a pound of silver may very well be laid away and carried away in a napkin as any hotel or restaurant man will tell you but let us get away from our mutton when the returned nobleman finds that the one talented servant has nothing to hand over except the original fund entrusted to him he is as angry as a multi millionaire would be if some one should hide under his bed and make a noise like an assessment he orders the unprofitable servant cast into outer darkness after first taking away his talent and giving it to the one hundred per cent financier and breathing strange saws saying from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath which is the same as to say nothing from nothing leaves nothing and now closer draw the threads of parable precept allegory and narrative leading nowhere if you will or else weaving themselves into the little fiction story about cliff mcgowan and his one talent there is but a definition to follow and then the homely actors trip on talent a gift endowment or faculty some peculiar ability power or accomplishment natural or acquired a metaphor borrowed from the parable in matt xxv l in new york city to day there are estimated living creatures training for the stage this does not include seals pigs dogs elephants prize fighters carmens mind readers or japanese wrestlers the bulk of them are in the ranks of the four million out of this number will survive a thousand nine hundred of these will have attained their fulness of fame when they shall dubiously indicate with the point of a hatpin a blurred figure in a flashlight photograph of a stage tout ensemble with the proud commentary that s me eighty in the pinkest of male louis xiv court costumes shall welcome the queen of the mythical pawpaw isles in a few well memorized words turning a tip tilted nose upon the nine hundred ten in tiny lace caps shall dust ibsen furniture for six minutes after the rising of the curtain nine shall attain the circuits besieging with muscle skill eye hand voice wit brain heel and toe the ultimate high walls of stardom one shall inherit broadway sic venit gloria mundi cliff mcgowan and mac mcgowan were cousins they lived on the west side and were talented singing dancing imitations trick bicycle riding boxing german and irish dialect comedy and a little sleight of hand and balancing of wheat straws and wheelbarrows on the ends of their chins came as easy to them as it is for you to fix your rat so it won t show or to dodge a creditor through the swinging doors of a well lighted cafe according as you may belong to the one or the other division of the greatest prestidigitators the people they were slim pale consummately self possessed youths whose fingernails were always irreproachably and clothes seams reproachfully shiny their conversation was in sentences so short that they made kipling s seem as long as court citations having the temperament they did no work any afternoon you could find them on eighth avenue either in front of spinelli s barber shop mike dugan s place or the limerick hotel rubbing their forefinger nails with dingy silk handkerchiefs at any time if you had happened to be standing undecisive near a pool table and cliff and mac had casually as it were drawn near mentioning something disinterestedly about a game well indeed would it have been for you had you gone your way unresponsive which assertion carefully considered is a study in tense punctuation and advice to strangers of all kinships it is likely that the closest is that of cousin between cousins there exist the ties of race name and favor ties thicker than water and yet not coagulated with the jealous precipitations of brotherhood or the enjoining obligations of the matrimonial yoke you can bestow upon a cousin almost the interest and affection that you would give to a stranger you need not feel toward him the contempt and embarrassment that you have for one of your father s sons it is the closer clan feeling that sometimes makes the branch of a tree stronger than its trunk thus were the two mcgowans bonded they enjoyed a quiet celebrity in their district which was a strip west of eighth avenue with the pump for its pivot their talents were praised in a hundred joints their friendship was famed even in a neighborhood where men had been known to fight off the wives of their friends when domestic onslaught was being made upon their friends by the wives of their friends thus do the limitations of english force us to repetends so side by side grim sallow lowering inseparable undefeated the cousins fought their way into the temple of art art with a big a which causes to intervene a lesson in geometry one night at about eleven o clock del delano dropped into mike s place on eighth avenue from that moment instead of remaining a place the cafe became a resort it was as though king edward had condescended to mingle with ten spots of a different suit or joe gans had casually strolled in to look over the tuskegee school or mr shaw of england had accepted an invitation to read selections from rena the snow bird at an unveiling of the proposed monument to james owen o connor at chinquapin falls mississippi in spite of these comparisons you will have to be told why the patronizing of a third rate saloon on the west side by the said del delano conferred such a specific honor upon the place del delano could not make his feet behave and so the world paid him a week to see them misconduct themselves on the vaudeville stage to make the matter plain to you and to swell the number of words he was the best fancy dancer on any of the circuits between ottawa and corpus christi with his eyes fixed on vacancy and his feet apparently fixed on nothing he nightly charmed thousands as his press agent incorrectly stated even taking night performance and matinee together he scarcely could have charmed more than eighteen hundred including those who left after zora the nautch girl had squeezed herself through a hoop twelve inches in diameter and those who were waiting for the moving pictures but del delano was the west side s favorite and nowhere is there a more loyal side five years before our story was submitted to the editors del had crawled from some tenth avenue basement like a lean rat and had bitten his way into the big cheese patched half starved cuffless and as scornful of the hook as an interpreter of ibsen he had danced his way into health as you and i view it and fame in sixteen minutes on amateur night at creary s variety theatre in eighth avenue a bookmaker one of the kind that talent wins with instead of losing sat in the audience asleep dreaming of an impossible pick up among the amateurs after a snore a glass of beer from the handsome waiter and a temporary blindness caused by the diamonds of a transmontane blonde in box e the bookmaker woke up long enough to engage del delano for a three weeks trial engagement fused with a trained dog short circuit covering the three washingtons heights statue and square by the time this story was read and accepted del delano was drawing his three hundred dollars a week which divided by seven sunday acts not in costume being permissible dispels the delusion entertained by most of us that we have seen better days you can easily imagine the worshipful agitation of eighth avenue whenever del delano honored it with a visit after his terpsichorean act in a historically great and vilely ventilated broadway theatre if the west side could claim forty two minutes out of his forty two weeks bookings every year it was an occasion for bonfires and repainting of the pump and now you know why mike s saloon is a resort and no longer a simple place del delano entered mike s alone so nearly concealed in a fur lined overcoat and a derby two sizes too large for him was prince lightfoot that you saw of his face only his pale hatchet edged features and a pair of unwinking cold light blue eyes nearly every man lounging at mike s bar recognized the renowned product of the west side to those who did not wisdom was conveyed by prodding elbows and growls of one sided introduction upon charley one of the bartenders both fame and fortune descended simultaneously he had once been honored by shaking hands with the great delano at a seventh avenue boxing bout so with lungs of brass he now cried hallo del old man what ll it be mike the proprietor who was cranking the cash register heard on the next day he raised charley s wages five a week del delano drank a pony beer paying for it carelessly out of his nightly earnings of and c he nodded amiably but coldly at the long line of mike s patrons and strolled past then into the rear room of the cafe for he heard in there sounds pertaining to his own art the light stirring staccato of a buck and wing dance in the back room mac mcgowan was giving a private exhibition of the genius of his feet a few young men sat at tables looking on critically while they amused themselves seriously with beer they nodded approval at some new fancy steps of mac s own invention at the sight of the great del delano the amateur s feet stuttered blundered clicked a few times and ceased to move the tongues of one s shoes become tied in the presence of the master mac s sallow face took on a slight flush from the uncertain cavity between del delano s hat brim and the lapels of his high fur coat collar came a thin puff of cigarette smoke and then a voice do that last step over again kid and don t hold your arms quite so stiff now then once more mac went through his paces according to the traditions of the man dancer his entire being was transformed into mere feet and legs his gaze and expression became cataleptic his body unbending above the waist but as light as a cork bobbed like the same cork dancing on the ripples of a running brook the beat of his heels and toes pleased you like a snare drum obligato the performance ended with an amazing clatter of leather against wood that culminated in a sudden flat footed stamp leaving the dancer erect and as motionless as a pillar of the colonial portico of a mansion in a kentucky prohibition town mac felt that he had done his best and that del delano would turn his back upon him in derisive scorn an approximate silence followed broken only by the mewing of a cafe cat and the hubbub and uproar of a few million citizens and transportation facilities outside mac turned a hopeless but nervy eye upon del delano s face in it he read disgust admiration envy indifference approval disappointment praise and contempt thus in the countenances of those we hate or love we find what we most desire or fear to see which is an assertion equalling in its wisdom and chiaroscuro the most famous sayings of the most foolish philosophers that the world has ever known del delano retired within his overcoat and hat in two minutes he emerged and turned his left side to mac then he spoke you ve got a foot movement kid like a baby hippopotamus trying to side step a jab from a humming bird and you hold yourself like a truck driver having his picture taken in a third avenue photograph gallery and you haven t got any method or style and your knees are about as limber as a couple of yale pass keys and you strike the eye as weighing let us say pounds while you work but say would you mind giving me your name mcgowan said the humbled amateur mac mcgowan delano the great slowly lighted a cigarette and continued through its smoke in other words you re rotten you can t dance but i ll tell you one thing you ve got throw it all off of your system while you re at it said mac what ve i got genius said del delano except myself it s up to you to be the best fancy dancer in the united states europe asia and the colonial possessions of all three smoke up said mac mcgowan genius repeated the master you ve got a talent for genius your brains are in your feet where a dancer s ought to be you ve been self taught until you re almost ruined but not quite what you need is a trainer i ll take you in hand and put you at the top of the profession there s room there for the two of us you may beat me said the master casting upon him a cold savage look combining so much rivalry affection justice and human hate that it stamped him at once as one of the little great ones of the earth you may beat me but i doubt it i ve got the start and the pull but at the top is where you belong your name you say is robinson mcgowan repeated the amateur mac mcgowan it don t matter said delano suppose you walk up to my hotel with me i d like to talk to you your footwork is the worst i ever saw madigan but well i d like to talk to you you may not think so but i m not so stuck up i came off of the west side myself that overcoat cost me eight hundred dollars but the collar ain t so high but what i can see over it i taught myself to dance and i put in most of nine years at it before i shook a foot in public but i had genius i didn t go too far wrong in teaching myself as you ve done you ve got the rottenest method and style of anybody i ever saw oh i don t think much of the few little steps i take said mac with hypocritical lightness don t talk like a package of self raising buckwheat flour said del delano you ve had a talent handed to you by the proposition higher up and it s up to you to do the proper thing with it i d like to have you go up to my hotel for a talk if you will in his rooms in the king clovis hotel del delano put on a scarlet house coat bordered with gold braid and set out apollinaris and a box of sweet crackers mac s eye wandered forget it said del drink and tobacco may be all right for a man who makes his living with his hands but they won t do if you re depending on your head or your feet if one end of you gets tangled so does the other that s why beer and cigarettes don t hurt piano players and picture painters but you ve got to cut em out if you want to do mental or pedal work now have a cracker and then we ll talk some all right said mac i take it as an honor of course for you to notice my hopping around of course i d like to do something in a professional line of course i can sing a little and do card tricks and irish and german comedy stuff and of course i m not so bad on the trapeze and comic bicycle stunts and hebrew monologues and one moment interrupted del delano before we begin i said you couldn t dance well that wasn t quite right you ve only got two or three bad tricks in your method you re handy with your feet and you belong at the top where i am i ll put you there i ve got six weeks continuous in new york and in four i can shape up your style till the booking agents will fight one another to get you and i ll do it too i m of from and for the west side del delano looks good on bill boards but the family name s crowley now mackintosh mcgowan i mean you ve got your chance fifty times a better one than i had i d be a shine to turn it down said mac and i hope you understand i appreciate it me and my cousin cliff mcgowan was thinking of getting a try out at creary s on amateur night a month from to morrow good stuff said delano i got mine there junius t rollins the booker for kuhn dooley jumped on the stage and engaged me after my dance and the boards were an inch deep in nickels and dimes and quarters there wasn t but nine penny pieces found in the lot i ought to tell you said mac after two minutes of pensiveness that my cousin cliff can beat me dancing we ve always been what you might call pals if you d take him up instead of me now it might be better he s invented a lot of steps that i can t cut forget it said delano mondays wednesdays fridays and saturdays of every week from now till amateur night a month off i ll coach you i ll make you as good as i am and nobody could do more for you my act s over every night at half an hour later i ll take you up and drill you till twelve i ll put you at the top of the bunch right where i am you ve got talent your style s bum but you ve got the genius you let me manage it i m from the west side myself and i d rather see one of the same gang win out before i would an east sider or any of the flatbush or hackensack meadow kind of butt iners i ll see that junius rollins is present on your friday night and if he don t climb over the footlights and offer you fifty a week as a starter i ll let you draw it down from my own salary every monday night now am i talking on the level or am i not amateur night at creary s eighth avenue theatre is cut by the same pattern as amateur nights elsewhere after the regular performance the humblest talent may by previous arrangement with the management make its debut upon the public stage ambitious non professionals mostly self instructed display their skill and powers of entertainment along the broadest lines they may sing dance mimic juggle contort recite or disport themselves along any of the ragged boundary lines of art from the ranks of these anxious tyros are chosen the professionals that adorn or otherwise make conspicuous the full blown stage press agents delight in recounting to open mouthed and close eared reporters stories of the humble beginnings of the brilliant stars whose orbits they control such and such a prima donna they will tell you made her initial bow to the public while turning handsprings on an amateur night one great matinee favorite made his debut on a generous friday evening singing coon songs of his own composition a tragedian famous on two continents and an island first attracted attention by an amateur impersonation of a newly landed scandinavian peasant girl one broadway comedian that turns em away got a booking on a friday night by reciting seriously the graveyard scene in hamlet thus they get their chance amateur night is a kindly boon it is charity divested of almsgiving it is a brotherly hand reached down by members of the best united band of coworkers in the world to raise up less fortunate ones without labelling them beggars it gives you the chance if you can grasp it to step for a few minutes before some badly painted scenery and during the playing by the orchestra of some ten or twelve bars of music and while the soles of your shoes may be clearly holding to the uppers to secure a salary equal to a congressman s or any orthodox minister s could an ambitious student of literature or financial methods get a chance like that by spending twenty minutes in a carnegie library i do not not trow so but shall we look in at creary s let us say that the specific friday night had arrived on which the fortunate mac mcgowan was to justify the flattering predictions of his distinguished patron and incidentally drop his silver talent into the slit of the slot machine of fame and fortune that gives up reputation and dough i offer sure of your acquiescence that we now forswear hypocritical philosophy and bigoted comment permitting the story to finish itself in the dress of material allegations a medium more worthy when held to the line than the most laborious creations of the word milliners page of o henry s manuscript missing here easily among the wings with his patron the great del delano for whatever footlights shone in the city that would be amused the freedom of their unshaded side was del s and if he should take up an amateur see and bring him around see and winking one of his cold blue eyes say to the manager take it from me he s got the goods see you wouldn t expect that amateur to sit on an unpainted bench sudorifically awaiting his turn would you so mac strolled around largely with the nonpareil and the seven waited clammily on the bench a giant in shirt sleeves with a grim kind face in which many stitches had been taken by surgeons from time to time i e with a long stick looped at the end he was the man with the hook the manager with his close smoothed blond hair his one sided smile and his abnormally easy manner pored with patient condescension over the difficult program of the amateurs the last of the professional turns the grand march of the happy huzzard had been completed the last wrinkle and darn of their blue silkolene cotton tights had vanished from the stage the man in the orchestra who played the kettle drum cymbals triangle sandpaper whang doodle hoof beats and catcalls and fired the pistol shots had wiped his brow the illegal holiday of the romans had arrived while the orchestra plays the famous waltz from the dismal wife let us bestow two hundred words upon the psychology of the audience the orchestra floor was filled by people the boxes contained persons in the galleries was the foreordained verdict the claque was there as it had originated in the stone age and was afterward adapted by the french every micky and maggie who sat upon creary s amateur bench wise beyond their talents knew that their success or doom lay already meted out to them by that crowded whistling roaring mass of romans in the three galleries they knew that the winning or the losing of the game for each one lay in the strength of the gang aloft that could turn the applause to its favorite on a broadway first night a wooer of fame may win it from the ticket buyers over the heads of the cognoscenti but not so at creary s the amateur s fate is arithmetical the number of his supporting admirers present at his try out decides it in advance but how these outlying friday nights put to a certain shame the mondays tuesdays wednesdays thursdays saturdays and matinees of the broadway stage you should know here the manuscript ends aristocracy versus hash from the rolling stone the snake reporter of the rolling stone was wandering up the avenue last night on his way home from the y m c a rooms when he was approached by a gaunt hungry looking man with wild eyes and dishevelled hair he accosted the reporter in a hollow weak voice can you tell me sir where i can find in this town a family of scrubs i don t understand exactly let me tell you how it is said the stranger inserting his forefinger in the reporter s buttonhole and badly damaging his chrysanthemum i am a representative from soapstone county and i and my family are houseless homeless and shelterless we have not tasted food for over a week i brought my family with me as i have indigestion and could not get around much with the boys some days ago i started out to find a boarding house as i cannot afford to put up at a hotel i found a nice aristocratic looking place that suited me and went in and asked for the proprietress a very stately lady with a roman nose came in the room she had one hand laid across her stom across her waist and the other held a lace handkerchief i told her i wanted board for myself and family and she condescended to take us i asked for her terms and she said per week i had two dollars in my pocket and i gave her that for a fine teapot that i broke when i fell over the table when she spoke you appear surprised says she you will please remembah that i am the widow of governor riddle of georgiah my family is very highly connected i give you board as a favah i nevah considah money any equivalent for the advantage of my society i well i got out of there and i went to some other places the next lady was a cousin of general mahone of virginia and wanted four dollars an hour for a back room with a pink motto and a burnet granite bed in it the next one was an aunt of davy crockett and asked eight dollars a day for a room furnished in imitation of the alamo with prunes for breakfast and one hour s conversation with her for dinner another one said she was a descendant of benedict arnold on her father s side and captain kidd on the other she took more after captain kidd she only had one meal and prayers a day and counted her society worth a week i found nine widows of supreme judges twelve relicts of governors and generals and twenty two ruins left by various happy colonels professors and majors who valued their aristocratic worth from to per week with weak kneed hash and dried apples on the side i admire people of fine descent but my stomach yearns for pork and beans instead of culture am i not right your words said the reporter convince me that you have uttered what you have said thanks you see how it is i am not wealthy i have only my per diem and my perquisites and i cannot afford to pay for high lineage and moldy ancestors a little corned beef goes further with me than a coronet and when i am cold a coat of arms does not warm me i greatly fear said the reporter with a playful hiccough that you have run against a high toned town most all the first class boarding houses here are run by ladies of the old southern families the very first in the land i am now desperate said the representative as he chewed a tack awhile thinking it was a clove i want to find a boarding house where the proprietress was an orphan found in a livery stable whose father was a dago from east austin and whose grandfather was never placed on the map i want a scrubby ornery low down snuff dipping back woodsy piebald gang who never heard of finger bowls or ward mcallister but who can get up a mess of hot cornbread and irish stew at regular market quotations is there such a place in austin the snake reporter sadly shook his head i do not know he said but i will shake you for the beer ten minutes later the slate in the blue ruin saloon bore two additional characters the prisoner of zembla from the rolling stone so the king fell into a furious rage so that none durst go near him for fear and he gave out that since the princess ostla had disobeyed him there would be a great tourney and to the knight who should prove himself of the greatest valor he would give the hand of the princess and he sent forth a herald to proclaim that he would do this and the herald went about the country making his desire known blowing a great tin horn and riding a noble steed that pranced and gambolled and the villagers gazed upon him and said lo that is one of them tin horn gamblers concerning which the chroniclers have told us and when the day came the king sat in the grandstand holding the gage of battle in his band and by his side sat the princess ostla looking very pale and beautiful but with mournful eyes from which she scarce could keep the tears and the knights which came to the tourney gazed upon the princess in wonder at her beauty and each swore to win so that he could marry her and board with the king suddenly the heart of the princess gave a great bound for she saw among the knights one of the poor students with whom she had been in love the knights mounted and rode in a line past the grandstand and the king stopped the poor student who had the worst horse and the poorest caparisons of any of the knights and said sir knight prithee tell me of what that marvellous shacky and rusty looking armor of thine is made oh king said the young knight seeing that we are about to engage in a big fight i would call it scrap iron wouldn t you ods bodkins said the king the youth hath a pretty wit about this time the princess ostla who began to feel better at the sight of her lover slipped a piece of gum into her mouth and closed her teeth upon it and even smiled a little and showed the beautiful pearls with which her mouth was set whereupon as soon as the knights perceived this of them went over to the king s treasurer and settled for their horse feed and went home it seems very hard said the princess that i cannot marry when i chews but two of the knights were left one of them being the princess lover here s enough for a fight anyhow said the king come hither o knights will ye joust for the hand of this fair lady we joust will said the knights the two knights fought for two hours and at length the princess lover prevailed and stretched the other upon the ground the victorious knight made his horse caracole before the king and bowed low in his saddle on the princess ostla s cheeks was a rosy flush in her eyes the light of excitement vied with the soft glow of love her lips were parted her lovely hair unbound and she grasped the arms of her chair and leaned forward with heaving bosom and happy smile to hear the words of her lover you have foughten well sir knight said the king and if there is any boon you crave you have but to name it then said the knight i will ask you this i have bought the patent rights in your kingdom for schneider s celebrated monkey wrench and i want a letter from you endorsing it you shall have it said the king but i must tell you that there is not a monkey in my kingdom with a yell of rage the victorious knight threw himself on his horse and rode away at a furious gallop the king was about to speak when a horrible suspicion flashed upon him and he fell dead upon the grandstand my god he cried he has forgotten to take the princess with him a strange story from the rolling stone in the northern part of austin there once dwelt an honest family by the name of smothers the family consisted of john smothers his wife himself their little daughter five years of age and her parents making six people toward the population of the city when counted for a special write up but only three by actual count one night after supper the little girl was seized with a severe colic and john smothers hurried down town to get some medicine he never came back the little girl recovered and in time grew up to womanhood the mother grieved very much over her husband s disappearance and it was nearly three months before she married again and moved to san antonio the little girl also married in time and after a few years had rolled around she also had a little girl five years of age she still lived in the same house where they dwelt when her father had left and never returned one night by a remarkable coincidence her little girl was taken with cramp colic on the anniversary of the disappearance of john smothers who would now have been her grandfather if he had been alive and had a steady job i will go downtown and get some medicine for her said john smith for it was none other than he whom she had married no no dear john cried his wife you too might disappear forever and then forget to come back so john smith did not go and together they sat by the bedside of little pansy for that was pansy s name after a little pansy seemed to grow worse and john smith again attempted to go for medicine but his wife would not let him suddenly the door opened and an old man stooped and bent with long white hair entered the room hello here is grandpa said pansy she had recognized him before any of the others the old man drew a bottle of medicine from his pocket and gave pansy a spoonful she got well immediately i was a little late said john smothers as i waited for a street car fickle fortune or how gladys hustled from the rolling stone press me no more mr snooper said gladys vavasour smith i can never be yours you have led me to believe different gladys said bertram d snooper the setting sun was flooding with golden light the oriel windows of a magnificent mansion situated in one of the most aristocratic streets west of the brick yard bertram d snooper a poor but ambitious and talented young lawyer had just lost his first suit he had dared to aspire to the hand of gladys vavasour smith the beautiful and talented daughter of one of the oldest and proudest families in the county the bluest blood flowed in her veins her grandfather had sawed wood for the hornsbys and an aunt on her mother s side had married a man who had been kicked by general lee s mule the lines about bertram d snooper s hands and mouth were drawn tighter as he paced to and fro waiting for a reply to the question he intended to ask gladys as soon as he thought of one at last an idea occurred to him why will you not marry me he asked in an inaudible tone because said gladys firmly speaking easily with great difficulty the progression and enlightenment that the woman of to day possesses demand that the man shall bring to the marriage altar a heart and body as free from the debasing and hereditary iniquities that now no longer exist except in the chimerical imagination of enslaved custom it is as i expected said bertram wiping his heated brow on the window curtain you have been reading books besides that continued gladys ignoring the deadly charge you have no money the blood of the snoopers rose hastily and mantled the cheek of bertram d he put on his coat and moved proudly to the door stay here till i return he said i will be back in fifteen years when he had finished speaking he ceased and left the room when he had gone gladys felt an uncontrollable yearning take possession of her she said slowly rather to herself than for publication i wonder if there was any of that cold cabbage left from dinner she then left the room when she did so a dark complexioned man with black hair and gloomy desperate looking clothes came out of the fireplace where he had been concealed and stated aha i have you in my power at last bertram d snooper gladys vavasour smith shall be mine i am in the possession of secrets that not a soul in the world suspects i have papers to prove that bertram snooper is the heir to the footnote an estate famous in texas legal history it took many many years for adjustment and a large part of the property was of course consumed as expenses of litigation tom bean estate and i have discovered that gladys grandfather who sawed wood for the hornsby s was also a cook in major rhoads fisher s command during the war therefore the family repudiate her and she will marry me in order to drag their proud name down in the dust ha ha ha as the reader has doubtless long ago discovered this man was no other than henry r grasty mr grasty then proceeded to gloat some more and then with a sardonic laugh left for new york fifteen years have elapsed of course our readers will understand that this is only supposed to the the case it really took less than a minute to make the little stars that represent an interval of time we could not afford to stop a piece in the middle and wait fifteen years before continuing it we hope this explanation will suffice we are careful not to create any wrong impressions gladys vavasour smith and henry r grasty stood at the marriage altar mr grasty had evidently worked his rabbit s foot successfully although he was quite a while in doing so just as the preacher was about to pronounce the fatal words on which he would have realized ten dollars and had the laugh on mr grasty the steeple of the church fell off and bertram d snooper entered the preacher fell to the ground with a dull thud he could ill afford to lose ten dollars he was hastily removed and a cheaper one secured bertram d snooper held a statesman in his hand aha he said i thought i would surprise you i just got in this morning here is a paper noticing my arrival he handed it to henry r grasty mr grasty looked at the paper and turned deadly pale it was dated three weeks after mr snooper s arrival foiled again he hissed speak bertram d snooper said gladys why have you come between me and henry i have just discovered that i am the sole heir to tom bean s estate and am worth two million dollars with a glad cry gladys threw herself in bertram s arms henry r grasty drew from his breast pocket a large tin box and opened it took therefrom pages of closely written foolscap what you say is true mr snooper but i ask you to read that he said handing it to bertram snooper mr snooper had no sooner read the document than he uttered a piercing shriek and bit off a large chew of tobacco all is lost he said what is that document asked gladys governor hogg s message it is not as bad as that said bertram but it deprives me of my entire fortune but i care not for that gladys since i have won you what is it speak i implore you said gladys those papers said henry r grasty are the proofs of my appointment as administrator of the tom bean estate with a loving cry gladys threw herself in henry r grasty s arms twenty minutes later bertram d snooper was seen deliberately to enter a beer saloon on seventeenth street an apology this appeared in the rolling stone shortly before it suspended publication never to resume the person who sweeps the office translates letters from foreign countries deciphers communications from graduates of business colleges and does most of the writing for this paper has been confined for the past two weeks to the under side of a large red quilt with a joint caucus of la grippe and measles we have missed two issues of the rolling stone and are now slightly convalescent for which we desire to apologize and express our regrets everybody s term of subscription will be extended enough to cover all missed issues and we hope soon to report that the goose remains suspended at a favorable altitude people who have tried to run a funny paper and entertain a congregation of large piebald measles at the same time will understand something of the tact finesse and hot sassafras tea required to do so we expect to get out the paper regularly from this time on but are forced to be very careful as improper treatment and deleterious after effects of measles combined with the high price of paper and presswork have been known to cause a relapse any one not getting their paper regularly will please come down and see about it bringing with them a ham or any little delicacy relished by invalids lord oakhurst s curse this story was sent to dr beall of greensboro n c in a letter in and so is one of o henry s earliest attempts at writing i lord oakhurst lay dying in the oak chamber in the eastern wing of oakhurst castle through the open window in the calm of the summer evening came the sweet fragrance of the early violets and budding trees and to the dying man it seemed as if earth s loveliness and beauty were never so apparent as on this bright june day his last day of life his young wife whom he loved with a devotion and strength that the presence of the king of terrors himself could not alter moved about the apartment weeping and sorrowful sometimes arranging the sick man s pillow and inquiring of him in low mournful tones if anything could be done to give him comfort and again with stifled sobs eating some chocolate caramels which she carried in the pocket of her apron the servants went to and fro with that quiet and subdued tread which prevails in a house where death is an expected guest and even the crash of broken china and shivered glass which announced their approach seemed to fall upon the ear with less violence and sound than usual lord oakhurst was thinking of days gone by when he wooed and won his beautiful young wife who was then but a charming and innocent girl how clearly and minutely those scenes rose up at the call of his memory he seemed to be standing once more beneath the old chestnut grove where they had plighted their troth in the twilight under the stars while the rare fragrance of the june roses and the smell of supper came gently by on the breeze there he had told her his love how that his whole happiness and future joy lay in the hope that he might win her for a bride that if she would trust her future to his care the devotedness of his lifetime should be hers and his only thought would be to make her life one long day of sunshine and peanut candy how plainly he remembered how she had with girlish shyness and coyness at first hesitated and murmured something to herself about an old bald beaded galoot but when he told her that to him life without her would be a blasted mockery and that his income was a year she threw herself on to him and froze there with the tenacity of a tick on a brindled cow and said with tears of joy hen ery i am thine and now he was dying in a few short hours his spirit would rise up at the call of the destroyer and quitting his poor weak earthly frame would go forth into that dim and dreaded unknown land and solve with certainty that mystery which revealeth itself not to mortal man ii a carriage drove rapidly up the avenue and stopped at the door sir everhard fitzarmond the famous london physician who had been telegraphed for alighted and quickly ascended the marble steps lady oakhurst met him at the door her lovely face expressing great anxiety and grief oh sir everhard i am so glad you have come he seems to be sinking rapidly did you bring the cream almonds i mentioned in the telegram sir everhard did not reply but silently handed her a package and slipping a couple of cloves into his mouth ascended the stairs that led to lord oakhurst s apartment lady oakhurst followed sir everhard approached the bedside of his patient and laid his hand gently on this sick man s diagnosis a shade of feeling passed over his professional countenance as lie gravely and solemnly pronounced these words madam your husband has croaked lady oakhurst at first did not comprehend his technical language and her lovely mouth let up for a moment on the cream almonds but soon his meaning flashed upon her and she seized an axe that her husband was accustomed to keep by his bedside to mangle his servants with and struck open lord oakhurst s cabinet containing his private papers and with eager hands opened the document which she took therefrom then with a wild unearthly shriek that would have made a steam piano go out behind a barn and kick itself in despair she fell senseless to the floor sir everhard fitzarmond picked up the paper and read its contents it was lord oakhurst s will bequeathing all his property to a scientific institution which should have for its object the invention of a means for extracting peach brandy from sawdust sir everhard glanced quickly around the room no one was in sight dropping the will he rapidly transferred some valuable ornaments and rare specimens of gold and silver filigree work from the centre table to his pockets and rang the bell for the servants iii the curse sir everhard fitzarmond descended the stairway of oakhurst castle and passed out into the avenue that led from the doorway to the great iron gates of the park lord oakhurst had been a great sportsman during his life and always kept a well stocked kennel of curs which now rushed out from their hiding places and with loud yelps sprang upon the physician burying their fangs in his lower limbs and seriously damaging his apparel sir everllard startled out of his professional dignity and usual indifference to human suffering by the personal application of feeling gave vent to a most horrible and blighting curse and ran with great swiftness to his carriage and drove off toward the city bexar scrip no from the rolling stone saturday march whenever you visit austin you should by all means go to see the general land office as you pass up the avenue you turn sharp round the corner of the court house and on a steep hill before you you see a medieval castle you think of the rhine the castled crag of drachenfels the lorelei and the vine clad slopes of germany and german it is in every line of its architecture and design the plan was drawn by an old draftsman from the vaterland whose heart still loved the scenes of his native land and it is said he reproduced the design of a certain castle near his birthplace with remarkable fidelity under the present administration a new coat of paint has vulgarized its ancient and venerable walls modern tiles have replaced the limestone slabs of its floors worn in hollows by the tread of thousands of feet and smart and gaudy fixtures have usurped the place of the time worn furniture that has been consecrated by the touch of hands that texas will never cease to honor but even now when you enter the building you lower your voice and time turns backward for you for the atmosphere which you breathe is cold with the exudation of buried generations the building is stone with a coating of concrete the walls are immensely thick it is cool in the summer and warm in the winter it is isolated and sombre standing apart from the other state buildings sullen and decaying brooding on the past twenty years ago it was much the same as now twenty years from now the garish newness will be worn off and it will return to its appearance of gloomy decadence people living in other states can form no conception of the vastness and importance of the work performed and the significance of the millions of records and papers composing the archives of this office the title deeds patents transfers and legal documents connected with every foot of land owned in the state of texas are filed here volumes could be filled with accounts of the knavery the double dealing the cross purposes the perjury the lies the bribery the alteration and erasing the suppressing and destroying of papers the various schemes and plots that for the sake of the almighty dollar have left their stains upon the records of the general land office no reference is made to the employees no more faithful competent and efficient force of men exists in the clerical portions of any government but there is or was for their day is now over a class of land speculators commonly called land sharks unscrupulous and greedy who have left their trail in every department of this office in the shape of titles destroyed patents cancelled homes demolished and torn away forged transfers and lying affidavits before the modern tiles were laid upon the floors there were deep hollows in the limestone slabs worn by the countless feet that daily trod uneasily through its echoing corridors pressing from file room to business room from commissioner s sanctum to record books and back again the honest but ignorant settler bent on saving the little plot of land he called home elbowed the wary land shark who was searching the records for evidence to oust him the lordly cattle baron relying on his influence and money stood at the commissioner s desk side by side with the preemptor whose little potato patch lay like a minute speck of island in the vast billowy sea of his princely pastures and played the old game of freeze out which is as old as cain and abel the trail of the serpent is through it all honest earnest men have wrought for generations striving to disentangle the shameful coil that certain years of fraud and infamy have wound look at the files and see the countless endorsements of those in authority transfer doubtful locked up certificate a forgery locked up signature a forgery patent refused duplicate patented elsewhere field notes forged certificates stolen from office and soon ad infinitum the record books spread upon long tables in the big room upstairs are open to the examination of all open them and you will find the dark and greasy finger prints of half a century s handling the quick hand of the land grabber has fluttered the leaves a million times the damp clutch of the perturbed tiller of the soil has left traces of his calling on the ragged leaves interest centres in the file room this is a large room built as a vault fireproof and entered by but a single door there is no admission on the portal and the precious files are handed out by a clerk in charge only on presentation of an order signed by the commissioner or chief clerk in years past too much laxity prevailed in its management and the files were handled by all corners simply on their request and returned at their will or not at all in these days most of the mischief was done in the file room there are about files each in a paper wrapper and comprising the title papers of a particular tract of land you ask the clerk in charge for the papers relating to any survey in texas they are arranged simply in districts and numbers he disappears from the door you hear the sliding of a tin box the lid snaps and the file is in your hand go up there some day and call for bexar scrip no the file clerk stares at you for a second says shortly out of file it has been missing twenty years the history of that file has never been written before twenty years ago there was a shrewd land agent living in austin who devoted his undoubted talents and vast knowledge of land titles and the laws governing them to the locating of surveys made by illegal certificates or improperly made and otherwise of no value through non compliance with the statutes or whatever flaws his ingenious and unscrupulous mind could unearth he found a fatal defect in the title of the land as on file in bexar scrip no and placed a new certificate upon the survey in his own name the law was on his side every sentiment of justice of right and humanity was against him the certificate by virtue of which the original survey had been made was missing it was not be found in the file and no memorandum or date on the wrapper to show that it had ever been filed under the law the land was vacant unappropriated public domain and open to location the land was occupied by a widow and her only son and she supposed her title good the railroad had surveyed a new line through the property and it had doubled in value sharp the land agent did not communicate with her in any way until he had filed his papers rushed his claim through the departments and into the patent room for patenting then he wrote her a letter offering her the choice of buying from him or vacating at once he received no reply one day he was looking through some files and came across the missing certificate some one probably an employee of the office had by mistake after making some examination placed it in the wrong file and curiously enough another inadvertence in there being no record of its filing on the wrapper had completed the appearance of its having never been filed sharp called for the file in which it belonged and scrutinized it carefully fearing he might have overlooked some endorsement regarding its return to the office on the back of the certificate was plainly endorsed the date of filing according to law and signed by the chief clerk if this certificate should be seen by the examining clerk his own claim when it came up for patenting would not be worth the paper on which it was written sharp glanced furtively around a young man or rather a boy about eighteen years of age stood a few feet away regarding him closely with keen black eyes sharp a little confused thrust the certificate into the file where it properly belonged and began gathering up the other papers the boy came up and leaned on the desk beside him a right interesting office sir he said i have never been in here before all those papers now they are about lands are they not the titles and deeds and such things yes said sharp they are supposed to contain all the title papers this one now said the boy taking up bexar scrip no what land does this represent the title of ah i see six hundred and forty acres in b country absalom harris original grantee please tell me i am so ignorant of these things how can you tell a good survey from a bad one i am told that there are a great many illegal and fraudulent surveys in this office i suppose this one is all right no said sharp the certificate is missing it is invalid that paper i just saw you place in that file i suppose is something else field notes or a transfer probably yes said sharp hurriedly corrected field notes excuse me i am a little pressed for time the boy was watching him with bright alert eyes it would never do to leave the certificate in the file but he could not take it out with that inquisitive boy watching him he turned to the file room with a dozen or more files in his hands and accidentally dropped part of them on the floor as he stooped to pick them up he swiftly thrust bexar scrip no in the inside breast pocket of his coat this happened at just half past four o clock and when the file clerk took the files he threw them in a pile in his room came out and locked the door the clerks were moving out of the doors in long straggling lines it was closing time sharp did not desire to take the file from the land office the boy might have seen him place the file in his pocket and the penalty of the law for such an act was very severe some distance back from the file room was the draftsman s room now entirely vacated by its occupants sharp dropped behind the outgoing stream of men and slipped slyly into this room the clerks trooped noisily down the iron stairway singing whistling and talking below the night watchman awaited their exit ready to close and bar the two great doors to the south and cast it is his duty to take careful note each day that no one remains in the building after the hour of closing sharp waited until all sounds had ceased it was his intention to linger until everything was quiet and then to remove the certificate from the file and throw the latter carelessly on some draftsman s desk as if it had been left there during the business of the day he knew also that he must remove the certificate from the office or destroy it as the chance finding of it by a clerk would lead to its immediately being restored to its proper place and the consequent discovery that his location over the old survey was absolutely worthless as he moved cautiously along the stone floor the loud barking of the little black dog kept by the watchman told that his sharp ears had heard the sounds of his steps the great hollow rooms echoed loudly move as lightly as he could sharp sat down at a desk and laid the file before him in all his queer practices and cunning tricks he had not yet included any act that was downright criminal he had always kept on the safe side of the law but in the deed he was about to commit there was no compromise to be made with what little conscience he had left there is no well defined boundary line between honesty and dishonesty the frontiers of one blend with the outside limits of the other and he who attempts to tread this dangerous ground may be sometimes in one domain and sometimes in the other so the only safe road is the broad highway that leads straight through and has been well defined by line and compass sharp was a man of what is called high standing in the community that is his word in a trade was as good as any man s his check was as good as so much cash and so regarded he went to church regularly went in good society and owed no man anything he was regarded as a sure winner in any land trade he chose to make but that was his occupation the act he was about to commit now would place him forever in the ranks of those who chose evil for their portion if it was found out more than that it would rob a widow and her son of property soon to be of great value which if not legally theirs was theirs certainly by every claim of justice but he had gone too far to hesitate his own survey was in the patent room for patenting his own title was about to be perfected by the state s own hand the certificate must be destroyed he leaned his head on his hands for a moment and as he did so a sound behind him caused his heart to leap with guilty fear but before he could rise a hand came over his shoulder and grasped the file he rose quickly as white as paper rattling his chair loudly on the stone floor the boy who land spoken to him earlier stood contemplating him with contemptuous and flashing eyes and quietly placed the file in the left breast pocket of his coat so mr sharp by nature as well as by name he said it seems that i was right in waiting behind the door in order to see you safely out you will appreciate the pleasure i feel in having done so when i tell you my name is harris my mother owns the land on which you have filed and if there is any justice in texas she shall hold it i am not certain but i think i saw you place a paper in this file this afternoon and it is barely possible that it may be of value to me i was also impressed with the idea that you desired to remove it again but had not the opportunity anyway i shall keep it until to morrow and let the commissioner decide far back among mr sharp s ancestors there must have been some of the old berserker blood for his caution his presence of mind left him and left him possessed of a blind devilish unreasoning rage that showed itself in a moment in the white glitter of his eye give me that file boy he said thickly holding out his hand i am no such fool mr sharp said the youth this file shall be laid before the commissioner to morrow for examination if he finds help help sharp was upon him like a tiger and bore him to the floor the boy was strong and vigorous but the suddenness of the attack gave him no chance to resist he struggled up again to his feet but it was an animal with blazing eyes and cruel looking teeth that fought him instead of a man mr sharp a man of high standing and good report was battling for his reputation presently there was a dull sound and another and still one more and a blade flashing white and then red and edward harris dropped down like some stuffed effigy of a man that boys make for sport with his limbs all crumpled and lax on the stone floor of the land office the old watchman was deaf and heard nothing the little dog barked at the foot of the stairs until his master made him come into his room sharp stood there for several minutes holding in his hand his bloody clasp knife listening to the cooing of the pigeons on the roof and the loud ticking of the clock above the receiver s desk a map rustled on the wall and his blood turned to ice a rat ran across some strewn papers and his scalp prickled and he could scarcely moisten his dry lips with his tongue between the file room and the draftsman s room there is a door that opens on a small dark spiral stairway that winds from the lower floor to the ceiling at the top of the house this stairway was not used then nor is it now it is unnecessary inconvenient dusty and dark as night and was a blunder of the architect who designed the building this stairway ends above at the tent shaped space between the roof and the joists that space is dark and forbidding and being useless is rarely visited sharp opened this door and gazed for a moment up this narrow cobwebbed stairway after dark that night a man opened cautiously one of the lower windows of the land office crept out with great circumspection and disappeared in the shadows one afternoon a week after this time sharp lingered behind again after the clerks had left and the office closed the next morning the first comers noticed a broad mark in the dust on the upstairs floor and the same mark was observed below stairs near a window it appeared as if some heavy and rather bulky object had been dragged along through the limestone dust a memorandum book with e harris written on the flyleaf was picked up on the stairs but nothing particular was thought of any of these signs circulars and advertisements appeared for a long time in the papers asking for information concerning edward harris who left his mother s home on a certain date and had never been heard of since after a while these things were succeeded by affairs of more recent interest and faded from the public mind sharp died two years ago respected and regretted the last two years of his life were clouded with a settled melancholy for which his friends could assign no reason the bulk of his comfortable fortune was made from the land he obtained by fraud and crime the disappearance of the file was a mystery that created some commotion in the land office but he got his patent it is a well known tradition in austin and vicinity that there is a buried treasure of great value somewhere on the banks of shoal creek about a mile west of the city three young men living in austin recently became possessed of what they thought was a clue of the whereabouts of the treasure and thursday night they repaired to the place after dark and plied the pickaxe and shovel with great diligence for about three hours at the end of that time their efforts were rewarded by the finding of a box buried about four feet below the surface which they hastened to open the light of a lantern disclosed to their view the fleshless bones of a human skeleton with clothing still wrapping its uncanny limbs they immediately left the scene and notified the proper authorities of their ghastly find on closer examination in the left breast pocket of the skeleton s coat there was found a flat oblong packet of papers cut through and through in three places by a knife blade and so completely soaked and clotted with blood that it had become an almost indistinguishable mass with the aid of a microscope and the exercise of a little imagination this

to the pied cool sward on a dead tree branch sings the saddest bard of the birds that be tis the lone pewee its note is a sob and its note is pitched in a single key like a soul bewitched to a mournful minstrelsy pewee pewee doth it ever cry a sad sweet minor threnody that threads the aisles of the dim hot grove like a tale of a wrong or a vanished love and the fancy comes that the wee dun bird perchance was a maid and her heart was stirred by some lover s rhyme in a golden time and broke when the world turned false and cold and her dreams grew dark and her faith grew cold in some fairy far off clime and her soul crept into the pewee s breast and forever she cries with a strange unrest for something lost in the afternoon for something missed from the lavish june for the heart that died in the long ago for the livelong pain that pierceth so thus the pewee cries while the evening lies steeped in the languorous still sunshine rapt to the leaf and the bough rind the vine of some hopeless paradise you can tell your paper the great man said i refused an interview i have nothing to say on the question sir nothing to say to you and then he talked till the sun went down and the chickens went to roost and he seized the collar of the poor young man and never his hold he loosed and the sun went down and the moon came up and he talked till the dawn of day though he said on this

swim by i shudder when the crane strikes at his prey i turn to fly at drops of sudden rain in every little cry of bird i hear a tracking shout from every sodden leaf that s stirred i see a face frown out my soul shakes when the water rat cowed by the blue snake flies black knots from tree holes glimmer at me with accusive eyes through all the murky silence rings a cry not born of earth an endless deep unechoing thing that owns not human birth i see no colors in the sky save red as blood is red i pray to god to still that cry from pallid lips and dead one spot in all that stagnant waste i shun as moles shun light and turn my prow to make all haste to fly before the night a poisonous mound hid from the sun where crabs hold revelry where eels and fishes feed upon the thing that once was he at night i steal along the shore within my hut i creep but awful stars blink through the door to hold me from my sleep the river gurgles like his throat in little choking coves and loudly dins that phantom note from out the awful groves i shout with laughter through the night i rage in greatest glee my fears all vanish with the light oh splendid nights they be i see her weep she calls his name he answers not nor will my soul with joy is all aflame i laugh and laugh and thrill i count her teardrops as they fall i flout my daytime fears i mumble thanks to god for all these gibes and happy

ranch november to mrs hall letter to mrs hall a friend back in north carolina this is one of the earliest letters found dear mrs hall as i have not heard from you since the shout you gave when you set out from the station on your way home i guess you have not received some seven or eight letters from me and hence your silence the mails are so unreliable that they may all have been lost if you don t get this you had better send to washington and get them to look over the dead letter office for the others i have nothing to tell you of any interest except that we all nearly froze to death last night thermometer away below degrees in the shade all night you ought by all means to come back to texas this winter you would love it more and more that same little breeze that you looked for so anxiously last summer is with us now as cold as callum bros suppose their soda water to be my sheep are doing finely they never were in better condition they give me very little trouble for i have never been able to see one of them yet i will proceed to give you all the news about this ranch dick has got his new house well under way the pet lamb is doing finely and i take the cake for cooking mutton steak and fine gravy the chickens are doing mighty well the garden produces magnificent prickly pears and grass onions are worth two for five cents and mr haynes has shot a mexican please send by express to this ranch cooks and washwomen blind or wooden legged ones perferred the climate has a tendency to make them walk off every two or three days which must be overcome ed brockman has quit the store and i think is going to work for lee among the cows wears a red sash and swears so fluently that he has been mistaken often for a member of the texas legislature if you see dr beall bow to him for me politely but distantly he refuses to waste a line upon me i suppose he is too much engaged in courting to write any letters give dr hall my profoundest regards i think about him invariably whenever he is occupying my thoughts influenced by the contents of the bugle there is an impression general at this ranch that you are president secretary and committee c of the various associations of fruit fairs sewing societies church fairs presbytery general assembly conference medical conventions and baby shows that go to make up the glory and renown of north carolina in general and while i heartily congratulate the aforesaid institutions on their having such a zealous and efficient officer i tremble lest their requirements leave you not time to favor me with a letter in reply to this and assure you that if you would so honor me i would highly appreciate the effort i would rather have a good long letter from you than many bugles in your letter be certain to refer as much as possible to the advantages of civilized life over the barbarous you might mention the theatres you see there the nice things you eat warm fires niggers to cook and bring in wood a special reference to nice beef steak would be advisable you know our being reminded of these luxuries makes us contented and happy when we hear of you people at home eating turkeys and mince pies and getting drunk christmas and having a fine time generally we become more and more reconciled to this country and would not leave it for anything i must close now as i must go and dress for the opera write soon yours very truly w s porter to dr w p beall dr beall of greensboro n c was one of young porter s dearest friends between them there was an almost regular correspondence during porter s first years in texas la salle county texas december dear doctor i send you a play a regular high art full orchestra gilt edged drama i send it to you because of old acquaintance and as a revival of old associations was i not ever ready in times gone by to generously furnish a spatula and other assistance when you did buy the succulent watermelon and was it not by my connivance and help that you did oft from the gentle oscar mayo skates entice but i digress i think that i have so concealed the identity of the characters introduced that no one will be able to place them as they all appear under fictitious names although i admit that many of the incidents and scenes were suggested by actual experiences of the author in your city you will of course introduce the play upon the stage if proper arrangements can be made i have not yet had an opportunity of ascertaining whether edwin booth john mccullough or henry irving can be secured however i will leave all such matters to your judgment and taste some few suggestions i will make with regard to the mounting of the piece which may be of value to you discrimination will be necessary in selecting a fit person to represent the character of bill slax the tramp the part is that of a youth of great beauty and noble manners temporarily under a cloud and is generally rather difficult to fill properly the other minor characters such as damfools citizens police customers countrymen c can be very easily supplied especially the first let it be announced in the patriot for several days that in front of benbow hall at a certain hour a man will walk a tight rope seventy feet from the ground who has never made the attempt before that the exhibition will be free and that the odds are to that the man will be killed a large crowd will gather then let the guilford grays charge one side the reidsville light infantry the other with fixed bayonets and a man with a hat commence taking up a collection in the rear by this means they can be readily driven into the hall and the door locked i have studied a long time about devising a plan for obtaining pay from the audience and have finally struck upon the only feasible one i think after the performance let some one come out on the stage and announce that james forbis will speak two hours the result easily explainable by philosophical and psychological reasons will be as follows the minds of the audience elated and inspired by the hope of immediate departure when confronted by such a terror inspiring and dismal prospect will collapse with the fearful reaction which will take place and for a space of time they will remain in a kind of comatose farewell vain world condition now as this is the time when the interest of the evening is at its highest pitch let the melodious strains of the orchestra steal forth as a committee appointed by the managers of lawyers druggists doctors and revenue officers go around and relieve the audience of the price of admission for each one where one person has no money let it be made up from another but on no account let the whole sum taken be more than the just amount at usual rates as i said before the characters in the play are purely imaginary and therefore not to be confounded with real persons but lest any one feeling some of the idiosyncrasies and characteristics apply too forcibly to his own high moral and irreproachable self should allow his warlike and combative spirits to arise you might as you go kind of casually like produce the impression that i rarely miss my aim with a colt s forty five but if that does not have the effect of quieting the splenetic individual and be still thirsts for bill slax s gore just inform him that if he comes out here he can t get any whiskey within two days journey of my present abode and water will have to be his only beverage while on the warpath this i am sure will avert the bloody and direful conflict accept my lasting regards and professions of respect ever yours bill slax to dr w p beall my dear doctor i wish you a happy c and all that sort of thing don t you know c c i send you a few little productions in the way of poetry c which of course were struck off in an idle moment some of the pictures are not good likenesses and so i have not labelled them which you may do as fast as you discover whom they represent as some of them resemble others more than themselves but the poems are good without exception and will compare favorably with baron alfred s latest on spring i have just come from a hunt in which i mortally wounded a wild hog and as my boots are full of thorns i can t write any longer than this paper will contain for it s all i ve got because i m too tired to write any more for the reason that i have no news to tell i see by the patriot that you are superintendent of public health and assure you that all such upward rise as you make like that will ever be witnessed with interest and pleasure by me c c give my regards to dr and mrs hall it would be uncomplimentary to your powers of perception as well as superfluous to say that i will now close and remain yours truly w s porter to dr w p beall la salle county texas february my dear doctor your appreciated epistle of the th received i was very glad to hear from you i hope to hear again if such irrelevant correspondence will not interfere with your duties as public health eradicator which i believe is the office you hold under county authority i supposed the very dramatic shakespearian comedy to be the last as i heard nothing from you previous before your letter and was about to write another of a more exciting character introducing several bloody single combats a dynamite explosion a ladies oyster supper for charitable purposes c also comprising some mysterious sub rosa transactions known only to myself and a select few new songs and dances and the greensboro poker club having picked up a few points myself relative to this latter amusement i feel competent to give a lucid glittering portrait of the scenes presented under its auspices but if the former drama has reached you safely i will refrain from burdening you any more with the labors of general stage manager c if long hair part of a sombrero mexican spurs c would make a fellow famous i already occupy a topmost niche in the temple frame if my wild untamed aspect had not been counteracted by my well known benevolent and amiable expression of countenance i would have been arrested long ago by the rangers on general suspicions of murder and horse stealing in fact i owe all my present means of lugubrious living to my desperate and bloodthirsty appearance combined with the confident and easy way in which i tackle a winchester rifle there is a gentleman who lives about fifteen miles from the ranch who for amusement and recreation and not altogether without an eye to the profit keeps a general merchandise store this gent for the first few months has been trying very earnestly to sell me a little paper which i would like much to have but am not anxious to purchase said paper is my account receipted occasionally he is absent and the welcome news coming to my ear i mount my fiery boss and gallop wildly up to the store enter with something of the sang froid grace abandon and recherche nonchalance with which charles yates ushers ladies and gentlemen to their seats in the opera house and nervously fingering my butcher knife fiercely demand goods and chattels of the clerk this plan always succeeds this is by way of explanation of this vast and unnecessary stationery of which this letter is composed i am always in too big a hurry to demur at kind and quality but when i get to town i will write you on small gilt edged paper that would suit even the fastidious and discriminating taste of a logan when i get to the city which will be shortly i will send you some account of this country and its inmates you are right i have almost forgotten what a regular old gum chewing ice cream destroying opera ticket vortex ivory clawing girl looks like last summer a very fair specimen of this kind ranged over about fort snell and i used to ride over twice a week on mail days and chew the end of my riding whip while she stood on the bridge and gathered up shells on the sea shore and wore the golden slippers but she has vamoosed and my ideas on the subject are again growing dim if you see anybody about to start to texas to live especially to this part if you will take your scalpyouler and sever the jugular vein cut the brachiopod artery and hamstring him after he knows what you have done for him he will rise and call you blessed this country is a silent but eloquent refutation of bob ingersoll s theory a man here gets prematurely insane melancholy and unreliable and finally dies of lead poisoning in his boots while in a good old land like greensboro a man can die as they do every day with all the benefits of the clergy w s porter austin texas april dear dave i take my pen in hand to let you know that i am well and hope these few lines will find you as well as can be expected i carried out your parting injunction of a floral nature with all the solemnity and sacredness that i would have bestowed upon a dying man s last request promptly at half past three i repaired to the robbers den commonly known as radams horticultural and vegetable emporium and secured the high priced offerings according to promise i asked if the bouquets were ready and the polite but piratical gentleman in charge pointed proudly to two objects on the counter reposing in a couple of vases and said they were i then told him i feared there was some mistake as no buttonhole bouquets had been ordered but he insisted on his former declaration and so i brought them away and sent them to their respective destinations i thought it a pity to spoil a good deck of cards by taking out only one so i bundled up the whole deck and inserted them in the bouquet but finally concluded it would not be right to violet joke my promise and i rose joke superior to such a mean trick and sent only one as directed i have a holiday to day as it is san jacinto day thermopylae had its messenger of defeat but the alamo had none mr president and fellow citizens those glorious heroes who fell for their country on the bloody field of san jacinto etc there is a bazaar to night in

we will see you soon yours as ever w s p austin texas april dear dave i received your letter in answer to mine which you never got till sometime after you had written i snatch a few moments from my arduous labors to reply the colorado has been on the biggest boom i have seen since in the pyrotechnical and not strictly grammatical language of the statesman the cruel devastating flood swept on a dreadful holocaust of swollen turbid waters surging and dashing in mad fury which have never been equalled in human history a pitiable sight was seen the morning after the flood six hundred men out of employment were seen standing on the banks of the river gazing at the rushing stream laden with debris of every description a wealthy new york banker who was present noticing the forlorn appearance of these men at once began to collect a subscription for them appealing in eloquent terms for help for these poor sufferers by the flood he collected one dollar and five horn buttons the dollar he had given himself he learned on inquiry that these men had not been at any employment in six years and all they had lost by the flood was a few fishing poles the banker put his dollar in his pocket and stepped up to the pearl saloon as you will see by this morning s paper there is to be a minstrel show next wednesday for benefit of austin grays i attended the rehearsal last night but am better this morning and the doctor thinks i will pull through with careful attention the jokes are mostly mildewed rockribbed and ancient as the sun i can give you no better idea of the tout ensemble and sine die of the affair than to state that scuddy is going to sing a song mrs harrell brought a lot of crystallized fruits from new orleans for you she wants to know if she shall send them around on bois d arc or keep them til you return answer write to your father he thinks you are leaving him out writing to everybody else first write we have the boss trick here now have sold about ten boxes of cigars

on top of them you lay a small die with the six up that will fit easily in the hole without being noticed you lay the four nickels over this and all presents the appearance of a stack of nickels you do all this privately so everybody will suppose it is nothing but a stack of five cent pieces you then lay another small die on top of the stack with the ace up you have a small tin cup shaped like this illustration made for the purpose you let everybody see the ace and then say you propose to turn the ace into a six you lay the tin cup carefully over the stack this way and feel around in your pocket for a pencil and not finding one the rest of this letter is lost austin texas may dear dave i received your two letters and have commenced two or three in reply but always failed to say what i wanted to and destroyed them all i heard from joe that you would probably remain in colorado i hope you will succeed in making a good thing out of it if you conclude to do so but would like to see you back again in austin if there is anything i can do for you here let me know town is fearfully dull except for the frequent raids of the servant girl annihilators who make things lively during the dead hours of the night if it were not for them items of interest would be very scarce as you may see by the statesman our serenading party has developed new and alarming modes of torture for our helpless and sleeping victims last thursday night we loaded up a small organ on a hack and with our other usual instruments made an assault upon the quiet air of midnight that made the atmosphere turn pale after going the rounds we were halted on the avenue by fritz hartkopf and ordered into his salon we went in carrying the organ etc a large crowd of bums immediately gathered prominent among which were to be seen percy james theodore hillyer randolph burmond charlie hicks and after partaking freely of lemonade we wended our way down and were duly halted and treated in the same manner by other hospitable gentlemen we were called in at several places while wit and champagne rhein wine etc flowed in a most joyous and hilarious manner it was one of the most recherche and per diem affairs ever known in the city nothing occurred to mar the pleasure of the hour except a trifling incident that might be construed as malapropos and post meridian by the hypercritical mr charles sims on attempting to introduce mr charles hicks and your humble servant to young ladies where we had been invited inside forgot our names and required to be informed on the subject before proceeding yours w s p austin texas december dear dave everything wept at your departure especially the clouds last night the clouds had a silver lining three dollars and a half s worth i fulfilled your engagement in grand tout ensemble style but there is a sad bon jour look about the thirty eight cents left in my vest pocket that would make a hired man weep all day long the heavens wept and the heavy sombre clouds went drifting about over head and the north wind howled in maniacal derision and the hack drivers danced on the pavements in wild fierce glee for they knew too well what the stormy day betokened the hack was to call for me at eight at five minutes to eight i went upstairs and dressed in my usual bijou and operatic style and rolled away to the opera emma sang finely i applauded at the wrong times and praised her rendering of the chromatic scale when she was performing on c flat andante pianissimo but otherwise the occasion passed off without anything to mar the joyousness of the hour everybody was there isidor moses and john ireland and fritz hartkopf and prof herzog and bill stacy and all the bong ton elight you will receive a draft to day through the first national bank of colorado for which

calliope six handed euchre grover cleveland hill city quartette johnson an early parable in one of his early letters written from austin o henry wrote a long parable that was evidently to tell his correspondent some of the local gossip here it is once upon a time there was a maiden in a land not fax away a maiden of much beauty and rare accomplishments she was beloved by all on account of her goodness of heart and her many charms of disposition her father was a great lord rich and powerful and a mighty man and he loved his daughter with exceeding great love and he cared for her with jealous and loving watchfulness lest any harm should befall her or even the least discomfort should mar her happiness and cause any trouble in her smooth and peaceful life the cunningest masters were engaged to teach her from her youngest days she played upon the harpsichord the loveliest and sweetest music she wrought fancy work in divers strange and wonderful forms that might puzzle all beholders as to what manner of things they might be she sang and all listeners hearkened thereunto as to the voice of an angel she danced stately minuets with the gay knights as graceful as a queen and as light as the thistledown borne above the clover blossoms by the wind she could paint upon china rare and unknown flowers the like unto which man never saw in colors crimson and blue and yellow glorious to behold she conversed in unknown tongues whereof no man knew the meaning and sense and created wild admiration in all by the ease and grace with which she did play upon a new and strange instrument of wondrous sound and structure which she called a banjo she had gone into a strange land far away beyond the rivers that flowed through her father s dominion farther than one could see from the highest castle tower up into the land of ice and snow where wise men famous for learning and ancient lore had gathered together from many lands and countries the daughters of great men kings and powerful rulers railroad men bankers mighty men who wished to bring up their children to be wise and versed in all things old and new here the princess abode for many seasons and she sat at the feet of old wise men who could tell of the world s birth and the stars and read the meaning of the forms of the rocks that make the high mountains and knew the history of all created things that are and here she learned to speak strange tongues and studied the deep mysteries of the past the secrets of the ancients chaldic lore etruscan inscription hidden and mystic sciences and knew the names of all the flowers and things that grow in fields or wood even unto the tiniest weed by the brook in due time the princess came back to her father s castle the big bell boomed from the high tower the heavy iron gates were thrown open banners floated all along the battlemented walls and in the grand hall servants and retainers hurried to and fro bearing gold dishes and great bowls of flaming smoking punch while oxen were roasted whole and hogsheads of ale tapped on the common by the castle walls and thither hied them the villagers one and all to make merry at the corning of the dear princess again she will come back so wise and learned they said so far above us that she will not notice us as she did once but not so the princess with a red rose in her hair and dressed so plain and neat that she looked more like a farmer s daughter than a great king s came down among them from her father s side with nods of love and welcome on her lips and a smile upon her face and took them by the hands as in the old days and none among them so lowly or so poor but what received a kind word from the gracious princess and carried away in their hearts glad feelings that she was still the same noble and gracious lady she always was then night came and torches by thousands lit up the great forest and musicians played and bonfires glowed with sparks flying like myriads of stars among the gloomy trees in the great castle hall were gathered the brave knights and the fairest ladies in the kingdom the jolly old king surrounded by the wise men and officers of state moved about among his guests stately and courteous ravishing music burst forth from all sides and down the hall moved the fair princess in the mazy dance on the arm of a knight who gazed upon her face in rapt devotion and love who was he that dared to look thus upon the daughter of the king sovereign prince of the kingdom and the heiress of her father s wealth and lands he had no title no proud name to place beside a royal one beyond that of an honorable knight but who says that that is not a title that borne worthily makes a man the peer of any that wears a crown he had loved her long when a boy they had roamed together in the great forest about the castle and played among the fountains of the court like brother and sister the king saw them together often and smiled and went his way and said nothing the years went on and they were together as much as they could be the summer days when the court went forth into the forest mounted on prancing steeds to chase the stags with hounds all clad in green and gold with waving plumes and shining silver and ribbons of gay colors this knight was by the princess side to guide her through the pathless swamps where the hunt ranged and saw that no harm came to her and now that she had come back after years of absence he went to her with fear lest she should have changed for her old self and would not be to him as she was when they were boy and girl together but no there was the same old kindly welcome the same smiling greeting the warm pressure of the hand the glad look in the eyes as of yore the knight s heart beat wildly and a dim new awakened hope arose in him was she too far away after all he felt worthy of her and of any one in fact but he was without riches only a knight errant with his sword for his fortune and his great love his only title and he had always refrained from ever telling her anything of his love for his pride prevented him and you know a poor girl even though she be a princess cannot say to a man i am rich but let that be no bar between us i am yours and will let my wealth pass if you will give up your pride no princess can say this and the knight s pride would not let him say anything of the kind and so you see there was small chance of their ever coming to an understanding well the feasting and dancing went on and the knight and the princess danced and sang together and walked out where the moon was making a white wonder of the great fountain and wandered under the rows of great oaks but spoke no word of love though no mortal man knows what thoughts passed in their heads and she gave long accounts of the wonders she had seen in the far icy north in the great school of wise men and the knight talked of the wild and savage men he had seen in the far west where he had been in battles with the heathen in a wild and dreary land and she heard with pity his tales of suffering and trials in the desert among wild animals and fierce human kings and inside the castle the music died away and the lights grew dim and the villagers had long since gone to their homes and the knight and the princess still talked of old times and the moon climbed high in the eastern sky one day there came news from a country far to the west where lay the possessions of the knight the enemy had robbed him of his treasure driven away his cattle and he found it was best to hie him away and rescue his inheritance and goods he buckled on his sword and mounted his good war horse he rode to the postern gate of the castle to make his adieus to the princess when he told her he was going away to the wild western country to do battle with the heathen she grew pale and her eyes took on a look of such pain and fear that the knight s heart leaped and then sank in his bosom a his pride still kept him from speaking the words that might have made all well she bade him farewell in a low voice and tears even stood in leer eyes but what could she say or do the knight put spurs to his horse and dashed away over the hills without ever looking back and the princess stood looking over the gate at him till the last sight of his plume below the brow of the hill the knight was gone many suitors flocked about the princess mighty lords and barons of great wealth were at her feet and attended her every journey they came and offered themselves and their fortunes again and again but none of them found favor in her eyes will the princess listen to no one they began to say among themselves has she given her heart to some one who is not among us no one could say a great and mighty physician young and of wondrous power in his art telephoned to her every night if he might come down how his suit prospered no one could tell but he persevered with great and astonishing diligence a powerful baron who assisted in regulating the finances of the kingdom and who was a direct descendant of a great prince who was cast into a lion s den knelt at her feet a gay and lively lord who lived in a castle hung with ribbons and streamers and gay devices of all kinds with other nobles of like character prostrated themselves before her but she would listen to none of them the princess rode about in quiet ways in the cool evenings upon a gray palfrey alone and very quiet and she seemed to grow silent and thoughtful as time went on and no news came from the western wars and the knight came not back again to his daughter

mrs hale is up in maine for a weeks vacation say bill i m sending your ms back by mail to day i kept it a little longer after you sent for it because one of the mcclure phillips firm wanted to see it first everybody says it is full of good stuff but thinks it should be put in a more connected shape by some skilful writer who has been trained to that sort work it seems to me that you ought to do better with it out there than you could here if you can get somebody out there to publish it it ought to sell all right n y is a pretty cold proposition and it can t see as far as the oklahoma country when it is looking for sales how about trying indianapolis or chicago duffy told me about the other ms sent out by your friend abbott kind of a bum friendly trick wasn t it why don t you get arizona s hand done and send it on seems to me you could handle a short story all right my regards to mrs jennings and bro frank write some more still bill dear jennings n y may got your letter all right hope

let me know in advance a day or two gallot is in grand rapids maybe he will run over for a day or two in haste and truly yours w s p it was hard to get o henry to take an interest in his books he was always eager to be at the undone work to be writing a new story instead of collecting old ones this letter came from north carolina it shows how much thought he gave always to titles land o the sky monday my dear colonel steger as i wired you to day i like man about town for a title but i am sending in a few others for you to look at and if any other suits you better i m agreeable here they are in preferred order the venturers transfers merry go rounds babylonica brickdust from babel babes in the jungle if none of these hit you right let me know and i ll get busy again but i think man about town is about the right thing it gives the city idea without using the old hackneyed words i am going to write you a letter in a day or so touchin on and appertainin to other matters and topics i am still improving and feeling pretty good colonel bingham has put in a new ash sifter and expects you to come down and see that it works all right all send regards to you you seem to have made quite a hit down here for a yankee salutations and good wishes yours s p this letter was found unfinished among his papers after his death his publishers had discussed many times his writing of a novel but the following letter constitutes the only record of his own opinions in the matter the date is surely or my dear mr steger my idea is to write the story of a man an individual not a type but a man who at the same time i want to represent a human nature type if such a person could exist the story will teach no lesson inculcate no moral advance no theory i want it to be something that it won t or can t be but as near as i can make it the true record of a man s thoughts his description of his mischances and adventures his true opinions of life as he has seen it and his absolutely honest deductions comments and views upon the different phases of life that he passes through i do not remember ever to have read an autobiography a biography or a piece of fiction that told the truth of course i have read stuff such as rousseau and zola and george moore and various memoirs that were supposed to be window panes in their respective breasts but mostly all of them were either liars actors or posers of course i m not trying to belittle the greatness of their literary expression all of us have to be prevaricators hypocrites and liars every day of our lives otherwise the social structure would fall into pieces the first day we must act in one another s presence just as we must wear clothes it is for the best the trouble about writing the truth has been that the writers have kept in their minds one or another or all of three thoughts that made a handicap they were trying either to do a piece of immortal literature or to shock the public or to please editors some of them succeeded in all three but they did not write the truth most autobiographies are insincere from beginning to end about the only chance for the truth to be told is in fiction it is well understood that all the truth cannot be told in print but how about nothing but the truth that s what i want to do i want the man who is telling the story to tell it not as he would to a reading public or to a confessor but something in this way suppose he were marooned on an island in mid ocean with no hope of ever being rescued and in order to pass away some of the time he should tell a story to himself embodying his adventure and experiences and opinions having a certain respect for himself let us hope he would leave out the realism that he would have no chance of selling in the market he would omit the lies and self conscious poses and would turn out to his one auditor something real and true so as truth is not to be found in history autobiography press reports nor at the bottom of an h g wells let us hope that fiction may be the means of bringing out a few grains of it the hero of the story will be a man born and raised in a somnolent little southern town his education is about a common school one but he learns afterward from reading and life i m going to try to give him a style in narrative and speech the best i ve got in the shop i m going to take him through all the main phases of life wild adventure city society something of the under world and among many characteristic planes of the phases i want him to acquire all the sophistication that experience can give him and always preserve his individual honest human view and have him tell the truth about everything it is time to say now that by the truth i don t mean the objectionable stuff that so often masquerades under the name i mean true opinions a true estimate of all things as they seem to the hero if you find a word or a suggestive line or sentence in any of my copy you cut it out and deduct it from the royalties i want this man to be a man of natural intelligence of individual character absolutely open and broad minded and show how the creator of the earth has got him in a rat trap put him here willy nilly you know the omar verse and then i want to show what he does about it there is always the eternal question from the primal source what are you going to do about it please don t think for the half of a moment that the story is going to be anything of an autobiography i have a distinct character in my mind for the part and he does not at all here the letter ends he never finished it the story of holding up a train in sixes and sevens there appears an article entitled holding up a train now the facts were given to o henry by an old and dear friend who in his wild avenging youth had actually held up trains to day he is mr al jennings of oklahoma city okla a prominent attorney he has permitted the publication of two letters o henry wrote him the first outlining the story as he thought his friend jennings ought to write it and the second announcing that with o henry s revision the manuscript had been accepted from w s porter to al jennings september st year not given but probably dear pard in regard to that article i will give you my idea of what is wanted say we take for a title the art and humor of the hold up or something like that i would suggest that in writing you assume a character we have got to respect the conventions and delusions of the public to a certain extent an article written as you would naturally write it would be regarded as a fake and an imposition remember that the traditions must be preserved wherever they will not interfere with the truth write in as simple plain and unembellished a style as you know how make your sentences short put in as much realism and as many facts as possible where you want to express an opinion or comment on the matter do it as practically and plainly as you can give it life and the vitality of facts now i will give you a sort of general synopsis of my idea of course everything is subject to your own revision and change the article we will say is written by a typical train hoister one without your education and powers of expression bouquet but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from his standpoint not from john wanamaker s yet in order to please john we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in and on the contrary do not depreciate a profession that is really only fnanciering with spurs on describe the facts and details all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his hands up in a pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see here is a rough draft of my idea begin abruptly without any philosophizing with your idea of the best times places and conditions for the hold up compare your opinions of this with those of others mention some poorly conceived attempts and failures of others giving your opinion why as far as possible refer to actual occurrences and incidents describe the manner of a hold up how many men is best where they are stationed how do they generally go into it nervous or joking or solemnly the details of stopping the train the duties of each man of the gang the behavior of the train crew and passengers here give as many brief odd and humorous incidents as you can think of your opinions on going through the passengers when is it done and when not done how is the boodle gotten at how does the express clerk generally take it anything done with the mail car under what circumstances will a train robber shoot a passenger or a train man suppose a man refuses to throw up his hands queer articles found on passengers a chance here for some imaginative work queer and laughable incidents of any kind refer whenever apropos to actual hold ups and facts concerning them of interest what could two or three brave and determined passengers do if they were to try why don t they try how long does it take to do the business does the train man ever stand in with the hold up best means of getting away how and when is the money divided how is it mostly spent best way to manoeuvre afterward how to get caught and how not to comment on the methods of officials who try to capture here s your chance to get even these ideas are some that occur to me casually you will of course have many far better i suggest that you make the article anywhere from to words get as much meat in it as you can and by the way stuff it full of western genuine slang not the eastern story paper kind get all the quaint cowboy expressions and terms of speech you can think of information is what we want clothed in the peculiar western style of the character we want to present the main idea is to be natural direct and concise i hope you will understand what i say i don t but try her a whack and send it along as soon as you can and let s see what we can do by the way mr everybody pays good prices i thought i would when i get your story put it into the shape my judgment decides upon and then send both your ms and mine to the magazine if he uses mine we ll whack up shares on the proceeds if he uses yours you get the check direct if he uses neither we are out only a few stamps sincerely your friend w s p and here is the letter telling his pard that the article had been bought by everybody s magazine this is dated pittsburg october th obviously the same year dear pard you re it i always told you you were a genius all you need is to succeed in order to make a success i enclose your letter which explains itself when you see your baby in print don t blame me if you find strange ear marks and brands on it i slashed it and cut it and added lots of stuff that never happened but i followed your facts and ideas and that is what made it valuable i ll think up some other idea for an article and we ll collaborate again some time eh i have all the work i can do and am selling it right along have averaged about per month since august st and yet i don t overwork don t think i ever will i commence about a m and generally knock off about or p m as soon as check mentioned in letter comes i ll send you your sheer of the boodle by the way please keep my nom de plume strictly to yourself i don t want any one to know just yet give my big regards to billy reason with him and try to convince him that we believe him to be pure merino and of more than average width with the kindest remembrances to yourself i remain your friend w s p at this time o henry was unknown and thought himself lucky to sell a story at any price strictly business more stories of the four million strictly business i suppose you know all about the stage and stage people you ve been touched with and by actors and you read the newspaper criticisms and the jokes in the weeklies about the rialto and the chorus girls and the long haired tragedians and i suppose that a condensed list of your ideas about the mysterious stageland would boil down to something like this leading ladies have five husbands paste diamonds and figures no better than your own madam if they weren t padded chorus girls are inseparable from peroxide panhards and pittsburg all shows walk back to new york on tan oxford and railroad ties irreproachable actresses reserve the comic landlady part for their mothers on broadway and their step aunts on the road kyrle bellew s real name is boyle o kelley the ravings of john mccullough in the phonograph were stolen from the first sale of the ellen terry memoirs joe weber is funnier than e h sothern but henry miller is getting older than he was all theatrical people on leaving the theatre at night drink champagne and eat lobsters until noon the next day after all the moving pictures have got the whole bunch pounded to a pulp now few of us know the real life of the stage people if we did the profession might be more overcrowded than it is we look askance at the players with an eye full of patronizing superiority and we go home and practise all sorts of elocution and gestures in front of our looking glasses latterly there has been much talk of the actor people in a new light it seems to have been divulged that instead of being motoring bacchanalias and diamond hungry loreleis they are businesslike folk students and ascetics with childer and homes and libraries owning real estate and conducting their private affairs in as orderly and unsensational a manner as any of us good citizens who are bound to the chariot wheels of the gas rent coal ice and wardmen whether the old or the new report of the sock and buskiners be the true one is a surmise that has no place here i offer you merely this little story of two strollers and for proof of its truth i can show you only the dark patch above the cast iron of the stage entrance door of keetor s old vaudeville theatre made there by the petulant push of gloved hands too impatient to finger the clumsy thumb latch and where i last saw cherry whisking through like a swallow into her nest on time to the minute as usual to dress for her act the vaudeville team of hart cherry was an inspiration but hart had been roaming through the eastern and western circuits for four years with a mixed up act comprising a monologue three lightning changes with songs a couple of imitations of celebrated imitators and a buck and wing dance that had drawn a glance of approval from the bass viol player in more than one house than which no performer ever received more satisfactory evidence of good work the greatest treat an actor can have is to witness the pitiful performance with which all other actors desecrate the stage in order to give himself this pleausre he will often forsake the sunniest broadway corner between thirty fourth and forty fourth to attend a matin ee offering by his less gifted brothers once during the lifetime of a minstrel joke one comes to scoff and remains to go through with that most difficult exercise of thespian muscles the audible contact of the palm of one hand against the palm of the other one afternoon bob hart presented his solvent serious well known vaudevillian face at the box office window of a rival attraction and got his d h coupon for an orchestra seat a b c and d glowed successively on the announcement spaces and passed into oblivion each plunging mr hart deeper into gloom others of the audience shrieked squirmed whistled and applauded but bob hart all the mustard and a whole show in himself sat with his face as long and his hands as far apart as a boy holding a hank of yarn for his grandmother to wind into a ball but when h came on the mustard suddenly sat up straight h was the happy alphabetical prognosticator of winona cherry in character songs and impersonations there were scarcely more than two bites to cherry but she delivered the merchandise tied with a pink cord and charged to the old man s account she first showed you a deliciously dewy and ginghamy country girl with a basket of property daisies who informed you ingenuously that there were other things to be learned at the old log school house besides cipherin and nouns especially when the teach er kept me in vanishing with a quick flirt of gingham apron strings she reappeared in considerably less than a trice as a fluffy parisienne so near does art bring the old red mill to the moulin rouge and then but you know the rest and so did bob hart but he saw somebody else he thought he saw that cherry was the only professional on the short order stage that he had seen who seemed exactly to fit the part of helen grimes in the sketch he had written and kept tucked away in the tray of his trunk of course bob hart as well as every other normal actor grocer newspaper man professor curb broker and farmer has a play tucked away somewhere they tuck em in trays of trunks trunks of trees desks haymows pigeonholes inside pockets safe deposit vaults handboxes and coal cellars waiting for mr frohman to call they belong among the fifty seven different kinds but bob hart s sketch was not destined to end in a pickle jar he called it mice will play he had kept it quiet and hidden away ever since he wrote it waiting to find a partner who fitted his conception of helen grimes and here was helen herself with all the innocent abandon the youth the sprightliness and the flawless stage art that his critical taste demanded after the act was over hart found the manager in the box office and got cherry s address at five the next afternoon he called at the musty old house in the west forties and sent up his professional card by daylight in a secular shirtwaist and plain voile skirt with her hair curbed and her sister of charity eyes winona cherry might have been playing the part of prudence wise the deacon s daughter in the great unwritten new england drama not yet entitled anything i know your act mr hart she said after she had looked over his card carefully what did you wish to see me about i saw you work last night said hart i ve written a sketch that i ve been saving up it s for two and i think you can do the other part i thought i d see you about it come in the parlor said miss cherry i ve been wishing for something of the sort i think i d like to act instead of doing turns bob hart drew his cherished mice will play from his pocket and read it to her read it again please said miss cherry and then she pointed out to him clearly how it could be improved by introducing a messenger instead of a telephone call and cutting the dialogue just before the climax while they were struggling with the pistol and by completely changing the lines and business of helen grimes at the point where her jealousy overcomes her hart yielded to all her strictures without argument she had at once put her finger on the sketch s weaker points that was her woman s intuition that he had lacked at the end of their talk hart was willing to stake the judgment experience and savings of his four years of vaudeville that mice will play would blossom into a perennial flower in the garden of the circuits miss cherry was slower to decide after many puckerings of her smooth young brow and tappings on her small white teeth with the end of a lead pencil she gave out her dictum mr hart said she i believe your sketch is going to win out that grimes part fits me like a shrinkable flannel after its first trip to a handless hand laundry i can make it stand out like the colonel of the forty fourth regiment at a little mothers bazaar and i ve seen you work i know what you can do with the other part but business is business how much do you get a week for the stunt you do now two hundred answered hart i get one hundred for mine said cherry that s about the natural discount for a woman but i live on it and put a few simoleons every week under the loose brick in the old kitchen hearth the stage is all right i love it but there s something else i love better that s a little country home some day with plymouth rock chickens and six ducks wandering around the yard now let me tell you mr hart i am strictly business if you want me to play the opposite part in your sketch i ll do it and i believe we can make it go and there s something else i want to say there s no nonsense in my make up i m on the level and i m on the stage for what it pays me just as other girls work in stores and offices i m going to save my money to keep me when i m past doing my stunts no old ladies home or retreat for imprudent actresses for me if you want to make this a business partnership mr hart with all nonsense cut out of it i m in on it i know something about vaudeville teams in general but this would have to be one in particular i want you to know that i m on the stage for what i can cart away from it every pay day in a little manila envelope with nicotine stains on it where the cashier has licked the flap it s kind of a hobby of mine to want to cravenette myself for plenty of rainy days in the future i want you to know just how i am i don t know what an all night restaurant looks like i drink only weak tea i never spoke to a man at a stage entrance in my life and i ve got money in five savings banks miss cherry said bob hart in his smooth serious tones you re in on your own terms i ve got strictly business pasted in my hat and stenciled on my make up box when i dream of nights i always see a five room bungalow on the north shore of long island with a jap cooking clam broth and duckling in the kitchen and me with the title deeds to the place in my pongee coat pocket swinging in a hammock on the side porch reading stanleys explorations into africa and nobody else around you never was interested in africa was you miss cherry not any said cherry what i m going to do with my money is to bank it you can get four per cent on deposits even at the salary i ve been earning i ve figured out that in ten years i d have an income of about a month just from the interest alone well i might invest some of the principal in a little business say trimming hats or a beauty parlor and make more well said hart you ve got the proper idea all right all right anyhow there are mighty few actors that amount to anything at all who couldn t fix themselves for the wet days to come if they d save their money instead of blowing it i m glad you ve got the correct business idea of it miss cherry i think the same way and i believe this sketch will more than double what both of us earn now when we get it shaped up the subsequent history of mice will play is the history of all successful writings for the stage hart cherry cut it pieced it remodeled it performed surgical operations on the dialogue and business changed the lines restored em added more cut em out renamed it gave it back the old name rewrote it substituted a dagger for the pistol restored the pistol put the sketch through all the known processes of condensation and improvement they rehearsed it by the old fashioned boardinghouse clock in the rarely used parlor until its warning click at five minutes to the hour would occur every time exactly half a second before the click of the unloaded revolver that helen grimes used in rehearsing the thrilling climax of the sketch yes that was a thriller and a piece of excellent work in the act a real caliber revolver was used loaded with a real cartridge helen grimes who is a western girl of decidedly buffalo billish skill and daring is tempestuously in love with frank desmond the private secretary and confidential prospective son in law of her father arapahoe grimes quarter million dollar cattle king owning a ranch that judging by the scenery is in either the bad lands or amagensett l i desmond in private life mr bob hart wears puttees and meadow brook hunt riding trousers and gives his address as new york leaving you to wonder why he comes to the bad lands or amagansett as the case may be and at the same time to conjecture mildly why a cattleman should want puttees about his ranch with a secretary in em well anyhow you know as well as i do that we all like that kind of play whether we admit it or not something along in between bluebeard jr and cymbeline played in the russian there were only two parts and a half in mice will play hart and cherry were the two of course and the half was a minor part always played by a stage hand who merely came in once in a tuxedo coat and a panic to announce that the house was surrounded by indians and to turn down the gas fire in the grate by the manager s orders there was another girl in the sketch a fifth avenue society swelless who was visiting the ranch and who had sirened jack valentine when he was a wealthy club man on lower third avenue before he lost his money this girl appeared on the stage only in the photographic state jack had her sarony stuck up on the mantel of the amagan of the bad lands droring room helen was jealous of course and now for the thriller old arapahoe grimes dies of angina pectoris one night so helen informs us in a stage ferryboat whisper over the footlights while only his secretary was present and that same day he was known to have had in cash in his ranch library just received for the sale of a drove of beeves in the east that accounts for the price we pay for steak the cash disappears at the same time jack valentine was the only person with the ranchman when he made his alleged croak gawd knows i love him but if he has done this deed you sabe don t you and then there are some mean things said about the fifth avenue girl who doesn t come on the stage and can we blame her with the vaudeville trust holding down prices until one actually must be buttoned in the back by a call boy maids cost so much but wait here s the climax helen grimes chaparralish as she can be is goaded beyond imprudence she convinces herself that jack valentine is not only a falsetto but a financier to lose at one fell swoop and a lover in riding trousers with angles in the sides like the variations on the chart of a typhoid fever patient is enough to make any perfect lady mad so then they stand in the ranch library which is furnished with mounted elk heads didn t the elks have a fish fry in amagensett once and the d enouement begins i know of no more interesting time in the run of a play unless it be when the prologue ends helen thinks jack has taken the money who else was there to take it the box office manager was at the front on his job the orchestra hadn t left their seats and no man could get past old jimmy the stage door man unless he could show a skye terrier or an automobile as a guarantee of eligibility goaded beyond imprudence as before said helen says to jack valentine robber and thief and worse yet stealer of trusting hearts this should be your fate with that out she whips of course the trusty caliber but i will be merciful goes on helen you shall live that will be your punishment i will show you how easily i could have sent you to the death that you deserve there is her picture on the mantel i will send through her more beautiful face the bullet that should have pierced your craven heart and she does it and there s no fake blank cartridges or assistants pulling strings helen fires the bullet the actual bullet goes through the face of the photograph and then strikes the hidden spring of the sliding panel in the wall and lo the panel slides and there is the missing in convincing stacks of currency and bags of gold it s great you know how it is cherry practised for two months at a target on the roof of her boarding house it took good shooting in the sketch she had to hit a brass disk only three inches in diameter covered by wall paper in the panel and she had to stand in exactly the same spot every night and the photo had to be in exactly the same spot and she had to shoot steady and true every time of course old arapahoe had tucked the funds away there in the secret place and of course jack hadn t taken anything except his salary which really might have come under the head of obtaining money under but that is neither here nor there and of course the new york girl was really engaged to a concrete house contractor in the bronx and necessarily jack and helen ended in a half nelson and there you are after hart and cherry had gotten mice will play flawless they had a try out at a vaudeville house that accommodates the sketch was a house wrecker it was one of those rare strokes of talent that inundates a theatre from the roof down the gallery wept and the orchestra seats being dressed for it swam in tears after the show the booking agents signed blank checks and pressed fountain pens upon hart and cherry five hundred dollars a week was what it panned out that night at bob hart took off his hat and bade cherry good night at her boarding house door mr hart said she thoughtfully come inside just a few minutes we ve got our chance now to make good and make money what we want to do is to cut expenses every cent we can and save all we can right said bob it s business with me you ve got your scheme for banking yours and i dream every night of that bungalow with the jap cook and nobody around to raise trouble anything to enlarge the net receipts will engage my attention come inside just a few minutes repeated cherry deeply thoughtful i ve got a proposition to make to you that will reduce our expenses a lot and help you work out your own future and help me work out mine and all on business principles mice will play had a tremendously successful run in new york for ten weeks rather neat for a vaudeville sketch and then it started on the circuits without following it it may be said that it was a solid drawing card for two years without a sign of abated popularity sam packard manager of one of keetor s new york houses said of hart cherry as square and high toned a little team as ever came over the circuit it s a pleasure to read their names on the booking list quiet hard workers no johnny and mabel nonsense on the job to the minute straight home after their act and each of em as gentlemanlike as a lady i don t expect to handle any attractions that give me less trouble or more respect for the profession and now after so much cracking of a nutshell here is the kernel of the story at the end of its second season mice will play came back to new york for another run at the roof gardens and summer theatres there was never any trouble in booking it at the top notch price bob hart had his bungalow nearly paid for and cherry had so many savings deposit bank books that she had begun to buy sectional bookcases on the instalment plan to hold them i tell you these things to assure you even if you can t believe it that many very many of the stage people are workers with abiding ambitions just the same as the man who wants to be president or the grocery clerk who wants a home in flatbush or a lady who is anxious to flop out of the count pan into the prince fire and i hope i may be allowed to say without chipping into the contribution basket that they often move in a mysterious way their wonders to perform but listen at the first performance of mice will play in new york at the westphalia no hams alluded to theatre winona cherry was nervous when she fired at the photograph of the eastern beauty on the mantel the bullet instead of penetrating the photo and then striking the disk went into the lower left side of bob hart s neck not expecting to get it there hart collapsed neatly while cherry fainted in a most artistic manner the audience surmising that they viewed a comedy instead of a tragedy in which the principals were married or reconciled applauded with great enjoyment the cool head who always graces such occasions rang the curtain down and two platoons of scene shifters respectively and more or less respectfully removed hart cherry from the stage the next turn went on and all went as merry as an alimony bell the stage hands found a young doctor at the stage entrance who was waiting for a patient with a decoction of am b ty roses the doctor examined hart carefully and laughed heartily no headlines for you old sport was his diagnosis if it had been two inches to the left it would have undermined the carotid artery as far as the red front drug store in flatbush and back again as it is you just get the property man to bind it up with a flounce torn from any one of the girls valenciennes and go home and get it dressed by the parlor floor practitioner on your block and you ll be all right excuse me i ve got a serious case outside to look after after that bob hart looked up and felt better and then to where he lay came vincente the tramp juggler great in his line vincente a solemn man from brattleboro vt named sam griggs at home sent toys and maple sugar home to two small daughters from every town he played vincente had moved on the same circuits with hart cherry and was their peripatetic friend bob said vincente in his serious way i m glad it s no worse the little lady is wild about you who asked hart cherry said the juggler we didn t know how bad you were hurt and we kept her away it s taking the manager and three girls to hold her it was an accident of course said hart cherry s all right she wasn t feeling in good trim or she couldn t have done it there s no hard feelings she s strictly business the doctor says i ll be on the job again in three days don t let her worry man said sam griggs severely puckering his old smooth lined face are you a chess automaton or a human pincushion cherry s crying her heart out for you calling bob bob every second with them holding her hands and keeping her from coming to you what s the matter with her asked hart with wide open eyes the sketch ll go on again in three days i m not hurt bad the doctor says she won t lose out half a week s salary i know it was an accident what s the matter with her you seem to be blind or a sort of a fool said vincente the girl loves you and is almost mad about your hurt what s the matter with you is she nothing to you i wish you could hear her call you loves me asked bob hart rising from the stack of scenery on which he lay cherry loves me why it s impossible i wish you could see her and hear her said griggs but man said bob hart sitting up it s impossible it s impossible i tell you i never dreamed of such a thing no human being said the tramp juggler could mistake it she s wild for love of you how have you been so blind but my god said bob hart rising to his feet it s too late it s too late i tell you sam it s too late it can t be you must be wrong it s impossible there s some mistake she s crying for you said the tramp juggler for love of you she s fighting three and calling your name so loud they don t dare to raise the curtain wake up man for love of me said bob hart with staring eyes don t i tell you it s too late it s too late man why cherry and i have been married two years the gold that glittered a story with a moral appended is like the bill of a mosquito it bores you and then injects a stinging drop to irritate your conscience therefore let us have the moral first and be done with it all is not gold that glitters but it is a wise child that keeps the stopper in his bottle of testing acid where broadway skirts the corner of the square presided over by george the veracious is the little rialto here stand the actors of that quarter and this is their shibboleth nit says i to frohman you can t touch me for a kopeck less than two fifty per and out i walks westward and southward from the thespian glare are one or two streets where a spanish american colony has huddled for a little tropical warmth in the nipping north the centre of life in this precinct is el refugio a cafe and restaurant that caters to the volatile exiles from the south up from chili bolivia colombia the rolling republics of central america and the ireful islands of the western indies flit the cloaked and sombreroed se ores who are scattered like burning lava by the political eruptions of their several countries hither they come to lay counterplots to bide their time to solicit funds to enlist filibusterers to smuggle out arms and ammunitions to play the game at long taw in el refugio they find the atmosphere in which they thrive in the restaurant of el refugio

conchito the waiter brings you a plate of brown frijoles and carafe of wine that has never stood still between oporto and el refugio ah dios one day a hamburg american liner deposited upon pier no gen perrico ximenes villablanca falcon a passenger from cartagena the general was between a claybank and bay in complexion had a inch waist and stood feet with his du barry heels he had the mustache of a shooting gallery proprietor he wore the full dress of a texas congressman and had the important aspect of an uninstructed delegate gen falcon had enough english under his hat to enable him to inquire his way to the street in which el refugio stood when he reached that neighborhood he saw a sign before a respectable red brick house that read hotel espanol in the window was a card in spanish aqui se habla espanol the general entered sure of a congenial port in the cozy office was mrs o brien the proprietress she had blond oh unimpeachably blond hair for the rest she was amiability and ran largely to inches around gen falcon brushed the floor with his broad brimmed hat and emitted a quantity of spanish the syllables sounding like firecrackers gently popping their way down the string of a bunch spanish or dago asked mrs o brien pleasantly i am a colombian madam said the general proudly i speak the spanish the advisment in your window say the spanish he is spoken here how is that well you ve been speaking it ain t you said the madam i m sure i can t at the hotel espanol general falcon engaged rooms and established himself at dusk he sauntered out upon the streets to view the wonders of this roaring city of the north as he walked he thought of the wonderful golden hair of mme o brien it is here said the general to himself no doubt in his own language that one shall find the most beautiful se oras in the world i have not in my colombia viewed among our beauties one so fair but no it is not for the general falcon to think of beauty it is my country that claims my devotion at the corner of broadway and the little rialto the general became involved the street cars bewildered him and the fender of one upset him against a pushcart laden with oranges a cab driver missed him an inch with a hub and poured barbarous execrations upon his head he scrambled to the sidewalk and skipped again in terror when the whistle of a peanut roaster puffed a hot scream in his ear v algame dios what devil s city is this as the general fluttered out of the streamers of passers like a wounded snipe he was marked simultaneously as game by two hunters one was bully mcguire whose system of sport required the use of a strong arm and the misuse of an eight inch piece of lead pipe the other nimrod of the asphalt was spider kelley a sportsman with more refined methods in pouncing upon their self evident prey mr kelley was a shade the quicker his elbow fended accurately the onslaught of mr mcguire g wan he commanded harshly i saw it first mcguire slunk away awed by superior intelligence pardon me said mr kelley to the general but you got balled up in the shuffle didn t you let me assist you he picked up the general s hat and brushed the dust from it the ways of mr kelley could not but succeed the general bewildered and dismayed by the resounding streets welcomed his deliverer as a caballero with a most disinterested heart i have a desire said the general to return to the hotel of o brien in which i am stop caramba se or there is a loudness and rapidness of going and coming in the city of this nueva york mr kelley s politeness would not suffer the distinguished colombian to brave the dangers of the return unaccompanied at the door of the hotel espanol they paused a little lower down on the opposite side of the street shone the modest illuminated sign of el refugio mr kelley to whom few streets were unfamiliar knew the place exteriorly as a dago joint all foreigners mr kelley classed under the two heads of dagoes and frenchmen he proposed to the general that they repair thither and substantiate their acquaintance with a liquid foundation an hour later found general falcon and mr kelley seated at a table in the conspirator s corner of el refugio bottles and glasses were between them for the tenth time the general confided the secret of his mission to the estados unidos he was here he declared to purchase arms stands of winchester rifles for the colombian revolutionists he had drafts in his pocket drawn by the cartagena bank on its new york correspondent for at other tables other revolutionists were shouting their political secrets to their fellow plotters but none was as loud as the general he pounded the table he hallooed for some wine he roared to his friend that his errand was a secret one and not to be hinted at to a living soul mr kelley himself was stirred to sympathetic enthusiasm he grasped the general s hand across the table monseer he said earnestly i don t know where this country of yours is but i m for it i guess it must be a branch of the united states though for the poetry guys and the schoolmarms call us columbia too sometimes it s a lucky thing for you that you butted into me to night i m the only man in new york that can get this gun deal through for you the secretary of war of the united states is me best friend he s in the city now and i ll see him for you to morrow in the meantime monseer you keep them drafts tight in your inside pocket i ll call for you to morrow and take you to see him say that ain t the district of columbia you re talking about is it concluded mr kelley with a sudden qualm you can t capture that with no guns it s been tried with more no no no exclaimed the general it is the republic of colombia it is a g r reat republic on the top side of america of the south yes yes all right said mr kelley reassured now suppose we trek along home and go by by i ll write to the secretary to night and make a date with him it s a ticklish job to get guns out of new york mcclusky himself can t do it they parted at the door of the hotel espanol the general rolled his eyes at the moon and sighed it is a great country your nueva york he said truly the cars in the streets devastate one and the engine that cooks the nuts terribly makes a squeak in the ear but ah se or kelley the se oras with hair of much goldness and admirable fatness they are magnificas muy magnificas kelley went to the nearest telephone booth and called up mccrary s caf e far up on broadway he asked for jimmy dunn is that jimmy dunn asked kelley yes came the answer you re a liar sang back kelley joyfully your e the secretary of war wait there till i come up i ve got the finest thing down here in the way of a fish you ever baited for it s a colorado maduro with a gold band around it and free coupons enough to buy a red hall lamp and a statuette of psyche rubbering in the brook i ll be up on the next car jimmy dunn was an a m of crookdom he was an artist in the confidence line he never saw a bludgeon in his life and he scorned knockout drops in fact he would have set nothing before an intended victim but the purest of drinks if it had been possible to procure such a thing in new york it was the ambition of spider kelley to elevate himself into jimmy s class these two gentlemen held a conference that night at mccrary s kelley explained he s as easy as a gumshoe he s from the island of colombia where there s a strike or a feud or something going on and they ve sent him up here to buy winchesters to arbitrate the thing with he showed me two drafts for each and one for on a bank here s truth jimmy i felt real mad with him because he didn t have it in thousand dollar bills and hand it to me on a silver waiter now we ve got to wait till he goes to the bank and gets the money for us they talked it over for two hours and then dunn said bring him to no broadway at four o clock to morrow afternoon in due time kelley called at the hotel espanol for the general he found the wily warrior engaged in delectable conversation with mrs o brien the secretary of war is waitin for us said kelley the general tore himself away with an effort ay se or he said with a sigh duty makes a call but se or the se oras of your estados unidos how beauties for exemplification take you la madame o brien que magnifica she is one goddess one juno what you call one ox eyed juno now mr kelley was a wit and better men have been shriveled by the fire of their own imagination sure he said with a grin but you mean a peroxide juno don t you mrs o brien heard and lifted an auriferous head her businesslike eye rested for an instant upon the disappearing form of mr kelley except in street cars one should never be unnecessarily rude to a lady when the gallant colombian and his escort arrived at the broadway address they were held in an anteroom for half an hour and then admitted into a well equipped office where a distinguished looking man with a smooth face wrote at a desk general falcon was presented to the secretary of war of the united states and his mission made known by his old friend mr kelley ah colombia said the secretary significantly when he was made to understand i m afraid there will be a little difficutly in that case the president and i differ in our sympathies there he prefers the established government while i the secretary gave the general a mysterious but encouraging smile you of course know general falcon that since the tammany war an act of congress has been passed requiring all manufactured arms and ammunition exported from this country to pass through the war department now if i can do anything for you i will be glad to do so to oblige my old friend mr kelley but it must be in absolute secrecy as the president as i have said does not regard favorably the efforts of your revolutionary party in colombia i will have my orderly bring a list of the available arms now in the warehouse the secretary struck a bell and an orderly with the letters a d t on his cap stepped promptly into the room bring me schedule b of the small arms inventory said the secretary the orderly quickly returned with a printed paper the secretary studied it closely i find he said that in warehouse of government stores there is shipment of stands of winchester rifles that were ordered by the sultan of morocco who forgot to send the cash with his order our rule is that legal tender must be paid down at the time of purchase my dear kelley your friend general falcon shall have this lot of arms if he desires it at the manufacturer s price and you will forgive me i am sure if i curtail our interview i am expecting the japanese minister and charles murphy every moment as one result of this interview the general was deeply grateful to his esteemed friend mr kelley as another the nimble secretary of war was extremely busy during the next two days buying empty rifle cases and filling them with bricks which were then stored in a warehouse rented for that purpose as still another when the general returned to the hotel espanol mrs o brien went up to him plucked a thread from his lapel and said say se or i don t want to butt in but what does that monkey faced cat eyed rubber necked tin horn tough want with you sangre de mi vida exclaimed the general impossible it is that you speak of my good friend se or kelley come into the summer garden said mrs o brien i want to have a talk with you let us suppose that an hour has elapsed and you say said the general that for the sum of can be purchased the furnishment of the house and the lease of one year with this garden so lovely so resembling unto the patios of my cara colombia and dirt cheap at that sighed the lady ah dios breathed general falcon what to me is war and politics this spot is one paradise my country it have other brave heroes to continue the fighting what to me should be glory and the shooting of mans ah no it is here i have found one angel let us buy the hotel espanol and you shall be mine and the money shall not be waste on guns mrs o brien rested her blond pompadour against the shoulder of the colombian patriot oh se or she sighed happily ain t you terrible two days later was the time appointed for the delivery of the arms to the general the boxes of supposed rifles were stacked in the rented warehouse and the secretary of war sat upon them waiting for his friend kelley to fetch the victim mr kelley hurried at the hour to the hotel espanol he found the general behind the desk adding up accounts i have decide said the general to buy not guns i have to day buy the insides of this hotel and there shall be marrying of the general perrico ximenes villablanca falcon with la madame o brien mr kelley almost strangled say you old bald headed bottle of shoe polish he spluttered you re a swindler that s what you are you ve bought a boarding house with money belonging to your infernal country wherever it is ah said the general footing up a column that is what you call politics war and revolution they are not nice yes it is not best that one shall always follow minerva no it is of quite desirable to keep hotels and be with that juno that ox eyed juno ah what hair of the gold it is that she have mr kelley choked again ah senor kelley said the general feelingly and finally is it that you have never eaten of the corned beef hash that madame o brien she make babes in the jungle montague silver the finest street man and art grafter in the west says to me once in little rock if you ever lose your mind billy and get too old to do honest swindling among grown men go to new york in the west a sucker is born every minute but in new york they appear in chunks of roe you can t count em two years afterward i found that i couldn t remember the names of the russian admirals and i noticed some gray hairs over my left ear so i knew the time had arrived for me to take silver s advice i struck new york about noon one day and took a walk up broadway and i run against silver himself all encompassed up in a spacious kind of haberdashery leaning against a hotel and rubbing the half moons on his nails with a silk handkerchief paresis or superannuated i asks him hello billy says silver i m glad to see you yes it seemed to me that the west was accumulating a little too much wiseness i ve been saving new york for dessert i know it s a low down trick to take things from these people they only know this and that and pass to and fro and think ever and anon i d hate for my mother to know i was skinning these weak minded ones she raised me better is there a crush already in the waiting rooms of the old doctor that does skin grafting i asks well no says silver you needn t back epidermis to win to day i ve only been here a month but i m ready to begin and the members of willie manhattan s sunday school class each of whom has volunteered to contribute a portion of cuticle toward this rehabilitation may as well send their photos to the evening daily i ve been studying the town says silver and reading the papers every day and i know it as well as the cat in the city hall knows an o sullivan people here lie down on the floor and scream and kick when you are the least bit slow about taking money from them come up in my room and i ll tell you we ll work the town together billy for the sake of old times silver takes me up in a hotel he has a quantity of irrelevant objects lying about there s more ways of getting money from these metropolitan hayseeds says silver than there is of cooking rice in charleston s c they ll bite at anything the brains of most of em commute the wiser they are in intelligence the less perception of cognizance they have why didin t a man the other day sell j p morgan an oil portrait of rockefeller jr for andrea del sarto s celebrated painting of the young saint john you see that bundle of printed stuff in the corner billy that s gold mining stock i started out one day to sell that but i quit it in two hours why got arrested for blocking the street people fought to buy it i sold the policeman a block of it on the way to the station house and then i took it off the market i don t want people to give me their money i want some little consideration connected with the transaction to keep my pride from being hurt i want em to guess the missing letter in chic go or draw to a pair of nines before they pay me a cent of money now there s another little scheme that worked so easy i had to quit it you see that bottle of blue ink on the table i tattooed an anchor on the back of my hand and went to a bank and told em i was admiral dewey s nephew they offered to cash my draft on him for a thousand but i didn t know my uncle s first name it shows though what an easy town it is as for burglars they won t go in a house now unless there s a hot supper ready and a few college students to wait on em they re slugging citizens all over the upper part of the city and i guess taking the town from end to end it s a plain case of assault and battery monty says i when silver had slacked up you may have manhattan correctly discriminated in your perorative but i doubt it i ve only been in town two hours but it don t dawn upon me that it s ours with a cherry in it there ain t enough rus in urbe about it to suit me i d be a good deal much better satisfied if the citizens had a straw or more in their hair and run more to velveteen vests and buckeye watch charms they don t look easy to me you ve got it billy says silver all emigrants have it new york s bigger than little rock or europe and it frightens a foreigner you ll be all right i tell you i feel like slapping the people here because they don t send me all their money in laundry baskets with germicide sprinkled over it i hate to go down on the street to get it who wears the diamonds in this town why winnie the wiretapper s wife and bella the buncosteerer s bride new yorkers can be worked easier than a blue rose on a tidy the only thing that bothers me is i know i ll break the cigars in my vest pocket when i get my clothes all full of twenties i hope you are right monty says i but i wish all the same i had been satisfied with a small business in little rock the crop of farmers is never so short out there but what you can get a few of em to sign a petition for a new post office that you can discount for at the county bank the people hear appear to possess instincts of self preservation and illiberality i fear me that we are not cultured enough to tackle this game don t worry says silver i ve got this jayville near tarrytown correctly estimated as sure as north river is the hudson and east river ain t a river why there are people living in four blocks of broadway who never saw any kind of a building except a skyscraper in their lives a good live hustling western man ought to get conspicuous enough here inside of three months to incur either jerome s clemency or lawson s displeasure hyperbole aside says i do you know of any immediate system of buncoing the community out of a dollar or two except by applying to the salvation army or having a fit on miss helen gould s doorsteps dozens of em says silver how much capital have you got billy a thousand i told him i ve got says he we ll pool and do a big piece of business there s so many ways we can make a million that i don t know how to begin the next morning silver meets me at the hotel and he is all sonorous and stirred with a kind of silent joy we re to meet j p morgan this afternoon says he a man i know in the hotel wants to introduce us he s a friend of his he says he likes to meet people from the west that sounds nice and plausible says i i d like to know mr morgan it won t hurt us a bit says silver to get acquainted with a few finance kings i kind of like the social way new york has with strangers the man silver knew was named klein at three o clock klein brought his wall street friend to see us in silver s room mr morgan looked some like his pictures and he had a turkish towel wrapped around his left foot and he walked with a cane mr silver and mr pescud says klein it sounds superfluous says he to mention the name of the greatest financial cut it out klein says mr morgan i m glad to know you gents i take great interest in the west klein tells me you re from little rock i think i ve a railroad or two out there somewhere if either of you guys would like to deal a hand or two of stud poker i now pierpont cuts in klein you forget excuse me gents says morgan since i ve had the gout so bad i sometimes play a social game of cards at my house neither of you never knew one eyed peters did you while you was around little rock he lived in seattle new mexico before we could answer mr morgan hammers on the floor with his can and begins to walk up and down swearing in a loud tone of voice they have been pounding your stocks to day on the street pierpont asks klein smiling stocks no roars mr morgan it s that picture i sent an agent to europe to buy i just thought about it he cabled me to day that it ain t to be found in all italy i d pay to morrow for that picture yes i give the agent a la carte in purchasing it i cannot understand why the art galleries will allow a de vinchy to why mr morgan says klein i thought you owned all of the de vinchy paintings what is the picture like mr morgan asks silver it must be as big as the side of the flatiron building i m afraid your art education is on the bum mr silver says morgan the picture is inches by and it is called love s idle hour it represents a number of cloak models doing the two step on the bank of a purple river the cablegram said it might have been brought to this country my collection will never be complete without that picture well so long gents us financiers must keep early hours mr morgan and klein went away together in a cab me and silver talked about how simple and unsuspecting great people was and silver said what a shame it would be to try to rob a man like mr morgan and i said i thought it would be rather imprudent myself klein proposes a stroll after dinner and me and him and silver walks down toward seventh avenue to see the sights klein sees a pair of cuff links that instigate his admiration in a pawnshop window and we all go in while he buys em after we got back to the hotel and klein had gone silver jumps at me and waves his hands did you see it says he did you see it billy what i asks why that picture that morgan wants it s hanging in that pawnshop behind the desk i didn t say anything because klein was there it s the article sure as you live the girls are as natural as paint can make them all measuring and and skirts if they had any skirts and they re doing a buck and wing on the bank of a river with the blues what did mr morgan say he d give for it oh don t make me tell you they can t know what it is in that pawnshop when the pawnshop opened the next morning me and silver was standing there as anxious as if we wanted to soak our sunday suit to buy a drink we sauntered inside and began to look at watch chains that s a violent specimen of a chromo you ve got up there remarked silver casual to the pawnbroker but i kind of enthuse over the girl with the shoulderblades and red bunting would an offer of for it cause you to knock over any fragile articles of your stock in hurrying it off the nail the pawnbroker smiles and goes on showing us plate watch chains that picture says he was pledged a year ago by an italian gentleman i loaned him on it it is called love s idle hour and it is by leonardo de vinchy two days ago the legal time expired and it became an unredeemed pledge here is a style of chain that is worn a great deal now at the end of half an hour me and silver paid the pawnbroker and walked out with the picture silver got into a cab with it and started for morgan s office i goes to the hotel and waits for him in two hours silver comes back did you see mr morgan i asks how much did he pay you for it silver sits down and fools with a tassel on the table cover i never exactly saw mr morgan he says because mr morgan s been in europe for a month but what s worrying me billy is this the department stores have all got that same picture on sale framed for and they charge for the frame alone that s what i can t understand the day resurgent i can see the artist bite the end of his pencil and frown when it comes to drawing his easter picture for his legitimate pictorial conceptions of figures pertinent to the festival are but four in number first comes easter pagan goddess of spring here his fancy may have free play a beautiful maiden with decorative hair and the proper number of toes will fill the bill miss clarice st vavasour the well known model will pose for it in the lethergogallagher or whatever it was that trilby called it second the melancholy lady with upturned eyes in a framework of lilies this is magazine covery but reliable third miss manhattan in the fifth avenue easter sunday parade fourth maggie murphy with a new red feather in her old straw hat happy and self conscious in the grand street turnout of course the rabbits do not count nor the easter eggs since the higher criticism has hard boiled them the limited field of its pictorial possibilities proves that easter of all our festival days is the most vague and shifting in our conception it belongs to all religions although the pagans invented it going back still further to the first spring we can see eve choosing with pride a new green leaf from the tree ficus carica now the object of this critical and learned preamble is to set forth the theorem that easter is neither a date a season a festival a holiday nor an occasion what it is you shall find out if you follow in the footsteps of danny mccree easter sunday dawned as it should bright and early in its place on the calendar between saturday and monday at the sun rose and at danny followed its example he went into the kitchen and washed his face at the sink his mother was frying bacon she looked at his hard smooth knowing countenance as he juggled with the round cake of soap and thought of his father when she first saw him stopping a hot grounder between second and third twenty two years before on a vacant lot in harlem where the la paloma apartment house now stands in the front room of the flat danny s father sat by an open window smoking his pipe with his dishevelled gray hair tossed about by the breeze he still clung to his pipe although his sight had been taken from him two years before by a precocious blast of giant powder that went off without permission very few blind men care for smoking for the reason that they cannot see the smoke now could you enjoy having the news read to you from an evening newspaper unless you could see the colors of the headlines tis easter day said mrs mccree scramble mine said danny after breakfast he dressed himself in the sabbath morning costume of the canal street importing house dray chauffeur frock coat striped trousers patent leathers gilded trace chain across front of vest and wing collar rolled brim derby and butterfly bow from schonstein s between fourteenth street and tony s fruit stand saturday night sale you ll be goin out this day of course danny said old man mccree a little wistfully tis a kind of holiday they say well it s fine spring weather i can feel it in the air why should i not be going out demanded danny in his grumpiest chest tones should i stay in am i as good as a horse one day of rest my team has a week who earns the money for the rent and the breakfast you ve just eat i d like to know answer me that all right lad said the old man i m not complainin while me two eyes was good there was nothin better to my mind than a sunday out there s a smell of turf and burnin brush comin in the windy i have me tobaccy a good fine day and rist to ye lad times i wish your mother had larned to read so i might hear the rest about the hippopotamus but let that be now what is this foolishness he talks of hippopotamuses asked danny of his mother as he passed through the kitchen have you been taking him to the zoo and for what i have not said mrs mccree he sets by the windy all day tis little recreation a blind man among the poor gets at all i m thinkin they wander in their minds at times one day he talks of grease without stoppin for the most of an hour i looks to see if there s lard burnin in the fryin pan there is not he says i do not understand tis weary days sundays and holidays and all for a blind man danny there was no better nor stronger than him when he had his two eyes tis a fine day son injoy yeself ag inst the morning there will be cold supper at six have you heard any talk of a hippopotamus asked danny of mike the janitor as he went out the door downstairs i have not said mike pulling his shirtsleeves higher but tis the only subject in the animal natural and illegal lists of outrages that i ve not been compained to about these two days see the landlord or else move out if ye like have ye hippopotamuses in the lease no then it was the old man who spoke of it said danny likely there s nothing in it danny walked up the street to the avenue and then struck northward into the heart of the district where easter modern easter in new bright raiment leads the pascal march out of towering brown churches came the blithe music of anthems from the choirs the broad sidewalks were moving parterres of living flowers so it seemed when your eye looked upon the ester girl gentlemen frock coated silk hatted gardeniaed sustained the background of the tradition children carried lilies in their hands the windows of the brownstone mansions were packed with the most opulent creations of flora the sister of the lady of the lilies around a corner white gloved pink gilled and tightly buttoned walked corrigan the cop shield to the curb danny knew him why corrigan he asked is easter i know it comes the first you re full after the moon rises on the seventeenth of march but why is it a proper and religious ceremony or does the governor appoint it out of politics tis an annual celebration said corrigan with the judicial air of the third deputy police commissioner peculiar to new york it extends up to harlem sometimes they has the reserves out at one hundred and twenty fifth street in my opinion tis not political thanks said danny and say did you ever hear a man complain of hippopotamuses when not specially in drink i mean nothing larger than sea turtles said corrigan reflecting and there was wood alcohol in that danny wandered the double heavy incumbency of enjoying simultaneously a sunday and a festival day was his the sorrows of the hand toiler fit him easily they are worn so often that they hang with the picturesque lines of the best tailor made garments that is why well fed artists of pencil and pen find in the griefs of the common people their most striking models but when the philistine would disport himself the grimness of melpomene herself attends upon his capers therefore danny set his jaw hard at easter and took his pleasure sadly the family entrance of dugan s caf e was feasible so danny yielded to the vernal season as far as a glass of bock seated in a dark linoleumed humid back room his heart and mind still groped after the mysterious meaning of the springtime jubilee say tim he said to the waiter why do they have easter skiddoo said tim closing a sophisticated eye is that a new one all right tony pastor s for you last night i guess i give it up what s the answer two apples or a yard and a half from dugan s danny turned back eastward the april sun seemed to stir in him a vague feeling that he could not construe he made a wrong diagnosis and decided that it was katy conlon a block from her house on avenue a he met her going to church they pumped hands on the corner gee but you look dumpish and dressed up said katy what s wrong come away with me to church and be cheerful what s doing at church asked danny why it s easter sunday silly i waited till after eleven expectin you might come around to go what does this easter stand for katy asked danny gloomily nobody seems to know nobody as blind as you said katy with spirit you haven t even looked at my new hat and skirt why it s when all the girls put on new spring clothes silly are you coming to church with me i will said danny if this easter is pulled off there they ought to be able to give some excuse for it not that the hat ain t a beauty the green roses are great at church the preacher did some expounding with no pounding he spoke rapidly for he was in a hurry to get home to his early sabbath dinner but he knew his business there was one word that controlled his theme resurrection not a new creation but a new life arising out of the old the congregation had heard it often before but there was a wonderful hat a combination of sweet peas and lavender in the sixth pew from the pulpit it attracted much attention after church danny lingered on a corner while katy waited with pique in her sky blue eyes are you coming along to the house she asked but don t mind me i ll get there all right you seem to be studyin a lot about something all right will i see you at any time specially mr mccree i ll be around wednesday night as usual said danny turning and crossing the street katy walked away with the green roses dangling indignantly danny stopped two blocks away he stood still with his hands in his pockets at the curb on the corner his face was that of a graven image deep in his soul something stirred so small so fine so keen and leavening that his hard fibres did not recognize it it was something more tender than the april day more subtle than the call of the senses purer and deeper rooted than the love of woman for had he not turned away from green roses and eyes that had kept him chained for a year and danny did not know what it was the preacher who was in a hurry to go to his dinner had told him but danny had had no libretto with which to follow the drowsy intonation but the preacher spoke the truth suddenly danny slapped his leg and gave forth a hoarse yell of delight hippopotamus he shouted to an elevated road pillar well how is that for a bum guess why blast my skylights i know what he was driving at now hippopotamus wouldn t that send you to the bronx it s been a year since he heard it and he didn t miss it so very far we quit at b c and this comes next well a wooden man wouldn t have guessed what he was trying to get out of him danny caught a crosstown car and went up to the rear flat that his labor supported old man mccree was still sitting by the window his extinct pipe lay on the sill will that be you lad he asked danny flared into the rage of a strong man who is surprised at the outset of committing a good deed who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house he snapped viciously have i no right to come in ye re a faithful lad said old man mccree with a sigh is it evening yet danny reached up on a shelf and took down a thick book labeled in gilt letters the history of greece dust was on it half an inch thick he laid it on the table and found a place in it marked by a strip of paper and then he gave a short roar at the top of his voice and said was it the hippopotamus you wanted to be read to about then did i hear ye open the book said old man mccree many and weary be the months since my lad has read it to me i dinno but i took a great likings to them greeks ye left off at a place tis a fine day outside lad be out and take rest from your work i have gotten used to me chair by the windy and me pipe pel peloponnesus was the place where we left off and not hippopotamus said danny the war began there it kept something doing for thirty years the headlines says that a guy named philip of macedon in b c got to be boss of greece by getting the decision at the battle of cher cheronaea i ll read it with his hand to his ear rapt in the peloponnesian war old man mccree sat for an hour listening then he got up and felt his way to the door of the kitchen mrs mccree was slicing cold meat she looked up tears were running from old man mccree s eyes do you hear our lad readin to me he said there is none finer in the land my two eyes have come back to me again after supper he said to danny tis a happy day this easter and now ye will be off to see katy in the evening well enough who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house said danny angrily have i no right to stay in it after supper there is yet to come the reading of the battle of corinth b c when the kingdom as they say became an in integral portion of the roman empire am i nothing in this house the fifth wheel the ranks of the bed line moved closer together for it was cold they were alluvial deposit of the stream of life lodged in the delta of fifth avenue and broadway the bed liners stamped their freezing feet looked at the empty benches in madison square whence jack frost had evicted them and muttered to one another in a confusion of tongues the flatiron building with its impious cloud piercing architecture looming mistily above them on the opposite delta might well have stood for the tower of babel whence these polyglot idlers had been called by the winged walking delegate of the lord standing on a pine box a head higher than his flock of goats the preacher exhorted whatever transient and shifting audience the north wind doled out to him it was a slave market fifteen cents bought you a man you deeded him to morpheus and the recording angel gave you credit the preacher was incredibly earnest and unwearied he had looked over the list of things one may do for one s fellow man and had assumed for himself the task of putting to bed all who might apply at his soap box on the nights of wednesday and sunday that left but five nights for other philanthropists to handle and had they done their part as well this wicked city might have become a vast arcadian dormitory where all might snooze and snore the happy hours away letting problem plays and the rent man and business go to the deuce the hour of eight was but a little while past sightseers in a small dark mass of pay ore were gathered in the shadow of general worth s monument now and then shyly ostentatiously carelessly or with conscientious exactness one would step forward and bestow upon the preacher small bills or silver then a lieutenant of scandinavian coloring and enthusiasm would march away to a lodging house with a squad of the redeemed all the while the preacher exhorted the crowd in terms beautifully devoid of eloquence splendid with the deadly accusative monotony of truth before the picture of the bed liners fades you must hear one phrase of the preacher s the one that formed his theme that night it is worthy of being stenciled on all the white ribbons in the world no man ever learned to be a drunkard on five cent whisky think of it tippler it covers the ground from the sprouting rye to the potter s field a clean profiled erect young man in the rear rank of the bedless emulated the terrapin drawing his head far down into the shell of his coat collar it was a well cut tweed coat and the trousers still showed signs of having flattened themselves beneath the compelling goose but conscientiously i must warn the milliner s apprentice who reads this expecting a reginald montressor in straits to peruse no further the young man was no other than thomas mcquade ex coachman discharged for drunkenness one month before and now reduced to the grimy ranks of the one night bed seekers if you live in smaller new york you must know the van smuythe family carriage drawn by the two pound to shot bays the carriage is shaped like a bath tub in each end of it reclines an old lady van smuythe holding a black sunshade the size of a new year s eve feather tickler before his downfall thomas mcquade drove the van smuythe bays and was himself driven by annie the van smuythe lady s maid but it is one of the saddest things about romance that a tight shoe or an empty commissary or an aching tooth will make a temporary heretic of any cupid worshiper and thomas s physical troubles were not few therefore his soul was less vexed with thoughts of his lost lady s maid than it was by the fancied presence of certain non existent things that his racked nerves almost convinced him were flying dancing crawling and wriggling on the asphalt and in the air above and around the dismal campus of the bed line army nearly four weeks of straight whisky and a diet limited to crackers bologna and pickles often guarantees a psycho zoological sequel thus desperate freezing angry beset by phantoms as he was he felt the need of human sympathy and intercourse the bed liner standing at his right was a young man of about his own age shabby but neat what s the diagnosis of your case freddy asked thomas with the freemasonic familiarity of the damned booze that s mine you don t look like a panhandler neither am i a month ago i was pushing the lines over the backs of the finest team of percheron buffaloes that ever made their mile down fifth avenue in and look at me now say how do you come to be at this bed bargain counter rummage sale the other young man seemed to welcome the advances of the airy ex coachman no said he mine isn t exactly a case of drink unless we allow that cupid is a bartender i married unwisely according to the opinion of my unforgiving relatives i ve been out of work for a year because i don t know how to work and i ve been sick in bellevue and other hospitals for months my wife and kid had to go back to her mother i was turned out of the hospital yesterday and i haven t a cent that s my tale of woe tough luck said thomas a man alone can pull through all right but i hate to see the women and kids get the worst of it just then there hummed up fifth avenue a motor car so splendid so red so smoothly running so craftily demolishing the speed regulations that it drew the attention even of the listless bed liners suspended and pinioned on its left side was an extra tire when opposite the unfortunate company the fastenings of this tire became loosed it fell to the asphalt bounded and rolled rapidly in the wake of the flying car thomas mcquade scenting an opportunity darted from his place among the preacher s goats in thirty seconds he had caught the rolling tire swung it over his shoulder and was trotting smartly after the car on both sides of the avenue people were shouting whistling and waving canes at the red car pointing to the enterprising thomas coming up with the lost tire one dollar thomas had estimated was the smallest guerdon that so grand an automobilist could offer for the service he had rendered and save his pride two blocks away the car had stopped there was a little brown muffled chauffeur driving and an imposing gentleman wearing a magnificent sealskin coat and a silk hat on a rear seat thomas proffered the captured tire with his best ex coachman manner and a look in the brighter of his reddened eyes that was meant to be suggestive to the extent of a silver coin or two and receptive up to higher denominations but the look was not so construed the sealskinned gentleman received the tire placed it inside the car gazed intently at the ex coachman and muttered to himself inscrutable words strange strange said he once or twice even i myself have fancied that the chaldean chiroscope has availed could it be possible then he addressed less mysterious words to the waiting and hopeful thomas sir i thank you for your kind rescue of my tire and i would ask you if i may a question do you know the family of van smuythes living in washington square north oughtn t i to replied thomas i lived there wish i did yet the sealskinned gentleman opened a door of the car step in please he said you have been expected thomas mcquade obeyed with surprise but without hesitation a seat in a motor car seemed better than standing room in the bed line but after the lap robe had been tucked about him and the auto had sped on its course the peculiarity of the invitation lingered in his mind maybe the guy hasn t got any change was his diagnosis lots of these swell rounders don t lug about any ready money guess he ll dump me out when he gets to some joint where he can get cash on his mug anyhow it s a cinch that i ve got that open air bed convention beat to a finish submerged in his greatcoat the mysterious automobilist seemed himself to marvel at the surprises of life wonderful amazing strange he repeated to himself constantly when the car had well entered the crosstown seventies it swung eastward a half block and stopped before a row of high stooped brownstone front houses be kind enough to enter my house with me said the sealskinned gentleman when they had alighted he s going to dig up sure reflected thomas following him inside there was a dim light in the hall his host conducted him through a door to the left closing it after him and leaving them in absolute darkness suddenly a luminous globe strangely decorated shone faintly in the centre of an immense room that seemed to thomas more splendidly appointed than any he had ever seen on the stage or read of in fairy tales the walls were hidden by gorgeous red hangings embroidered with fantastic gold figures at the rear end of the room were draped porti eres of dull gold spangled with silver crescents and stars the furniture was of the costliest and rarest styles the ex coachman s feet sank into rugs as fleecy and deep as snowdrifts there were three or four oddly shaped stands or tables covered with black velvet drapery thomas mcquade took in the splendors of this palatial apartment with one eye with the other he looked for his imposing conductor to find that he had disappeared b gee muttered thomas this listens like a spook shop shouldn t wonder if it ain t one of these moravian nights adventures that you read about wonder what became of the furry guy suddenly a stuffed owl that stood on an ebony perch near the illuminated globe slowly raised his wings and emitted from his eyes a brilliant electric glow with a fright born imprecation thomas seized a bronze statuette of hebe from a cabinet near by and hurled it with all his might at the terrifying and impossible fowl the owl and his perch went over with a crash with the sound there was a click and the room was flooded with light from a dozen frosted globes along the walls and ceiling the gold porti eres parted and closed and the mysterious automobilist entered the room he was tall and wore evening dress of perfect cut and accurate taste a vandyke beard of glossy golden brown rather long and wavy hair smoothly parted and large magnetic orientally occult eyes gave him a most impressive and striking appearance if you can conceive a russian grand duke in a rajah s throneroom advancing to greet a visiting emperor you will gather something of the majesty of his manner but thomas mcquade was too near his d t s to be mindful of his p s and q s when he viewed this silken polished and somewhat terrifying host he thought vaguely of dentists say doc said he resentfully that s a hot bird you keep on tap i hope i didn t break anything but i ve nearly got the williwalloos and when he threw them candle power lamps of his on me i took a snap shot at him with that little brass flatiron girl that stood on the sideboard that is merely a mechanical toy said the gentleman with a wave of his hand may i ask you to be seated while i explain why i brought you to my house perhaps you would not understand nor be in sympathy with the psychological prompting that caused me to do so so i will come to the point at once by venturing to refer to your admission that you know the van smuythe family of washington square north any silver missing asked thomas tartly any joolry displaced of course i know em any of the old ladies sunshades disappeared well i know em and then what the grand duke rubbed his white hands together softly wonderful he murmured wonderful shall i come to believe in the chaldean chiroscope myself let me assure you he continued that there is nothing for you to fear instead i think i can promise you that very good fortune awaits you we will see do they want me back asked thomas with something of his old professional pride in his voice i ll promise to cut out the booze and do the right thing if they ll try me again but how did you get wise doc b gee it s the swellest employment agency i was ever in with its flashlight owls and so forth with an indulgent smile the gracious host begged to be excused for two minutes he went out to the sidewalk and gave an order to the chauffeur who still waited with the car returning to the mysterious apartment he sat by his guest and began to entertain him so well by his witty and genial converse that the poor bed liner almost forgot the cold streets from which he had been so recently and so singularly rescued a servant brought some tender cold fowl and tea biscuits and a glass of miraculous wine and thomas felt the glamour of arabia envelop him thus half an hour sped quickly and then the honk of the returned motor car at the door suddenly drew the grand duke to his feet with another soft petition for a brief absence two women well muffled against the cold were admitted at the front door and suavely conducted by the master of the house down the hall through another door to the left and into a smaller room which was screened and segregated from the larger front room by heavy double porti eres here the furnishings were even more elegant and exquisitely tasteful than in the other on a gold inlaid rosewood table were scattered sheets of white paper and a queer triangular instrument or toy apparently of gold standing on little wheels the taller woman threw back her black veil and loosened her cloak she was fifty with a wrinkled and sad face the other young and plump took a chair a little distance away and to the rear as a servant or an attendant might have done you sent for me professor cherubusco said the elder woman wearily i hope you have something more definite than usual to say i ve about lost the little faith i had in your art i would not have responded to your call this evening if my sister had not insisted upon it madam said the professor with his princeliest smile the true art cannot fail to find the true psychic and potential branch sometimes requires time we have not succeeded i admint with the cards the crystal the stars the magic formulae of zarazin nor the oracle of po but we have at last discovered the true psychic route the chaldean chiroscope has been successful in our search the professor s voice had a ring that seemed to proclaim his belief in his own words the elderly lady looked at him with a little more interest why there was no sense in those words that it wrote with my hands on it she said what do you mean the words were these said professor cherubusco rising to his full magnificent height by the fifth wheel of the chariot he shall come i haven t seen many chariots said the lady but i never saw one with five wheels progress said the professor progress in science and mechanics has accomplished it though to be exact we may speak of it only as an extra tire progress in occult art has advanced in proportion madam i repeat that the chaldean chiroscope has succeeded i can not only answer the question that you have propounded but i can produce before your eyes the proof thereof and now the lady was disturbed both in her disbelief and in her poise o professor she cried anxiously when where has he been found do not keep me in suspense i beg you will excuse me for a very few minutes said professor cherubusco and i think i can demonstrate to you the efficacy of the true art thomas was contentedly munching the last crumbs of the bread and fowl when the enchanter appeared suddenly at his side are you willing to return to your old home if you are assured of a welcome and restoration to favor he asked with his courteous royal smile do i look bughouse answered thomas enough of the footback life for me but will they have me again the old lady is as fixed in her ways as a nut on a new axle my dear young man said the other she has been searching for you everywhere great said thomas i m on the job that team of dropsical domedaries they call horses is a handicap for a first class coachman like myself but i ll take the job back sure doc they re good people to be with and now a change came o er the suave countenance of the caliph of bagdad he looked keenly and suspiciously at the ex coachman may i ask what your name is he said shortly you ve been looking for me said thomas and don t know my name you re a funny kind of sleuth you must be one of the central office gumshoers i m thomas mcquade of course and i ve been chauffeur of the van smuythe elephant team for a year they fired me a month ago for well doc you saw what i did to your old owl i went broke on booze and when i saw the tire drop off your whiz wagon i was standing in that squad of hoboes at the worth monument waiting for a free bed now what s the prize for the best answer to all this to his intense surprise thomas felt himself lifted by the collar and dragged without a word of explanation to the front door this was opened and he was kicked forcibly down the steps with one heavy disillusionizing humiliating impact of the stupendous arabian s shoe as soon as the ex coachman had recovered his feet and his wits he hastened as fast as he could eastward toward broadway crazy guy was his estimate of the mysterious automobilist just wanted to have some fun kiddin i guess he might have dug up a dollar anyhow now i ve got to hurry up and get back to that gang of bum bed hunters before they all get preached to sleep when thomas reached the end of his two mile walk he found the ranks of the homeless reduced to a squad of perhaps eight or ten he took the proper place of a newcomer at the left end of the rear rank in a file in front of him was the young man who had spoken to him of hospitals and something of a wife and child sorry to see you back again said the young man turning to speak to him i hoped you had struck something better than this me said thomas oh i just took a run around the block to keep warm i see the public ain t lending to the lord very fast to night in this kind of weather said the young man charity avails itself of the proverb and both begins and ends at home and the preacher and his vehement lieutenant struck up a last hymn of petition to providence and man those of the bed liners whose windpipes still registered above degrees hopelessly and tunelessly joined in in the middle of the second verse thomas saw a sturdy girl with wind tossed drapery battling against the breeze and coming straight toward him from the opposite sidewalk annie he yelled and ran toward her you fool you fool she cried weeping and laughing and hanging upon his neck why did you do it the stuff explained thomas briefly you know but subsequently nit not a drop he led her to the curb how did you happen to see me i came to find you said annie holding tight to his sleeve oh you big fool professor cherubusco told us that we might find you here professor ch dont know the guy what saloon does he work in he s a clairvoyant thomas the greatest in the world he found you with the chaldean telescope he said he s a liar said thomas i never had it he never saw me have anybody s telescope and he said you came in a chariot with five wheels or something annie said thoms solicitously you re giving me the wheels now if i had a chariot i d have gone to bed in it long ago and without any singing and preaching for a nightcap either listen you big fool the missis says she ll take you back i begged her to but you must behave and you can go up to the house to night and your old room over the stable is ready great said thomas earnestly you are it annie but when did these stunts happen to night at professor cherubusco s he sent his automobile for the missis and she took me along i ve been there with her before what s the professor s line he s a clairvoyant and a witch the missis consults him he knows everything but he hasn t done the missis any good yet though she s paid him hundreds of dollars but he told us that the stars told him we could find you here what s the old lady want this cherry buster to do that s a family secret said annie and now you ve asked enough questions come on home you big fool they had moved but a little way up the street when thomas stopped got any dough with you annie he asked annie looked at him sharply oh i know what that look means said thomas you re wrong not another drop but there s a guy that was standing next to me in the bed line over there that s in bad shape he s the right kind and he s got wives or kids or something and he s on the sick list no booze if you could dig up half a dollar for him so he could get a decent bed i d like it annie s fingers began to wiggle in her purse sure i ve got money said she lots of it twelve dollars and then she added with woman s ineradicable suspicion of vicarious benevolence bring him here and let me see him first thomas went on his mission the wan bed liner came readily enough as the two drew near annie looked up from her purse and screamed mr walter oh mr walter is that you annie said the young man meekly oh mr walter and the missis hunting high and low for you does mother want to see me he asked with a flush coming out on his pale cheek she s been hunting for you high and low sure she wants to see you she wants you to come home she s tried police and morgues and lawyers and advertising and detectives and rewards and everything and then she took up clearvoyants you ll go right home won t you mr walter gladly if she wants me said the young man three years is a long time i suppose i ll have to walk up though unless the street cars are giving free rides i used to walk and beat that old plug team of bays we used to drive to the carriage have they got them yet they have said thomas feelingly and they ll have em ten years from now the life of the royal elephantibus truckhorseibus is one hundred and forty nine years i m the coachman just got my reappointment five minutes ago let s all ride up in a surface car that is er if annie will pay the fares on the broadway car annie handed each one of the prodigals a nickel to pay the conductor seems to me you are mighty reckless the way you throw large sums of money around said thomas sarcastically in that purse said annie decidedly is exactly i shall take every cent of it to morrow and give it to professor cherubusco the greatest man in the world well said thomas i guess he must be a pretty fly guy to pipe off things the way he does i m glad his spooks told him where you could find me if you ll give me his address some day i ll go up there myself and shake his hand presently thomas moved tentatively in his seat and thoughtfully felt an abrasion or two on his knees and his elbows say annie said he confidentially maybe it s one of the last dreams of booze but i ve a kind of a recollection of riding in authomobile with a swell guy that took me to a house full of eagles and arc lights he fed me on biscuits and hot air and then kicked me down the front steps if it was the d t s why am i so sore shut up you fool said annie if i could find that funny guy s house said thomas in conclusion i d go up there some day and punch his nose for him the poet and the peasant the other day a poet friend of mine who has lived in close communion with nature all his life wrote a poem and took it to an editor it was a living pastoral full of the genuine breath of the fields the song of birds and the pleasant chatter of trickling streams when the poet called again to see about it with hopes of a beefsteak dinner in his heart it was handed back to him with the comment too artificial several of us met over spaghetti and dutchess county chianti and swallowed indignation with slippery forkfuls and there we dug a pit for the editor with us was conant a well arrived writer of fiction a man who had trod on asphalt all his life and who had never looked upon bucolic scenes except with sensations of disgust from the windows of express trains conant wrote a poem and called it the doe and the brook it was a fine specimen of the kind of work you would expect from a poet who had strayed with amaryllis only as far as the florist s windows and whose sole ornithological discussion had been carried on with a waiter conant signed this poem and we sent it to the same editor but this has very little to do with the story just as the editor was reading the first line of the poem on the next morning a being stumbled off the west shore ferryboat and loped slowly up forty second street the invader was a young man with light blue eyes a hanging lip and hair the exact color of the little orphan s afterward discovered to be the earl s daughter in one of mr blaney s plays his trousers were corduroy his coat short sleeved with buttons in the middle of his back one bootleg was outside the corduroys you looked expectantly though in vain at his straw hat for ear holes its shape inaugurating the suspicion that it had been ravaged from a former equine possessor in his hand was a valise description of it is an impossible task a boston man would not have carried his lunch and law books to his office in it and above one ear in his hair was a wisp of hay the rustic s letter of credit his badge of innocence the last clinging touch of the garden of eden lingering to shame the gold brick men knowingly smilingly the city crowds passed him by they saw the raw stranger stand in the gutter and stretch his neck at the tall buildings at this they ceased to smile and even to look at him it had been done so often a few glanced at the antique valise to see what coney attraction or brand of chewing gum he might be thus dinning into his memory but for the most part he was ignored even the newsboys looked bored when he scampered like a circus clown out of the way of cabs and street cars at eighth avenue stood bunco harry with his dyed mustache and shiny good natured eyes harry was too good an artist not to be pained at the sight of an actor overdoing his part he edged up to the countryman who had stopped to open his mouth at a jewelry store window and shook his head too thick pal he said critically too thick by a couple of inches i don t know what your lay is but you ve got the properties too thick that hay now why they don t even allow that on proctor s circuit any more i don t understand you mister said the green one i m not lookin for any circus i ve just run down from ulster county to look at the town bein that the hayin s over with gosh but it s a whopper i thought poughkeepsie was some punkins but this here town is five times as big oh well said bunco harry raising his eyebrows i didn t mean to butt in you don t have to tell i thought you ought to tone down a little so i tried to put you wise wish you success at your graft whatever it is come and have a drink anyhow i wouldn t mind having a glass of lager beer acknowledged the other they went to a caf e frequented by men with smooth faces and shifty eyes and sat at their drinks i m glad i come across you mister said haylocks how d you like to play a game or two of seven up i ve got the keerds he fished them out of noah s valise a rare inimitable deck greasy with bacon suppers and grimy with the soil of cornfields bunco harry laughed loud and briefly not for me sport he said firmly i don t go against that make up of yours for a cent but i still say you ve overdone it the reubs haven t dressed like that since i doubt if you could work brooklyn for a key winding watch with that layout oh you needn t think i ain t got the money boasted haylocks he drew forth a tightly rolled mass of bills as large as a teacup and laid it on the table got that for my share of grandmother s farm he announced there s in that roll thought i d come to the city and look around for a likely business to go into bunco harry took up the roll of money and looked at it with almost respect in his smiling eyes i ve seen worse he said critically but you ll never do it in them clothes you want to get light tan shoes and a black suit and a straw hat with a colored band and talk a good deal about pittsburg and freight differentials and drink sherry for breakfast in order to work off phony stuff like that what s his line asked two or three shifty eyed men of bunco harry after haylocks had gathered up his impugned money and departed the queer i guess said harry or else he s one of jerome s men or some guy with a new graft he s too much hayseed maybe that his i wonder now oh no it couldn t have been real money haylocks wandered on thirst probably assailed him again for he dived into a dark groggery on a side street and bought beer at first sight of him their eyes brightened but when his insistent and exaggerated rusticity became apparent their expressions changed to wary suspicion haylocks swung his valise across the bar keep that a while for me mister he said chewing at the end of a virulent claybank cigar i ll be back after i knock around a spell and keep your eye on it for there s inside of it though maybe you wouldn t think so to look at me somewhere outside a phonograph struck up a band piece and haylocks was off for it his coat tail buttons flopping in the middle of his back divvy mike said the men hanging upon the bar winking openly at one another honest now said the bartender kicking the valise to one side you don t think i d fall to that do you anybody can see he ain t no jay one of mcadoo s come on squad i guess he s a shine if he made himself up there ain t no parts of the country now where they dress like that since they run rural free delivery to providence rhode island if he s got nine fifty in that valise it s a ninety eight cent waterbury that s stopped at ten minutes to ten when haylocks had exhausted the resources of mr edison to amuse he returned for his valise and then down broadway he gallivanted culling the sights with his eager blue eyes but still and evermore broadway rejected him with curt glances and sardonic smiles he was the oldest of the gags that the city must endure he was so flagrantly impossible so ultra rustic so exaggerated beyond the most freakish products of the barnyard the hayfield and the vaudeville stage that he excited only weariness and suspicion and the wisp of hay in his hair was so genuine so fresh and redolent of the meadows so clamorously rural that even a shellgame man would have put up his peas and folded his table at the sight of it haylocks seated himself upon a flight of stone steps and once more exhumed his roll of yellow backs from the valise the outer one a twenty he shucked off and beckoned to a newsboy son said he run somewhere and get this changed for me i m mighty nigh out of chicken feed i guess you ll get a nickel if you ll hurry up a hurt look appeared through the dirt on the newsy s face aw watchert ink g wan and get yer funny bill changed yerself dey ain t no farm clothes yer got on g wan wit yer stage money on a corner lounged a keen eyed steerer for a gambling house he was haylocks and his expression suddenly grew cold and virtuous mister said the rural one i ve heard of places in this here town where a fellow could have a good game of old sledge or peg a card at keno i got in this valise and i come down from old ulster to see the sights know where a fellow could get action on about or i m goin to have some sport and then maybe i ll buy out a business of some kind the steerer looked pained and investigated a white speck on his left forefinger nail cheese it old man he murmured reproachfully the central office must be bughouse to send you out looking like such a gillie you couldn t get within two blocks of a sidewalk crap game in them tony pastor props the recent mr scotty from death valley has got you beat a crosstown block in the way of elizabethan scenery and mechanical accessories let it be skiddoo for yours nay i know of no gilded halls where one may bet a patrol wagon on the ace rebuffed once again by the great city that is so swift to detect artificialities haylocks sat upon the curb and presented his thoughts to hold a conference it s my clothes said he durned if it ain t they think i m a hayseed and won t have nothin to do with me nobody never made fun of this hat in ulster county i guess if you want folks to notice you in new york you must dress up like they do so haylocks went shopping in the bazaars where men spake through their noses and rubbed their hands and ran the tape line ecstatically over the buldge in his inside pocket where reposed a red nubbin of corn with an even number of rows and messengers bearing parcels and boxes streamed to his hotel on broadway within the lights of long acre at o clock in the evening one descended to the sidewalk whom ulster county would have foresworn bright tan were his shoes his hat the latest block his light gray trousers were deeply creased a gay blue silk handkerchief flapped from the breast pocket of his elegant english walking coat his collar might have graced a laundry window his blond hair was trimmed close the wisp of hay was gone for an instant he stood resplendent with the leisurely air of a boulevardier concocting in his mind the route for his evening pleasures and then he turned down the gay bright street with the easy and graceful tread of a millionaire but in the instant that he had paused the wisest and keenest eyes in the city had enveloped him in their field of vision a stout man with gray eyes picked two of his friends with a lift of his eyebrows from the row of loungers in front of the hotel the juiciest jay i ve seen in six months said the man with gray eyes come along it was half past eleven when a man galloped into the west forty seventh street police station with the story of his wrongs nine hundred and fifty dollars he gasped all my share of grandmother s farm the desk seargeant wrung from him the name jabez bulltongue of locust valley farm ulster county and then bagan to take descriptions of the strong arm gentlemen when conant went to see the editor about the fate of his poem he was received over the head of the office boy into the inner office that is decorated with the statuettes by rodin and j g brown when i read the first line of the doe and the brook said the editor i knew it to be the work of one whose life has been heart to heart with nature the finished art of the line did not blind me to that fact to use a somewhat homely comparison it was as if a wild free child of the woods and fields were to don the garb of fashion and walk down broadway beneath the apparel the man would show thanks said conant i suppose the check will be round on thursday as usual the morals of this story have somehow gotten mixed you can take your choice of stay on the farm or don t write poetry the robe of peace mysteries follow one another so closely in a great city that the reading public and the friends of johnny bellchambers have ceased to marvel at his sudden and unexplained disappearance nearly a year ago this particular mystery has now been cleared up but the solution is so strange and incredible to the mind of the average man that only a select few who were in close touch with bellchambers will give it full credence johnny bellchambers as is well known belonged to the intrinsically inner circle of the elite without any of the ostentation of the fashionable ones who endeavor to attract notice by eccentric display of wealth and show he still was au fait in everything that gave deserved lustre to his high position in the ranks of society especially did he shine in the matter of dress in this he was the despair of imitators always correct exquisitely groomed and possessed of an unlimited wardrobe he was conceded to be the best dressed man in new york and therefore in america there was not a tailor in gotham who would not have deemed it a precious boon to have been granted the privilege of making bellchambers clothes without a cent of pay as he wore them they would have been a priceless advertisement trousers were his special passion here nothing but perfection would he notice he would have worn a patch as quickly as he would have overlooked a wrinkle he kept a man in his apartments always busy pressing his ample supply his friends said that three hours was the limit of time that he would wear these garments without exchanging bellchambers disappeared very suddenly for three days his absence brought no alarm to his friends and then they began to operate the usual methods of inquiry all of them failed he had left absolutely no trace behind then the search for a motive was instituted but none was found he had no enemies he had no debts there was no woman there were several thousand dollars in his bank to his credit he had never showed any tendency toward mental eccentricity in fact he was of a particularly calm and well balanced temperament every means of tracing the vanished man was made use of but without avail it was one of those cases more numerous in late years where men seem to have gone out like the flame of a candle leaving not even a trail of smoke as a witness in may tom eyres and lancelot gilliam two of bellchambers old friends went for a little run on the other side while pottering around in italy and switzerland they happened one day to hear of a monastery in the swiss alps that promised something outside of the ordinary tourist beguiling attractions the monastery was almost inaccessible to the average sightseer being on an extremely rugged and precipitous spur of the mountains the attractions it possessed but did not advertise were first an exclusive and divine cordial made by the monks that was said to far surpass benedictine and chartreuse next a huge brass bell so purely and accurately cast that it had not ceased sounding since it was first rung three hundred years ago finally it was asserted that no englishman had ever set foot within its walls eyres and gilliam decided that these three reports called for investigation it took them two days with the aid of two guides to reach the monastery of st gondrau it stood upon a frozen wind swept crag with the snow piled about it in treacherous drifting masses they were hospitably received by the brothers whose duty it was to entertain the infrequent guest they drank of the precious cordial finding it rarely potent and reviving they listened to the great ever echoing bell and learned that they were pioneer travelers in those gray stone walls over the englishman whose restless feet have trodden nearly every corner of the earth at three o clock on the afternoon they arrived the two young gothamites stood with good brother cristofer in the great cold hallway of the monastery to watch the monks march past on their way to the refectory they came slowly pacing by twos with their heads bowed treading noiselessly with sandaled feet upon the rough stone flags as the procession slowly filed past eyres suddenly gripped gilliam by the arm look he whispered eagerly at the one just opposite you now the one on this side with his hand at his waist if that isn t johnny bellchambers then i never saw him gilliam saw and recognized the lost glass of fashion what the deuce said he wonderingly is old bell doing here tommy it surely can t be he never heard of bell having a turn for the religious fact is i ve heard him say things when a four in hand didn t seem to tie up just right that would bring him up for court martial before any church it s bell without a doubt said eyres firmly or i m pretty badly in need of an oculist but think of johnny bellchambers the royal high chancellor of swell togs and the mahatma of pink teas up here in cold storage doing penance in a snuff colored bathrobe i can t get it straight in my mind let s ask the jolly old boy that s doing honors brother cristofer was appealed to for information by that time the monks had passed into the refectory he could not tell to which one they referred bellchambers ah the brothers of st gondrau abandoned their worldly names when they took the vows did the gentlemen wish to speak with one of the brothers if they would come to the refectory and indicate the one they wished to see the reverend abbot in authority would doubtless permit it eyres and gilliam went into the dining hall and pointed out to brother cristofer the man they had seen yes it was johnny bellchambers they saw his face plainly now as he sat among the dingy brothers never looking up eating broth from a coarse brown bowl permission to speak to one of the brothers was granted to the two travelers by the abbot and they waited in a reception room for him to come when he did come treading softly in his sandals both eyres and gilliam looked at him in perplexity and astonishment it was johnny bellchambers but he had a different look upon his smooth shaven face was an expression of ineffable peace of rapturous attainment of perfect and complete happiness his form was proudly erect his eyes shone with a serene and gracious light he was as neat and well groomed as in the old new york days but how differently was he clad now he seemed clothed in but a single garment a long robe of rough brown cloth gathered by a cord at the waist and falling in straight loose folds nearly to his feet he shook hands with his visitors with his old ease and grace of manner if there was any embarrassment in that meeting it was not manifested by johnny bellchambers the room had no seats they stood to converse glad to see you old man said eyres somewhat awkwardly wasn t expecting to find you up here not a bad idea though after all society s an awful sham must be a relief to shake the giddy whirl and retire to er contemplation and er prayer and hymns and those things oh cut that tommy said bellchambers cheerfully don t be afraid that i ll pass around the plate i go through these thing um bobs with the rest of these old boys because they are the rules i m brother ambrose here you know i m given just ten minutes to talk to you fellows that s rather a new design in waistcoats you have on isn t it gilliam are they wearing those things on broadway now it s the same old johnny said gilliam joyfully what the devil i mean why oh confound it what did you do it for old man peel the bathrobe pleaded eyres almost tearfully and go back with us the old crowd ll go wild to see you this isn t in your line bell i know half a dozen girls that wore the willow on the quiet when you shook us in that unaccountable way hand in your resignation or get a dispensation or whatever you have to do to get a release from this ice factory you ll get catarrh here johnny and my god you haven t any socks on bellchambers looked down at his sandaled feet and smiled you fellows don t understand he said soothingly it s nice of you to want me to go back but the old life will never know me again i have reached here the goal of all my ambitions i am entirely happy and contented here i shall remain for the remainder of my days you see this robe that i wear bellchambers caressingly touched the straight hanging garment at last i have found something that will not bag at the knees i have attained at that moment the deep boom of the great brass bell reverberated through the monastery it must have been a summons to immediate devotions for brother ambrose bowed his head turned and left the chamber without another word a slight wave of his hand as he passed through the stone doorway seemed to say a farewell to his old friends they left the monastery without seeing him again and this is the story that tommy eyres and lancelot gilliam brought back with them from their latest european tour the girl and the graft the other day i ran across my old friend ferguson pogue pogue is a conscientious grafter of the highest type his headquarters is the western hemisphere and his line of business is anything from speculating in town lots on the great staked plains to selling wooden toys in connecticut made by hydraulic pressure from nutmegs ground to a pulp now and then when pogue has made a good haul he comes to new york for a rest he says the jug of wine and loaf of bread and thou in the wilderness business is about as much rest and pleasure to him as sliding down the bumps at coney would be to president taft give me says pogue a big city for my vacation especially new york i m not much fond of new yorkers and manhattan is about the only place on the globe where i don t find any while in the metropolis pogue can always be found at one of two places one is a little second hand bookshop on fourth avenue where he reads books about his hobbies mahometanism and taxidermy i found him at the other his hall bedroom in eighteenth street where he sat in his stocking feet trying to pluck the banks of the wabash out of a small zither four years he has practised this tune without arriving near enough to cast the longest trout line to the water s edge on the dresser lay a blued steel colt s forty five and a tight roll of tens and twenties large enough around to belong to the spring rattlesnake story class a chambermaid with a room cleaning air fluttered nearby in the hall unable to enter or to flee scandalized by the stocking feet aghast at the colt s yet powerless with her metropolitan instincts to remove herself beyond the magic influence of the yellow hued roll i sat on his trunk while ferguson pogue talked no one could be franker or more candid in his conversation beside his expression the cry of henry james for lacteal nourishment at the age of one month would have seemed like a chaldean cryptogram he told me stories of his profession with pride for he considered it an art and i was curious enough to ask him whether he had known any women who followed it ladies said pogue with western chivalry well not to any great extent they don t amount to much in special lines of graft because they re all so busy in general lines what why they have to who s got the money in the world the men did you ever know a man to give a woman a dollar without any consideration a man will shell out his dust to another man free and easy and gratis but if he drops a penny in one of the machines run by the madam eve s daughters amalgamated association and the pineapple chewing gum don t fall out when he pulls the lever you can hear him kick to the superintendent four blocks away man is the hardest proposition a woman has to go up against he s the low grade one and she has to work overtime to make him pay two times out of five she s salted she can t put in crushers and costly machinery he d notice em and be onto the game they have to pan out what they get and it hurts their tender hands some of em are natural sluice troughs and can carry out to the ton the dry eyed ones have to depend on signed letters false hair sympathy the kangaroo walk cowhide whips ability to cook sentimental juries conversational powers silk underskirts ancestry rouge anonymous letters violet sachet powders witnesses revolvers pneumatic forms carbolic acid moonlight cold cream and the evening newspapers you are outrageous ferg i said surely there is none of this graft as you call it in a perfect and harmonious matrimonial union well said pogue nothing that would justify you every time in calling police headquarters and ordering out the reserves and a vaudeville manager on a dead run but it s this way suppose you re a fifth avenue millionaire soaring high on the right side of copper and cappers you come home at night and bring a diamond brooch to the lady who s staked your for a claim you hand it over she says oh george and looks to see if it s backed she comes up and kisses you you ve waited for it you get it all right it s graft but i m telling you about artemisia blye she was from kansas and she suggested corn in all of its phases her hair was as yellow as the silk her form was as tall and graceful as a stalk in the low grounds during a wet summer her eyes were as big and startling as bunions and green was her favorite color on my last trip into the cool recesses of your sequestered city i met a human named vaucross he was worth that is he had a million he told me he was in business on the street a sidewalk merchant says i sarcastic exactly says he senior partner of a paving concern i kind of took to him for this reason i met him on broadway one night when i was out of heart luck tobacco and place he was all silk hat diamonds and front he was all front if you had gone behind him you would have only looked yourself in the face i looked like a cross between count tolstoy and a june lobster i was out of luck i had but let me lay my eyes on that dealer again vaucross stopped and talked to me a few minutes and then he took me to a high toned restaurant to eat dinner there was music and then some beethoven and bordelaise sauce and cussing in french and frangipangi and some hauteur and cigarettes when i am flush i know them places i declare i must have looked as bad as a magazine artist sitting there without any money and my hair all rumpled like i was booked to read a chapter from elsie s school days at a brooklyn bohemian smoker but vaucross treated me like a bear hunter s guide he wasn t afraid of hurting the waiter s feelings mr pogue he explains to me i am using you go on says i i hope you don t wake up and then he tells me you know the kind of man he was he was a new yorker his whole ambition was to be noticed he wanted to be conspicuous he wanted people to point him out and bow to him and tell others who he was he said it had been the desire of his life always he didn t have but a million so he couldn t attract attention by spending money he said he tried to get into public notice one time by planting a little public square on the east side with garlic for free use of the poor but carnegie heard of it and covered it over at once with a library in the gaelic language three times he had jumped in the way of automibiles but the only result was five broken ribs and a notice in the papers that an unknown man five feet ten with four amalgam filled teeth supposed to be the last of the famous red leary gang had been run over ever try the reporters i asked him last month says mr vaucross my expenditure for lunches to reporters was get anything out of that i asks that reminds me says he add for perpsin yes i got indigestion how am i supposed to push along your scramble for prominence i inquires contrast something of that sort to night says vaucross it grieves me but i am forced to resort to eccentricity and here he drops his napkin in his soup and rises up and bows to a gent who is devastating a potato under a palm across the room the police commissioner says my climber gratified friend says i in a hurry have ambitions but don t kick a rung out of your ladder when you use me as a stepping stone to salute the police you spoil my appetite on the grounds that i may be degraded and incriminated be thoughtful at the quaker city squab en casserole the idea about artemisia blye comes to me suppose i can manage to get you in the papers says i a column or two every day in all of em and your picture in most of em for a week how much would it be worth to you ten thousand dollars says vaucross warm in a minute but no murder says he and i won t wear pink pants at a cotillon i wouldn t ask you to says i this is honorable stylish and uneffiminate tell the waiter to bring a demi tasse and some other beans and i will disclose to you the opus moderandi we closed the deal an hour later in the rococo rouge et noise room i telegraphed that night to miss artemisia in salina she took a couple of photographs and an autograph letter to an elder in the fourth presbyterian church in the morning and got some transportation and she stopped in topeka long enough to trade a flashlight interior and a valentine to the vice president of a trust company for a mileage book and a package of five dollar notes with scrawled on the band the fifth evening after she got my wire she was waiting all d ecollet ee and dressed up for me and vaucross to take her to dinner in one of these new york feminine apartment houses where a man can t get in unless he plays bezique and smokes depilatory powder cigarettes she s a stunner says vaucross when he saw her they ll give her a two column cut sure this was the scheme the three of us concocted it was business straight through vaucross was to rush miss blye with all the style and display and emotion he could for a month of course that amounted to nothing as far as his ambitions were concerned the sight of a man in a white tie and patent leather pumps pouring greenbacks through the large end of a cornucopia to purchase nutriment and heartsease for tall willowy blondes in new york is as common a sight as blue turtles in delirium tremens but he was to write her love letters the worst kind of love letters such as your wife publishes after you are dead every day at the end of the month he was to drop her and she would bring suit for for breach of promise miss artemisia was to get if she won the suit that was all and if she lost she was to get it anyhow there was a signed contract to that effect sometimes they had me out with em but not often i couldn t keep up to their style she used to pull out his notes and criticize them like bills of lading say you she d say what do you call this letter to a hardware merchant from his nephew on learning that his aunt has nettlerash you eastern duffers know as much about writing love letters as a kansas grasshopper does about tugboats my dear miss blye wouldn t that put pink icing and a little red sugar bird on your bridal cake how long do you expect to hold an audience in a court room with that kind of stuff you want to get down to business and call me tweedlums babe and honeysuckle and sing yourself mama s own big bad puggy wuggy boy if you want any limelight to concentrate upon your sparse gray hairs get sappy after that vaucross dipped his pen in the indelible tabasco his notes read like something or other in the original i could see a jury sitting up and women tearing one another s hats to hear em read and i could see piling up for mr vaucross as much notoriousness as archbishop crammer or the brooklyn bridge or cheese on salad ever enjoyed he seemed mighty pleased at the prospects they agreed on a night and i stood on fifth avenue outside a solemn restaurant and watched em a process server walked in and handed vaucross the papers at this table everybody looked at em and he looked as proud as cicero i went back to my room and lit a five cent cigar for i knew the was as good as ours about two hours later somebody knocked at my door there stood vaucross and miss artemisia and she was clinging yes sir clinging to his arm and they tells me they d been out and got married and they articulated some trivial cadences about love and such and they laid down a bundle on the table and said good night and left and that s why i say concluded ferguson pogue that a woman is too busy occupied with her natural vocation and instinct of graft such as is given her for self preservation and amusement to make any great success in special lines what was in the bundle they left i asked with my usual curiosity why said ferguson there was a scalper s railroad ticket as far as kansas city and two pairs of mr vaucross s old pants the call of the tame when the inauguration was accomplished the proceedings were made smooth by the presence of the rough riders it is well known that a herd of those competent and loyal ex warrriors paid a visit to the big city the newspaper reporters dug out of their trunks the old broad brimmed hats and leather belts that they wear to north beach fish fries and mixed with the visitors no damage was done beyond the employment of the wonderful plural tenderfeet in each of the scribe s stories the westerners mildly contemplated the skyscrapers as high as the third story yawned at broadway hunched down in the big chairs in hotel corridors and altogether looked as bored and dejected as a member of ye ancient and honorable artillery separated during a sham battle from his valet out of this sightseeing delegations of good king teddy s gentlemen of the royal bear hounds dropped one greenbrier nye of pin feather ariz the daily cyclone of sixth avenue s rush hour swept him away from the company of his pardners true the dust from a thousand rustling skirts filled his eyes the mighty roar of trains rushing across the sky deafened him the lightning flash of twice ten hundred beaming eyes confused his vision the storm was so sudden and tremendous that greenbrier s first impulse was to lie down and grab a root and then he remembered that the disturbance was human and not elemental and he backed out of it with a grin into a doorway the reporters had written that but for the widebrimmed hats the west was not visible upon these gauchos of the north heaven sharpen their eyes the suit of black diagonal wrinkled in impossible places the bright blue four in hand factory tied the low turned down collar pattern of the days of seymour and blair white glazed as the letters on the window of the open day and night except sunday restaurants the out curve at the knees from the saddle grip the peculiar spread of the half closed right thumb and fingers from the stiff hold upon the circling lasso the deeply absorbed weather tan that the hottest sun of cape may can never equal the seldom winking blue eyes that unconsciously divided the rushing crowds into fours as though they were being counted out of a corral the segregated loneliness and solemnity of expression as of an emperor or of one whose horizons have not intruded upon him nearer than a day s ride these brands of the west were set upon greenbrier nye oh yes he wore a broadbrimmed hat gentle reader just like those the madison square post office mail carriers wear when they go up to bronx park on sunday afternoons suddenly greenbrier nye jumped into the drifting herd of metropolitan cattle seized upon a man dragged him out of the stream and gave him a buffet upon his collarbone that sent him reeling against a wall the victim recovered his hat with the angry look of a new yorker who has suffered an outrage and intends to write to the trib about it but he looked at his assailant and knew that the blow was in consideration of love and affection after the manner of the west which greets its friends with contumely and uproar and pounding fists and receives its enemies in decorum and order such as the judicious placing of the welcoming bullet demands god in the mountains cried greenbrier holding fast to the foreleg of his cull can this be longhorn merritt the other man was oh look on broadway any day for the pattern business man latest rolled brim derby good barber business digestion and tailor greenbrier nye he exclaimed grasping the hand that had smitten him my dear fellow so glad to see you how did you come to oh to be sure the inaugural ceremonies i remember you joined the rough riders you must come and have luncheon with me of course greenbrier pinned him sadly but firmly to the wall with a hand the size shape and color of a mcclellan saddle longy he said in a melancholy voice that disturbed traffic what have they been doing to you you act just like a citizen they done made you into an inmate of the city directory you never made no such johnny branch execration of yourself as that out on the gila come and have lunching with me you never defined grub by any such terms of reproach in them days i ve been living in new york seven years said merritt it s been eight since we punched cows together in old man garcia s outfit well let s go to a caf e anyhow it sounds good to hear it called grub again they picked their way through the crowd to a hotel and drifted as by a natural law to the bar speak up invited greenbrier a dry martini said merritt oh lord cried greenbrier and yet me and you once saw the same pink gila monsters crawling up the walls of the same hotel in canon diablo a dry but let that pass whiskey straight and they re on you merritt smiled and paid they lunched in a small extension of the dining room that connected with the caf e merritt dexterously diverted his friend s choice that hovered over ham and eggs to a pur ee of celery a salmon cutlet a partridge pie and a desirable salad on the day said greenbrier grieved and thunderous when i can t hold but one drink before eating when i meet a friend i ain t seen in eight years at a by table in a thirty cent town at o clock on the third day of the week i want nine broncos to kick me forty times over a acre section of land get them statistics right old man laughed merritt waiter bring an absinthe frapp e and what s yours greenbrier whiskey straight mourned nye out of the neck of a bottle you used to take it longy straight out of the neck of a bottle on a galloping pony arizona redeye not this ab oh what s the use they re on you merritt slipped the wine card under his glass all right i suppose you think i m spoiled by the city i m as good a westerner as you are greenbrier but somehow i can t make up my mind to go back out there new york is comfortable comfortable i make a good living and i live it no more wet blankets and riding herd in snowstorms and bacon and cold coffee and blowouts once in six months for me i reckon i ll hang out here in the future we ll take in the theatre to night greenbrier and after that we ll dine at i ll tell you what you are merritt said greenbrier laying one elbow in his salad and the other in his butter you are a concentrated effete unconditional short sleeved gotch eared miss sally walker god made you perpendicular and suitable to ride straddle and use cuss words in the original wherefore you have suffered his handiwork to elapse by removing yourself to new york and putting on little shoes tied with strings and making faces when you talk i ve seen you rope and tie a steer in if you was to see one now you d write to the police commissioner about it and these flapdoodle drinks that you inoculate your system with these little essences of cowslip with acorns in em and paregoric flip they ain t anyways in assent with the cordiality of manhood i hate to see you this way well mr greenbrier said merritt with apology in his tone in a way you are right sometimes i do feel like i was being raised on the bottle but i tell you new york is comfortable comfortable there s something about it the sights and the crowds and the way it changes every day and the very air of it that seems to tie a one mile long stake rope around a man s neck with the other end fastened somewhere about thirty fourth street i don t know what it is god knows said greenbrier sadly and i know the east has gobbled you up you was venison and now you re veal you put me in mind of a japonica in a window you ve been signed sealed and diskivered requiescat in hoc signo you make me thirsty a green chartreuse here said merritt to the waiter whiskey straight sighed greenbrier and they re on you you renegade of the round ups guilty with an application for mercy said merritt you don t know how it is greenbrier it s so comfortable here that please loan me your smelling salts pleaded greenbrier if i hadn t seen you once bluff three bluffers from mazatzal city with an empty gun in phoenix greenbrier s voice died away in pure grief cigars he called harshly to the waiter to hide his emotion a pack of turkish cigarettes for mine said merritt they re on you chanted greenbrier struggling to conceal his contempt at seven they dined in the where to dine well column that evening a galaxy had assembled there bright shone the lights o er fair women and br let it go anyhow brave men the orchestra played charmingly hardly had a tip from a diner been placed in its hands by a waiter when it would burst forth into soniferousness the more beer you contributed to it the more meyerbeer it gave you which is reciprocity merritt put forth exertions on the dinner greenbrier was his old friend and he liked him he persuaded him to drink a cocktail i take the horehound tea said greenbrier for old times sake but i d prefer whiskey straight they re on you right said merritt now run your eye down that bill of fare and see if it seems to hitch on any of these items lay me on my lava bed said greenbrier with bulging eyes all these specimens of nutriment in the grub wagon what s this horse with the heaves i pass but look along here s truck for twenty roundups all spelled out in different directions wait till i see the viands ordered merritt turned to the wine list this medoc isn t bad he suggested you re the doc said greenbrier i d rather have whiskey straight it s on you greenbrier looked around the room the waiter brought things and took dishes away he was observing he saw a new york restaurant crowd enjoying itself how was the range when you left the gila asked merritt fine said greenbrier you see that lady in the red speckled silk at that table well she could warm over her beans at my campfire yes the range was good she looks as nice as a white mustang i see once on black river when the coffee came greenbrier put one foot on the seat of the chair next to him you said it was a comfortable town longy he said meditatively yes it s a comfortable town it s different from the plains in a blue norther what did you call that mess in the crock with the handle longy oh yes squabs in a cash roll they re worth the roll that white mustang had just such a way of turning his head and shaking his mane look at her longy if i thought i could sell out my ranch at a fair price i believe i d gyar song he suddenly cried in a voice that paralyzed every knife and fork in the restaurant the waiter dived toward the table two more of them cocktail drinks ordered greenbrier merritt looked at him and smiled significantly they re on me said greenbrier blowing a puff of smoke to the ceiling the unknown quantity the poet longfellow or was it confucius the inventor of wisdom remarked life is real life is earnest and things are not what they seem as mathematics are or is thanks old subscriber the only just rule by which questions of life can be measured let us by all means adjust our theme to the straight edge and the balanced column of the great goddess two and two makes four figures unassailable sums in addition shall be set over against whatever oposing element there may be a mathematician after scanning the above two lines of poetry would say ahem young gentlemen if we assume that x plus that is that life is real then things all of which life includes are real anything that is real is what it seems then if we consider the proposition that things are not what they seem why but this is heresy and not poesy we woo the sweet nymph algebra we would conduct you into the presence of the elusive seductive pursued satisfying mysterious x not long before the beginning of this century septimus kinsolving an old new yorker invented an idea he originated the discovery that bread is made from flour and not from wheat futures perceiving that the flour crop was short and that the stock exchange was having no perceptible effect on the growing wheat mr kinsolving cornered the flour market the result was that when you or my landlady before the war she never had to turn her hand to anything southerners accomodated bought a five cent load of bread you laid down an additional two cents which went to mr kinsolving as a testimonial to his perspicacity a second result was that mr kinsolving quit the game with prof er rake off mr kinsolving s son dan was at college when the mathematical experiment in breadstuffs was made dan came home during vacation and found the old gentleman in a red dressing gown reading little dorrit on the porch of his estimable red brick mansion in washington square he had retired from business with enough extra two cent pieces from bread buyers to reach if laid side by side fifteen times around the earth and lap as far as the public debt of paraguay dan shook hands with his father and hurried over to greenwich village to see his old high school friend kenwitz dan had always admired kenwitz kenwitz was pale curly haired intense serious mathematical studious altruistic socialistic and the natural foe of oligarchies kenwitz had foregone college and was learning watch making in his father s jewelry store dan was smiling jovial easy tempered and tolerant alike of kings and ragpickers the two foregathered joyously being opposites and then dan went back to college and kenwitz to his mainsprings and to his private library in the rear of the jewelry shop four years later dan came back to washington square with the accumulations of b a and two years of europe thick upon him he took a filial look at septimus kinsolving s elaborate tombstone in greenwood and a tedious excursion through typewritten documents with the family lawyer and then feeling himself a lonely and hopeless millionaire hurried down to the old jewelry store across sixth avenue kenwitz unscrewed a magnifying glass from his eye routed out his parent from a dingy rear room and abandoned the interior of watches for outdoors he went with dan and they sat on a bench in washington square dan had not changed much he was stalwart and had a dignity that was inclined to relax into a grin kenwitz was more serious more intense more learned philosophical and socialistic i know about it now said dan finally i pumped it out of the eminent legal lights that turned over to me poor old dad s collections of bonds and boodle it amounts to ken and i am told that he squeezed it out of the chaps that pay their pennies for loaves of bread at little bakeries around the corner you ve studied economics dan and you know all about monopolies and the masses and octopuses and the rights of laboring people i never thought about those things before football and trying to be white to my fellowman were about the extent of my college curriculum but since i came back and found out how dad made his money i ve been thinking i d like awfully well to pay back those chaps who had to give up too much money for bread i know it would buck the line of my income for a good many yards but i d like to make it square with em is there any way it can be done old ways and means kenwitz s big black eyes glowed fierily his thin intellectual face took on almost a sardonic cast he caught dan s arm with the grip of a friend and a judge you can t do it he said emphatically one of the chief punishments of you men of ill gotten wealth is that when you do repent you find that you have lost the power to make reparation or restitution i admire your good intentions dan but you can t do anything those people were robbed of their precious pennies it s too late to remedy the evil you can t pay them back of course said dan lighting his pipe we couldn t hunt up every one of the duffers and hand em back the right change there s an awful lot of em buying bread all the time funny taste they have i never cared for bread especially except for a toasted cracker with the roquefort but we might find a few of em and chuck some of dad s cash back where it came from i d feel better if i could it seems tough for people to be held up for a soggy thing like bread one wouldn t mind standing a rise in broiled lobsters or deviled crabs get to work and think ken i want to pay back all that money i can there are plenty of charities said kenwitz mechanically easy enough said dan in a cloud of smoke i suppose i could give the city a park or endow an asparagus bed in a hospital but i don t want paul to get away with the proceeds of the gold brick we sold peter it s the bread shorts i want to cover ken the thin fingers of kenwitz moved rapidly do you know how much money it would take to pay back the losses of consumers during that corner in flour he asked i do not said dan stoutly my lawyer tells me that i have two millions if you had a hundred millions said kenwitz vehemently you couldn t repair a thousandth part of the damage that has been done you cannot conceive of the accumulated evils produced by misapplied wealth each penny that was wrung from the lean purses of the poor reacted a thousandfold to their harm you do not understand you do not see how hopeless is your desire to make restitution not in a single instance can it be done back up philosopher said dan the penny has no sorrow that the dollar cannot heal not in one instance repeated kenwitz i will give you one and let us see thomas boyne had a little bakery over there in varick street he sold bread to the poorest people when the price of flour went up he had to raise the price of bread his customers were too poor to pay it boyne s business failed and he lost his capital all he had in the world dan kinsolving struck the park bench a mighty blow with his fist i accept the instance he cried take me to boyne i will repay his thousand dollars and buy him a new bakery write your check said kenwitz without moving and then begin to write checks in payment of the train of consequences draw the next one for boyne went insane after his failure and set fire to the building from which he was about to be evicted the loss amounted to that much boyne died in an asylum stick to the instance said dan i haven t noticed any insurance companies on my charity list draw your next check for went on kenwitz boyne s son fell into bad way after the bakery closed and was accused of murder he was acquitted last week after a three years legal battle and the state draws upon taxpayers for that much expense back to the bakery exclaimed dan impatiently the government doesn t need to stand in the bread line the last item of the instance is come and i will show you said kenwitz rising the socialistic watchmaker was happy he was a millionaire baiter by nature and a pessimist by trade kenwitz would assure you in one breath that money was but evil and corruption and that your brand new watch needed cleaning and a new ratchet wheel he conducted kinsolving southward out of the square and into ragged poverty haunted varick street up the narrow stairway of a squalid brick tenement he led the penitent offspring of the octupus he knocked on a door and a clear voice called to them to enter in that almost bare room a young woman sat sewing at a machine she nodded to kenwitz as to a familiar acquaintance one little stream of sunlight through the dingy window burnished her heavy hair to the color of an ancient tuscan s shield she flashed a rippling smile at kenwitz and a look of somewhat flustered inquiry kinsolving stood regarding her clear and pathetic beauty in heart throbbing silence thus they came into the presence of the last item of the instance how many this week miss mary asked the watchmaker a mountain of coarse gray shirts lay upon the floor nearly thirty dozen said the young woman cheerfully i ve made almost i m improving mr kenwitz i hardly know what to do with so much money her eyes turned brightly soft in the direction of dan a little pink spot came out on her round pale cheek kenwitz chuckled like a diabolic raven miss boyne he said let me present mr kinsolving the son of the man who put bread up five years ago he thinks he would like to do something to aid those who where inconvenienced by that act the smile left the young woman s face she rose and pointed her forefinger toward the door this time she looked kinsolving straight in the eye but it was not a look that gave delight the two men went down varick street kenwitz letting all his pessimism and rancor and hatred of the octopus come to the surface gibed at the moneyed side of his friend in an acrid torrent of words dan appeared to be listening and then turned to kenwitz and shook hands with him warmly i m obliged to you ken old man he said vaguely a thousand times obliged mein gott you are crazy cried the watchmaker dropping his spectacles for the first time in years two months afterward kenwitz went into a large bakery on lower broadway with a pair of gold rimmed eyeglasses that he had mended for the proprietor a lady was giving an order to a clerk as kenwitz passed her these loaves are ten cents said the clerk i always get them at eight cents uptown said the lady you need not fill the order i will drive by there on my way home the voice was familiar the watchmaker paused mr kenwitz cried the lady heartily how do you do kenwitz was trying to train his socialistic and economic comprehension on her wonderful fur boa and the carriage waiting outside why miss boyne he began mrs kinsolving she corrected dan and i were married a month ago the thing s the play being acquainted with a newspaper reporter who had a couple of free passes i got to see the performance a few nights ago at one of the popular vaudeville houses one of the numbers was a violin solo by a striking looking man not much past forty but with very gray thick hair not being afflicted with a taste for music i let the system of noises drift past my ears while i regarded the man there was a story about that chap a month or two ago said the reporter they gave me the assignment it was to run a column and was to be on the extremely light and joking order the old man seems to like the funny touch i give to local happenings oh yes i m working on a farce comedy now well i went down to the house and got all the details but i certainly fell down on that job i went back and turned in a comic write up of an east side funeral instead why oh i couldn t seem to get hold of it with my funny hooks somehow maybe you could make a one act tragedy out of it for a curtain raiser i ll give you the details after the performance my friend the reporter recited to me the facts over w urzburger i see no reason said i when he had concluded why that shouldn t make a rattling good funny story those three people couldn t have acted in a more absurd and preposterous manner if they had been real actors in a real theatre i m really afraid that all the stage is a world anyhow and all the players men and women the thing s the play is the way i quote mr shakespeare try it said the reporter i will said i and i did to show him how he could have made a humorous column of it for his paper there stands a house near abingdon square on the ground floor there has been for twenty five years a little store where toys and notions and stationery are sold one night twenty years ago there was a wedding in the rooms above the store the widow mayo owned the house and store her daughter helen was married to frank barry john delaney was best man helen was eighteen and her picture had been printed in a morning paper next to the headlines of a wholesale female murderess story from butte mont but after your eye and intelligence had rejected the connection you seized your magnifying glass and read beneath the portrait her description as one of a series of prominent beauties and belles of the lower west side frank barry and john delaney were prominent young beaux of the same side and bosom friends whom you expected to turn upon each other every time the curtain went up one who pays his money for orchestra seats and fiction expects this that is the first funny idea that has turned up in the story yet both had made a great race for helen s hand when frank won john shook his hand and congratulated him honestly he did after the ceremony helen ran upstairs to put on her hat she was getting married in a traveling dress she and frank were going to old point comfort for a week downstairs the usual horde of gibbering cave dwellers were waiting with their hands full of old congress gaiters and paper bags of hominy then there was a rattle of the fire escape and into her room jumps the mad and infatuated john delaney with a damp curl drooping upon his forehead and made violent and reprehensible love to his lost one entreating her to flee or fly with him to the riviera or the bronx or any old place where there are italian skies and dolce far niente it would have carried blaney off his feet to see helen repulse him with blazing and scornful eyes she fairly withered him by demanding whatever he meant by speaking to respectable people that way in a few moments she had him going the manliness that had possessed him departed he bowed low and said something about irresistible impulse and forever carry in his heart the memory of and she suggested that he catch the first fire escape going down i will away said john delaney to the furthermost parts of the earth i cannot remain near you and know that you are another s i will to africa and there amid other scenes strive to for for goodness sake get out said helen somebody might come in he knelt upon one knee and she extended him one white hand that he might give it a farewell kiss girls was this choice boon of the great little god cupid ever vouchsafed you to have the fellow you want hard and fast and have the one you don t want come with a damp curl on his forehead and kneel to you and babble of africa and love which in spite of everything shall forever bloom an amaranth in his heart to know your power and to feel the sweet security of your own happy state to send the unlucky one broken hearted to foreign climes while you congratulate yourself as he presses his last kiss upon your knuckles that your nails are well manicured say girls it s galluptious don t ever let it get by you and then of course how did you guess it the door opened and in stalked the bridegroom jealous of slow tying bonnet strings the farewell kiss was imprinted upon helen s hand and out of the window and down the fire escape sprang john delaney africa bound a little slow music if you please faint violin just a breath in the clarinet and a touch of the cello imagine the scene frank white hot with the cry of a man wounded to death bursting from him helen rushing and clinging to him trying to explain he catches her wrists and tears them from his shoulders once twice thrice he sways her this way and that the stage manager will show you how and throws her from him to the floor a huddled crushed moaning thing never he cries will he look upon her face again and rushes from the house through the staring groups of astonished guests and now because it is the thing instead of the play the audience must stroll out into the real lobby of the world and marry die grow gray rich poor happy or sad during the intermission of twenty years which must precede the rising of the curtain again mrs barry inherited the shop and the house at thirty eight she could have bested many an eighteen year old at a beauty show on points and general results only a few people remembered her wedding comedy but she made of it no secret she did not pack it in lavender or moth balls nor did she sell it to a magazine one day a middle aged money making lawyer who bought his legal cap and ink of her asked her across the counter to marry him i m really much obliged to you said helen cheerfully but i married another man twenty years ago he was more a goose than a man but i think i love him yet i have never seen him since about half an hour after the ceremony was it copying ink that you wanted or just writing fluid the lawyer bowed over the counter with old time grace and left a respectful kiss on the back of her hand helen sighed parting salutes however romantic may be overdone here she was at thirty eight beautiful and admired and all that she seemed to have got from her lovers were approaches and adieus worse still in the last one she had lost a customer too business languished and she hung out a room to let card two large rooms on the third floor were prepared for desirable tenants roomers came and went regretfully for the house of mrs barry was the abode of neatness comfort and taste one day came ramonti the violinist and engaged the front room above the discord and clatter uptown offended his nice ear so a friend had sent him to this oasis in the desert of noise ramonti with his still youthful face his dark eyebrows his short pointed foreign brown beard his distinguished head of gray hair and his artist s temperament revealed in his light gay and sympathetic manner was a welcome tenant in the old house near abingdon square helen lived on the floor above the store the architecture of it was singular and quaint the hall was large and almost square up one side of it and then across the end of it ascended an open stairway to the floor above this hall space she had furnished as a sitting room and office combined there she kept her desk and wrote her business letters and there she sat of evenings by a warm fire and a bright red light and sewed or read ramonti found the atmosphere so agreeable that he spent much time there describing to mrs barry the wonders of paris where he had studied with a particularly notorious and noisy fiddler next comes lodger no a handsome melancholy man in the early s with a brown mysterious beard and strangely pleading haunting eyes he too found the society of helen a desirable thing with the eyes of romeo and othello s tongue he charmed her with tales of distant climes and wooed her by respectful innuendo from the first helen felt a marvelous and compelling thrill in the presence of this man his voice somehow took her swiftly back to the days of her youth s romance this feeling grew and she gave way to it and it led her to an instinctive belief that he had been a factor in that romance and then with a woman s reasoning oh yes they do sometimes she leaped over common syllogism and theory and logic and was sure that her husband had come back to her for she saw in his eyes love which no woman can mistake and a thousand tons of regret and remorse which aroused pity which is perilously near to love requited which is the sine qua non in the house that jack built but she made no sign a husband who steps around the corner for twenty years and then drops in again should not expect to find his slippers laid out too conveniently near nor a match ready lighted for his cigar there must be expiation explanation and possibly execration a little purgatory and then maybe if he were properly humble he might be trusted with a harp and crown and so she made no sign that she knew or suspected and my friend the reporter could see nothing funny in this sent out on an assignment to write up a roaring hilarious brilliant joshing story of but i will not knock a brother let us go on with the story one evening ramonti stopped in helen s hall office reception room and told his love with the tenderness and ardor of the enraptured artist his words were a bright flame of the divine fire that glows in the heart of a man who is a dreamer and doer combined but before you give me an answer he went on before she could accuse him of suddenness i must tell you that ramonti is the only name i have to offer you my manager gave me that i do not know who i am or where i came from my first recollection is of opening my eyes in a hospital i was a young man and i had been there for weeks my life before that is a blank to me they told me that i was found lying in the street with a wound on my head and was brought there in an ambulance they thought i must have fallen and struck my head upon the stones there was nothing to show who i was i have never been able to remember after i was discharged from the hospital i took up the violin i have had success mrs barry i do not know your name except that i love you the first time i saw you i realized that you were the one woman in the world for me and oh a lot of stuff like that helen felt young again first a wave of pride and a sweet little thrill of vanity went all over her and then she looked ramonti in the eyes and a tremendous throb went through her heart she hadn t expected that throb it took her by surprise the musician had become a big factor in her life and she hadn t been aware of it mr ramonti she said sorrowfully this was not on the stage remember it was in the old home near abingdon square i m awfully sorry but i m a married woman and then she told him the sad story of her life as a heroine must do sooner or later either to a theatrical manager or to a reporter ramonti took her hand bowed low and kissed it and went up to his room helen sat down and looked mournfully at her hand well she might three suitors had kissed it mounted their red roan steeds and ridden away in an hour entered the mysterious stranger with the haunting eyes helen was in the willow rocker knitting a useless thing in cotton wool he ricocheted from the stairs and stopped for a chat sitting across the table from her he also poured out his narrative of love and then he said helen do you not remember me i think i have seen it in your eyes can you forgive the past and remember the love that has lasted for twenty years i wronged you deeply i was afraid to come back to you but my love overpowered my reason can you will you forgive me helen stood up the mysterious stranger held one of her hands in a strong and trembling clasp there she stood and i pity the stage that it has not acquired a scene like that and her emotions to portray for she stood with a divided heart the fresh unforgettable virginal love for her bridegroom was hers the treasured sacred honored memory of her first choice filled half her soul she leaned to that pure feeling honor and faith and sweet abiding romance bound her to it but the other half of her heart and soul was filled with something else a later fuller nearer influence and so the old fought against the new and while she hesitated from the room above came the soft racking petitionary music of a violin the hag music bewitches some of the noblest the daws may peck upon one s sleeve without injury but whoever wears his heart upon his tympanum gets it not far from the neck this music and the musician caller her and at her side honor and the old love held her back forgive me he pleaded twenty years is a long time to remain away from the one you say you love she declared with a purgatorial touch how could i tell he begged i will conceal nothing from you that night when he left i followed him i was mad with jealousy on a dark street i struck him down he did not rise i examined him his head had struck a stone i did not intend to kill him i was mad with love and jealousy i hid near by and saw an ambulance take him away although you married him helen who are you cried the woman with wide open eyes snatching her hand away don t you remember me helen the one who has always loved you best i am john delaney if you can forgive but she was gone leaping stumbling hurrying flying up the stairs toward the music and him who had forgotten but who had known her for his in each of his two existences and as she climbed up she sobbed cried and sang frank frank frank three mortals thus juggling with years as though they were billiard balls and my friend the reporter couldn t see anything funny in it a ramble in aphasia my wife and i parted on that morning in precisely our usual manner she left her second cup of tea to follow me to the front door there she plucked from my lapel the invisible strand of lint the universal act of woman to proclaim ownership and bade me to take care of my cold i had no cold next came her kiss of parting the lever kiss of domesticity flavored with young hyson there was no fear of the extemporaneous of variety spicing her infinite custom with the deft touch of long malpractice she dabbed awry my well set scarf pin and then as i closed the door i heard her morning slippers pattering back to her cooling tea when i set out i had no thought or premonition of what was to occur the attack came suddenly for many weeks i had been toiling almost night and day at a famous railroad law case that i won triumphantly but a few days previously in fact i had been digging away at the law almost without cessation for many years once or twice good doctor volney my friend and physician had warned me if you don t slacken up belford he said you ll go suddenly to pieces either your nerves or your brain will give way tell me does a week pass in which you do not read in the papers of a case of aphasia of some man lost wandering nameless with his past and his identity blotted out and all from that little brain clot made by overwork or worry i always thought said i that the clot in those instances was really to be found on the brains of the newspaper reporters doctor volney shook his head the disease exists he said you need a change or a rest court room office and home there is the only route you travel for recreation you read law books better take warning in time on thursday nights i said defensively my wife and i play cribbage on sundays she reads to me the weekly letter from her mother that law books are not a recreation remains yet to be established that morning as i walked i was thinking of doctor volney s words i was feeling as well as i usually did possibly in better spirits than usual i woke with stiff and cramped muscles from having slept long on the incommodious seat of a day coach i leaned my head against the seat and tried to think after a long time i said to myself i must have a name of some sort i searched my pockets not a card not a letter not a paper or monogram could i find but i found in my coat pocket nearly in bills of large denomination i must be some one of course i repeated to myself and began again to consider the car was well crowded with men among whom i told myself there must have been some common interest for they intermingled freely and seemed in the best good humor and spirits one of them a stout spectacled gentleman enveloped in a decided odor of cinnamon and aloes took the vacant half of my seat with a friendly nod and unfolded a newspaper in the intervals between his periods of reading we conversed as travelers will on current affairs i found myself able to sustain the conversation on such subjects with credit at least to my memory by and by my companion said you are one of us of course fine lot of men the west sends in this time i m glad they held the convention in new york i ve never been east before my name s r p bolder bolder son of hickory grove missouri though unprepared i rose to the emergency as men will when put to it now must i hold a christening and be at once babe parson and parent my senses came to the rescue of my slower brain the insistent odor of drugs from my compainion supplied one idea a glance at his newspaper where my eye met a conspicuous advertisement assisted me further my name said i glibly is edward pinkhammer i am a druggist and my home is in cornopolis kansas i knew you were a druggist said my fellow traveler affably i saw the callous spot on your right forefinger where the handle of the pestle rubs of course you are a delegate to our national convention are all these men druggists i asked wonderingly they are this car came through from the west and they re your old time druggists too none of your patent tablet and granule pharmashootists that use slot machines instead of a prescription desk we percolate our own paregoric and roll our own pills and we ain t above handling a few garden seeds in the spring and carrying a side line of confectionery and shoes i tell you hampinker i ve got an idea to spring on this convention new ideas is what they want now you know the shelf bottles of tartar emetic and rochelle salt ant et pot tart and sod et pot tart one s poison you know and the other s harmless it s easy to mistake one label for the other where do druggists mostly keep em why as far apart as possible on different shelves that s wrong i say keep em side by side so when you want one you can always compare it with the other and avoid mistakes do you catch the idea it seems to me a very good one i said all right when i spring it on the convention you back it up we ll make some of these eastern orange phosphate and massage cream professors that think they re the only lozenges in the market look like hypodermic tablets if i can be of any aid i said warming the two bottles of er tartrate of antimony and potash and tartrate of soda and potash shall henceforth sit side by side i concluded firmly now there s another thing said mr bolder for an excipient in manipulating a pill mass which do you prefer the magnesia carbonate or the pulverised glycerrhiza radix the er magnesia i said it was easier to say than the other word mr bolder glanced at me distrustfully through his spectacles give me the glycerrhiza said he magnesia cakes here s another one of these fake aphasia cases he said presently handing me his newspaper and laying his finger upon an article i don t believe in em i put nine out of ten of em down as frauds a man gets sick of his business and his folks and wants to have a good time he skips out somewhere and when they find him he pretends to have lost his memory don t know his own name and won t even recognize the strawberry mark on his wife s left shoulder aphasia tut why can t they stay at home and forget i took the paper and read after the pungent headlines the following denver june elwyn c belford a prominent lawyer is mysteriously missing from his home since three days ago and all efforts to locate him have been in vain mr bellford is a well known citizen of the highest standing and has enjoyed a large and lucrative law practice he is married and owns a fine home and the most extensive private library in the state on the day of his disappearance he drew quite a large sum of money from his bank no one can be found who saw him after he left the bank mr bellford was a man of singularly quiet and domestic tastes and seemed to find his happiness in his home and profession if any clue at all exists to his strange disappearance it my be found in the fact that for some months he has been deeply absorbed in an important law case in connection with the q y and z railroad company it is feared that overwork may have affected his mind every effort is being made to discover the whereabouts of the missing man it seems to me you are not altogether uncynical mr bolder i said after i had read the despatch this has the sound to me of a genuine case why should this man prosperous happily married and respected choose suddenly to abandon everything i know that these lapses of memory do occur and that men do find themselves adrift without a name a history or a home oh gammon and jalap said mr bolder it s larks they re after there s too much education nowadays men know about aphasia and they use it for an excuse the women are wise too when it s all over they look you in the eye as scientific as you please and say he hypnotized me thus mr bolder diverted but did not aid me with his comments and philosophy we arrived in new york about ten at night i rode in a cab to a hotel and i wrote my name edward pinkhammer in the register as i did so i felt pervade me a splendid wild intoxicating buoyancy a sense of unlimited freedom of newly attained possibilities i was just born into the world the old fetters whatever they had been were stricken from my hands and feet the future lay before me a clear road such as an infant enters and i could set out upon it equipped with a man s learning and experience i thought the hotel clerk looked at me five seconds too long i had no baggage the druggists convention i said my trunk has somehow failed to arrive i drew out a roll of money ah said he showing an auriferous tooth we have quite a number of the western delegates stopping here he struck a bell for the boy i endeavored to give color to my r ole there is an important movement on foot among us westerners i said in regard to a recommendation to the convention that the bottles containing the tartrate of antimoney and potash and the tartrate of sodium and potash be kept in a contiguous position on the shelf gentleman to three fourteen said the clerk hastily i was whisked away to my room the next day i bought a trunk and clothing and began to live the life of edward pinkhammer i did not tax my brain with endeavors to solve problems of the past it was a piquant and sparkling cup that the great island city held up to my lips i drank of it gratefully the keys of manhattan belong to him who is able to bear them you must be either the city s guest or its victim the following few days were as gold and silver edward pinkhammer yet counting back to his birth by hours only knew the rare joy of having come upon so diverting a world full fledged and unrestrained i sat entranced on the magic carpets provided in theatres and roof gardens that transported one into strange and delightful lands full of frolicsome music pretty girls and grotesque drolly extravagant parodies upon human kind i went here and there at my own dear will bound by no limits of space time or comportment i dined in weird cabarets at weirder tables d h te to the sound of hungarian music and the wild shouts of mercurial artists and sculptors or again where the night life quivers in the electric glare like a kinetoscopic picture and the millinery of the world and its jewels and the ones whom they adorn and the men who make all three possible are met for good cheer and the spectacular effect and among all these scenes that i have mentioned i learned one thing that i never knew before and that is that the key to liberty is not in the hands of license but convention holds it comity has a toll gate at which you must pay or you may not enter the land of freedom in all the glitter the seeming disorder the parade the abandon i saw this law unobtrusive yet like iron prevail therefore in manhattan you must obey these unwritten laws and then you will be freest of the free if you decline to be bound by them you put on shackles sometimes as my mood urged me i would seek the stately softly murmuring palm rooms redolent with high born life and delicate restraint in which to dine again i would go down to the waterways in steamers packed with vociferous bedecked unchecked love making clerks and shop girls to their crude pleasures on the island shores and there was always broadway glistening opulent wily varying desirable broadway growing upon one like an opium habit one afternoon as i entered my hotel a stout man with a big nose and a black mustache blocked my way in the corridor when i would have passed around him he greet me with offensive familiarity hello bellford he cried loudly what the deuce are you doing in new york didn t know anything could drag you away from that old book den of yours is mrs b along or is this a little business run alone eh you have made a mistake sir i said coldly releasing my hand from his grasp my name is pinkhammer you will excuse me the man dropped to one side apparently astonished as i walked to the clerk s desk i heard him call to a bell boy and say something about telegraph blanks you will give me my bill i said to the clerk and have my baggage brought down in half an hour i do not care to remain where i am annoyed by confidence men i moved that afternoon to another hotel a sedate old fashioned one on lower fifth avenue there was a restaurant a little way off broadway where one could be served almost al fresco in a tropic array of screening flora quiet and luxury and a perfect service made it an ideal place in which to take luncheon or refreshment one afternoon i was there picking my way to a table among the ferns when i felt my sleeve caught mr bellford exclaimed an amazingly sweet voice i turned quickly to see a lady seated alone a lady of about thirty with exceedingly handsome eyes who looked at me as though i had been her very dear friend you were about to pass me she said accusingly don t tell me you do not know me why should we not shake hands at least once in fifteen years i shook hands with her at once i took a chair opposite her at the table i summoned with my eyebrows a hovering waiter the lady was philandering with an orange ice i ordered a cr me de menthe her hair was reddish bronze you could not look at it because you could not look away from her eyes but you were conscious of it as you are conscious of sunset while you look into the profundities of a wood at twilight are you sure you know me i asked no she said smiling i was never sure of that what would you think i said a little anxiously if i were to tell you that my name is edward pinkhammer from cornopolis kansas what would i think she repeated with a merry glance why that you had not brought mrs bellford to new york with you of course i do wish you had i would have liked to see marian her voice lowered slightly you haven t changed much elwyn i felt her wonderful eyes searching mine and my face more closely yes you have she amended and there was a soft exultant note in her latest tones i see it now you haven t forgotten you haven t forgotten for a year or a day or an hour i told you you never could i poked my straw anxiously in the cr me de menthe i m sure i beg your pardon i said a little uneasy at her gaze but that is just the trouble i have forgotten i ve forgotten everything she flouted my denial she laughed deliciously at something she seemed to see in my face i ve heard of you at times she went on you re quite a big lawyer out west denver isn t it or los angeles marian must be very proud of you you knew i suppose that i married six months after you did you may have seen it in the papers the flowers alone cost two thousand dollars she had mentioned fifteen years fifteen years is a long time would it be too late i asked somewhat timorously to offer you congratulations not if you dare do it she answered with such fine intrepidity that i was silent and began to crease patterns on the cloth with my thumb nail tell me one thing she said leaning toward me rather eagerly a thing i have wanted to know for many years just from a woman s curiosity of course have you ever dared since that night to touch smell or look at white roses at white roses wet with rain and dew i took a sip of cr me de menthe it would be useless i suppose i said with a sigh for me to repeat that i have no recollection at all about these things my memory is completely at fault i need not say how much i regret it the lady rested her arms upon the table and again her eyes disdained my words and went traveling by their own route direct to my soul she laughed softly with a strange quality in the sound it was a laugh of happiness yes and of content and of misery i tried to look away from her you lie elwyn bellford she breathed blissfully oh i know you lie i gazed dully into the ferns my name is edward pinkhammer i said i came with the delegates to the druggists national convention there is a movement on foot for arranging a new position for the bottles of tartrate of antimony and tartrate of potash in which very likely you would take little interest a shining landau stopped before the entrance the lady rose i took her hand and bowed i am deeply sorry i said to her that i cannot remember i could explain but fear you would not understand you will not concede pinkhammer and i really cannot at all conceive of the the roses and other things good by mr bellford she said with her happy sorrowful smile as she stepped into her carriage i attended the theatre that night when i returned to my hotel a quiet man in dark clothes who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief appeared magically at my side mr pinkhammer he said giving the bulk of his attention to his forefinger may i request you to step aside with me for a little conversation there is a room here certainly i answered he conducted me into a small private parlor a lady and a gentleman were there the lady i surmised would have been unusually good looking had her features not been clouded by an expression of keen worry and fatigue she was of a style of figure and possessed coloring and features that were agreeable to my fancy she was in a traveling dress she fixed upon me an earnest look of extreme anxiety and pressed an unsteady hand to her bosom i think she would have started forward but the gentleman arrested her movement with an authoritative motion of his hand he then came himself to meet me he was a man of forty a little gray about the temples and with a strong thoughtful face bellford old man he said cordially i m glad to see you again of course we know everything is all right i warned you you know that you were overdoing it now you ll go back with us and be yourself again in no time i smiled ironically i havae been bellforded so often i said that it has lost its edge still in the end it may grow wearisome would you be willing at all to entertain the hypothesis that my name is edward pinkhammer and that i never saw you before in my life before the man could reply a wailing cry came from the woman she sprang past his detaining arm elwyn she sobbed and cast herself upon me and clung tight elwyn she cried again don t break my heart i am your wife call my name once just once i could see you dead rather than this way i unwound her arms respectfully but firmly madam i said severely pardon me if i suggest that you accept a resemblance too precipitately it is a pity i went on with an amused laugh as the thought occurred to me that this bellford and i could not be kept side by side upon the same shelf like tartrates of sodium and antimony for purposes of identification in order to understand the allusion i concluded airily it may be necessary for you to keep an eye on the proceedings of the druggists national convention the lady turned to her companion and grasped his arm what is it doctor volney oh what is it she moaned go to your room for a while i heard him say i will remain and talk with him his mind no i think not only a portion of the brain yes i am sure he will recover go to your room and leave me with him the lady disappeared the man in dark clothes also went outside still manicuring himself in a thoughtful way i think he waited in the hall i would like to talk with you a while mr pinkhammer if i may said the gentleman who remained very well if you care to i replied and will excuse me if i take it comfortably i am rather tired i stretched myself upon a couch by a window and lit a cigar he drew a chair nearby let us speak to the point he said soothingly your name is not pinkhammer i know that as well as you do i said coolly but a man must have a name of some sort i can assure you that i do not extravagantly admire the name of pinkhammer but when one christens one s self suddenly the fine names do not seem to suggest themselves but suppose it had been scheringhausen or scroggins i think i did very well with pinkhammer your name said the other man seriously is elwyn c bellford you are one of the first lawyers in denver you are suffering from an attack of aphasia which has caused you to forget your identity the cause of it was over application to your profession and perhaps a life too bare of natural recreation and pleasures the lady who has just left the room is your wife she is what i would call a fine looking woman i said after a judicial pause i particularly admire the shade of brown in her hair she is a wife to be proud of since your disappearance nearly two weeks ago she has scarcely closed her eyes we learned that you were in new york through a telegram sent by isidore newman a traveling man from denver he said that he had met you in a hotel here and that you did not recognize him i think i remember the occasion i said the fellow called me bellford if i am not mistaken but don t you think it about time now for you to introduce yourself i am robert volney doctor volney i have been your close friend for twenty years and your physician for fifteen i came with mrs bellford to trace you as soon as we got the telegram try elwyn old man try to remember what s the use to try i asked with a little frown you say you are a physician is aphasia curable when a man loses his memory does it return slowly or suddenly sometimes gradually and imperfectly sometimes as suddenly as it went will you undertake the treatment of my case doctor volney i asked old friend said he i ll do everything in my power and wil have done everything that science can do to cure you very well said i then you will consider that i am your patient everything is in confidence now professional confidence of course said doctor volney i got up from the couch some one had set a vase of white roses on the centre table a cluster of white roses freshly sprinkled and fragrant i threw them far out of the window and then laid myself upon the couch again it will be best bobby i said to have this cure happen suddenly i m rather tired of it all anyway you may go now and bring marian in but oh doc i said with a sigh as i kicked him on the shin good old doc it was glorious a municipal report the cities are full of pride challenging each to each this from her mountainside that from her burthened beach r kipling fancy a novel about chicago or buffalo let us say or nashville tennessee there are justthree big cities in the united states that are story cities new york of course new orleans and best of the lot san francisco frank norris east is east and west is san francisco according to californians californians are a race of people they are not merely inhabitants of a state they are the southerners of the west now chicagoans are no less loyal to their city but when you ask them why they stammer and speak of lake fish and the new odd fellows building but californians go into detail of course they have in the climate an argument that is good for half an hour while you are thinking of your coal bills and heavy underwear but as soon as they come to mistake your silence for conviction madness comes upon them and they picture the city of the golden gate as the bagdad of the new world so far as a matter of opinion no refutation is necessary but dear cousins all from adam and eve descended it is a rash one who will lay his finger on the map and say in this town there can be no romance what could happen here yes it is a bold and a rash deed to challenge in one sentence history romance and rand and mcnally nashville a city port of delivery and the capital of the state of tennessee is on the cumberland river and on the n c st l and the l n railroads this city is regarded as the most important educational centre in the south i stepped off the train at p m having searched the thesaurus in vain for adjectives i must as a substitution hie me to comparison in the form of a recipe take a london fog parts malaria parts gas leaks parts dewdrops gathered in a brick yard at sunrise parts odor of honeysuckle parts mix the mixture will give you an approximate conception of a nashville drizzle it is not so fragrant as a moth ball nor as thick as pea soup but tis enough twill serve i went to a hotel in a tumbril it required strong self suppression for me to keep from climbing to the top of it and giving an imitation of sidney carton the vehicle was drawn by beasts of a bygone era and driven by something dark and emancipated i was sleepy and tired so when i got to the hotel i hurriedly paid it the fifty cents it demanded with approximate lagniappe i assure you i knew its habits and i did not want to hear it prate about its old marster or anything that happened befo de wah the hotel was one of the kind described as renovated that means worth of new marble pillars tiling electric lights and brass cuspidors in the lobby and a new l n time table and a lithograph of lookout mountain in each one of the great rooms above the management was without reproach the attention full of exquisite southern courtesy the service as slow as the progress of a snail and as good humored as rip van winkle the food was worth traveling a thousand miles for there is no other hotel in the world where you can get such chicken livers en brochette at dinner i asked a negro waiter if there was anything doing in town he pondered gravely for a minute and then replied well boss i don t really reckon there s anything at all doin after sundown sundown had been accomplished it had been drowned in the drizzle long before so that spectacle was denied me but i went forth upon the streets in the drizzle to see what might be there it is built on undulating grounds and the streets are lighted by electricity at a cost of per annum as i left the hotel there was a race riot down upon me charged a company of freedmen or arabs or zulus armed with no i saw with relief that they were not rifles but whips and i saw dimly a caravan of black clumsy vehicles and at the reassuring shouts kyar you anywhere in the town boss fuh fifty cents i reasoned that i was merely a fare instead of a victim i walked through long streets all leading uphill i wondered how those streets ever came down again perhaps they didn t until they were graded on a few of the main streets i saw lights in stores here and there saw street cars go by conveying worthy burghers hither and yon saw people pass engaged in the art of conversation and heard a burst of semi lively laughter issuing from a soda water and ice cream parlor the streets other than main seemed to have enticed upon their borders houses consecrated to peace and domesticity in many of them lights shone behind discreetly drawn window shades in a few pianos tinkled orderly and irreproachable music there was indeed little doing i wished i had come before sundown so i returned to my hotel in november the confederate general hood advanced against nashville where he shut up a national force under general thomas the latter then sallied forth and defeated the confederates in a terrible conflict all my life i have heard of admired and witnessed the fine marksmanship of the south in its peaceful conflicts in the tobacco chewing regions but in my hotel a surprise awaited me there were twelve bright new imposing capacious brass cuspidors in the great lobby tall enough to be called urns and so wide mouthed that the crack pitcher of a lady baseball team should have been able to throw a ball into one of them at five paces distant but although a terrible battle had raged and was still raging the enemy had not suffered bright new imposing capacious untouched they stood but shades of jefferson brick the tile floor the beautiful tile floor i could not avoid thinking of the battle of nashville and trying to draw as is my foolish habit some deductions about hereditary marksmanship here i first saw major by misplaced courtesy wentworth caswell i knew him for a type the moment my eyes suffered from the sight of him a rat has no geographical habitat my old friend a tennyson said as he so well said almost everything prophet curse me the blabbing lip and curse me the british vermin the rat let us regard the word british as interchangeable ad lib a rat is a rat this man was hunting about the hotel lobby like a starved dog that had forgotten where he had buried a bone he had a face of great acreage red pulpy and with a kind of sleepy massiveness like that of buddha he possessed one single virtue he was very smoothly shaven the mark of the beast is not indelible upon a man until he goes about with a stubble i think that if he had not used his razor that day i would have repulsed his advances and the criminal calendar of the world would have been spared the addition of one murder i happened to be standing within five feet of a cuspidor when major caswell opened fire upon it i had been observant enough to percieve that the attacking force was using gatlings instead of squirrel rifles so i side stepped so promptly that the major seized the opportunity to apologize to a noncombatant he had the blabbing lip in four minutes he had become my friend and had dragged me to the bar i desire to interpolate here that i am a southerner but i am not one by profession or trade i eschew the string tie the slouch hat the prince albert the number of bales of cotton destroyed by sherman and plug chewing when the orchestra plays dixie i do not cheer i slide a little lower on the leather cornered seat and well order another w urzburger and wish that longstreet had but what s the use major caswell banged the bar with his fist and the first gun at fort sumter re echoed when he fired the last one at appomattox i began to hope but then he began on family trees and demonstrated that adam was only a third cousin of a collateral branch of the caswell family genealogy disposed of he took up to my distaste his private family matters he spoke of his wife traced her descent back to eve and profanely denied any possible rumor that she may have had relations in the land of nod by this time i was beginning to suspect that he was trying to obscure by noise the fact that he had ordered the drinks on the chance that i would be bewildered into paying for them but when they were down he crashed a silver dollar loudly upon the bar then of course another serving was obligatory and when i had paid for that i took leave of him brusquely for i wanted no more of him but before i had obtained my release he had prated loudly of an income that his wife received and showed a handful of silver money when i got my key at the desk the clerk said to me courteously if that man caswell has annoyed you and if you would like to make a complaint we will have him ejected he is a nuisance a loafer and without any known means of support although he seems to have some money most the time but we don t seem to be able to hit upon any means of throwing him out legally why no said i after some reflection i don t see my way clear to making a complaint but i would like to place myself on record as asserting that i do not care for his company your town i continued seems to be a quiet one what manner of entertainment adventure or excitement have you to offer to the stranger within your gates well sir said the clerk there will be a show here next thursday it is i ll look it up and have the announcement sent up to your room with the ice water good night after i went up to my room i looked out the window it was only about ten o clock but i looked upon a silent town the drizzle continued spangled with dim lights as far apart as currants in a cake sold at the ladies exchange a quiet place i said to myself as my first shoe struck the ceiling of the occupant of the room beneath mine nothing of the life here that gives color and variety to the cities in the east and west just a good ordinary humdrum business town nashville occupies a foremost place among the manufacturing centres of the country it is the fifth boot and shoe market in the united states the largest candy and cracker manufacturing city in the south and does an enormous wholesale drygoods grocery and drug business i must tell you how i came to be in nashville and i assure you the digression brings as much tedium to me as it does to you i was traveling elsewhere on my own business but i had a commission from a northern literary magazine to stop over there and establish a personal connection between the publication and one of its contributors azalea adair adair there was no clue to the personality except the handwriting had sent in some essays lost art and poems that had made the editors swear approvingly over their one o clock luncheon so they had commissioned me to round up said adair and corner by contract his or her output at two cents a word before some other publisher offered her ten or twenty at nine o clock the next morning after my chicken livers en brochette try them if you can find that hotel i strayed out into the drizzle which was still on for an unlimited run at the first corner i came upon uncle caesar he was a stalwart negro older than the pyramids with gray wool and a face that reminded me of brutus and a second afterwards of the late king cettiwayo he wore the most remarkable coat that i ever had seen or expect to see it reached to his ankles an had once been a confederate gray in colors but rain and sun and age had so variegated it that joseph s coat beside it would have faded to a pale monochrome i must linger with that coat for it has to do with the story the story that is so long in coming because you can hardly expect anything to happen in nashville once it must have been the military coat of an officer the cape of it had vanished but all adown its front it had been frogged and tasseled magnificently but now the frogs and tassles were gone in their stead had been patiently stitched i surmised by some surviving black mammy new frogs made of cunningly twisted common hempen twine this twine was frayed and disheveled it must have been added to the coat as a substitute for vanished splendors with tasteless but painstaking devotion for it followed faithfully the curves of the long missing frogs and to complete the comedy and pathos of the garment all its buttons were gone save one the second button from the top alone remained the coat was fastened by other twine strings tied through the buttonholes and other holes rudely pierced in the opposite side there was never such a weird garment so fantastically bedecked and of so many mottled hues the lone button was the size of a half dollar made of yellow horn and sewed on with coarse twine this negro stood by a carriage so old that ham himself might have started a hack line with it after he left the ark with the two animals hitched to it as i approached he threw open the door drew out a feather duster waved it without using it and said in deep rumbling tones step right in suh ain t a speck of dust in it jus got back from a funeral suh i inferred that on such gala occasions carriages were given an extra cleaning i looked up and down the street and perceived that there was little choice among the vehicles for hire that lined the curb i looked in my memorandum book for the address of azalea adair i want to go to jessamine street i said and was about to step into the hack but for an instant the thick long gorilla like arm of the old negro barred me on his massive and saturnine face a look of sudden suspicion and enmity flashed for a moment then with quickly returning conviction he asked blandishingly what are you gwine there for boss what is it to you i asked a little sharply nothin suh jus nothin only it s a lonesome kind of part of town and few folks ever has business out there step right in the seats is clean jes got back from a funeral suh a mile and a half it must have been to our journey s end i could hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving i could smell nothing but the drizzle now further flavored with coal smoke and something like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms all i could see through the streaming windows were two rows of dim houses the city has an area of square miles miles of streets of which miles are paved a system of waterworks that cost with miles of mains eight sixty one jessamine street was a decayed mansion thirty yards back from the street it stood outmerged in a splendid grove of trees and untrimmed shrubbery a row of box bushes overflowed and almost hid the paling fence from sight the gate was kept closed by a rope noose that encircled the gate post and the first paling of the gate but when you got inside you saw that was a shell a shadow a ghost of former grandeur and excellence but in the story i have not yet got inside when the hack had ceased from rattling and the weary quadrupeds came to a rest i handed my jehu his fifty cents with an additional quarter feeling a glow of conscious generosity as i did so he refused it it s two dollars suh he said how s that i asked i plainly heard you call out at the hotel fifty cents to any part of the town it s two dollars suh he repeated obstinately it s a long ways from the hotel it is within the city limits and well within them i argued don t think that you have picked up a greenhorn yankee do you see those hills over there i went on pointing toward the east i could not see them myself for the drizzle well i was born and raised on their other side you old fool nigger can t you tell people from other people when you see em the grim face of king cettiwayo softened is you from the south suh i reckon it was them shoes of yourn fooled me they is somethin sharp in the toes for a southern gen lman to wear then the charge is fifty cents i suppose said i inexorably his former expression a mingling of cupidity and hostility returned remained ten seconds and vanished boss he said fifty cents is right but i needs two dollars suh i m obleeged to have two dollars i ain t demandin it now suh after i know whar you s from i m jus sayin that i has to have two dollars to night and business mighty po peace and confidence settled upon his heavy features he had been luckier than he had hoped instead of having picked up a greenhorn ignorant of rates he had come upon an inheritance you confounded old rascal i said reaching down to my pocket you ought to be turned over to the police for the first time i saw him smile he knew he knew he knew i gave him two one dollar bills as i handed them over i noticed that one of them had seen parlous times its upper right hand corner was missing and it had been torn through the middle but joined again a strip of blue tissue paper pasted over the split preserved its negotiability enough of the african bandit for the present i left him happy lifted the rope and opened a creaky gate the house as i said was a shell a paint brush had not touched it in twenty years i could not see why a strong wind should not have bowled it over like a house of cards until i looked again at the trees that hugged it close the trees that saw the battle of nashville and still drew their protecting branches around it against storm and enemy and cold azalea adair fifty years old white haired a descendant of the cavaliers as thin and frail as the house she lived in robed in the cheapest and cleanest dress i ever saw with an air as simple as a queen s received me the reception room seemed a mile square because there was nothing in it except some rows of books on unpainted white pine bookshelves a cracked marble top table a rag rug a hairless horsehair sofa and two or three chairs yes there was a picture on the wall a colored crayon drawing of a cluster of pansies i looked around for the portrait of andrew jackson and the pinecone hanging basket but they were not there azalea adair and i had conversation a little of which will be repeated to you she was a product of the old south gently nurtured in the sheltered life her learning was not broad but was deep and of splendid originality in its somewhat narrow scope she had been educated at home and her knowledge of the world was derived from inference and by inspiration of such is the precious small group of essayists made whle she talked to me i kept brushing my fingers trying unconsciously to rid them guiltily of the absent dust from the half calf backs of lamb chaucer hazlitt marcus aurelius montaigne and hood she was exquisite she was a valuable discovery nearly everybody nowadays knows too much oh so much too much of real life i could perceive clearly that azalea adair was very poor a house and a dress she had not much else i fancied so divided between my duty to the magazine and my loyalty to the poets and essayists who fought thomas in the valley of the cumberland i listened to her voice which was like a harpsichord s and found that i could not speak of contracts in the presence of the nine muses and the three graces one hesitated to lower the topic to two cents there would have to be another colloquy after i had regained my commercialism but i spoke of my mission and three o clock of the next afternoon was set for the discussion of the business proposition your town i said as i began to make ready to depart which is the time for smooth generalities seems to be a quiet sedate place a home town i should say where few things out of the ordinary ever happen it carries on an extensive trade in stoves and hollow ware with the west and south and its flouring mills have a daily capacity of more than barrels azalea adair seemed to reflect i have never thought of it that way she said with a kind of sincere intensity that seemed to belong to her isn t it in the still quiet places that things do happen i fancy that when god began to create the earth on the first monday morning one could have leaned out one s window and heard the drops of mud splashing from his trowel as he built up the everlasting hills what did the noisiest project in the world i mean the building of the tower of bable result in finally a page and a half of esperanto in the north american review of course said i platitudinously human nature is the same everywhere but there is more color er more drama and movement and er romance in some cities than in others on the surface said azalea adair i have traveled many times around the world in a golden airship wafted on two wings print and dreams i have seen on one of my imaginary tours the sultan of turkey bowstring with his own hands one of his wives who had uncovered her face in public i have seen a man in nashville tear up his theatre tickets because his wife was going out with her face covered with rice powder in san francisco s chinatown i saw the slave girl sing yee dipped slowly inch by inch in boiling almond oil to make her swear she would never see her american lover again she gave in when the boiling oil had reached three inches above her knee at a euchre party in east nashville the other night i saw kitty morgan cut dead by seven of her schoolmates and lifelong friends because she had married a house painter the boiling oil was sizzling as high as her heart but i wish you could have seen the fine little smile that she carried from table to table oh yes it is a humdrum town just a few miles of red brick houses and mud and lumber yards some one knocked hollowly at the back of the house azalea adair breathed a soft apology and went to investigate the sound she came back in three minutes with brightened eyes a faint flush on her cheeks and ten years lifted from her shoulders you must have a cup of tea before you go she said and a sugar cake she reached and shook a little iron bell in shuffled a small negro girl about twelve barefoot not very tidy glowering at me with thumb in mouth and bulging eyes azlea adair opened a tiny worn purse and drew out a dollar bill a dollar bill with the upper right hand corner missing torn in two pieces and pasted together again with a strip of blue tissue paper it was one of the bills i had given the piratical negro there was no doubt about it go up to mr baker s store on the corner impy she said handing the girl the dollar bill and get a quarter of a pound of tea the kind he always sends me and ten cents worth of sugar cakes now hurry the supply of tea in the house happens to be exhausted she explained to me impy left by the back way before the scrape of her hard bare feet had died away on the back porch a wild shriek i was sure it was hers filled the hollow house then the deep gruff tones of an angry man s voice mingled with the girl s further squeals and unintelligible words azalea adair rose without surprise or emotion and disappeared for two minutes i heard the hoarse rumble of the man s voice then someting like an oath and a slight scuffle and she returned calmly to her chair this is a roomy house she said and i have a tenant for part of it i am sorry to have to rescind my invitation to tea it was impossible to get the kind i always use at the store perhaps to morrow mr baker will be able to supply me i was sure that impy had not had time to leave the house i inquired concerning street car lines and took my leave after i was well on my way i remembered that i had not learned azalea adair s name but to morrow would do that same day i started in on the course of iniquity that this uneventful city forced upon me i was in the town only two days but in that time i managed to lie shamelessly by telegraph and to be an accomplice after the fact if that is the correct legal term to a murder as i rounded the corner nearest my hotel the afrite coachman of the ploychromatic nonpareil coat seized me swung open the dungeony door of his peripatetic sarcophagus flirted his feather duster and began his ritual step right in boss carriage is clean jus got back from a funeral fifty cents to any and then he knew me and grinned broadly scuse me boss you is de gen l man what rid out with me dis mawnin thank you kindly suh i am going out to again to morrow afternoon at three said i and if you will be here i ll let you drive me so you know miss adair i concluded thinking of my dollar bill i belonged to her father judge adair suh he replied i judge that she is pretty poor i said she hasn t much money to speak of has she for an instant i looked again at the fierce countenance of king cettiwayo and then he changed back to an extortionate old negro hack driver she ain t gwine to starve suh he said slowly she has reso ces suh she has reso ces i shall pay you fifty cents for the trip said i dat is puffeckly correct suh he answered humbly i jus had to have dat two dollars dis mawnin boss i went to the hotel and lied by electricity i wired the magazine a adair holds out for eight cents a word the answer that came back was give it to her quick you duffer just before dinner major wentworth caswell bore down upon me with the greetings of a long lost friend i have seen few men whom i have so instantaneously hated and of whom it was so difficult to be rid i was standing at the bar when he invaded me therefore i could not wave the white ribbon in his face i would have paid gladly for the drinks hoping thereby to escape another but he was one of those despicable roaring advertising bibbers who must have brass bands and fireworks attend upon every cent that they waste in their follies with an air of producing millions he drew two one dollar bills from a pocket and dashed one of them upon the bar i looked once more at the dollar bill with the upper right hand corner missing torn through the middle and patched with a strip of blue tissue paper it was my dollar bill again it could have been no other i went up to my room the drizzle and the monotony of a dreary eventless southern town had made me tired and listless i remember that just before i went to bed i mentally disposed of the mysterious dollar bill which might have formed the clew to a tremendously fine detective story of san francisco by saying to myself sleepily seems as if a lot of people here own stock in the hack driver s trust pays dividends promptly too wonder if then i fell asleep king cettiwayo was at his post the next day and rattled my bones over the stones out to he was to wait and rattle me back again when i was ready azalea adair looked paler and cleaner and frailer than she had looked on the day before after she had signed the contract at eight cents per word she grew still paler and began to slip out of her chair whitout much trouble i managed to get her up on the antediluvian horsehair sofa and then i ran out to the sidewalk and yelled to the coffee colored pirate to bring a doctor with a wisdom that i had not expected in him he abandoned his team and struck off up the street afoot realizing the value of speed in ten minutes he returned with a grave gray haired and capable man of medicine in a few words worth much less than eight cents each i explained to him my presence in the hollow house of mystery he bowed with stately understanding and turned to the old negro uncle caesar he said calmly run up to my house and ask miss lucy to give you a cream pitcher full of fresh milk and half a tumbler of port wine and hurry back don t drive run i want you to get back sometime this week it occurred to me that dr merriman also felt a distrust as to the speeding powers of the land pirate s steeds after uncle caesar was gone lumberingly but swiftly up the street the doctor looked me over with great politeness and as much careful calculation until he had decided that i might do it is only a case of insufficient nutrition he said in other words the result of poverty pride and starvation mrs caswell has many devoted friends who would be glad to aid her but she will accept nothing except from that old negro uncle caesar who was once owned by her family mrs caswell said i in surprise and then i looked at the contract and saw that she had signed it azalea adair caswell i thought she was miss adair i said married to a drunken worthless loafer sir said the doctor it is said that he robs her even of the small sums that her old servant contributes toward her support when the milk and wine had been brought the doctor soon revived azalea adair she sat up and talked of the beauty of the autumn leaves that were then in season and their height of color she referred lightly to her fainting seizure as the outcome of an old palpitation of the heart impy fanned her as she lay on the sofa the doctor was due elsewhere and i followed him to the door i told him that it was within my power and intentions to make a reasonable advance of money to azalea adair on future contributions to the magazine and he seemed pleased by the way he said perhaps you would like to know that you have had royalty for a coachman old caesar s grandfather was a king in congo caesar himself has royal ways as you may have observed as the doctor was moving off i heard uncle caesar s voice inside did he get bofe of dem two dollars from you mis zalea yes caesar i heard azalea adair answer weakly and then i went in and concluded business negotiations with our contributor i assumed the responsibility of advancing fifty dollars putting it as a necessary formality in binding our bargain and then uncle caesar drove me back to the hotel here ends all of the story as far as i can testify as a witness the rest must be only bare statements of facts at about six o clock i went out for a stroll uncle caesar was at his corner he threw open the door of his carriage flourished his duster and began his depressing formula step right in suh fifty cents to anywhere in the city hack s puffickly clean suh jus got back from a funeral and then he recognized me i think his eyesight was getting bad his coat had taken on a few more faded shades of color the twine strings were more frayed and ragged the last remaining button the button of yellow horn was gone a motley descendant of kings was uncle caesar about two hours later i saw an excited crowd besieging the front of a drug store in a desert where nothing happens this was manna so i edged my way inside on an extemporized couch of empty boxes and chairs was stretched the mortal corporeality of major wentworth caswell a doctor was testing him for the immortal ingredient his decision was that it was conspicuous by its absence the erstwhile major had been found dead on a dark street and brought by curious and ennuied citizens to the drug store the late human being had been engaged in terrific battle the details showed that loafer and reprobate though he had been he had been also a warrior but he had lost his hands were yet clinched so tightly that his fingers would not be opened the gentle citizens who had know him stood about and searched their vocabularies to find some good words if it were possible to speak of him one kind looking man said after much thought when cas was about fo teen he was one of the best spellers in school while i stood there the fingers of the right hand of the man that was which hung down the side of a white pine box relaxed and dropped something at my feet i covered it with one foot quietly and a little later on i picked it up and pocketed it i reasoned that in his last struggle his hand must have seized that object unwittingly and held it in a death grip at the hotel that night the main topic of conversation with the possible exceptions of politics and prohibition was the demise of major caswell i heard one man say to a group of listeners in my opinion gentlemen caswell was murdered by somme of these no account niggers for his money he had fifty dollars this afternoon which he showed to several gentlemen in the hotel when he was found the money was not on his person i left the city the next morning at nine and as the train was crossing the bridge over the cumberland river i took out of my pocket a yellow horn overcoat button the size of a fifty cent piece with frayed ends of coarse twine hanging from it and cast it out of the window into the slow muddy waters below i wonder what s doing in buffalo psyche and the pskyscraper if you are a philosopher you can do this thing you can go to the top of a high building look down upon your fellow men feet below and despise them as insects like the irresponsible black waterbugs on summer ponds they crawl and circle and hustle about idiotically without aim or purpose they do not even move with the admirable intelligence of ants for ants always know when they are going home the ant is of a lowly station but he will often reach home and get his slippers on while you are left at your elevated station man then to the housetopped philosopher appears to be but a creeping contemptible beetle brokers poets millionaires bootblacks beauties hod carriers and politicians become little black specks dodging bigger black specks in streets no wider than your thumb from this high view the city itself becomes degraded to an unintelligible mass of distorted buildings and impossible perspectives the revered ocean is a duck pond the earth itself a lost golf ball all the minutiae of life are gone the philosopher gazes into the infinite heavens above him and allows his soul to expand to the influence of his new view he feels that he is the heir to eternity and the child of time space too should be his by the right of his immortal heritage and he thrills at the thought that some day his kind shall traverse theose mysterious aerial roads between planet and planet the tiny world beneath his feet upon which this towering structure of steel rests as a speck of dust upon a himalayan mountain it is but one of a countless number of such whirling atoms what are the ambitions the achievements the paltry conquests and loves of those restless black insects below compared with the serene and awful immensity of the universe that lies above and around their insignificant city it is guaranteed that the philosopher will have these thoughts they have been expressly compiled from the philosophies of the world and set down with the proper interrogation point at the end of them to represent the invariable musings of deep thinkers on high places and when the philosopher takes the elevator down his mind is broader his heart is at peace and his conception of the cosmogony of creation is as wide as the buckle of orion s summer belt but if your name happened to be daisy and you worked in an eighth avenue candy store and lived in a little cold hall bedroom five feet by eight and earned per week and ate ten cent lunches and were nineteen years old and got up at and worked till and never had studied philosophy maybe things wouldn t look that way to you from the top of a skyscraper two sighed for the hand of daisy the unphilosophical one was joe who kept the smallest store in new york it was about the size of a tool box of the d p w and was stuck like a swallow s nest against a corner of a down town skyscraper its stock consisted of fruit candies newspapers song books cigarettes and lemonade in season when stern winter shook his congealed locks and joe had to move himself and the fruit inside there was exactly room in the store for the proprietor his wares a stove the size of a vinegar cruet and one customer joe was not of the nation that keeps us forever in a furore with fugues and fruit he was a capable american youth who was laying by money and wanted daisy to help him spend it three times he had asked her i got money saved up daisy was his love song and you know how bad i want you that store of mine ain t very big but oh ain t it would be the antiphony of the unphilosophical one why i heard wanamaker s was trying to get you to sublet part of your floor space to them for next year daisy passed joe s corner every morning and evening hello two by four was her usual greeting seems to me your store looks emptier you must have sold a pack of chewing gum ain t much room in here sure joe would answer with his slow grin except for you daise me and the store are waitin for you whenever you ll take us don t you think you might before long store a fine scorn was expressed by daisy s uptilted nose sardine box waitin for me you say gee you d have to throw out about a hundred pounds of candy before i could get inside of it joe i wouldn t mind an even swap like that said joe complimentary daisy s existence was limited in every way she had to walk sideways between the counter and the shelves in the candy store in her own hall bedroom coziness had been carried close to cohesiveness the walls were so near to one another that the paper on them made a perfect babel of noise she could light the gas with one hand and close the door with the other without taking her eyes off the reflection of her brown pompadour in the mirror she had joe s picture in a gilt frame on the dresser and sometimes but her next thought would always be of joe s funny little store tacked like a soap box to the corner of that great building and away would go her sentiment in a breeze of laughter daisy s other suitor followed joe by several months he came to board in the house where she lived his name was dabster and he was a philosopher though young attainments stood out upon him like continental labels on a passaic n j suit case knowledge he had kidnapped from cyclopedias and handbooks of useful information but as for wisdom when she passed he was left sniffling in the road without so much as the number of her motor car he could and would tell you the proportion of water and muscle making properties of peas and veal the shortest verse in the bible the number of pounds of shingle nails required to fasten shingles laid four inches to the weather the population of kankakee ill the theories of spinoza the name of mr h mckay twombly s second hall footman the length of the hoosac tunnel the best time to set a hen the salary of the railway post office messenger between driftwood and red bank furnace pa and the number of bones in the foreleg of a cat the weight of learning was no handicap to dabster his statistics were the sprigs of parsley with which he garnished the feast of small talk that he would set before you if he conceived that to be your taste and again he used them as breastworks in foraging at the boardinghouse firing at you a volley of figures concerning the weight of a lineal foot of bar iron x inches and the average annual rainfall at fort snelling minn he would transfix with his fork the best piece of chicken on the dish while you were trying to rally sufficiently to ask him weakly why does a hen cross the road thus brightly armed and further equipped with a measure of good looks of a hair oily shopping district at three in the afternoon kind it seems that joe of the lilliputian emporium had a rival worthy of his steel but joe carried no steel there wouldn t have been room in his store to draw it if he had one saturday afternoon about four o clock daisy and mr dabster stopped before joe s booth dabster wore a silk hat and well daisy was a woman and that hat had no chance to get back in its box until joe had seen it a stick of pineapple chewing gum was the ostensible object of the call joe supplied it through the open side of his store he did not pale or falter at sight of the hat mr dabster s going to take me on top of the building to observe the view said daisy after she had introduced her admirers i never was on a skyscraper i guess it must be awfully nice and funny up there h m said joe the panorama said mr dabster exposed to the gaze from the top of a lofty building is not only sublime but instructive miss daisy has a decided pleasure in store for her it s windy up there too as well as here said joe are you dressed warm enough daise sure thing i m all lined said daisy smiling slyly at his clouded brow you look just like a mummy in a case joe ain t you just put in an invoice of a pint of peanuts or another apple your stock looks awful over stocked daisy giggled at her favorite joke and joe had to smile with her your quarters are somewhat limited mr er er remarked dabster in comparison with the size of this building i understand the area of its side to be about by feet that would make you occupy a proportionate space as if half of beloochistan were placed upon a territory as large as the united states east of the rocky mountains with the province of ontario and belgium added is that so sport said joe genially you are weisenheimer on figures all right how many square pounds of baled hay do you think a jackass could eat if he stopped brayin long enough to keep still a minute and five eighths a few minutes later daisy and mr dabster stepped from an elevator to the top floor of the skyscraper then up a short steep stairway and out upon the roof dabster led her to the parapet so she could look down at the black dots moving in the street below what are they she asked trembling she had never before been on a height like this before and then dabster must needs play the philosopher on the tower and conduct her soul forth to meet the immensity of space bipeds he said solemnly see what they become even at the small elevation of feet mere crawling insects going to and fro at random oh they ain t anything of the kind exclaimed daisy suddenly they re folks i saw an automobile oh gee are we that high up walk over this way said dabster he showed her the great city lying like an orderly array of toys far below starred here and there early as it was by the first beacon lights of the winter afternoon and then the bay and sea to the south and east vanishing mysteriously into the sky i don t like it declared daisy with troubled blue eyes say we go down but the philosopher was not to be denied his opportunity he would let her behold the grandeur of his mind the half nelson he had on the infinite and the memory he had for statistics and then she would nevermore be content to buy chewing gum aat the smallest store in new york and so he began to prate of the smallness of human affairs and how that even so slight a removal from earth made man and his works look like one tenth part of a dollar thrice computed and that one should consider the sidereal system and the maxims of epictetus and be comforted you don t carry me with you said daisy say i think it s awful to be up so high that folks look like fleas one of them we saw might have been joe why jiminy we might as well be in new jersey say i m afraid up here the philosopher smiled fatuously the earth said he is itself only as a grain of wheat in space look up there daisy gazed upward apprehensively the short day was spent and the stars were coming out above yonder star said dabster is venus the evening star she is miles from the sun fudge said daisy with a brief flash of spirit where do you think i come from brooklyn susie price in our store her brother sent her a ticket to go to san francisco that s only three thousand miles the philosopher smiled indulgently our world he said is miles from the sun there are eighteen stars of the first magnitude that are times further from us than the sun is if one of them should be extinguished it would be three years before we would see its light go out there are six thousand stars of the sixth magnitude it takes thirty six years for the light of one of them to reach the earth with an eighteen foot telescope we can see stars including those of the thirteenth magnitude whose light takes years to reach us each of these stars you re lyin cried daisy angrily you re tryin to scare me and you have i want to go down she stamped her foot arcturus began the philosopher soothingly but he was interrupted by a demonstration out of the vastness of the nature that he was endeavoring to portray with his memory instead of his heart for to the heart expounder of nature the stars were set in the firmament expressly to give soft light to lovers wandering happily beneath them and if you stand tiptoe some september night with your sweetheart on your arm you can almost touch them with your hand three years for their light to reach us indeed out of the west leaped a meteor lighting the roof of the skyscraper almost to midday its fiery parabola was limned against the sky toward the east it hissed as it went and daisy screamed take me down she cried vehemently you you mental arithmetic dabster got her to the elevator and inside of it she was wild eyed and she shuddered when the express made its debilitating drop outside the revolving door of the skyscraper the philosopher lost her she vanished and he stood bewildered without figures or statistics to aid him joe had a lull in trade and by squirming among his stock succeeded in lighting a cigarette and getting one cold foot against the attenuated stove the door was burst open and daisy laughing crying scattering fruit and candies tumbled into his arms oh joe i ve been up on the skyscraper ain t it cozy and warm and homelike in here i m ready for you joe whenever you want me a bird of bagdad without a doubt much of the spirit and genius of the caliph harun al rashid descended to the margrave august michael von paulsen quigg quigg s restaurant is in fourth avenue that street that the city seems to have forgotten in its growth fourth avenue born and bred in the bowery staggers northward full of good resolutions where it crosses fourteenth street it struts for a brief moment proudly in the glare of the museums and cheap theatres it may yet become a fit mate for its high born sister boulevard to the west or its roaring polyglot broad waisted cousin to the east it passes union square and here the hoofs of the dray horses seem to thunder in unison recalling the tread of marching hosts hooray but now come the silent and terrible mountains buildings square as forts high as the clouds shutting out the sky where thousands of slaves bend over desks all day on the ground floors are only little fruit shops and laundries and book shops where you see copies of littell s living age and g w m reynold s novels in the windows and next poor fourth avenue the street glides into a mediaeval solitude on each side are shops devoted to antiques let us say it is night men in rusty armor stand in the windows and menace the hurrying cars with raised rusty iron gauntlets hauberks and helms blunderbusses cromwellian breastplates matchlocks creeses and the swords and daggers of an army of dead and gone gallants gleam dully in the ghostly light here and there from a corner saloon lit with jack o lanterns or phosphorus stagger forth shuddering home bound citizens nerved by the tankards within to their fearsome journey adown that eldrich avenue lined with the bloodstained weapons of the fighting dead what street could live inclosed by these mortuary relics and trod by these spectral citizens in whose sunken hearts scarce one good whoop or tra la la remained not fourth avenue not after the tinsel but enlivening glories of the little rialto not after the echoing drum beats of union square there need be no tears ladies and gentlemen tis but the suicide of a street with a shriek and a crash fourth avenue dives headlong into the tunnel at thirty fourth and is never seen again near the sad scene of the thoroughfare s dissolution stood the modest restaurant of quigg it stands there yet if you care to view its crumbling red brick front its show window heaped with oranges tomatoes layer cakes pies canned asparagus its papier m ach e lobster and two maltese kittens asleep on a bunch of lettuce if you care to sit at one of the little tables upon whose cloth has been traced in the yellowest of coffee stains the trail of the japanese advance to sit there with one eye on your umbrella and the other upon the bogus bottle from which you drop the counterfeit sauce foisted upon us by the cursed charlatan who assumes to be our dear old lord and friend the nobleman in india quigg s title came through his mother one of her ancestors was a margravine of saxony his father was a tammany brave on account of the dilution of his heredity he found that he could neither become a reigning potentate nor get a job in the city hall so he opened a restaurant he was a man full of thought and reading the business gave him a living though he gave it little attention one side of his house bequeathed to him a poetic and romantic adventure the other have him the restless spirit that made him seek adventure by day he was quigg the restaurateur by night he was the margrave the caliph the prince of bohemia going about the city in search of the odd the mysterious the inexplicable the recondite one night at at which hour the restaurant closed quigg set forth upon his quest there was a mingling of the foreign the military and the artistic in his appearance as he buttoned his coat high up under his short trimmed brown and gray beard and turned westward toward the more central life conduits of the city in his pocket he had stored an assortment of cards written upon without which he never stirred out of doors each of those cards was good at his own restaurant for its face value some called simply for a bowl of soup or sandwiches and coffee others entitled their bearer to one two three or more days of full meals a few were for single regular meals a very few were in effect meal tickets good for a week of riches and power margrave quigg had none but he had a caliph s heart it may be forgiven him if his head fell short of the measure of harun al rashid s perhaps some of the gold pieces in bagdad had put less warmth and hope into the complainants among the bazaars than had quigg s beef stew among the fishermen and one eyed calenders of manhattan continuing his progress in search of romance to divert him or of distress that he might aid quigg became aware of a fast gathering crowd that whooped and fought and eddied at a corner of broadway and the crosstown street that he was traversing hurrying to the spot he beheld a young man of an exceedingly melancholy and preoccupied demeanor engaged in the pastime of casting silver money from his pockets in the middle of the street with each motion of the generous one s hand the crowd huddled upon the falling largesse with yells of joy traffic was suspended a policman in the centre of the mob stooped often to the ground as he urged the blockaders to move on the margrave saw at a glance that here was food for his hunger after knowledge concerning abnormal working of the human heart he made his way swiftly to the young man s side and took his arm come with me at once he said in the low but commanding voice that his waiters had learned to fear pinched remarked the young man looking up at him with expressionless eyes pinched by a painless dentist take me away flatty and give me gas some lay eggs and some lay none when is a hen still deeply seized by some inward grief but tractable he allowed quigg to lead him away and down the street to a little park there seated on a bench he upon whom a corner of the great caliph s mantle has descended spake with kindness and discretion seeking to know what evil had come upon the other disturbing his soul and driving him to such ill considered and ruinous waste of his substance and stores i was doing the monte cristo act as adapted by pompton n j wasn t i asked the young man you were throwing small coins into the street for the people to scramble after said the margrave that s it you buy all the beer you can hold and then you throw chicken feed to oh curse that word chicken and hens feathers roosters eggs and everything connected with it young sir said the margrave kindly but with dignity though i do not ask your confidence i invite it i know the world and i know humanity man is my study though i do not eye him as the scientist eyes a beetle or as the philanthropist gazes at the objects of his bounty through a veil of theory and ignorance it is my pleasure and distraction to interest myself in the peculiar and complicated misfortunes that life in a great city visits upon my fellow men you may be familiar with the history of that glorious and immortal ruler the caliph harun al rashid whose wise and beneficent excursions among his people in the city of bagdad secured him the privilege of relieving so much of their distress in my humble way i walk in his footsteps i seek for romance and adventure in city streets not in ruined castles or in crumbling palaces to me the greatest marvels of magic are those that take place in men s hearts when acted upon by the furious and diverse forces of a crowded population in your strange behavior this evening i fancy a story lurks i read in your act something deeper than the wanton wastefulness of a spendthrift i observe in your countenance the certain traces of consuming grief or despair i repeat i invite your confidence i am not without some power to alleviate and advise will you not trust me gee how you talk exclaimed the young man a gleam of admiration supplanting for a moment the dull sadness of his eyes you ve got the astor library skinned to a synopsis of preceding chapters i mind that old turk you speak of i read the arabian nights when i was a kid he was a kind of bill devery and charlie schwab rolled into one but say you might wave enchanted dishrags and make copper bottles smoke up coon giants all night without ever touching me my case won t yield to that kind of treatment if i could hear your story said the margrave with his lofty serious smile i ll

several incubators you say you re giving imitations of the old arab guy that gave away libraries in bagdad well now can you whistle up a fairy that ll solve this hen query or not when the young man ceased the margrave arose and paced to and fro by the park bench for several minutes finally he sat again and said in grave and impressive tones i must confess sir that during the eight years that i have spent in search of adventure and in relieving distress i have never encountered a more interesting or a more perplexing case i fear that i have overlooked hens in my researches and observations as to their habits their times and manner of laying their many varieties and cross breedings their span of life their oh don t make an ibsen drama of it interrupted the young man flippantly riddles especially old hildebrant s riddles don t have to be worked out seriously they are light themes such as sim ford and harry thurston peck like to handle but somehow i can t strike just the answer bill watson may and he may not to morrow will tell well your majesty i m glad anyhow that you butted in and whiled the time away i guess mr al rashid himself would have bounced back if one of his constituents had conducted him up against this riddle i ll say good night peace fo yours and what you may call its of allah the margrave still with a gloomy air held out his hand i cannot exppress my regret he said sadly never before have i found myself unable to assist in some way what kind of a hen lays the longest it is a baffling problem there is a hen i believe called the plymouth rock that cut it out said the young man the caliph trade is a mighty serious one i don t suppose you d even see anything funny in a preacher s defense of john d rockefeller well good night your nibs from habit the margrave began to fumble in his pockets he drew forth a card and handed it to the young man do me the favor to accept this anyhow he said the time may come when it might be of use to you thanks said the young man pocketing it carelessly my name is simmons shame to him who would hint that the reader s interest shall altogether pursue the margrave august michael von paulsen quigg i am indeed astray if my hand fail in keeping the way where my peruser s heart would follow then let us on the morrow peep quickly in at the door of hildebrant harness maker hildebrant s pounds reposed on a bench silverbuckling a raw leather martingale bill watson came in first vell said hildebrant shaking all over with the vile conceit of the joke maker haf you guessed him vat kind of a hen lays der longest

der longest simmons regarded him with dull savagery in his eye should he curse this mountain of pernicious humor curse him and die why should but there was laura dogged speechless he thrust his hands into his coat pockets and stood his hand encountered the strange touch of the margrave s card he drew it out and looked at it as men about to be hanged look at a crawling fly there was written on it in quigg s bold round hand good for one roast chicken to bearer simmons looked up with a flashing eye a dead one said he goot roared hildebrant rocking the table with giant glee dot is right you gome at mine house at o clock to der party compliments of the season there are no more christmas stories to write fiction is exhausted and newspaper items the next best are manufactured by clever young journalists who have married early and have an engagingly pessimistic view of life therefore for seasonable diversion we are reduced to very questionable sources facts and philosophy we will begin with whichever you choose to call it children are pestilential little animals with which we have to cope under a bewildering variety of conditions especially when childish sorrows overwhelm them are we put to our wits end we exhaust our paltry store of consolation and then beat them sobbing to sleep then we grovel in the dust of a million years and ask god why thus we call out of the rat trap as for the children no one understands them except old maids hunchbacks and shepherd dogs now comes the facts in the case of the rag doll the tatterdemalion and the twenty fifth of december on the tenth of that month the child of the millionaire lost her rag doll there were many servants in the millionaire s palace on the hudson and these ransacked the house and grounds but without finding the lost treasure the child was a girl of five and one of those perverse little beasts that often wound the sensibilities of wealthy parents by fixing their affections upon some vulgar inexpensive toy instead of upon diamond studded automobiles and pony phaetons the child grieved sorely and truly a thing inexplicable to the millionaire to whom the rag doll market was about as interesting as bay state gas and to the lady the child s mother who was all form that is nearly all as you shall see the child cried inconsolably and grew hollow eyed knock kneed spindling and corykilverty in many other respects the millionaire smiled and tapped his coffers confidently the pick of the output of the french and german toymakers was rushed by special delivery to the mansion but rachel refused to be comforted she was weeping for her rag child and was for a high protective tariff against all foreign foolishness then doctors with the finest bedside manners and stop watches were called in one by one they chattered futilely about peptomanganate of iron and sea voyages and hypophosphites until their stop watches showed that bill rendered was under the wire for show or place then as men they advised that the rag doll be found as soon as possible and restored to its mourning parent the child sniffed at therapeutics chewed a thumb and wailed for her betsy and all this time cablegrams were coming from santa claus saying that he would soon be here and enjoining us to show a true christian spirit and let up on the pool rooms and tontine policies and platoon systems long enough to give him a welcome everywhere the spirit of christmas was diffusing itself the banks were refusing loans the pawn brokers had doubled their gang of helpers people bumped your shins on the streets with red sleds thomas and jeremiah bubbled before you on the bars while you waited on one foot holly wreaths of hospitality were hung in windows of the stores they who had em were getting their furs you hardly knew which was the best bet in balls three high moth or snow it was no time at which to lose the rag doll or your heart if doctor watson s investigating friend had been called in to solve this mysterious disappearance he might have observed on the millionaire s wall a copy of the vampire that would have quickly suggested by induction a rag and a bone and a hank of hair flip a scotch terrier next to the rag doll in the child s heart frisked through the halls the hank of hair aha x the unfound quantity represented the rag doll but the bone well when dogs find bones they done it were an easy and a fruitful task to examine flip s forefeet look watson earth dried earth between the toes of course the dog but sherlock was not there therefore it devolves but topography and architecture must intervene the millionaire s palace occupied a lordly space in front of it was a lawn close mowed as a south ireland man s face two days after a shave at one side of it and fronting on another street was a pleasuance trimmed to a leaf and the garage and stables the scotch pup had ravished the rag doll from the nursery dragged it to a corner of the lawn dug a hole and buried it after the manner of careless undertakers there you have the mystery solved and no checks to write for the hypodermical wizard of fi pun notes to toss to the sergeant then let s get down to the heart of the thing tiresome readers the christmas heart of the thing fuzzy was drunk not riotously or helplessly or loquaciously as you or i might get but decently appropriately and inoffensively as becomes a gentleman down on his luck fuzzy was a soldier of misfortune the road the haystack the park bench the kitchen door the bitter round of eleemosynary beds with shower bath attachment the petty pickings and ignobly garnered largesse of great cities these formed the chapters of his history fuzzy walked toward the river down the street that bounded one side of the millionaire s house and grounds he saw a leg of betsy the lost rag doll protruding like the clue to a lilliputian murder mystery from its untimely grave in a corner of the fence he dragged forth the maltreated infant tucked it under his arm and went on his way crooning a road song of his brethrren that no doll that has been brought up to the sheltered life should hear well for betsy that she had no ears and well that she had no eyes save unseeing circles of black for the faces of fuzzy and the scotch terrier were those of brothers and the heart of no rag doll could withstand twice to become the prey of such fearsome monsters though you may not know it grogan s saloon stands near the river and near the foot of the street down which fuzzy traveled in grogan s christmas cheer was already rampant fuzzy entered with his doll he fancied that as a mummer at the feast of saturn he might earn a few drops from the wassail cup he set betsy on the bar and addressed her loudly and humorously seasoning his speech with exaggerated compliments and endearments as one entertaining his lady friend the loafers and bibbers around caught the farce of it and roared the bartender gave fuzzy a drink oh many of us carry rag dolls one for the lady suggested fuzzy impudently and tucked another contribution to art beneath his waistcoat he began to see possibilities in betsy his first night had been a success visions of a vaudeville circuit about town dawned upon him in a group near the stove sat pigeon mccarthy black riley and one ear mike well and unfavorably known in the tough shoestring district that blackened the left bank of the river they passed a newspaper back and forth among themselves the item that each solid and blunt forefinger pointed out was an advertisement headed one hundred dollars reward to earn it one must return the rag doll lost strayed or stolen from the millionaire s mansion it seemed that grief still ravaged unchecked in the bosom of the too faithful child flip the terrier capered and shook his absurd whisker before her powerless to distract she wailed for her betsy in the faces of walking talking mama ing and eye closing french mabelles and violettes the advertisement was a last resort black riley came from behind the stove and approached fuzzy in his one sided parabolic way the christmas mummer flushed with success had tucked betsy under his arm and was about to depart to the filling of impromptu dates elsewhere say bo said black riley to him where did you cop out dat doll this doll asked fuzzy touching betsy with his forefinger to be sure that she was the one referred to his doll was presented to me by the emperor of beloochistan i have seven hundred others in my country home in newport this doll cheese the funny business said riley you swiped it or picked it up at de house on de hill where but never mind dat you want to take fifty cents for de rags and take it quick me brother s kid at home might be wantin to play wid it hey what he produced the coin fuzzy laughed a gurgling insolent alcoholic laugh in his face go to the office of sarah bernhardt s manager and propose to him that she be released from a night s performance to entertain the tackytown lyceum and literary coterie you will hear the duplicate of fuzzy s laugh black riley gauged fuzzy quickly with his blueberry eye as a wrestler does his hand was itching to play the roman and wrest the rag sabine from the extemporaneous merry andrew who was entertaining an angel unaware but he refrained fuzzy was fat and solid and big three inches of well nourished corporeity defended from the winter winds by dingy linen intervened between his vest and trousers countless small circular wrinkles running around his coat sleeves and knees guaranteed the quality of his bone and muscle his small blue eyes bathed in the moisture of altruism and wooziness looked upon you kindly yet without abashment he was whiskerly whiskyly fleshily formidable so black riley temporized wot ll you take for it den he asked money said fuzzy with husky firmness cannot buy her he was intoxicated with the artist s first sweet cup of attainment to set a faded blue earth stained rag doll on a bar to hold mimic converse with it and to find his heart leaping with the sense of plaudits earned and his throat scorching with free libations poured in his honor could base coin buy him from such achievements you will perceive that fuzzy had the temperament fuzzy walked out with the gait of a trained sea lion in search of other caf es to conquer though the dusk of twilight was hardly yet apparent lights were beginning to spangle the city like pop corn bursting in a deep skillet christmas eve impatiently expected was peeping over the brink of the hour millions had prepared for its celebration towns would be painted red you yourself have heard the horns and dodged the capers of the saturnalians pigeon mccarthy black riley and one ear mike held a hasty converse outside grogan s they were narrow chested pallid striplings not fighters in the open but more dangerous in their ways of warfare than the most terrible of turks fuzzy in a pitched battle could have eaten the three of them in a go as you please encounter he was already doomed they overtook him just as he and betsy were entering costigan s casino they deflected him and shoved the newspaper under his nose fuzzy could read and more boys said he you are certainly damn true friends give me a week to think it over the soul of a real artist is quenched with difficulty the boys carefully pointed out to him that advertisements were soulless and that the deficiencies of the day might not be supplied by the morrow a cool hundred said fuzzy thoughtfully and mushily booys said he you are true friends i ll go up and claim the reward the show business is not what it used to be night was falling more surely the three tagged at his sides to the foot of the rise on which stood the millionaire s house there fuzzy turned upon them acrimoniously you are a pack of putty faced beagle hounds he roared go away they went away a little way in pigeon mccarthy s pocket was a section of one inch gas pipe eight inches long in one end of it and in the middle of it was a lead plug one half of it was packed tight with solder black riley carried a slung shot being a conventional thug one ear mike relied upon a pair of brass knucks an heirloom in the family why fetch and carry said black riley when some one will do it for ye let him bring it out to us hey what we can chuck him in the river said pigeon mccarthy with a stone tied to his feet youse guys make me tired said one ear mike sadly ain t progress ever appealed to none of yez sprinkle a little gasoline on im and drop im on the drive well fuzzy entered the millionaire s gate and zigzagged toward the softly glowing entrance of the mansion the three goblins came up to the gate and lingered one on each side of it one beyond the roadway they fingered their cold metal and leather confident fuzzy rang the door bell smiling foolishly and dreamily an atavistic instrinct prompted him to reach for the button of his right glove but he wore no gloves so his left hand dropped embarrassed the particular menial whose duty it was to open doors to silks and laces shied at first sight of fuzzy but a second glance took in his passport his card of admission his surety of welcome the lost rag doll of the daughter of the house dangling under his arm fuzzy was admitted into a great hall dim with the glow from unseen lights the hireling went away and returned with a maid and the child the doll was restored to the mourning one she clasped her lost darling to her breast and then with the inordinate selfishness and candor of childhood stamped her foot and whined hatred and fear of the odious being who had rescued her from the depths of sorrow and despair fuzzy wriggled himself into an ingratiatory attitude and essayed the idiotic smile and blattering small talk that is supposed to charm the budding intellect of the young the child bawled and was dragged away hugging her betsy close there came the secretary pale poised polished gliding in pumps and worshipping pomp and ceremony he counted out into fuzzy s hand ten ten dollar bills then dropped his eye upon the door transferred it to james its custodian indicated the obnoxious earner of the reward with the other and allowed his pumps to waft him away to secretarial regions james gathered fuzzy with his own commanding optic and swept him as far as the front door when the money touched fuzzy s dingy palm his first instinct was to take to his heels but a second thought restrained him from that blunder of etiquette it was his it had been given him it and oh what an elysium it opened to the gaze of his mind s eye he had tumbled to the foot of the ladder he was hungry homeless friendless ragged cold drifting and he held in his hand the key to a paradise of the mud honey that he craved the fairy doll had waved a wand with her rag stuffed hand and now wherever he might go the enchanted palaces with shining foot rests and magic red fluids in gleaming glassware would be open to him he followed james to the door he paused there as the flunky drew open the great mahogany portal for him to pass into the vestibule beyond the wrought iron gates in the dark highway black riley and his two pals casually strolled fingering under their coats the inevitably fatal weapons that were to make the reward of the rag doll theirs fuzzy stopped at the millionaire s door and bethought himself like little sprigs of mistletoe on a dead tree certain living green thoughts and memories began to decorate his confused mind he was quite drunk mind you and the present was beginning to fade those wreaths aand festoons of holly with their scarlet berries making the great hall gay where had he seen such things before somewhere he had known polished floors and odors of fresh flowers in winter and and some one was singing a song in the house that he thought he had heard before some one singing and playing a harp of course it was christmas fuzzy though he must have been pretty drunk to have overlooked that and then he went out of the present and there came back to him out of some impossible vanished and irrevocable past a little pure white transient forgotten ghost the spirit of nobless oblige upon a gentleman certain things devolve james opened the outer door a stream of light went down the graveled walk to the iron gate black riley mccarthy and one ear mike saw and carelessly drew their sinister cordon closer about the gate with a more imperious gesture than james s master had ever used or could ever use fuzzy compelled the menial to close the door upon a gentleman certain things devolve especially at the christmas season it is cust customary he said to james the flustered when a gentleman calls on christmas eve to pass the compliments of the season with the lady of the house you und stand i shall not move shtep till i pass compl ments season with lady the house und stand there was an argument james lost fuzzy raised his voice and sent it through the house unpleasantly i did not say he was a gentleman he was simply a tramp being visited by a ghost a sterling silver bell rang james went back to answer it leaving fuzzy in the hall james explained somewhere to some one then he came and conducted fuzzy into the library the lady entered a moment later she was more beautiful and holy than any picture that fuzzy had seen she smiled and said something about a doll fuzzy didn t understand that he remembered nothing about a doll a footman brought in two small glasses of sparkling wine on a stamped sterling silver waiter the lady took one the other was handed to fuzzy as his fingers closed on the slender glass stem his disabilities dropped from him for one brief moment he straightened himself and time so disobliging to most of us turned backward to accomodate fuzzy forgotten christmas ghosts whiter than the false beards of the most opulent kris kringle were rising in the fumes of grogan s whisky what had the millionaire s mansion to do with a long wainscoted virginia hall where the riders were grouped around a silver punch bowl drinking the ancient toast of the house and why should the patter of the cab horses hoofs on the frozen street be in any wise related to the sound of the saddled hunters stamping under the shelter of the west veranda and what had fuzzy to do with any of it the lady looking at him over her glass let her condescending smile fade away like a false dawn her eyes turned serious she saw something beneath the rags and scotch terrier whiskers that she did not understand but it did not matter fuzzy lifted his glass and smiled vacantly p pardon lady he said but couldn t leave without exchangin comp ments sheason with lady th house gainst princ ples gen leman do sho and then he began the ancient salutation that was a tradition in the house when men wore lace ruffles and powder the blessings of another year fuzzy s memory failed him the lady prompted be upon this hearth the guest stammered fuzzy and upon her who continued the lady with a leading smile oh cut it out said fuzzy ill manneredly i can t remember drink hearty fuzzy had shot his arrow they drank the lady smiled again the smile of her caste james enveloped and re conducted him toward the front door the harp music still softly drifted through the house outside black riley breathed on his cold hands and hugged the gate i wonder said the lady to herself musing who but there were so many who came i wonder whether memory is a curse or a blessing to them after they have fallen so low fuzzy and his escort were nearly at the door the lady called james james stalked back obsequiously leaving fuzzy waiting unsteadily with his brief spark of the divine fire gone outside black riley stamped his cold feet and got a firmer grip on his section of gas pipe you will conduct this gentleman said the lady downstairs then tell louis to get out the mercedes and take him to whatever place he wishes to go a night in new arabia the great city of bagdad on the subway is caliph ridden its palaces bazaars khans and byways are thronged with al rashids in divers disguises seeking diversion and victims for their unbridled generosity you can scarcely find a poor beggar whom they are willing to let enjoy his spoils unsuccored nor a wrecked unfortunate upon whom they will not reshower the means of fresh misfortune you will hardly find anywhere a hungry one who has not had the opportunity to tighten his belt in gift libraries nor a poor pundit who has not blushed at the holiday basket of celery crowned turkey forced resoundingly through his door by the eleemosynary press so then fearfully through the harun haunted streets creep the one eyed calenders the little hunchback and the barber s sixth brother hoping to escape the ministrations of the roving horde of caliphoid sultans entertainment for many arabian nights might be had from the histories of those who have escaped the largesse of the army of commanders of the faithful until dawn you might sit on the enchanted rug and listen to such stories as are told of the powerful genie roc ef el er who sent the forty thieves to soak up the oil plant of ali baba of the good caliph kar neg ghe who gave away palaces of the seven voyages of sailbad the sinner who frequented wooden excursion steamers among the islands of the fisherman and the bottle of the barmecides boarding house of aladdin s rise to wealth by means of his wonderful gasmeter but now there being ten sultans to one sheherazade she is held too valuable to be in fear of the bowstring in consequence the art of narrative languishes and as the lesser caliphs are hunting the happy poor and the resigned unfortunate from cover to cover in order to heap upon them strange mercies and mysterious benefits too often comes the report from arabian headquarters that the captive refused to talk this reticence then in the actors who perform the sad comedies of their philanthropy scourged world must in a degree account for the shortcomings of this painfully gleaned tale which shall be called the story of the caliph who alleviated his conscience old jacob spraggins mixed for himself some scotch and lithia water at his oak sideboard inspiration must have resulted from its imbibition for immediately afterward he struck the quartered oak soundly with his fist and shouted to the empty dining room by the coke ovens of hell it must be that ten thousand dollars if i can get that squared it ll do the trick thus by the commonest artifice of the trade having gained your interest the action of the story will now be suspended leaving you grumpily to consider a sort of dull biography beginning fifteen years before when old jacob was young jacob he was a breaker boy in a pennsylvania coal mine i don t know what a breaker boy is but his occupation seems to be standing by a coal dump with a wan look and a dinner pail to have his picture taken for magazine articles anyhow jacob was one but instead of dying of overwork at nine and leaving his helpless parents and brothers at the mercy of the union strikers reserve fund he hitched up his galluses put a dollar or two in a side proposition now and then and at forty five was worth there now it s over hardly had time to yawn did you i ve seen biographies that but let us dissemble i want you to consider jacob spraggins esq after he had arrived at the seventh stage of his career the stages meant are first humble origin second deserved promotion third stockholder fourth capitalist fifth trust magnate sixth rich malefactor seventh caliph eighth x the eighth stage shall be left to the higher mathematics at fifty five jacob retired from active business the income of a czar was still rolling in on him from coal iron real estate oil railroads manufactories and corporations but none of it touched jacob s hands in a raw state it was a sterilized increment carefully cleaned and dusted and fumigated until it arrived at its ultimate stage of untainted spotless checks in the white fingers of his private secretary jacob built a three million dollar palace on a corner lot fronting on nabob avenue city of new bagdad and began to feel the mantle of the late h a rashid descending upon him eventually jacob slipped the mantle under his collar tied it in a neat four in hand and became a licensed harrier of our mesopotamian proletariat when a man s income becomes so large that the butcher actually sends him the kind of steak he orders he begins to think about his soul s salvation now the various stages or classes of rich men must not be forgotten the capitalist can tell you to a dollar the amount of his wealth the trust magnate estimates it the rich malefactor hands you a cigar and denies that he has bought the p d q the caliph merely smiles and talks about hammerstein and the musical lasses there is a record of tremendous altercation at breakfast in a where to dine well tavern between a magnate and his wife the rift within the loot being that the wife calculated their fortune at a figure higher than did her future divorc oh well i myself heard a similar quarrel between a man and his wife because he found fifty cents less in his pockets than he thought he had after all we are all human count tolstoi r fitzsimmons peter pan and the rest of us don t lose heart because the story seems to be degenerating into a sort of moral essay for intellectual readers there will be dialogue and stage business pretty soon when jacob first began to compare the eyes of needles with the camels in the zoo he decided upon organized charity he had his secretary send a check for one million to the universal benevolent association of the globe you may have looked down through a grating in front of a decayed warehouse for a nickel that you had dropped through but that is neither here nor there the association acknowledged receipt of his favor of the th ult with enclosure as stated separated by a double line but still mighty close to the matter under the caption of oddities of the day s news in an evening paper jacob spraggins read that one jasper spargyous had donated to the u b a of g a camel may have a stomach for each day in the week but i dare not venture to accord him whiskers for fear of the great displeasure at washington but if he have whiskers surely not one of them will seem to have been inserted in the eye of a needle by that effort of that rich man to enter the k of h the right is reserved to reject any and all bids signed s peter secretary and gatekeeper next jacob selected the best endowed college he could scare up and presented it with a laboratory the college did not maintain a scientific course but it accepted the money and built an elaborate lavatory instead which was no diversion of funds so far as jacob ever discovered the faculty met and invited jacob to come over and take his a b c degree before sending the invitation they smiled cut out the c added the proper punctuation marks and all was well while walking on the campus before being capped and gowned jacob saw two professors strolling nearby their voices long adapted to indoor acoustics undesignedly reached his ear there goes the latest chevalier d industrie said one of them to buy a sleeping powder from us he gets his degree to morrow in foro conscientai said the other let s eave arf a brick at im jacob ignored the latin but the brick pleasantry was not too hard for him there was no mandragora in the honorary draught of learning that he had bought that was before the passage of the pure food and drugs act jacob wearied of philanthropy on a large scale if i could see folks made happier he said to himself if i could see em myself and hear em express their gratitude for what i done for em it would make me feel better this donatin funds to institutions and societies is about as satisfactory as dropping money into a broken slot machine so jacob followed his nose which led him through unswept streets to the homes of the poorest the very thing said jacob i will charter two river steamboats pack them full of these unfortunate children and say ten thousand dolls and drums and a thousand freezers of ice cream and give them a delightful outing up the sound the sea breezes on that trip ought to blow the taint off some of this money that keeps coming in faster than i can work it off my mind jacob must have leaked some of his benevolent intentions for an immense person with a bald face and a mouth that looked as if it ought to have a drop letters here sign over it hooked a finger around him and set him in a space between a barber s pole and a stack of ash cans words came out of the post office slit smooth husky words with gloves on em but sounding as if they might turn to bare knuckles any moment say sport do you know where you are at well dis is mike o grady s district you re buttin into see mike s got de stomach ache privilege for every kid in dis neighborhood see and if dere s any picnics or red balloons to be dealt out here mike s money pays for em see don t you butt in or something ll be handed to you youse d settlers and reformers with your social ologies and your millionaire detectives have got dis district in a hell of a fix anyhow with your college students and professors rough housing de soda water stands and dem rubber neck coaches fillin de streets de folks down here are fraid to go out of de houses now you leave em to mike dey belongs to him and he knows how to handle em keep on your own side of de town are you some wiser now uncle or do you want to scrap wit mike o grady for de santa claus belt in dis district clearly that spot in the moral vineyard was preempted so caliph spraggins menaced no more the people in the bazaars of the east side to keep down his growing surplus he doubled his donations to organized charity presented the y m c a of his native town with a collection of butterflies and sent a check to the famine sufferers in china big enough to buy new emerald eyes and diamond filled teeth for all their gods but none of these charitable acts seemed to bring peace to the caliph s heart he tried to get a personal note into his benefactions by tipping bellboys and waiters and bills he got well snickered at and derided for that by the minions who accept with respect gratuities commensurate to the service performed he sought out an ambitious and talented but poor young woman and bought for her the star part in a new comedy he might have gotten rid of more of his cumbersome money in this philanthropy if he had not neglected to write letters to her but she lost the suit for lack of evidence while his capital still kept piling up and his optikos needleorum camelibus or rich man s disease was unrelieved in caliph spraggins s home lived his sister henrietta who used to cook for the coal miners in a twenty five cent eating house in coketown pa and who now would have offered john mitchell only two fingers of her hand to shake and his daughter celia nineteen back from boarding school and from being polished off by private instructors in the restaurant languages and those etudes and things celia is the heroine lest the artist s delineation of her charms on this very page humbug your fancy take from me her authorized description she was a nice looking awkward loud rather bashful brown haired girl with a sallow complexion bright eyes and a perpetual smile she had a wholesome spraggins inherited love for plain food loose clothing and the society of the lower classes she had too much health and youth to feel the burden of wealth she had a wide mouth that kept the peppermint pepsin tablets rattling like hail from the slot machine wherever she went and she could whistle hornpipes keep this picture in mind and let the artist do his worst celia looked out of her window one day and gave her heart to the grocer s young man the receiver thereof was at that moment engaged in conceding immortality to his horse and calling down upon him the ultimate fate of the wicked so he did not notice the transfer a horse should stand still when you are lifting a crate of strictly new laid eggs out of the wagon young lady reader you would have liked that grocer s young man yourself but you wouldn t have given him your heart because you are saving it for a riding master or a shoe manufacturer with a torpid liver or something quiet but rich in gray tweeds at palm beach oh i know about it so i am glad the grocer s young man was for celia and not for you the grocer s young man was slim and straight and as confident and easy in his movements as the man in the back of the magazines who wears the new frictionless roller suspenders he wore a gray bicycle cap on the back of his head and his hair was straw colored and curly and his sunburned face looked like one that smiled a good deal when he was not preaching the doctrine of everlasting punishment to delivery wagon horses he slung imported a fancy groceries about as though they were only the stuff he delivered at boarding houses and when he picked up his whip your mind instantly recalled mr tacktt and his air with the buttonless foils tradesmen delivered their goods at a side gate at the rear of the house the grocer s wagon came about ten in the morning for three days celia watched the driver when he came finding something new each time to admire in the lofty and almost contemptuous way he had of tossing around the choicest gifts of pomona ceres and the canning factories then she consulted annette to be explicit annette mccorkle the second housemaid who deserves a paragraph herself annette fletcherized large numbers of romantic novels which she obtained at a free public library branch donated by one of the biggest caliphs in the business she was celia s sidekicker and chum though aunt henrietta didn t know it you may hazard a bean or two oh canary bird seed exclaimed annette ain t it a corkin situation you a heiress and fallin in love with him on sight he s a sweet boy too and above his business but he ain t susceptible like the common run of grocer s assistants he never pays no attention to me he will to me said celia riches began annette unsheathing the not unjustifiable feminine sting oh you re not so beautiful said celia with her wide disarming smile neither am i but he sha n t know that there s any money mixed up with my looks such as they are that s fair now i want you to lend me one of your caps and an apron annette oh marshmallows cried annette i see ain t it lovely it s just like lurline the left handed or a buttonhole maker s wrongs i ll bet he ll turn out to be a count there was a long hallway or passageway as they call it in the land of the colonels with one side latticed running along the rear of the house the grocer s young man went through this to deliver his goods one morning he passed a girl in there with shining eyes sallow complexion and wide smiling mouth wearing a maid s cap and apron but as he was cumbered with a basket of early drumhead lettuce and trophy tomatoes and three bunches of asparagus and six bottles of the most expensive queen olives he saw no more than that she was one of the maids but on his way out he came up behind her and she was whistling fisher s hornpipe so loudly and clearly that all the piccolos in the world should have disjointed themselves and crept into their cases for shame the grocer s young man stopped and pushed back his cap until it hung on his collar button behind that s out o sight kid said he my name is celia if you please said the whistler dazzling him with a three inch smile that s all right i m thomas mcleod what part of the house do you work in i m the the second parlor maid do you know the falling waters no said celia we don t know anybody we got rich too quick that is mr spraggins did i ll make you acquainted said thomas mcleod it s a strathspey the first cousin to a hornpipe if celia s whistling put the piccolos out of commission thomas mcleod s surely made the biggest flutes hunt their holes he could actually whistle bass when he stopped celia was ready to jump into his delivery wagon and ride with him clear to the end of the pier and on to the ferry boat of the charon line i ll be around to morrow at said thomas with some spinach and a case of carbonic i ll practice that what you may call it said celia i can whistle a fine second the processes of courtship are personal and do not belong to general literature they should be chronicled in detail only in advertisements of iron tonics and in the secret by laws of the woman s auxiliary of the ancient order of the rat trap but genteel writing may contain a description of certain stages of its progress without intruding upon the province of the x ray or of park policemen a day came when thomas mcleod and celia lingered at the end of the latticed passage sixteen a week isn t much said thomas letting his cap rest on his shoulder blades celia looked through the lattice work and whistled a dead march shopping with aunt henrietta the day before she had paid that much for a dozen handkerchiefs maybe i ll get a raise next month said thomas i ll be around to morrow at the same time with a bag of flour and the laundry soap all right said celia annette s married cousin pays only a month for a flat in the bronx never for a moment did she count on the spraggins money she knew aunt henrietta s invincible pride of caste and pa s mightiness as a colossus of cash and she understood that if she chose thomas she and her grocer s young man might go whistle for a living another day came thomas violating the dignity of nabob avenue with the devil s dream whistled keenly between his teeth raised to eighteen a week yesterday he said been pricing flats around morningside you want to start untying those apron strings and unpinning that cap old girl oh tommy said celia with her broadest smile won t that be enough i got betty to show me how to make a cottage pudding i guess we could call it a flat pudding if we wanted to and tell no lie said thomas and i can sweep and polish and dust of course a parlor maid learns that and we cold whistle duets of evenings the old man said he d raise me to twenty at christmas if bryan couldn t think of any harder name to call a republican than a postponer said the grocer s young man i can sew said celia and i know that you must make the gas company s man show his badge when he comes to look at the meter and i know how to put up quince jam and window curtains bully you re all right cele yes i believe we can pull it off on eighteen as he was jumping into the wagon the second parlor maid braved discovery by running swiftly to the gate and oh tommy i forgot she called softly i believe i could make your neckties forget it said thomas decisively and another thing she continued sliced cucumbers at night will drive away cockroaches and sleep too you bet said mr mcleod yes i believe if i have a delivery to make on the west side this afternoon i ll look in at a furniture store i know over there it was just as the wagon dashed away that old jacob spraggins struck the sideboard with his fist and made the mysterious remark about ten thousand dollars that you perhaps remember which justifies the reflection that some stories as well as life and puppies thrown into wells move around in circles painfully but briefly we must shed light on jacob s words the foundation of his fortune was made when he was twenty a poor coal digger ever hear of a rich one had saved a dollar or two and bought a small tract of land on a hillside on which he tried to raise corn not a nubbin jacob whose nose was a divining rod told him there was a vein of coal beneath he bought the land from the miner for and sold it a month afterward for luckily the miner had enough left of his sale money to drink himself into a black coat opening in the back as soon as he heard the news and so for forty years afterward we find jacob illuminated with the sudden thought that if he could make restitution of this sum of money to the heirs or assigns of the unlucky miner respite and nepenthe might be his and now must come swift action for we have here some four thousand words and not a tear shed and never a pistol joke safe nor bottle cracked old jacob hired a dozen private detectives to find the heirs if any existed of the old miner hugh mcleod get the point of course i know as well as you do that thomas is going to be the heir i might have concealed the name but why always hold back you mystery till the end i say let it come near the middle so people can stop reading there if they want to after the detectives had trailed false clues about three thousand dollars i mean miles they cornered thomas at the grocery and got his confession that hugh mcleod had been his grandfather and that there were no other heirs they arranged a meeting for him and old jacob one morning in one of their offices jacob liked the young man very much he liked the way he looked straight at him when he talked and the way he threw his bicycle cap over the top of a rose colored vase on the centre table there was a slight flaw in jacob s system of restitution he did not consider that the act to be perfect should include confession so he represented himself to be the agent of the purchaser of the land who had sent him to refund the sale price for the ease of his conscience well sir said thomas this sounds to me like an illustrated post card from south boston with we re having a good time here written on it i don t know the game is this ten thousand dollars money or do i have to save so many coupons to get it old jacob counted out to him twenty five hundred dollar bills that was better he thought than a check thomas put them thoughtfully into his pocket grandfather s best thanks he said to the party who sends it jacob talked on asking him about his work how he spent his leisure time and what his ambitions were the more he saw and heard of thomas the better he liked him he had not met many young men in bagdad so frank and wholesome i would like to have you visit my house he said i might help you in investing or laying out your money i am a very wealthy man i have a daughter about grown and i would like for you to know her there are not many young men i would care to have call on her i m obliged said thomas i m not much at making calls it s generally the side entrance for mine and besides i m engaged to a girl that has the delaware peach crop killed in the blossom she s a parlor maid in a house where i deliver goods she won t be working there much longer though say don t forget to give your friend my grandfather s best regards you ll excuse me now my wagon s outside with a lot of green stuff that s got to be delivered see you again sir at eleven thomas delivered some bunches of parsley and lettuce at the spraggins mansion thomas was only twenty two so as he came back he took out the handful of five hundred dollar bills and waved them carelessly annette took a pair of eyes as big as creamed onion to the cook i told you he was a count she said after relating he never would carry on with me but you say he showed money said the cook hundreds of thousands said annette carried around loose in his pockets and he never would look at me it was paid to me to day thomas was explaining to celia outside it came from my grandfather s estate say cele what s the use of waiting now i m going to quit the job to night why can t we get married next week tommy said celia i m no parlor maid i ve been fooling you i m miss spraggins celia spraggins the newspapers say i ll be worth forty million dollars some day thomas pulled his cap down straight on his head for the first time since we have known him i suppose then said he i suppose then you ll not be marrying me next week but you can whistle no said celia i ll not be marrying you next week my father would never let me marry a grocer s clerk but i ll marry you to night tommy if you say so old jacob spraggins came home at p m in his motor car the make of it you will have to surmise sorrowfully i am giving you unsubsidized fiction had it been a street car i could have told you its voltage and the number of wheels it had jacob called for his daughter he had bought a ruby necklace for her and wanted to hear her say what a kind thoughtful dear old dad he was there was a brief search in the house for her and then came annette glowing with the pure flame of truth and loyalty well mixed with envy and histrionics oh sir said she wondering if she should kneel miss celia s just this minute running away out of the side gate with a young man to be married i couldn t stop her sir they went in a cab what young man roared old jacob a millionaire if you please sir a rich nobleman in disguise he carries his money with him and the red peppers and the onions was only to blind us sir he never did seem to take to me jacob rushed out in time to catch his car the chauffeur had been delayed by trying to light a cigarette in the wind here gaston or mike or whatever you call yourself scoot around the corner quicker than blazes and see if you can see a cab if you do run it down there was a cab in sight a block away gaston or mike with his eyes half shut and his mind on his cigarette picked up the trail neatly crowded the cab to the curb and pocketed it what t ell you doin yelled the cabman pa shrieked celia grandfather s remorseful friend s agent said thomas wonder what s on his conscience now a thousand thunders said gaston or mike i have no other match young man said old jacob severely how about that parlor maid you were engaged to a couple of years afterward old jacob went into the office of his private secretary the amalgamated missionary society solicits a contribution of toward the conversion of the koreans said the secretary pass em up said jacob the university of plumville writes that its yearly endowment fund of that you bestowed upon it is past due tell em it s been cut out the scientific society of clam cove long island asks for to buy alcohol to preserve specimens waste basket the society for providing healthful recreation for working girls wants from you to lay out a golf course tell em to see an undertaker cut em all out went on jacob i ve quit being a good thing i need every dollar i can scrape or save i want you to write to the directors of every company that i m interested in and recommend a per cent cut in salaries and say i noticed half a cake of soap lying in a corner of the hall as i came in i want you to speak to the scrubwoman about waste i ve got no money to throw away and say we ve got vinegar pretty well in hand haven t we the globe spice seasons company said secretary controls the market at present raise vinegar two cents a gallon notify all our branches suddenly jacob spraggin s plump red face relaxed into a pulpy grin he walked over to the secretary s desk and showed a small red mark on his thick forefinger bit it he said darned if he didn t and he ain t had the tooth three weeks jaky mcleod my celia s kid he ll be worth a hundred millions by the time he s twenty one if i can pile it up for him as he was leaving old jacob turned at the door and said better make that vinegar raise three cents instead of two i ll be back in an hour and sign the letters the true history of the caliph harun al rashid relates that toward the end of his reign he wearied of philanthropy and caused to be beheaded all his former favorites and companions of his arabian nights rambles happy are we in these days of enlightenment when the only death warrant the caliphs can serve on us is in the form of a tradesman s bill the girl and the habit habit a tendency or aptitude acquired by custom or frequent repitition the critics have assailed every source of inspiration save one to that one we are driven for our moral theme when we levied upon the masters of old they gleefully dug up the parallels to our columns when we strove to set forth real life they reproached us for trying to imitate henry george george washington washington irving and irving bacheller we wrote of the west and the east and they accused us of both jesse and henry james we wrote from our heart and they said something about a disordered liver we took a text from matthew or er yes deuteronomy but the preachers were hammering away at the inspiration idea before we could get into type so driven to the wall we go for our subject matter to the reliable old moral unassailable vade mecum the unabridged dictionary miss merriam was cashier at hinkle s hinkle s is one of the big downtown restaurants it is in what the papers call the financial district each day from o clock to hinkle s was full of hungry customers messenger boys stenographers brokers owners of mining stock promoters inventors with patents pending and also people with money the cashiership at hinkle s was no sinecure hinkle egged and toasted and griddle caked and coffeed a good many customers and he lunched as good a word as dined many more it might be said that hinkle s breakfast crowd was a contingent but his luncheon patronage amounted to a horde miss merriam sat on a stool at a desk inclosed on three sides by a strong high fencing of woven brass wire through an arched opening at the bottom you thrust your waiter s check and the money while your heart went pit pat for miss merriam was lovely and capable she could take cents out of a bill and refuse an offer of marriage before you could next lost your chance please don t shove she could keep cool and collected while she collected your check give you the correct change win your heart indicate the toothpick stand and rate you to a quarter of a cent better than bradstreet could to a thousand in less time than it takes to pepper an egg with one of hinkle s casters there is an old and dignified allusion to the fierce light that beats upon a throne the light that beats upon the young lady cashier s cage is also something fierce the other fellow is responsible for the slang every male patron of hinkle s from a d t boys up to the curbstone brokers adored miss merriam when they paid their checks they wooed her with every wile known to cupid s art between the meshes of the brass railing went smiles winks compliments tender vows invitations to dinner sighs languishing looks and merry banter that was wafted pointedly back by the gifted miss merriam there is no coign of vantage more effective than the position of young lady cashier she sits there easily queen of the court of commerce she is duchess of dollars and devoirs countess of compliment and coin leading lady of love and luncheon you take from her a smile and a canadian dime and you go your way uncomplaining you count the cheery word or two that she tosses you as misers count their treasures and you pocket the change for a five uncomputed perhaps the brass bound inaccessibility multiplies her charms anyhow she is a shirt waisted angel immaculate trim manicured seductive bright eyed ready alert psyche circe and ate in one separating you from your circulating medium after your sirloin medium the young men who broke bread at hinkle s never settled with the cashier without an exchange of badinage and open compliment many of them went to greater lengths and dropped promissory hints of theatre tickets and chocolate the older spoke plainly of orange blossoms generally withering the tentative petals by after allusions to harlem flats one broker who had been squeezed by copper proposed to miss merriam more regularly than he ate during a brisk luncheon hour miss merriam s conversation while she took money for checks would run something like this good morning mr haskins sir it s natural thank you don t be quite so fresh hello johnny ten fifteen twenty chase along now or they ll take the letters off your cap beg pardon count it again

an old wealthy and eccentric banker while he was walking past hinkle s on his way to a street car a wealthy and eccentric banker who rides in street cars is move up please there are others a samaritan a pharisee a man and a policeman who were first on the spot lifter banker mcramsey and carried him into hinkle s restaurant when the aged but indestructible banker opened his eyes he saw a beautikful vision bending over him with a pitiful tender smile bathing his forehead with beef tea and chafing his hands with something frapp e out of a chafing dish mr mcramsey sighed lost a vest button gazed with deep gratitude upon his fair preserveress and then recovered consciousness to the seaside library all who are anticipating a romance banker mcramsey had an aged and respected wife and his sentiments toward miss merriam were fatherly he talked to her for half an hour with interest not the kind that went with his talks during business hours the next day he brought mrs mcramsey down to see her the old couple were childless they had only a married daughter living in brooklyn to make a short story shorter the beautiful cashier won the hearts of the good old couple they came to hinkle s again and again they invited her to their old fashioned but splendid home in one of the east seventies miss merriam s winning loveliness her sweet frankness and impulsive heart took them by storm they said a hundred times that miss merriam reminded them so much of their lost daughter the brooklyn matron n ee ramsey had the figure of buddha and a face like the ideal of an art photographer miss merriam was a combination of curves smiles rose leaves pearls satin and hair tonic posters enough of the fatuity of parents a month after the worthy couple became acquainted with miss merriam she stood before hinkle one afternoon and resigned her cashiership they re going to adopt me she told the bereft restaurateur they re funny old people but regular dears and the swell home they have got say hinkle there isn t any use of talking i m on the a la carte to wear brown duds and goggles in a whiz wagon or marry a duke at least still i somehow hate to break out of the old cage i ve been cashiering so long i feel funny doing anything else i ll miss joshing the fellows awfully when they line up to pay for the buckwheats and but i can t let this chance slide and they re awfully good hinkle i know i ll have a swell time you owe me nine sixty two and a half for the week cut out the half if it hurts you hinkle and they did miss merriam became miss rosa mcramsey and she graced the transition beauty is only skin deep but the nerves lie very near to the skin nerve but just here will you oblige by perusing again the quotation with which this story begins the mcramseys poured out money like domestic champagne to polish their adopted one milliners dancing masters and private tutors got it miss er mcramsey was grateful loving and tried to forget hinkle s to give ample credit to the adaptability of the american girl hinkle s did fade from her memory and speech most of the time not every one will remember when the earl of hitesbury came to east seventy street america he was only a fair to medium earl without debts and he created little excitement but you will surely remember the evening when the daughters of benevolence haled their bazaar in the w f a a hotel for you were there and you wrote a note to fannie on the hotel paper and mailed it just to show her that you did not very well that was the evening the baby was sick of course at the bazaar the mcramseys were prominent miss mer er mcramsey was exquisitely beautiful the earl of hitesbury had been very attentive to her since he dropped in to have a look at america at the charity bazaar the affair was supposed to be going to be pulled off to a finish an earl is as good as a duke better his standing may be lower but his outstanding accounts are also lower our ex young lady cashier was assigned to a booth she was expected to sell worthless articles to nobs and snobs at exorbitant prices the proceeds of the bazaar were to be used for giving the poor children of the slums a christmas din say did you ever wonder where they get the other miss mcramsey beautiful palpitating excited charming radiant fluttered about in her booth an imitation brass network with a little arched opening fenced her in along came the earl assured delicate accurate admiring admiring greatly and faced the open wicket you look chawming you know pon my word you do my deah he said beguilingly cut that joshing out she said coolly and briskly who do you think you are talking to your check please oh lordy patrons of the bazaar became aware of a commotion and pressed around a certain booth the earl of hitesbury stood near by pulling a pale blond and puzzled whisker miss mcramsey has fainted some one explained proof of the pudding spring winked a vitreous optic at editor westbrook of the minerva magazine and deflected him from his course he had lunched in his favorite corner of a broadway hotel and was returning to his office when his feet became entangled in the lure of the vernal coquette which is by way of saying that he turned eastward in twenty sixth street safely forded the spring freshet of vehicles in fifth avenue and meandered along the walks of budding madison square the lenient air and the settings of the little park almost formed a pastoral the color motif was green the presiding shade at the creation of man and vegetation the callow grass between the walks was the color of verdigris a poisonous green reminiscent of the horde of derelict humans that had breathed upon the soil during the summer and autumn the bursting tree buds looked strangely familiar to those who had botanized among the garnishings of the fish course of a forty cent dinner the sky above was of that pale aquamarine tint that ballroom poets rhyme with true and sue and coo the one natural and frank color visible was the ostensible green of the newly painted benches a shade between the color of a pickled cucumber and that of a last year s fast black cravenette raincoat but to the city bred eye of editor westbrook the landscape appeared a masterpiece and now whether you are of those who rush in or of the gentle concourse that fears to tread you must follow in a brief invasion of the editor s mind editor westbrook s spirit was contented and serene the april number of the minerva had sold its entire edition before the tenth day of the month a newsdealer in keokuk had written that he could have sold fifty copies more if he had em the owners of the magazine had raised his the editor s salary he had just installed in his home a jewel of a recently imported cook who was afraid of policemen and the morning papers had published in full a speech he had made at a publishers banquet also there were echoing in his mind the jubilant notes of a splendid song that his charming young wife had sung to him before he left his up town apartment that morning she was taking enthusiastic interest in her music of late practising early and diligently when he had complimented her on the improvement in her voice she had fairly hugged him for joy at his praise he felt too the benign tonic medicament of the trained nurse spring tripping softly adown the wards of the convalescent city while editor westbrook was sauntering between the rows of park benches already filling with vagrants and the guardians of lawless childhood he felt his sleeve grasped and held suspecting that he was about to be panhandled he turned a cold and unprofitable face and saw that his captor was dawe shackleford dawe dingy almost ragged the genteel scracely visible in him through the deeper lines of the shabby while the editor is pulling himself out of his surprise a flashlight biography of dawe is offered he was a fiction writer and one of westbrook s old acquaintances at one time they might have called each other old friends dawe had some money in those days and lived in a decent apartment house near westbrook s the two families often went to theatres and dinners together mrs dawe and mrs westbrook became dearest friends then one day a little tentacle of the octopus just to amuse itself ingurgitated dawe s capital and he moved to the gramercy park neighborhood where one for a few groats per week may sit upon one s trunk under eight branched chandeliers and opposite carrara marble mantels and watch the mice play upon the floor dawe thought to live by writing fiction now and then he sold a story he submitted many to westbrook the minerva printed one or two of them the rest were returned westbrook sent a careful and conscientious personal letter with each rejected manuscript pointing out in detail his reasons for considering it unavailable editor westbrook had his own clear conception of what constituted good fiction so had dawe mrs dawe was mainly concerned about the constituents of the scanty dishes of food that she managed to scrape together one day dawe had been spouting to her about the excellencies of certain french writers at dinner they sat down to a dish that a hungry schoolboy could have encompassed at a gulp dawe commented it s maupassant hash said mrs dawe it may not be art but i do wish you would do a five course marion crawford serial with an ella wheeler wilcox sonnet for dessert i m hungry as far as this from success was shackleford dawe when he plucked editor westbrook s sleeve in madison square that was the first time the editor had seen dawe in several months why shack is this you said westbrook somewhat awkwardly for the form of his phrase seemed to touch upon the other s changed appearance sit down for a minute said dawe tugging at his sleeve this is my office i can t come to yours looking as i do oh sit down you won t be disgraced those half plucked birds on the other benches will take you for a swell porch climber they won t know you are only an editor smoke shack said editor westbrook sinking cautiously upon the virulent green bench he always yielded gracefully when he did yield dawe snapped at the cigar as a kingfisher darts at a sunperch or a girl pecks at a chocolate cream i have just began the editor oh i know don t finish said dawe give me a match you have just ten minutes to spare how did you manage to get past my office boy and invade my sanctum there he goes now throwing his club at a dog that couldn t read the keep off the grass signs how goes the writing asked the editor look at me said dawe for your answer now don t put on that embarrassed friendly but honest look and ask me why i don t get a job as a wine agent or a cab driver i m in the fight to a finish i know i can write good fiction and i ll force you fellows to admit it yet i ll make you change the spelling of regrets to c h e q u e before i m done with you editor westbrook gazed through his nose glasses with a sweetly sorrowful omniscient sympathetic skeptical expression the copyrighted expression of the editor beleagured by the unavailable contributor have you read the last story i sent you the alarum of the soul asked dawe carefully i hesitated over that story shack really i did it had some good points i was writing you a letter to send with it when it goes back to you i regret never mind the regrets said dawe grimly there s neither salve nor sting in em any more what i want to know is why come now out with the good points first the story said westbrook deliberately after a suppressed sigh is written around an almost original plot characterization the best you have done construction almost as good except for a few weak joints which might be strengthened by a few changes and touches it was a good story except i can write english can t i interrupted dawe i have always told you said the editor that you had a style then the trouble is same old thing said editor westbrook you work up to your climax like an artist and then you turn yourself into a photographer i don t know what form of obstinate madness possesses you but that is what you do with everything that you write no i will retract the comparison with the photographer now and then photography in spite of its impossible perspective manages to record a fleeting glimpse of truth but you spoil every d enouement by those flat drab obliterating strokes of your brush that i have so often complained of if you would rise to the literary pinnacle of your dramatic senses and paint them in the high colors that art requires the postman would leave fewer bulky self addressed envelopes at your door oh fiddles and footlights cried dawe derisively you ve got that old sawmill drama kink in your brain yet when the man with the black mustache kidnaps golden haired bessie you are bound to have the mother kneel and raise her hands in the spotlight and say may high heaven witness that i will rest neither night nor day till the heartless villain that has stolen me child feels the weight of another s vengeance editor westbrook conceded a smile of impervious complacency i think said he that in real life the woman would express herself in those words or in very similar ones not in a six hundred nights run anywhere but on the stage said dawe hotly i ll tell you what she d say in real life she d say what bessie led away by a strange man good lord it s one trouble after another get my other hat i must hurry around to the police station why wasn t somebody looking after her i d like to know for god s sake get out of my way or i ll never get ready not that hat the brown one with the velvet bows bessie must have been crazy she s usually shy of strangers is that too much powder lordy how i m upset that s the way she d talk continued dawe people in real life don t fly into heroics and blank verse at emotional crises they simply can t do it if they talk at all on such occasions they draw from the same vocabulary that they use every day and muddle up their words and ideas a little more that s all shack said editor westbrook impressively did you ever pick up the mangled and lifeless form of a child from under the fender of a street car and carry it in your arms and lay it down before the distracted mother did you ever do that and listen to the words of grief and despair as they flowed spontaneously from her lips i never did said dawe did you well no said editor westbrook with a slight frown but i can well imagine what she would say so can i said dawe and now the fitting time had come for editor westbrook to play the oracle and silence his opinionated contributor it was not for an unarrived fictionist to dictate words to be uttered by the heroes and heroines of the minerva magazine contrary to the theories of the editor thereof my dear shack said he if i know anything of life i know that every sudden deep and tragic emotion in the human heart calls forth an apposite concordant conformable and proportionate expression of feeling how much of this inevitable accord between expression and feeling should be attributed to nature and how much to the influence of art it would be difficult to say the sublimely terrible roar of the lioness that has been deprived of her cubs is dramatically as far above her customary whine and purr as the kingly and transcendent utterances of lear are above the level of his senile vaporings but it is also true that all men and women have what may be called a sub conscious dramatic sense that is awakened by a sufficiently deep and powerful emotion a sense unconsciously acquired from literature and the stage that prompts them to express those emotions in language befitting their importance and histrionic value and in the name of the seven sacred saddle blankets of sagittarius where did the stage and literature get the stunt asked dawe from life answered the editor triumphantly the story writer rose from the bench and gesticulated eloquently but dumbly he was beggared for words with which to formulate adequately his dissent on a bench nearby a frowzy loafer opened his red eyes and perceived that his moral support was due a downtrodden brother punch him one jack he called hoarsely to dawe w at s he come makin a noise like a penny arcade for amongst gen lemen that comes in the square to set and think editor westbrook looked at his watch with an affected show of leisure tell me asked dawe with truculent anxiety what especial faults in the alarum of the soul caused you to throw it down when gabriel murray said westbrook goes to his telephone and is told that his fianc ee has been shot by a burglar he says i do not recall the exact words but i do said dawe he says damn central she always cuts me off and then to his friend say tommy does a thirty two bullet make a big hole it s kind of hard luck ain t it could you get me a drink from the sideboard tommy no straight nothing on the side and again continued the editor without pausing for argument when berenice opens the letter from her husband informing her that he has fled with the manicure girl her words are let me see she says interposed the author well what do you think of that absurdly inappropriate words said westbrook presenting an anti climax plunging the story into hopeless bathos worse yet they mirror life falsely no human being ever uttered banal colloquialisms when confronted by sudden tragedy wrong said dawe closing his unshaven jaws doggedly i say no man or woman ever spouts high falutin talk when they go up against a real climax they talk naturally and a little worse the editor rose from the bench with his air of indulgence and inside information say westbrook said dawe pinning him by the lapel would you have accepted the alarum of the soul if you had believed that the actions and words of the characters were true to life in the parts of the story that we discussed it is very likely that i would if i believed that way said the editor but i have explained to you that i do not if i could prove to you that i am right i m sorry shack but i m afraid i haven t time to argue any further just now i don t want to argue said dave i want to demonstrate to you from life itself that my view is the correct one how could you do that asked westbrook in a surprised tone listen said the writer seriously i have thought of a way it is important to me that my theory of true to life fiction be recognized as correct by the magazines i ve fought for it for three years and i m down to my last dollar with two months rent due i have applied the opposite of your theory said the editor in selecting the fiction for the minerva magazine the circulation has gone up from ninety thousand to four hundred thousand said dawe whereas it should have been boosted to a million you said something to me just now about demonstrating your pet theory i will if you ll give me about half an hour of your time i ll prove to you that i am right i ll prove it by louise your wife exclaimed westbrook how well not exactly by her but with her said dawe now you know how devoted and loving louse has always been she thinks i m the only genuine preparation on the market that bears the old doctor s signature she s been fonder and more faithful than ever since i ve been cast for the neglected genius part indeed she is a charming and admirable life companion agreed the editor i remember what inseparable friends she and mrs westbrook once were we are both lucky chaps shack to have such wives you must bring mrs dawe up some evening soon and we ll have one of those informal chafing dish suppers that we used to enjoy so much later said dawe when i get another shirt and now i ll tell you my scheme when i was about to leave home after breakfast if you can call tea and oatmeal breakfast louise told me she was going to visit her aunt in eighty ninth street she said she would return at three o clock she is always on time to a minute it is now dawe glanced toward the editor s watch pocket twenty seven minutes to three said westbrook scanning his time piece we have just enough time said dawe we will go to my flat at once i will write a note address it to her and leave it on the table where she will see it as she enters the door you and i will be in the dining room concealed by the porti eres in that note i ll say that i have fled from her forever with an affinity who understands the need of my artistic soul as she never did when she reads it we will observe her actions and hear her words then we will know which theory is the correct one yours or mine oh never exclaimed the editor shaking his head that would be inexcusably cruel i could not consent to have mrs dawe s feelings played upon in such a manner brace up said the writer i guess i think as much of her as you do it s for her benefit as well as mine i ve got to get a market for my stories in some way it won t hurt louise she s healthy and sound her heart goes as strong as a ninety eight cent watch it ll last for only a minute and then i ll step out and explain to her you really owe it to me to give me the chance westbrook editor westbrook at length yielded though but half willingly and in the half of him that consented lurked the vivisectionist that is in all of us let him who has not used the scalpel rise and stand in his place pity tis that there are not enough rabbits and guinea pigs to go around the two experimenters in art left the square and hurried eastward and then to that south until they arrived in the gramercy neighborhood within its high iron railings the little park had put on its smart coat of vernal green and was admiring itself in its fountain mirror outside the railings the hollow square of crumbling houses shells of a bygone gentry leaned as if in ghostly gossip over the forgotten doings of the vanished quality sic transit gloria urbis a block or two north of the park dawe steered the editor again eastward then after covering a short distance into a lofty but narrow flathouse burdened with a floridly over decorated fa cade to the fifth story they toiled and dawe panting pushed his latch key into the door of one of the front flats when the door opened editor westbrook saw with feelings of pity how meanly and meagerly the rooms were furnished get a chair if you can find one said dawe while i hunt up pen and ink hello what s this here s a note from louise she must have left it there when she went out this morning he picked up an envelope that lay on the centre table and tore it open he began to read the letter that he drew out of it and once having begun it aloud he so read it through to the end these are the words that editor westbrook heard dear shackleford by the time you get this i will be about a hundred miles away and still a going i ve got a place in the chorus of the occidental opera co and we start on the road to day at twelve o clock i didn t want to starve to death and so i decided to make my own living i m not coming back mrs westbrook is going with me she said she was tired of living with a combination phonograph iceberg and dictionary and she s not coming back either we ve been practising the songs and dances for two months on the quiet i hope you will be successful and get along all right good bye louise dawe dropped the letter covered his face with his trembling hands and cried out in a deep vibrating voice my god why hast thou given me this cup to drink since she is false then let thy heaven s fairest gifts faith and love become the jesting by words of traitors and fiends editor westbrook s glasses fell to the floor the fingers of one hand fumbled with a button on his coat as he blurted between his pale lips say shack ain t that a hell of a note wouldn t that knock you off your perch shack ain t it hell now shack ain t it past one at rooney s only on the lower east side of new york do the houses of capulet and montagu survive there they do not fight by the book of arithmetic if you but bite your thumb at an upholder of your opposing house you have work cut out for your steel on broadway you may drag your man along a dozen blocks by his nose and he will only bawl for the watch but in the domain of the east side tybalts and mercutios you must observe the niceties of deportment to the wink of any eyelash and to an inch of elbow room at the bar when its patrons include foes of your house and kin so when eddie mcmanus known to the capulets as cork mcmanus drifted into dutch mike s for a stein of beer and came upon a bunch of montagus making merry with the suds he began to observe the strictest parliamentary rules courtesy forbade his leaving the saloon with his thirst unslaked caution steered him to a place at the bar where the mirror supplied the cognizance of the enemy s movements that his indifferent gaze seemed to disdain experience whispered to him that the finger of trouble would be busy among the chattering steins at dutch mike s that night close by his side drew brick cleary his mercutio companion of his perambulations thus they stood four of the mulberry hill gang and two fo the dry dock gang minding their p s and q s so solicitously that dutch mike kept one eye on his customers and the other on an open space beneath his bar in which it was his custom to seek safety whenever the ominous politeness of the rival associations congealed into the shapes of bullets and cold steel but we have not to do with the wars of the mulberry hills and the dry docks we must to rooney s where on the most blighted dead branch of the tree of life a little pale orchid shall bloom overstrained etiquette at last gave way it is not known who first overstepped the bounds of punctilio but the consequences were immediate buck malone of the mulberry hills with a dewey like swiftness got an eight inch gun swung round from his hurricane deck but mcmanus s simile must be the torpedo he glided in under the guns and slipped a scant three inches of knife blade between the ribs of the mulberry hill cruiser meanwhile brick cleary a devotee to strategy had skimmed across the lunch counter and thrown the switch of the electrics leaving the combat to be waged by the light of gunfire alone dutch mike crawled from his haven and ran into the street crying for the watch instead of for a shakespeare to immortalize the cimmerian shindy the cop came and found a prostrate bleeding montagu supported by three distrait and reticent followers of the house faithful to the ethics of the gangs no one knew whence the hurt came there was no capulet to be seen raus mit der interrogatories said buck malone to the officer sure i know who done it i always manages to get a bird s eye view of any guy that comes up an makes a show case for a hardware store out of me no i m not telling you his name i ll settle with um meself wow ouch easy boys yes i ll attend to his case meself i m not making any complaint at midnight mcmanus strolled around a pile of lumber near an east side dock and lingered in the vicinity of a certain water plug brick cleary drifted casually to the trysting place ten minutes later he ll maybe not croak said brick and he won t tell of course but dutch mike did he told the police he was tired of having his place shot up it s unhandy just now because tim corrigan s in europe for a week s end with kings he ll be back on the kaiser williams next friday you ll have to duck out of sight till then tim ll fix it up all right for us when he comes back this goes to explain why cork mcmanus went into rooney s one night and there looked upon the bright stranger face of romance for the first time in his precarious career until tim corrigan should return from his jaunt among kings and princes and hold up his big white finger in private offices it was unsafe for cork in any of the old haunts of his gang so he lay perdu in the high rear room of a capulet reading pink sporting sheets and cursing the slow paddle wheels of the kaiser wilhelm it was on thursday evening that cork s seclusion became intolerable to him never a hart panted for water fountain as he did for the cool touch of a drifting stein for the firm security of a foot rail in the hollow of his shoe and the quiet hearty challenges of friendship and repartee along and across the shining bars but he must avoid the district where he was known the cops were looking for him everywhere for news was scarce and the newspapers were harping again on the failure of the police to suppress the gangs if they got him before corrigan came back the big white finger could not be uplifted it would be too late then but corrigan would be home the next day so he felt sure there would be small danger in a little excursion that night among the crass pleasures that represented life to him at half past twelve mcmanus stood in a darkish cross town street looking up at the name rooney s picked out by incandescent lights against a signboard over a second story window he had heard of the place as a tough hang out with its frequenters and its locality he was unfamiliar guided by certain unerring indications common to all such resorts he ascended the stairs and entered the large room over the caf e here were some twenty or thirty tables at this time about half filled with rooney s guests waiters served drinks at one end a human pianola with drugged eyes hammered the keys with automatic and furious unprecision at merciful intervals a waiter would roar or squeak a song songs full of mr jonsons and babes and coons historical word guaranties of the genuineness of african melodies composed by red waistcoated young gentlemen natives of the cotton fields and rice swamps of west twenty eighth street for one brief moment you must admire rooney with me as he receives seats manipulates and chaffs his guests he is twenty nine he has wellington s nose dante s chin the cheek bones of an iroquois the smile of talleyrand corbett s foot work and the pose of an eleven year old east side central park queen of the may he is assisted by a lieutenant known as frank a pudgy easy chap swell dressed who goes among the tables seeing that dull care does not intrude now what is there about rooney s to inspire all this pother it is more respectable by daylight stout ladies with children and mittens and bundles and unpedigreed dogs drop up of afternoons for a stein and a chat even by gaslight the diversions are melancholy i the mouth drink and rag time and an occasional surprise when the waiter swabs the suds from under your sticky glass there is an answer transmigration the soul of sir walter raleigh has traveled from beneath his slashed doublet to a kindred home under rooney s visible plaid waistcoat rooney s is twenty years ahead of the times rooney has removed the embargo rooney has spread his cloak upon the soggy crossing of public opinion and any elizabeth who treads upon it is as much a queen as another attend to the revelation of the secret in rooney s ladies may smoke mcmanus sat down at a vacant table he paid for the glass of beer that he ordered tilted his narrow brimmed derby to the back of his brick dust head twined his feet among the rungs of his chair and heaved a sigh of contentment from the breathing spaces of his innermost soul for this mud honey was clarified sweetness to his taste the sham gaiety the hectic glow of counterfeit hospitality the self conscious joyless laughter the wine born warmth the loud music retrieving the hour from frequent whiles of awful and corroding silence the presence of well clothed and frank eyed beneficiaries of rooney s removal of the restrictions laid upon the weed the familiar blended odors of soaked lemon peel flat beer and peau d espagne all these were manna to cork mcmanus hungry for his week in the desert of the capulet s high rear room a girl alone entered rooney s glanced around with leisurely swiftness and sat opposite mcmanus at his table her eyes rested upon him for two seconds in the look with which woman reconnoitres all men whom she for the first time confronts in that space of time she will decide upon one of two things either to scream for the police or that she may marry him later on her brief inspection concluded the girl laid on the table a worn red morocco shopping bag with the inevitable top gallant sail of frayed lace handkerchief flying from a corner of it after she had ordered a small beer from the immediate waiter she took from her bag a box of cigarettes and lighted one with slightly exaggerated ease of manner then she looked again in the eyes of cork mcmanus and smiled instantly the doom of each was sealed the unqualified desire of a man to buy clothes and build fires for a woman for a whole lifetime at first sight of her is not uncommon among that humble portion of humanity that does not care for bradstreet or coats of arms or shaw s plays love at first sight has occurred a time or two in high life but as a rule the extempore mania is to be found among unsophisticated cratures such as the dove the blue tailed dingbat and the ten dollar a week clerk poets subscribers to all fiction magazines and schatchens take notice with the exchange of the mysterious magnetic current came to each of them the instant desire to lie pretend dazzle and deceive which is the worst thing about the hypocritical disorder known as love have another beer suggested cork in his circle the phrase was considered to be a card accompanied by a letter of introduction and references no thanks said the girl raising her eyebrows and choosing her conventional words carefully i merely dropped in for a slight refreshment the cigarette between her fingers seemed to require explanation my aunt is a russian lady she concluded and we often have a post perannual cigarette after dinner at home cheese it said cork whom society airs oppressed your fingers are as yellow as mine say said the girl blazing upon him with low voiced indignation what do you think i am say who do you think you are talking to what she was pretty to look at her eyes were big brown intrepid and bright uner her flat sailor hat planted jauntily on one side her crinkly tawny hair parted and was drawn back low and massy in a thick pendant knot behind the roundness of girlhood still lingered in her chin and neck but her cheeks and fingers were thinning slightly she looked upon the world with defiance suspicion and sullen wonder her smart short tan coat was soiled and expensive two inches below her black dress dropped the lowest flounce of a heliotrope silk underskirt beg your pardon said cork looking at her admiringly i didn t mean anything sure it s no harm to smoke maudy rooney s said the girl softened at once by his amends is the only place i know where a lady can smoke maybe it ain t a nice habit but aunty lets us at home and my name ain t maudy if you please it s ruby delamere that s a swell handle said cork approvingly mine s mcmanus cor er eddie mcmanus oh you can t help that laughed ruby don t apologize cork looked seriously at the big clock on rooney s wall the girl s ubiquitous eyes took in the movement i know it s late she said reaching for her bag but you know how you want a smoke when you want one ain t rooney s all right i never saw anything wrong here this is twice i ve been in i work in a bookbindery on third avenue a lot of us girls have been working overtime three nights a week they won t let you smoke there of course i just dropped in here on my way home for a puff ain t it all right in here if it ain t i won t come any more it s a little bit late for you to be out alone anywhere said cork i m not wise to this particular joint but anyhow you don t want to have your picture taken in it for a present to your sunday school teacher have one more beer and then say i take you home but i don t know you said the girl with fine scrupulosity i don t accept the company of gentlemen i ain t acquainted with my aunt never would allow that why said cork mcmanus pulling his ear i m the latest thing in suitings with side vents and bell skirt when it comes to escortin a lady you bet you ll find me all right ruby and i ll give you a tip as to who i am my governor is one of the hottest cross buns of the wall street push morgan s cab horse casts a shoe every time the old man sticks his head out the window me well i m in trainin down the street the old man s goin to

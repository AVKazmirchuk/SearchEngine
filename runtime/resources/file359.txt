a crowd of perhaps a hundred people gathered to attend the sale most of them were members of various religious orders priests and churchmen come to purchase the paraphernalia of the chapel lest they fall into desecrating hands others were business men and agents come to bid upon the realty a clerical looking brother had volunteered to wield the hammer bringing to the office of auctioneer the anomaly of choice diction and dignity of manner a few of the minor articles were sold and then two assistants brought forward the image of the virgin robbins started the bidding at ten dollars a stout man in an ecclesiastical garb went to fifteen a voice from another part of the crowd raised to twenty the three bid alternately raising by bids of five until the offer was fifty dollars then the stout man dropped out and robbins as a sort of coup de main went to a hundred one hundred and fifty said the other voice two hundred bid robbins boldly two fifty called his competitor promptly the reporter hesitated for the space of a lightning flash estimating how much he could borrow from the boys in the office and screw from the business manager from his next month s salary three hundred he offered three fifty spoke up the other in a louder voice a voice that sent robbins diving suddenly through the crowd in its direction to catch dumars its owner ferociously by the collar you unconverted idiot hissed robbins close to his ear pool agreed said dumars coolly i couldn t raise three hundred and fifty dollars with a search warrant but i can stand half what you come bidding against me for i thought i was the only fool in the crowd explained robbins no one else bidding the statue was knocked down to the syndicate at their last offer dumars remained with the prize while robbins hurried forth to wring from the resources and credit of both the price he soon returned with the money and the two musketeers loaded their precious package into a carriage and drove with it to dumars s room in old chartres street nearby they lugged it covered with a cloth up the stairs and deposited it on a table a hundred pounds it weighed if an ounce and at that estimate according to their calculation if their daring theory were correct it stood there worth twenty thousand golden dollars robbins removed the covering and opened his pocket knife sacre muttered dumars shuddering it is the mother of christ what would you do shut up judas said robbins coldly it s too late for you to be saved now with a firm hand he chipped a slice from the shoulder of the image the cut showed a dull grayish metal with a thin coating of gold leaf lead announced robbins hurling his knife to the floor gilded to the devil with it said dumars forgetting his scruples i must have a drink together they walked moodily to the cafe of madame tribault two squares away it seemed that madame s mind had been stirred that day to fresh recollections of the past services of the two young men in her behalf you mustn t sit by those table she interposed as they were about to drop into their accustomed seats thass so boys but no i mek you come at this room like my tres bon amis yes i goin mek for you myself one anisette and one cafe royale ver fine ah i lak treat my fren nize yes plis come in this way madame led them into the little back room into which she sometimes invited the especially favoured of her customers in two comfortable armchairs by a big window that opened upon the courtyard she placed them with a low table between bustling hospitably about she began to prepare the promised refreshments it was the first time the reporters had been honoured with admission to the sacred precincts the room was in dusky twilight flecked with gleams of the polished fine woods and burnished glass and metal that the creoles love from the little courtyard a tiny fountain sent in an insinuating sound of trickling waters to which a banana plant by the window kept time with its tremulous leaves robbins an investigator by nature sent a curious glance roving about the room from some barbaric ancestor madame had inherited a penchant for the crude in decoration the walls were adorned with cheap lithographs florid libels upon nature addressed to the taste of the bourgeoisie birthday cards garish newspaper supplements and specimens of art advertising calculated to reduce the optic nerve to stunned submission a patch of something unintelligible in the midst of the more candid display puzzled robbins and he rose and took a step nearer to interrogate it at closer range then he leaned weakly against the wall and called out madame tibault oh madame since when oh since when have you been in the habit of papering your walls with five thousand dollar united states four per cent gold bonds tell me is this a grimm s fairy tale or should i consult an oculist at his words madame tibault and dumars approached h what you say said madame cheerily h what you say m sieur robbin bon ah those

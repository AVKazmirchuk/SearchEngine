storekeeper or a lady you look to me like you might tote an umbrella and wear suspenders and go home of nights the little woman says perry has made some improvements i believe you can t understand buck i haven t been away from the house at night since we was married we talked on a while me and perry and as sure as i live that man interrupted me in the middle of my talk to tell me about six tomato plants he had growing in his garden shoved his agricultural degradation right up under my nose while i was telling him about the fun we had tarring and feathering that faro dealer at california pete s layout but by and by perry shows a flicker of sense buck says he i ll have to admit that it is a little dull at times not that i m not perfectly happy with the little woman but a man seems to require some excitement now and then now i ll tell you mariana s gone visiting this afternoon and she won t be home till seven o clock neither of us ever stays out a minute after that time unless we are together now i m glad you came along buck says perry for i m feeling just like having one more rip roaring razoo with you for the sake of old times what you say to us putting in the afternoon having fun i d like it fine says perry i slapped that old captive range rider half across his little garden get your hat you old dried up alligator i shouts you ain t dead yet you re part human anyhow if you did get all bogged up in matrimony we ll take this town to pieces and see what makes it tick we ll make all kinds of profligate demands upon the science of cork pulling you ll grow horns yet old muley cow says i punching perry in the ribs if you trot around on the trail of vice with your uncle buck i ll have to be home by seven you know says perry again oh yes says i winking to myself for i knew the kind of seven o clocks perry rountree got back by after he once got to passing repartee with the bartenders we goes down to the gray mule saloon that old dobe building by the depot give it a name says i as soon as we got one hoof on the foot rest sarsaparilla says perry you could have knocked me down with a lemon peeling insult me as much as you want to i says to perry but don t startle the bartender he may have heart disease come on now your tongue got twisted the tall glasses i orders and the bottle in the left hand corner of the ice chest sarsaparilla repeats perry and then his eyes get animated and i see he s got some great scheme in his mind he wants to emit buck says he all interested i ll tell you what i want to make this a red letter day i ve been keeping close at home and i want to turn myself a loose we ll have the highest old time you ever saw we ll go in the back room here and play checkers till half past six i leaned against the bar and i says to gotch eared mike who was on watch for god s sake don t mention this you know what perry used to be he s had the fever and the doctor says we must humour him give us the checker board and the men mike says perry come on buck i m just wild to have some excitement i went in the back room with perry before we closed the door i says to mike don t ever let it straggle out from under your hat that you seen buck caperton fraternal with sarsaparilla or persona grata with a checker board or i ll make a swallow fork in your other ear i locked the door and me and perry played checkers to see that poor old humiliated piece of household bric a brac sitting there and sniggering out loud whenever he jumped a man and all obnoxious with animation when he got into my king row would have made a sheep dog sick with mortification him that was once satisfied only when he was pegging six boards at keno or giving the faro dealers nervous prostration to see him pushing them checkers about like sally louisa at a school children s party why i was all smothered up with mortification and i sits there playing the black men all sweating for fear somebody i knew would find it out and i thinks to myself some about this marrying business and how it seems to be the same kind of a game as that mrs delilah played she give her old man a hair cut and everybody knows what a man s head looks like after a woman cuts his hair and then when the pharisees came around to guy him he was so shamed that he went to work and kicked the whole house down on top of the whole outfit them married men thinks i lose all their spirit and instinct for riot and foolishness they won t drink they won t buck the tiger they won t even fight what do they want to go and stay married for i asks myself but perry seems to be having hilarity in considerable quantities buck old hoss says he isn t this just the hell roaringest time we ever had in our lives i don t know when i ve been stirred up so you see i ve been sticking pretty close to home since i married and i haven t been on a spree in a long time spree yes that s what he called it playing checkers in the back room of the gray mule i suppose it did seem to him a little more immoral and nearer to a prolonged debauch than standing over six tomato plants with a sprinkling pot every little bit perry looks at his watch and says i got to be home you know buck at seven all right i d say romp along and move this here excitement s killing me if i don t reform some and loosen up the strain of this checkered dissipation i won t have a nerve left it might have been half past six when commotions began to go on outside in the street we heard a yelling and a six shootering and a lot of galloping and manoeuvres what s that i wonders oh some nonsense outside says perry it s your move we just got time to play this game i ll just take a peep through the window says i and see you can t expect a mere mortal to stand the excitement of having a king jumped and listen to an unidentified conflict going on at the same time the gray mule saloon was one of them old spanish dobe buildings and the back room only had two little windows a foot wide with iron bars in em i looked out one and i see the cause of the rucus there was the trimble gang ten of em the worst outfit of desperadoes and horse thieves in texas coming up the street shooting right and left they was coming right straight for the gray mule then they got past the range of my sight but we heard em ride up to the front door and then they socked the place full of lead we heard the big looking glass behind the bar knocked all to pieces and the bottles crashing we could see gotch eared mike in his apron running across the plaza like a coyote with the bullets puffing up dust all around him then the gang went to work in the saloon drinking what they wanted and smashing what they didn t me and petty both knew that gang and they knew us the year before perry married him and me was in the same ranger company and we fought that outfit down on the san miguel and brought back ben trimble and two others for murder we can t get out says i we ll have to stay in here till they leave perry looked at his watch twenty five to seven says he we can finish that game i got two men on you it s your move buck i got to be home at seven you know we sat down and went on playing the trimble gang had a roughhouse for sure they were getting good and drunk they d drink a while and holler a while and then they d shoot up a few bottles and glasses two or three times they came and tried to open our door then there was some more shooting outside and i looked out the window again ham gossett the town marshal had a posse in the houses and stores across the street and was trying to bag a trimble or two through the windows i lost that game of checkers i m free in saying that i lost three kings that i might have saved if i had been corralled in a more peaceful pasture but that drivelling married man sat there and cackled when he won a man like an unintelligent hen picking up a grain of corn when the game was over perry gets up and looks at his watch i ve had a glorious time buck says he but i ll have to be going now it s a quarter to seven and i got to be home by seven you know i thought he was joking they ll clear out or be dead drunk in half an hour or an hour says i you ain t that tired of being married that you want to commit any more sudden suicide are you says i giving him the laugh one time says perry i was half an hour late getting home i met mariana on the street looking for me if you could have seen her buck but you don t understand she knows what a wild kind of a snoozer i ve been and she s afraid something will happen i ll never be late getting home again i ll say good bye to you now buck i got between him and the door married man says i i know you was christened a fool the minute the preacher tangled you up but don t you never sometimes think one little think on a human basis there s ten of that gang in there and they re pizen with whisky and desire for murder they ll drink you up like a bottle of booze before you get half way to the door be intelligent now and use at least wild hog sense sit down and wait till we have some chance to get out without being carried in baskets i got to be home by seven buck repeats this hen pecked thing of little wisdom like an unthinking poll parrot mariana says he will be out looking for me and he reaches down and pulls a leg out of the checker table i ll go through this trimble outfit says he like a cottontail through a brush corral i m not pestered any more with a desire to engage in rucuses but i got to be home by seven you lock the door after me buck and don t you forget i won three out of them five games i d play longer but mariana hush up you old locoed road runner i interrupts did you ever notice your uncle buck locking doors against trouble i m not married says i but i m as big a d n fool as any mormon one from four leaves three says i and i gathers out another leg of the table we ll get home by seven says i whether it s the heavenly one or the other may i see you home says i you sarsaparilla drinking checker playing glutton for death and destruction we opened the door easy and then stampeded for the front part of the gang was lined up at the bar part of em was passing over the drinks and two or three was peeping out the door and window and taking shots at the marshal s crowd the room was so full of smoke we got half way to the front door before they noticed us then i heard berry trimble s voice somewhere yell out how d that buck caperton get in here and he skinned the side of my neck with a bullet i reckon he felt bad over that miss for berry s the best shot south of the southern pacific railroad but the smoke in the saloon was some too thick for good shooting me and perry smashed over two of the gang with our table legs which didn t miss like the guns did and as we run out the door i grabbed a winchester from a fellow who was watching the outside and i turned and regulated the account of mr berry me and perry got out and around the corner all right i never much expected to get out but i wasn t going to be intimidated by that married man according to perry s idea checkers was the event of the day but if i am any judge of gentle recreations that little table leg parade through the gray mule saloon deserved the head lines in the bill of particulars walk fast says perry it s two minutes to seven and i got to be home by oh shut up says i i had an appointment as chief performer at an inquest at seven and i m not kicking about not keeping it i had to pass by perry s little house his mariana was standing at the gate we got there at five minutes past seven she had on a blue wrapper and her hair was pulled back smooth like little girls do when they want to look grown folksy she didn t see us till we got close for she was gazing up the other way then she backed around and saw perry and a kind of a look scooted around over her face danged if i can describe it i heard her breathe long just like a cow when you turn her calf in the lot and she says you re late perry five minutes says perry cheerful me and old buck was having a game of checkers perry introduces me to mariana and they ask me to come in no sir ee i d had enough truck with married folks for that day i says i ll be going along and that i ve spent a very pleasant afternoon with my old partner especially says i just to jostle perry during that game when the table legs came all loose but i d promised him not to let her know anything i ve been worrying over that business ever since it happened continued buck there s one thing about it that s got me all twisted up and i can t figure it out what was that i asked as i rolled and handed buck the last cigarette why i ll tell you when i saw the look that little woman gave perry when she turned round and saw him coming back to the ranch safe why was it i got the idea all in a minute that that look of hers was worth more than the whole caboodle of us sarsaparilla checkers and all and that the d n fool in the game wasn t named perry rountree at all rolling stones introduction this the twelfth and final volume of o henry s work gets its title from an early newspaper venture of which he was the head and front on april there appeared in austin texas volume number of the rolling stone with a circulation greatly in excess of that of the only two numbers that had gone before apparently the business office was encouraged the first two issues of one thousand copies each had been bought up of the third an edition of six thousand was published and distributed free so that the business men of austin texas might know what a good medium was at hand for their advertising the editor and proprietor and illustrator of the rolling stone was will porter incidentally paying and receiving teller in major brackenridge s bank perhaps the most characteristic feature of the paper was the plunkville patriot a page each week or at least with the regularity of the somewhat uncertain paper itself purporting to be reprinted from a contemporary journal the editor of the plunkville patriot was colonel aristotle jordan unrelenting enemy of his enemies when the colonel s application for the postmastership in plunkville is ignored his columns carry a bitter attack on the administration at washington with the public weal at heart the patriot announces that there is a dangerous hole in the front steps of the elite saloon here too appears the delightful literary item that mark twain and charles egbert craddock are spending the summer together in their adirondacks camp free runs its advertising column a clergyman who cured himself of fits will send one book containing popular songs one repeating rifle two decks easywinner cards and liver pad free of charge for address sucker chump augusta me the office moves nearly every week probably in accordance with the time honored principle involving the comparative ease of moving and paying rent when the colonel publishes his own candidacy for mayor he further declares that the patriot will accept no announcements for municipal offices until after our the editor s canvass adams co grocers order their ad discontinued and find later in the patriot this estimate of their product no less than three children have been poisoned by eating their canned vegetables and j o adams the senior member of the firm was run out of kansas city for adulterating codfish balls it pays to advertise here is the editorial in which the editor first announces his campaign our worthy mayor colonel henry stutty died this morning after an illness of about five minutes brought on by carrying a bouquet to mrs eli watts just as eli got in from a fishing trip ten minutes later we had dodgers out announcing our candidacy for the office we have lived in plunkville going on five years and have never been elected anything yet we understand the mayor business thoroughly and if elected some people will wish wolves had stolen them from their cradles the page from the patriot is presented with an array of perfectly confused type of artistic errors in setting up and when an occasional line gets shifted intentionally of course the effect is alarming anybody who knows the advertising of a small country weekly can as he reads pick out in the following the advertisement from the personal miss hattie green of paris ill is steel riveted seam or water power automatic oiling thoroughly tested visiting her sister mrs g w grubes little giant engines at adams co also sachet powders mc cormick reapers and oysters all of this was a part of the rolling stone which flourished or at least wavered in austin during the years and years before porter s strong instinct to write had been gratified in letters he wrote in his twenties long imaginative letters occasionally stuffed with execrable puns but more than often buoyant truly humorous keenly incisive into the unreal especially in fiction i have included a number of these letters to doctor beall of greensboro n c and to his early friend in texas mr david harrell in porter went to houston texas to work on the houston post there he conducted a column which he called postscripts some of the contents of the pages that follow have been taken from these old files in the fair hope that admirers of the matured o henry will find in them pleasurable marks of the later genius before the days of the rolling stone there are eleven years in texas over which with the exception of the letters mentioned there are few traces of literary performance but there are some very interesting drawings some of which are reproduced in this volume a story is back of them they were the illustrations to a book joe dixon prospector and inveterate fortune seeker came to austin from the rockies in at the constant urging of his old pal mr john maddox joe kept writing mr maddox your fortune s in your pen not your pick come to austin and write an account of your adventures it was hard to woo dixon from the gold that wasn t there but finally maddox wrote him he must come and try the scheme there s a boy here from north carolina wrote maddox his name is will porter and he can make the pictures he s all right dixon came the plan was that after author and artist had done their work patron would step in carry the manuscript to new york bestow it on a deserving publisher and then return to await with the other two the avalanche of royalties this version of the story comes from mr maddox there were forty pictures in all and they were very true to the life of the rockies in the seventies of course the young artist had no technique no anything except what was native but wait as the months went by dixon worked hard but he began to have doubts perhaps the book was no good perhaps john would only lose his money he was a miner not a writer and he ought not to let john go to any expense the result of this line of thought was the colorado river for the manuscript and the high road for the author the pictures fortunately were saved most of them porter gave later to mrs hagelstein of san angelo texas mr maddox by the way finding a note from joe that explained all hastened to the river and recovered a few scraps of the great book that had lodged against a sandbar but there was no putting them together again so much for the title it is a real o henry title contents of this last volume are drawn not only from letters old newspaper files and the rolling stone but from magazines and unpublished manuscripts of the short stories several were written at the very height of his powers and popularity and were lost inexplicably but lost of the poems there are a few whose authorship might have been in doubt if the compiler of this collection had not secured external evidence that made them certainly the work of o henry without this very strong evidence they might have been rejected because they were not entirely the kind of poems the readers of o henry would expect from him most of them however were found in his own indubitable manuscript or over his own signature there is extant a mass of o henry correspondence that has not been included in this collection during the better part of a decade in new york city he wrote constantly to editors and in many instances intimately this is very important material and permission has been secured to use nearly all of it in a biographical volume that will be issued within the next two or three years the letters in this volume have been chosen as an exihibit as early specimens of his writing and for their particularly characteristic turns of thought and phrase the collection is not complete in any historical sense h p s this record of births and deaths is copied from the porter family bible just lately discovered births algernon sidney porter son of

dream this was the last work of o henry the cosmopolitan magazine had ordered it from him and after his death the unfinished manuscript was found in his room on his dusty desk the story as it here appears was published in the cosmopolitan for september murray dreamed a dream both psychology and science grope when they would explain to us the strange adventures of our immaterial selves when wandering in the realm of death s twin brother sleep this story will not attempt to be illuminative it is no more than a record of murray s dream one of the most puzzling phases of that strange waking sleep is that dreams which seem to cover months or even years may take place within a few seconds or minutes murray was waiting in his cell in the ward of the condemned an electric arc light in the ceiling of the corridor shone brightly upon his table on a sheet of white paper an ant crawled wildly here and there as murray blocked its way with an envelope the electrocution was set for eight o clock in the evening murray smiled at the antics of the wisest of insects there were seven other condemned men in the chamber since he had been there murray had seen three taken out to their fate one gone mad and fighting like a wolf caught in a trap one no less mad offering up a sanctimonious lip service to heaven the third a weakling collapsed and strapped to a board he wondered with what credit to himself his own heart foot and face would meet his punishment for this was his evening he thought it must be nearly eight o clock opposite his own in the two rows of cells was the cage of bonifacio the sicilian slayer of his betrothed and of two officers who came to arrest him with him murray had played checkers many a long hour each calling his move to his unseen opponent across the corridor bonifacio s great booming voice with its indestructible singing quality called out eh meestro murray how you feel all a right yes all right bonifacio said murray steadily as he allowed the ant to crawl upon the envelope and then dumped it gently on the stone floor dat s good a meestro murray men like us we must a die like a men my time come nex a week all a right remember meestro murray i beat a you dat las game of de check maybe we play again some a time i don a know maybe we have to call a de move damn a loud to play de check where dey goin send us bonifacio s hardened philosophy followed closely by his deafening musical peal of laughter warmed rather than chilled murray s numbed heart yet bonifacio had until next week to live the cell dwellers heard the familiar loud click of the steel bolts as the door at the end of the corridor was opened three men came to murray s cell and unlocked it two were prison guards the other was len no that was in the old days now the reverend leonard winston a friend and neighbor from their barefoot days i got them to let me take the prison chaplain s place he said as he gave murray s hand one short strong grip in his left hand he held a small bible with his forefinger marking a page murray smiled slightly and arranged two or three books and some penholders orderly on his small table he would have spoken but no appropriate words seemed to present themselves to his mind the prisoners had christened this cellhouse eighty feet long twenty eight feet wide limbo lane the regular guard of limbo lane an immense rough kindly man drew a pint bottle of whiskey from his pocket and offered it to murray saying it s the regular thing you know all has it who feel like they need a bracer no danger of it becoming a habit with em you see murray drank deep into the bottle that s the boy said the guard just a little nerve tonic and everything goes smooth as silk they stepped into the corridor and each one of the doomed seven knew limbo lane is a world on the outside of the world but it had learned when deprived of one or more of the five senses to make another sense supply the deficiency each one knew that it was nearly eight and that murray was to go to the chair at eight there is also in the many limbo lanes an aristocracy of crime the man who kills in the open who beats his enemy or pursuer down flushed by the primitive emotions and the ardor of combat holds in contempt the human rat the spider and the snake so of the seven condemned only three called their farewells to murray as he marched down the corridor between the two guards bonifacio marvin who had killed a guard while trying to escape from the prison and bassett the train robber who was driven to it because the express messenger wouldn t raise his hands when ordered to do so the remaining four smoldered silent in their cells no doubt feeling their social ostracism in limbo lane society more keenly than they did the memory of their less picturesque offences against the law murray wondered at his own calmness and nearly indifference in the execution room were about twenty men a congregation made up of prison officers newspaper reporters and lookers on who had succeeded here in the very middle of a sentence the hand of death interrupted the telling of o henry s last story he had planned to make this story different from his others the beginning of a new series in a style he had not previously attempted i want to show the public he said that i can write something new new for me i mean a story without slang a straightforward dramatic plot treated in a way that will come nearer my idea of real story writing before starting to write the present story he outlined briefly how he intended to develop it murray the criminal accused and convicted of the brutal murder of his sweetheart a murder prompted by jealous rage at first faces the death penalty calm and to all outward appearances indifferent to his fate as he nears the electric chair he is overcome by a revulsion of feeling he is left dazed stupefied stunned the entire scene in the death chamber the witnesses the spectators the preparations for execution become unreal to him the thought flashes through his brain that a terrible mistake is being made why is he being strapped to the chair what has he done what crime has he committed in the few moments while the straps are being adjusted a vision comes to him he dreams a dream he sees a little country cottage bright sun lit nestling in a bower of flowers a woman is there and a little child he speaks with them and finds that they are his wife his child and the cottage their home so after all it is a mistake some one has frightfully irretrievably blundered the accusation the trial the conviction the sentence to death in the electric chair all a dream he takes his wife in his arms and kisses the child yes here is happiness it was a dream then at a sign from the prison warden the fatal current is turned on murray had dreamed the wrong dream a ruler of men written at the prime of his popularity and power this characteristic and amusing story was published in everybody s magazine in august i walked the streets of the city of insolence thirsting for the sight of a stranger face for the city is a desert of familiar types as thick and alike as the grains in a sand storm and you grow to hate them as you do a friend who is always by you or one of your own kin and my desire was granted for i saw near a corner of broadway and twenty ninth street a little flaxen haired man with a face like a scaly bark hickory nut selling to a fast gathering crowd a tool that omnigeneously proclaimed itself a can opener a screw driver a button hook a nail file a shoe horn a watch guard a potato peeler and an ornament to any gentleman s key ring and then a stall fed cop shoved himself through the congregation of customers the vender plainly used to having his seasons of trade thus abruptly curtailed closed his satchel and slipped like a weasel through the opposite segment of the circle the crowd scurried aimlessly away like ants from a disturbed crumb the cop suddenly becoming oblivious of the earth and its inhabitants stood still swelling his bulk and putting his club through an intricate drill of twirls i hurried after kansas bill bowers and caught him by an arm without his looking at me or slowing his pace i found a five dollar bill crumpled neatly into my hand i wouldn t have thought kansas bill i said that you d hold an old friend that cheap then he turned his head and the hickory nut cracked into a wide smile give back the money said he or i ll have the cop after you for false pretenses i thought you was the cop i want to talk to you bill i said when did you leave oklahoma where is reddy mcgill now why are you selling those impossible contraptions on the street how did your big horn gold mine pan out how did you get so badly sunburned what will you drink a year ago answered kansas bill systematically putting up windmills in arizona for pin money to buy etceteras with salted been down in the tropics beer we foregathered in a propitious place and became elijahs while a waiter of dark plumage played the raven to perfection reminiscence needs must be had before i could steer bill into his epic mood yes said he i mind the time timoteo s rope broke on that cow s horns while the calf was chasing you you and that cow i d never forget it the tropics said i are a broad territory what part of cancer of capricorn have you been honoring with a visit down along china or peru or maybe the argentine confederacy said kansas bill anyway twas among a great race of people off colored but progressive i was there three months no doubt you are glad to be back among the truly great race i surmised especially among new yorkers the most progressive and independent citizens of any country in the world i continued with the fatuity of the provincial who has eaten the broadway lotus do you want to start an argument asked bill can there be one i answered has an irishman humor do you think asked he i have an hour or two to spare said i looking at the cafe clock not that the americans aren t a great commercial nation conceded bill but the fault laid with the people who wrote lies for fiction what was this irishman s name i asked was that last beer cold enough said he i see there is talk of further outbreaks among the russian peasants i remarked his name was barney o connor said bill thus because of our ancient prescience of each other s trail of thought we travelled ambiguously to the point where kansas bill s story began i met o connor in a boarding house on the west side he invited me to his hall room to have a drink and we became like a dog and a cat that had been raised together there he sat a tall fine handsome man with his feet against one wall and his back against the other looking over a map on the bed and sticking three feet out of it was a beautiful gold sword with tassels on it and rhinestones in the handle what s this says i for by that time we were well acquainted the annual parade in vilification of the ex snakes of ireland and what s the line of march up broadway to forty second thence east to mccarty s cafe thence sit down on the wash stand says o connor and listen and cast no perversions on the sword twas me father s in old munster and this map bowers is no diagram of a holiday procession if ye look again ye ll see that it s the continent known as south america comprising fourteen green blue red and yellow countries all crying out from time to time to be liberated from the yoke of the oppressor i know says i to o connor the idea is a literary one the ten cent magazine stole it from ridpath s history of the world from the sand stone period to the equator you ll find it in every one of em it s a continued story of a soldier of fortune generally named o keefe who gets to be dictator while the spanish american populace cries cospetto and other italian maledictions i misdoubt if it s ever been done you re not thinking of trying that are you barney i asks bowers says he you re a man of education and courage how can i deny it says i education runs in my family and i have acquired courage by a hard struggle with life the o connors says he are a warlike race there is me father s sword and here is the map a life of inaction is not for me the o connors were born to rule tis a ruler of men i must be barney i says to him why don t you get on the force and settle down to a quiet life of carnage and corruption instead of roaming off to foreign parts in what better way can you indulge your desire to subdue and maltreat the oppressed look again at the map says he at the country i have the point of me knife on tis that one i have selected to aid and overthrow with me father s sword i see says i it s the green one and that does credit to your patriotism and it s the smallest one and that does credit to your judgment do ye accuse me of cowardice says barney turning pink no man says i who attacks and confiscates a country single handed could be called a coward the worst you can be charged with is plagiarism or imitation if anthony hope and roosevelt let you get away with it nobody else will have any right to kick i m not joking says o connor and i ve got cash to work the scheme with i ve taken a liking to you do you want it or not i m not working i told him but how is it to be do i eat during the fomentation of the insurrection or am i only to be secretary of war after the country is conquered is it to be a pay envelope or only a portfolio i ll pay all expenses says o connor i want a man i can trust if we succeed you may pick out any appointment you want in the gift of the government all right then says i you can get me a bunch of draying contracts and then a quick action consignment to a seat on the supreme court bench so i won t be in line for the presidency the kind of cannon they chasten their presidents with in that country hurt too much you can consider me on the pay roll two weeks afterward o connor and me took a steamer for the small green doomed country we were three weeks on the trip o connor said he had his plans all figured out in advance but being the commanding general it consorted with his dignity to keep the details concealed from his army and cabinet commonly known as william t bowers three dollars a day was the price for which i joined the cause of liberating an undiscovered country from the ills that threatened or sustained it every saturday night on the steamer i stood in line at parade rest and o connor handed ever the twenty one dollars the town we landed at was named guayaquerita so they told me not for me says i it ll be little old hilldale or tompkinsville or cherry tree corners when i speak of it it s a clear case where spelling reform ought to butt in and disenvowel it but the town looked fine from the bay when we sailed in it was white with green ruching and lace ruffles on the skirt when the surf slashed up on the sand it looked as tropical and dolce far ultra as the pictures of lake ronkonkoma in the brochure of the passenger department of the long island railroad we went through the quarantine and custom house indignities and then o connor leads me to a dobe house on a street called the avenue of the dolorous butterflies of the individual and collective saints ten feet wide it was and knee deep in alfalfa and cigar stumps hooligan alley says i rechristening it twill be our headquarters says o connor my agent here don fernando pacheco secured it for us so in that house o connor and me established the revolutionary centre in the front room we had ostensible things such as fruit a guitar and a table with a conch shell on it in the back room o connor had his desk and a large looking glass and his sword hid in a roll of straw matting we slept on hammocks that we hung to hooks in the wall and took our meals at the hotel ingles a beanery run on the american plan by a german proprietor with chinese cooking served a la kansas city lunch counter it seems that o connor really did have some sort of system planned out beforehand he wrote plenty of letters and every day or two some native gent would stroll round to headquarters and be shut up in the back room for half an hour with o connor and the interpreter i noticed that when they went in they were always smoking eight inch cigars and at peace with the world but when they came out they would be folding up a ten or twenty dollar bill and cursing the government horribly one evening after we had been in guaya in this town of smellville by the sea about a month and me and o connor were sitting outside the door helping along old tempus fugit with rum and ice and limes i says to him if you ll excuse a patriot that don t exactly know what he s patronizing for the question what is your scheme for subjugating this country do you intend to plunge it into bloodshed or do you mean to buy its votes peacefully and honorably at the polls bowers says he ye re a fine little man and i intend to make great use of ye after the conflict but ye do not understand statecraft already by now we have a network of strategy clutching with invisible fingers at the throat of the tyrant calderas we have agents at work in every town in the republic the liberal party is bound to win on our secret lists we have the names of enough sympathizers to crush the administration forces at a single blow a straw vote says i only shows which way the hot air blows who has accomplished this goes on o connor i have i have directed everything the time was ripe when we came so my agents inform me the people are groaning under burdens of taxes and levies who will be their natural leader when they rise could it be any one but meself twas only yesterday that zaldas our representative in the province of durasnas tells me that the people in secret already call me el library door which is the spanish manner of saying the liberator was zaldas that maroon colored old aztec with a paper collar on and unbleached domestic shoes i asked he was says o connor i saw him tucking a yellow back into his vest pocket as he came out says i it may be says i that they call you a library door but they treat you more like the side door of a bank but let us hope for the worst it has cost money of course says o connor but we ll have the country in our hands inside of a month in the evenings we walked about in the plaza and listened to the band playing and mingled with the populace at its distressing and obnoxious pleasures there were thirteen vehicles belonging to the upper classes mostly rockaways and old style barouches such as the mayor rides in at the unveiling of the new poorhouse at milledgeville alabama round and round the desiccated fountain in the middle of the plaza they drove and lifted their high silk hats to their friends the common people walked around in barefooted bunches puffing stogies that a pittsburg millionaire wouldn t have chewed for a dry smoke on ladies day at his club and the grandest figure in the whole turnout was barney o connor six foot two he stood in his fifth avenue clothes with his eagle eye and his black moustache that tickled his ears he was a born dictator and czar and hero and harrier of the human race it looked to me that all eyes were turned upon o connor and that every woman there loved him and every man feared him once or twice i looked at him and thought of funnier things that had happened than his winning out in his game and i began to feel like a hidalgo de officio de grafto de south america myself and then i would come down again to solid bottom and let my imagination gloat as usual upon the twenty one american dollars due me on saturday night take note says o connor to me as thus we walked of the mass of the people observe their oppressed and melancholy air can ye not see that they are ripe for revolt do ye not perceive that they are disaffected i do not says i nor disinfected either i m beginning to understand these people when they look unhappy they re enjoying themselves when they feel unhappy they go to sleep they re not the kind of people to take an interest in revolutions they ll flock to our standard says o connor three thousand men in this town alone will spring to arms when the signal is given i am assured of that but everything is in secret there is no chance for us to fail on hooligan alley as i prefer to call the street our headquarters was on there was a row of flat dobe houses with red tile roofs some straw shacks full of indians and dogs and one two story wooden house with balconies a little farther down that was where general tumbalo the comandante and commander of the military forces lived right across the street was a private residence built like a combination bake oven and folding bed one day o connor and me were passing it single file on the flange they called a sidewalk when out of the window flies a big red rose o connor who is ahead picks it up presses it to his fifth rib and bows to the ground by carrambos that man certainly had the irish drama chaunceyized i looked around expecting to see the little boy and girl in white sateen ready to jump on his shoulder while he jolted their spinal columns and ribs together through a breakdown and sang sleep little one sleep as i passed the window i glanced inside and caught a glimpse of a white dress and a pair of big flashing black eyes and gleaming teeth under a dark lace mantilla when we got back to our house o connor began to walk up and down the floor and twist his moustaches did ye see her eyes bowers he asks me i did says i and i can see more than that it s all coming out according to the story books i knew there was something missing twas the love interest what is it that comes in chapter vii to cheer the gallant irish adventurer why love of course love that makes the hat go around at last we have the eyes of midnight hue and the rose flung from the barred window now what comes next the underground passage the intercepted letter the traitor in camp the hero thrown into a dungeon the mysterious message from the senorita then the outburst the fighting on the plaza the don t be a fool says o connor interrupting but that s the only woman in the world for me bowers the o connors are as quick to love as they are to fight i shall wear that rose over me heart when i lead me men into action for a good battle to be fought there must be some woman to give it power every time i agreed if you want to have a good lively scrap there s only one thing bothering me in the novels the light haired friend of the hero always gets killed think em all over that you ve read and you ll see that i m right i think i ll step down to the botica espanola and lay in a bottle of walnut stain before war is declared how will i find out her name says o connor layin his chin in his hand why don t you go across the street and ask her says i will ye never regard anything in life seriously says o connor looking down at me like a schoolmaster maybe she meant the rose for me i said whistling the spanish fandango for the first time since i d known o connor he laughed he got up and roared and clapped his knees and leaned against the wall till the tiles on the roof clattered to the noise of his lungs he went into the back room and looked at himself in the glass and began and laughed all over from the beginning again then he looked at me and repeated himself that s why i asked you if you thought an irishman had any humor he d been doing farce comedy from the day i saw him without knowing it and the first time he had an idea advanced to him with any intelligence in it he acted like two twelfths of the sextet in a floradora road company the next afternoon he comes in with a triumphant smile and begins to pull something like ticker tape out of his pocket great says i this is something like home how is amalgamated copper to day i ve got her name says o connor and he reads off something like this dona isabel antonia inez lolita carreras y buencaminos y monteleon she lives with her mother explains o connor her father was killed in the last revolution she is sure to be in sympathy with our cause and sure enough the next day she flung a little bunch of roses clear across the street into our door o connor dived for it and found a piece of paper curled around a stem with a line in spanish on it he dragged the interpreter out of his corner and got him busy the interpreter scratched his head and gave us as a translation three best bets fortune had got a face like the man fighting fortune looks like a brave man and fortune favors the brave we put our money on the last one do ye see says o connor she intends to encourage me sword to save her country it looks to me like an invitation to supper says i so every day this senorita sits behind the barred windows and exhausts a conservatory or two one posy at a time and o connor walks like a dominecker rooster and swells his chest and swears to me he will win her by feats of arms and big deeds on the gory field of battle by and by the revolution began to get ripe one day o connor takes me into the back room and tells me all bowers says he at twelve o clock one week from to day the struggle will take place it has pleased ye to find amusement and diversion in this project because ye have not sense enough to perceive that it is easily accomplished by a man of courage intelligence and historical superiority such as meself the whole world over says he the o connors have ruled men women and nations to subdue a small and indifferent country like this is a trifle ye see what little barefooted manikins the men of it are i could lick four of em single handed no doubt says i but could you lick six and suppose they hurled an army of seventeen against you listen says o connor to what will occur at noon next tuesday patriots will rise up in the towns of the republic the government will be absolutely unprepared the public buildings will be taken the regular army made prisoners and the new administration set up in the capital it will not be so easy on account of most of the army being stationed there they will occupy the president s palace and the strongly fortified government buildings and stand a siege but on the very day of the outbreak a body of our troops will begin a march to the capital from every town as soon as the local victory has been won the thing is so well planned that it is an impossibility for us to fail i meself will lead the troops from here the new president will be senor espadas now minister of finance in the present cabinet what do you get i asked twill be strange said o connor smiling if i don t have all the jobs handed to me on a silver salver to pick what i choose i ve been the brains of the scheme and when the fighting opens i guess i won t be in the rear rank who managed it so our troops could get arms smuggled into this country didn t i arrange it with a new york firm before i left there our financial agents inform me that stands of winchester rifles have been delivered a month ago at a secret place up coast and distributed among the towns i tell you bowers the game is already won well that kind of talk kind of shook my disbelief in the infallibility of the serious irish gentleman soldier of fortune it certainly seemed that the patriotic grafters had gone about the thing in a business way i looked upon o connor with more respect and began to figure on what kind of uniform i might wear as secretary of war tuesday the day set for the revolution came around according to schedule o connor said that a signal had been agreed upon for the uprising there was an old cannon on the beach near the national warehouse that had been secretly loaded and promptly at twelve o clock was to be fired off immediately the revolutionists would seize their concealed arms attack the comandante s troops in the cuartel and capture the custom house and all government property and supplies i was nervous all the morning and about eleven o clock o connor became infused with the excitement and martial spirit of murder he geared his father s sword around him and walked up and down in the back room like a lion in the zoo suffering from corns i smoked a couple of dozen cigars and decided on yellow stripes down the trouser legs of my uniform at half past eleven o connor asks me to take a short stroll through the streets to see if i could notice any signs of the uprising i was back in fifteen minutes did you hear anything he asks i did says i at first i thought it was drums but it wasn t it was snoring everybody in town s asleep o connor tears out his watch fools says he they ve set the time right at the siesta hour when everybody takes a nap but the cannon will wake em up everything will be all right depend upon it just at twelve o clock we heard the sound of a cannon boom shaking the whole town o connor loosens his sword in its scabbard and jumps for the door i went as far as the door and stood in it people were sticking their heads out of doors and windows but there was one grand sight that made the landscape look tame general tumbalo the comandante was rolling down the steps of his residential dugout waving a five foot sabre in his hand he wore his cocked and plumed hat and his dress parade coat covered with gold braid and buttons sky blue pajamas one rubber boot and one red plush slipper completed his make up the general had heard the cannon and he puffed down the sidewalk toward the soldiers barracks as fast as his rudely awakened two hundred pounds could travel o connor sees him and lets out a battle cry and draws his father s sword and rushes across the street and tackle s the enemy right there in the street he and the general gave an exhibition of blacksmithing and butchery sparks flew from their blades the general roared and o connor gave the slogan of his race and proclivities then the general s sabre broke in two and he took to his ginger colored heels crying out policios at every jump o connor chased him a block imbued with the sentiment of manslaughter and slicing buttons off the general s coat tails with the paternal weapon at the corner five barefooted policemen in cotton undershirts and straw fiats climbed over o connor and subjugated him according to the municipal statutes they brought him past the late revolutionary headquarters on the way to jail i stood in the door a policeman had him by each hand and foot and they dragged him on his back through the grass like a turtle twice they stopped and the odd policeman took another s place while he rolled a cigarette the great soldier of fortune turned his head and looked at me as they passed i blushed and lit another cigar the procession passed on and at ten minutes past twelve everybody had gone back to sleep again in the afternoon the interpreter came around and smiled as he laid his hand on the big red jar we usually kept ice water in the ice man didn t call to day says i what s the matter with everything sancho ah yes says the liver colored linguist they just tell me in the town verree bad act that senor o connor make fight with general tumbalo yes general tumbalo great soldier and big mans what ll they do to mr o connor i asks i talk little while presently with the juez de la paz what you call justice with the peace says sancho he tell me it verree bad crime that one senor americano try kill general tumbalo he say they keep senor o connor in jail six months then have trial and shoot him with guns verree sorree how about this revolution that was to be pulled off i asks oh says this sancho i think too hot weather for revolution revolution better in winter time maybe so next winter quien sabe but the cannon went off says i the signal was given that big sound says sancho grinning the boiler in ice factory he blow up boom wake everybody up from siesta verree sorree no ice mucho hot day about sunset i went over to the jail and they let me talk to o connor through the bars what s the news bowers says he have we taken the town i ve been expecting a rescue party all the afternoon i haven t heard any firing has any word been received from the capital take it easy barney says i i think there s been a change of plans there s something more important to talk about have you any money i have not says o connor the last dollar went to pay our hotel bill yesterday did our troops capture the custom house there ought be plenty of government money there segregate your mind from battles says i i ve been making inquiries you re to be shot six months from date for assault and battery i m expecting to receive fifty years at hard labor for vagrancy all they furnish you while you re a prisoner is water you depend on your friends for food i ll see what i can do i went away and found a silver chile dollar in an old vest of o connor s i took him some fried fish and rice for his supper in the morning i went down to a lagoon and had a drink of water and then went back to the jail o connor had a porterhouse steak look in his eye barney says i i ve found a pond full of the finest kind of water it s the grandest sweetest purest water in the world say the word and i ll go fetch you a bucket of it and you can throw this vile government stuff out the window i ll do anything i can for a friend has it come to this says o connor raging up and down his cell am i to be starved to death and then shot i ll make those traitors feel the weight of an o connor s hand when i get out of this and then he comes to the bars and speaks softer has nothing been heard from dona isabel he asks though every one else in the world fail says he i trust those eyes of hers she will find a way to effect my release do ye think ye could communicate with her one word from her even a rose would make me sorrow light but don t let her know except with the utmost delicacy bowers these high bred castilians are sensitive and proud well said barney says i you ve given me an idea i ll report later something s got to be pulled off quick or we ll both starve i walked out and down to hooligan alley and then on the other side of the street as i went past the window of dona isabel antonia concha regalia out flies the rose as usual and hits me on the ear the door was open and i took off my hat and walked in it wasn t very light inside but there she sat in a rocking chair by the window smoking a black cheroot and when i got closer i saw that she was about thirty nine and had never seen a straight front in her life i sat down on the arm of her chair and took the cheroot out of her mouth and stole a kiss hullo izzy i says excuse my unconventionality but i feel like i have known you for a month whose izzy is oo the lady ducked her head under her mantilla and drew in a long breath i thought she was going to scream but with all that intake of air she only came out with me likee americanos as soon as she said that i knew that o connor and me would be doing things with a knife and fork before the day was over i drew a chair beside her and inside of half an hour we were engaged then i took my hat and said i must go out for a while you come back says izzy in alarm me go bring preacher says i come back twenty minutes we marry now how you likee marry to day says izzy good i went down on the beach to the united states consul s shack he was a grizzly man eighty two pounds smoked glasses five foot eleven pickled he was playing chess with an india rubber man in white clothes excuse me for interrupting says i but can you tell me how a man could get married quick the consul gets up and fingers in a pigeonhole i believe i had a license to perform the ceremony myself a year or two ago he said i ll look and i caught hold of his arm don t look it up says i marriage is a lottery anyway i m willing to take the risk about the license if you are the consul went back to hooligan alley with me izzy called her ma to come in but the old lady was picking a chicken in the patio and begged to be excused so we stood up and the consul performed the ceremony that evening mrs bowers cooked a great supper of stewed goat tamales baked bananas fricasseed red peppers and coffee afterward i sat in the rocking chair by the front window and she sat on the floor plunking at a guitar and happy as she should be as mrs william t b all at once i sprang up in a hurry i d forgotten all about o connor i asked izzy to fix up a lot of truck for him to eat that big oogly man said izzy but all right he your friend i pulled a rose out of a bunch in a jar and took the grub basket around to the jail o connor ate like a wolf then he wiped his face with a banana peel and said have you heard nothing from dona isabel yet hist says i slipping the rose between the bars she sends you this she bids you take courage at nightfall two masked men brought it to the ruined chateau in the orange grove how did you like that goat hash barney o connor pressed the rose to his lips this is more to me than all the food in the world says he but the supper was fine where did you raise it i ve negotiated a stand off at a delicatessen but downtown i tells him rest easy if there s anything to be done i ll do it so things went along that way for some weeks izzy was a great cook and if she had had a little more poise of character and smoked a little better brand of tobacco we might have drifted into some sense of responsibility for the honor i had conferred on her but as time went on i began to hunger for the sight of a real lady standing before me in a street car all i was staying in that land of bilk and money for was because i couldn t get away and i thought it no more than decent to stay and see o connor shot one day our old interpreter drops around and after smoking an hour says that the judge of the peace sent him to request me to call on him i went to his office in a lemon grove on a hill at the edge of the town and there i had a surprise i expected to see one of the usual cinnamon colored natives in congress gaiters and one of pizzaro s cast off hats what i saw was an elegant gentleman of a slightly claybank complexion sitting in an upholstered leather chair sipping a highball and reading mrs humphry ward i had smuggled into my brain a few words of spanish by the help of izzy and i began to remark in a rich andalusian brogue buenas dias senor yo tengo yo tengo oh sit down mr bowers says he i spent eight years in your country in colleges and law schools let me mix you a highball lemon peel or not thus we got along in about half an hour i was beginning to tell him about the scandal in our family when aunt elvira ran away with a cumberland presbyterian preacher then he says to me i sent for you mr bowers to let you know that you can have your friend mr o connor now of course we had to make a show of punishing him on account of his attack on general tumbalo it is arranged that he shall be released to morrow night you and he will be conveyed on board the fruit steamer voyager bound for new york which lies in the harbor your passage will be arranged for one moment judge says i that revolution the judge lays back in his chair and howls why says he presently that was all a little joke fixed up by the boys around the court room and one or two of our cut ups and a few clerks in the stores the town is bursting its sides with laughing the boys made themselves up to be conspirators and they what you call it stick senor o connor for his money it is very funny it was says i i saw the joke all along i ll take another highball if your honor don t mind the next evening just at dark a couple of soldiers brought o connor down to the beach where i was waiting under a cocoanut tree hist says i in his ear dona isabel has arranged our escape not a word they rowed us in a boat out to a little steamer that smelled of table d hote salad oil and bone phosphate the great mellow tropical moon was rising as we steamed away o connor leaned on the taffrail or rear balcony of the ship and gazed silently at guaya at buncoville on the beach he had the red rose in his hand she will wait i heard him say eyes like hers never deceive but i shall see her again traitors cannot keep an o connor down forever you talk like a sequel says i but in volume ii please omit the light haired friend who totes the grub to the hero in his dungeon cell and thus reminiscing we came back to new york there was a little silence broken only by the familiar roar of the streets after kansas bill bowers ceased talking did o connor ever go back i asked he attained his heart s desire said bill can you walk two blocks i ll show you he led me eastward and down a flight of stairs that was covered by a curious shaped glowing pagoda like structure signs and figures on the tiled walls and supporting columns attested that we were in the grand central station of the subway hundreds of people were on the midway platform an uptown express dashed up and halted it was crowded there was a rush for it by a still larger crowd towering above every one there a magnificent broad shouldered athletic man leaped into the centre of the struggle men and women he seized in either hand and hurled them like manikins toward the open gates of the train now and then some passenger with a shred of soul and self respect left to him turned to offer remonstrance but the blue uniform on the towering figure the fierce and conquering glare of his eye and the ready impact of his ham like hands glued together the lips that would have spoken complaint when the train was full then he exhibited to all who might observe and admire his irresistible genius as a ruler of men with his knees with his elbows with his shoulders with his resistless feet he shoved crushed slammed heaved kicked flung pounded the overplus of passengers aboard then with the sounds of its wheels drowned by the moans shrieks prayers and curses of its unfortunate crew the express dashed away that s him ain t he a wonder said kansas bill admiringly that tropical country wasn t the place for him i wish the distinguished traveller writer war correspondent and playright richmond hobson davis could see him now o connor ought to be dramatized the atavism of john tom little bear o henry thought this the best of the jeff peters stories all the rest of which are included in the gentle grafter except cupid a la carte in the heart of the west the atavism of john tom little bear appeared in everybody s magazine for july i saw a light in jeff peters s room over the red front drug store i hastened toward it for i had not known that jeff was in town he is a man of the hadji breed of a hundred occupations with a story to tell when he will of each one i found jeff repacking his grip for a run down to florida to look at an orange grove for which he had traded a month before his mining claim on the yukon he kicked me a chair with the same old humorous profound smile on his seasoned countenance it had been eight months since we had met but his greeting was such as men pass from day to day time is jeff s servant and the continent is a big lot across which he cuts to his many roads for a while we skirmished along the edges of unprofitable talk which culminated in that unquiet problem of the philippines all them tropical races said jeff could be run out better with their own jockeys up the tropical man knows what he wants all he wants is a season ticket to the cock fights and a pair of western union climbers to go up the bread fruit tree the anglo saxon man wants him to learn to conjugate and wear suspenders he ll be happiest in his own way i was shocked education man i said is the watchword in time they will rise to our standard of civilization look at what education has done for the indian o ho sang jeff lighting his pipe which was a good sign yes the indian i m looking i hasten to contemplate the redman as a standard bearer of progress he s the same as the other brown boys you can t make an anglo saxon of him did i ever tell you about the time my friend john tom little bear bit off the right ear of the arts of culture and education and spun the teetotum back round to where it was when columbus was a little boy i did not john tom little bear was an educated cherokee indian and an old friend of mine when i was in the territories he was a graduate of one of them eastern football colleges that have been so successful in teaching the indian to use the gridiron instead of burning his victims at the stake as an anglo saxon john tom was copper colored in spots as an indian he was one of the whitest men i ever knew as a cherokee he was a gentleman on the first ballot as a ward of the nation he was mighty hard to carry at the primaries john tom and me got together and began to make medicine how to get up some lawful genteel swindle which we might work in a quiet way so as not to excite the stupidity of the police or the cupidity of the larger corporations we had close upon between us and we pined to make it grow as all respectable capitalists do so we figured out a proposition which seems to be as honorable as a gold mine prospectus and as profitable as a church raffle and inside of thirty days you find us swarming into kansas with a pair of fluent horses and a red camping wagon on the european plan john tom is chief wish heap dough the famous indian medicine man and samaritan sachem of the seven tribes mr peters is business manager and half owner we needed a third man so we looked around and found j conyngham binkly leaning against the want column of a newspaper this binkly has a disease for shakespearian roles and an hallucination about a nights run on the new york stage but he confesses that he never could earn the butter to spread on his william s roles so he is willing to drop to the ordinary baker s kind and be satisfied with a mile run behind the medicine ponies besides richard iii he could do twenty seven coon songs and banjo specialties and was willing to cook and curry the horses we carried a fine line of excuses for taking money one was a magic soap for removing grease spots and quarters from clothes one was a sum wah tah the great indian remedy made from a prairie herb revealed by the great spirit in a dream to his favorite medicine men the great chiefs mcgarrity and siberstein bottlers chicago and the other was a frivolous system of pick pocketing the kansasters that had the department stores reduced to a decimal fraction look ye a pair of silk garters a dream book one dozen clothespins a gold tooth and when knighthood was in flower all wrapped up in a genuine japanese silkarina handkerchief and handed to the handsome lady by mr peters for the trivial sum of fifty cents while professor binkly entertains us in a three minute round with the banjo twas an eminent graft we had we ravaged peacefully through the state determined to remove all doubt as to why twas called bleeding kansas john tom little bear in full indian chief s costume drew crowds away from the parchesi sociables and government ownership conversaziones while at the football college in the east he had acquired quantities of rhetoric and the art of calisthenics and sophistry in his classes and when he stood up in the red wagon and explained to the farmers eloquent about chilblains and hyperaesthesia of the cranium jeff couldn t hand out the indian remedy fast enough for em one night we was camped on the edge of a little town out west of salina we always camped near a stream and put up a little tent sometimes we sold out of the remedy unexpected and then chief wish heap dough would have a dream in which the manitou commanded him to fill up a few bottles of sum wah tah at the most convenient place twas about ten o clock and we d just got in from a street performance i was in the tent with the lantern figuring up the day s profits john tom hadn t taken off his indian make up and was sitting by the campfire minding a fine sirloin steak in the pan for the professor till he finished his hair raising scene with the trained horses all at once out of dark bushes comes a pop like a firecracker and john tom gives a grunt and digs out of his bosom a little bullet that has dented itself against his collar bone john tom makes a dive in the direction of the fireworks and comes back dragging by the collar a kid about nine or ten years young in a velveteen suit with a little nickel mounted rifle in his hand about as big as a fountain pen here you pappoose says john tom what are you gunning for with that howitzer you might hit somebody in the eye come out jeff and mind the steak don t let it burn while i investigate this demon with the pea shooter cowardly redskin says the kid like he was quoting from a favorite author dare to burn me at the stake and the paleface will sweep you from the prairies like like everything now you lemme go or i ll tell mamma john tom plants the kid on a camp stool and sits down by him now tell the big chief he says why you try to shoot pellets into your uncle john s system didn t you know it was loaded are you a indian asks the kid looking up cute as you please at john tom s buckskin and eagle feathers i am says john tom well then that s why answers the boy swinging his feet i nearly let the steak burn watching the nerve of that youngster o ho says john tom i see you re the boy avenger and you ve sworn to rid the continent of the savage redman is that about the way of it son the kid halfway nodded his head and then he looked glum twas indecent to wring his secret from his bosom before a single brave had fallen before his parlor rifle now tell us where your wigwam is pappoose says john tom where you live your mamma will be worrying about you being out so late tell me and i ll take you home the kid grins i guess not he says i live thousands and thousands of miles over there he gyrated his hand toward the horizon i come on the train he says by myself i got off here because the conductor said my ticket had ex pirated he looks at john tom with sudden suspicion i bet you ain t a indian he says you don t talk like a indian you look like one but all a indian can say is heap good and paleface die say i bet you are one of them make believe indians that sell medicine on the streets i saw one once in quincy you never mind says john tom whether i m a cigar sign or a tammany cartoon the question before the council is what s to be done with you you ve run away from home you ve been reading howells you ve disgraced the profession of boy avengers by trying to shoot a tame indian and never saying die dog of a redskin you have crossed the path of the boy avenger nineteen times too often what do you mean by it the kid thought for a minute i guess i made a mistake he says i ought to have gone farther west they find em wild out there in the canyons he holds out his hand to john tom the little rascal please excuse me sir says he for shooting at you i hope it didn t hurt you but you ought to be more careful when a scout sees a indian in his war dress his rifle must speak little bear give a big laugh with a whoop at the end of it and swings the kid ten feet high and sets him on his shoulder and the runaway fingers the fringe and the eagle feathers and is full of the joy the white man knows when he dangles his heels against an inferior race it is plain that little bear and that kid are chums from that on the little renegade has already smoked the pipe of peace with the savage and you can see in his eye that he is figuring on a tomahawk and a pair of moccasins children s size we have supper in the tent the youngster looks upon me and the professor as ordinary braves only intended as a background to the camp scene when he is seated on a box of sum wah tah with the edge of the table sawing his neck and his mouth full of beefsteak little bear calls for his name roy says the kid with a sirloiny sound to it but when the rest of it and his post office address is referred to he shakes his head i guess not he says you ll send me back i want to stay with you i like this camping out at home we fellows had a camp in our back yard they called me roy the red wolf i guess that ll do for a name gimme another piece of beefsteak please we had to keep that kid we knew there was a hullabaloo about him somewheres and that mamma and uncle harry and aunt jane and the chief of police were hot after finding his trail but not another word would he tell us in two days he was the mascot of the big medicine outfit and all of us had a sneaking hope that his owners wouldn t turn up when the red wagon was doing business he was in it and passed up the bottles to mr peters as proud and satisfied as a prince that s abjured a two hundred dollar crown for a million dollar parvenuess once john tom asked him something about his papa i ain t got any papa he says he runned away and left us he made my mamma cry aunt lucy says he s a shape a what somebody asks him a shape says the kid some kind of a shape lemme see oh yes a feendenuman shape i don t know what it means john tom was for putting our brand on him and dressing him up like a little chief with wampum and beads but i vetoes it somebody s lost that kid is my view of it and they may want him you let me try him with a few stratagems and see if i can t get a look at his visiting card so that night i goes up to mr roy blank by the camp fire and looks at him contemptuous and scornful snickenwitzel says i like the word made me sick snickenwitzel bah before i d be named snickenwitzel what s the matter with you jeff says the kid opening his eyes wide snickenwitzel i repeats and i spat the word out i saw a man to day from your town and he told me your name i m not surprised you was ashamed to tell it snickenwitzel whew ah here now says the boy indignant and wriggling all over what s the matter with you that ain t my name it s conyers what s the matter with you and that s not the worst of it i went on quick keeping him hot and not giving him time to think we thought you was from a nice well to do family here s mr little bear a chief of the cherokees entitled to wear nine otter tails on his sunday blanket and professor binkly who plays shakespeare and the banjo and me that s got hundreds of dollars in that black tin box in the wagon and we ve got to be careful about the company we keep that man tells me your folks live way down in little old hencoop alley where there are no sidewalks and the goats eat off the table with you that kid was almost crying now taint so he splutters he he don t know what he s talking about we live on poplar av noo i don t sociate with goats what s the matter with you poplar avenue says i sarcastic poplar avenue that s a street to live on it only runs two blocks and then falls off a bluff you can throw a keg of nails the whole length of it don t talk to me about poplar avenue it s it s miles long says the kid our number s and there s lots of houses after that what s the matter with aw you make me tired jeff well well now says i i guess that man made a mistake maybe it was some other boy he was talking about if i catch him i ll teach him to go around slandering people and after supper i goes up town and telegraphs to mrs conyers poplar avenue quincy ill that the kid is safe and sassy with us and will be held for further orders in two hours an answer comes to hold him tight and she ll start for him by next train the next train was due at p m the next day and me and john tom was at the depot with the kid you might scour the plains in vain for the big chief wish heap dough in his place is mr little bear in the human habiliments of the anglo saxon sect and the leather of his shoes is patented and the loop of his necktie is copyrighted for these things john tom had grafted on him at college along with metaphysics and the knockout guard for the low tackle but for his complexion which is some yellowish and the black mop of his straight hair you might have thought here was an ordinary man out of the city directory that subscribes for magazines and pushes the lawn mower in his shirt sleeves of evenings then the train rolled in and a little woman in a gray dress with sort of illuminating hair slides off and looks around quick and the boy avenger sees her and yells mamma and she cries o and they meet in a clinch and now the pesky redskins can come forth from their caves on the plains without fear any more of the rifle of roy the red wolf mrs conyers comes up and thanks me an john tom without the usual extremities you always look for in a woman she says just enough in a way to convince and there is no incidental music by the orchestra i made a few illiterate requisitions upon the art of conversation at which the lady smiles friendly as if she had known me a week and then mr little bear adorns the atmosphere with the various idioms into which education can fracture the wind of speech i could see the kid s mother didn t quite place john tom but it seemed she was apprised in his dialects and she played up to his lead in the science of making three words do the work of one that kid introduced us with some footnotes and explanations that made things plainer than a week of rhetoric he danced around and punched us in the back and tried to climb john tom s leg this is john tom mamma says he he s a indian he sells medicine in a red wagon i shot him but he wasn t wild the other one s jeff he s a fakir too come on and see the camp where we live won t you mamma it is plain to see that the life of the woman is in that boy she has got him again where her arms can gather him and that s enough she s ready to do anything to please him she hesitates the eighth of a second and takes another look at these men i imagine she says to herself about john tom seems to be a gentleman if his hair don t curl and mr peters she disposes of as follows no ladies man but a man who knows a lady so we all rambled down to the camp as neighborly as coming from a wake and there she inspects the wagon and pats the place with her hand where the kid used to sleep and dabs around her eyewinkers with her handkerchief and professor binkly gives us trovatore on one strong of the banjo and is about to slide off into hamlet s monologue when one of the horses gets tangled in his rope and he must go look after him and says something about foiled again when it got dark me and john tom walked back up to the corn exchange hotel and the four of us had supper there i think the trouble started at that supper for then was when mr little bear made an intellectual balloon ascension i held on to the tablecloth and listened to him soar that redman if i could judge had the gift of information he took language and did with it all a roman can do with macaroni his vocal remarks was all embroidered over with the most scholarly verbs and prefixes and his syllables was smooth and fitted nicely to the joints of his idea i thought i d heard him talk before but i hadn t and it wasn t the size of his words but the way they come and twasn t his subjects for he spoke of common things like cathedrals and football and poems and catarrh and souls and freight rates and sculpture mrs conyers understood his accents and the elegant sounds went back and forth between em and now and then jefferson d peters would intervene a few shop worn senseless words to have the butter passed or another leg of the chicken yes john tom little bear appeared to be inveigled some in his bosom about that mrs conyers she was of the kind that pleases she had the good looks and more i ll tell you you take one of these cloak models in a big store they strike you as being on the impersonal system they are adapted for the eye what they run to is inches around and complexion and the art of fanning the delusion that the sealskin would look just as well on the lady with the warts and the pocket book now if one of them models was off duty and you took it and it would say charlie when you pressed it and sit up at the table why then you would have something similar to mrs conyers i could see how john tom could resist any inclination to hate that white squaw the lady and the kid stayed at the hotel in the morning they say they will start for home me and little bear left at eight o clock and sold indian remedy on the courthouse square till nine he leaves me and the professor to drive down to camp while he stays up town i am not enamored with that plan for it shows john tom is uneasy in his composures and that leads to firewater and sometimes to the green corn dance and costs not often does chief wish heap dough get busy with the firewater but whenever he does there is heap much doing in the lodges of the palefaces who wear blue and carry the club at half past nine professor binkly is rolled in his quilt snoring in blank verse and i am sitting by the fire listening to the frogs mr little bear slides into camp and sits down against a tree there is no symptoms of firewater jeff says he after a long time a little boy came west to hunt indians well then says i for i wasn t thinking as he was and he bagged one says john tom and twas not with a gun and he never had on a velveteen suit of clothes in his life and then i began to catch his smoke i know it says i and i ll bet you his pictures are on valentines and fool men are his game red and white you win on the red says john tom calm jeff for how many ponies do you think i could buy mrs conyers scandalous talk i replies tis not a paleface custom john tom laughs loud and bites into a cigar no he answers tis the savage equivalent for the dollars of the white man s marriage settlement oh i know there s an eternal wall between the races if i could do it jeff i d put a torch to every white college that a redman has ever set foot inside why don t you leave us alone he says to our own ghost dances and dog feasts and our dingy squaws to cook our grasshopper soup and darn our moccasins now you sure don t mean disrespect to the perennial blossom entitled education says i scandalized because i wear it in the bosom of my own intellectual shirt waist i ve had education says i and never took any harm from it you lasso us goes on little bear not noticing my prose insertions and teach us what is beautiful in literature and in life and how to appreciate what is fine in men and women what have you done to me says he you ve made me a cherokee moses you ve taught me to hate the wigwams and love the white man s ways i can look over into the promised land and see mrs conyers but my place is on the reservation little bear stands up in his chief s dress and laughs again but white man jeff he goes on the paleface provides a recourse tis a temporary one but it gives a respite and the name of it is whiskey and straight off he walks up the path to town again now says i in my mind may the manitou move him to do only bailable things this night for i perceive that john tom is about to avail himself of the white man s solace maybe it was as i sat smoking when i hear pit a pats on the path and here comes mrs conyers running her hair twisted up any way and a look on her face that says burglars and mice and the flour s all out rolled in one oh mr peters she calls out as they will oh oh i made a quick think and i spoke the gist of it out loud now says i we ve been brothers me and that indian but i ll make a good one of him in two minutes if no no she says wild and cracking her knuckles i haven t seen mr little bear tis my husband he s stolen my boy oh she says just when i had him back in my arms again that heartless villain every bitterness life knows she says he s made me drink my poor little lamb that ought to be warm in his bed carried of by that fiend how did all this happen i ask let s have the facts i was fixing his bed she explains and roy was playing on the hotel porch and he drives up to the steps i heard roy scream and ran out my husband had him in the buggy then i begged him for my child this is what he gave me she turns her face to the light there is a crimson streak running across her cheek and mouth he did that with his whip she says come back to the hotel says i and we ll see what can be done on the way she tells me some of the wherefores when he slashed her with the whip he told her he found out she was coming for the kid and he was on the same train mrs conyers had been living with her brother and they d watched the boy always as her husband had tried to steal him before i judge that man was worse than a street railway promoter it seems he had spent her money and slugged her and killed her canary bird and told it around that she had cold feet at the hotel we found a mass meeting of five infuriated citizens chewing tobacco and denouncing the outrage most of the town was asleep by ten o clock i talks the lady some quiet and tells her i will take the one o clock train for the next town forty miles east for it is likely that the esteemed mr conyers will drive there to take the cars i don t know i tells her but what he has legal rights but if i find him i can give him an illegal left in the eye and tie him up for a day or two anyhow on a disturbal of the peace proposition mrs conyers goes inside and cries with the landlord s wife who is fixing some catnip tea that will make everything all right for the poor dear the landlord comes out on the porch thumbing his one suspender and says to me ain t had so much excitements in town since bedford steegall s wife swallered a spring lizard i seen him through the winder hit her with the buggy whip and everything what s that suit of clothes cost you you got on pears like we d have some rain don t it say doc that indian of yorn s on a kind of a whizz to night ain t he he comes along just before you did and i told him about this here occurrence he gives a cur us kind of a hoot and trotted off i guess our constable ll have him in the lock up fore morning i thought i d sit on the porch and wait for the one o clock train i wasn t feeling saturated with mirth here was john tom on one of his sprees and this kidnapping business losing sleep for me but then i m always having trouble with other people s troubles every few minutes mrs conyers would come out on the porch and look down the road the way the buggy went like she expected to see that kid coming back on a white pony with a red apple in his hand now wasn t that like a woman and that brings up cats i saw a mouse go in this hole says mrs cat you can go prize up a plank over there if you like i ll watch this hole about a quarter to one o clock the lady comes out again restless crying easy as females do for their own amusement and she looks down that road again and listens now ma am says i there s no use watching cold wheel tracks by this time they re halfway to hush she says holding up her hand and i do hear something coming flip flap in the dark and then there is the awfulest war whoop ever heard outside of madison square garden at a buffalo bill matinee and up the steps and on to the porch jumps the disrespectable indian the lamp in the hall shines on him and i fail to recognize mr j t little bear alumnus of the class of what i see is a cherokee brave and the warpath is what he has been travelling firewater and other things have got him going his buckskin is hanging in strings and his feathers are mixed up like a frizzly hen s the dust of miles is on his moccasins and the light in his eye is the kind the aborigines wear but in his arms he brings that kid his eyes half closed with his little shoes dangling and one hand fast around the indian s collar pappoose says john tom and i notice that the flowers of the white man s syntax have left his tongue he is the original proposition in bear s claws and copper color me bring says he and he lays the kid in his mother s arms run fifteen mile says john tom ugh catch white man bring pappoose the little woman is in extremities of gladness she must wake up that stir up trouble youngster and hug him and make proclamation that he is his mamma s own precious treasure i was about to ask questions but i looked at mr little bear and my eye caught the sight of something in his belt now go to bed ma am says i and this gadabout youngster likewise for there s no more danger and the kidnapping business is not what it was earlier in the night i inveigled john tom down to camp quick and when he tumbled over asleep i got that thing out of his belt and disposed of it where the eye of education can t see it for even the football colleges disapprove of the art of scalp taking in their curriculums it is ten o clock next day when john tom wakes up and looks around i am glad to see the nineteenth century in his eyes again what was it jeff he asks heap firewater says i john tom frowns and thinks a little combined says he directly with the interesting little physiological shake up known as reversion to type i remember now have they gone yet on the train i answers ugh says john tom better so paleface bring big chief wish heap dough a little bromo seltzer and then he ll take up the redman s burden again helping the other fellow originally published in munsey s magazine december but can thim that helps others help thimselves mulvaney this is the story that william trotter told me on the beach at aguas frescas while i waited for the gig of the captain of the fruit steamer andador which was to take me abroad reluctantly i was leaving the land of always afternoon william was remaining and he favored me with a condensed oral autobiography as we sat on the sands in the shade cast by the bodega nacional as usual i became aware that the man from bombay had already written the story but as he had compressed it to an eight word sentence i have become an expansionist and have quoted his phrase above with apologies to him and best regards to terence ii don t you ever have a desire to go back to the land of derby hats and starched collars i asked him you seem to be a handy man and a man of action i continued and i am sure i could find you a comfortable job somewhere in the states ragged shiftless barefooted a confirmed eater of the lotos william trotter had pleased me much and i hated to see him gobbled up by the tropics i ve no doubt you could he said idly splitting the bark from a section of sugar cane i ve no doubt you could do much for me if every man could do as much for himself as he can for others every country in the world would be holding millenniums instead of centennials there seemed to be pabulum in w t s words and then another idea came to me i had a brother in chicopee falls who owned manufactories cotton or sugar or a a sheetings or something in the commercial line lie was vulgarly rich and therefore reverenced art the artistic temperament of the family was monopolized at my birth i knew that brother james would honor my slightest wish i would demand from him a position in cotton sugar or sheetings for william trotter something say at two hundred a month or thereabouts i confided my beliefs and made my large propositions to william he had pleased me much and he was ragged while we were talking there was a sound of firing guns four or five rattlingly as if by a squad the cheerful noise came from the direction of the cuartel which is a kind of makeshift barracks for the soldiers of the republic hear that said william trotter let me tell you about it a year ago i landed on this coast with one solitary dollar i have the same sum in my pocket to day i was second cook on a tramp fruiter and they marooned me here early one morning without benefit of clergy just because i poulticed the face of the first mate with cheese omelette at dinner the fellow had kicked because i d put horseradish in it instead of cheese when they threw me out of the yawl into three feet of surf i waded ashore and sat down under a palm tree by and by a fine looking white man with a red face and white clothes genteel as possible but somewhat under the influence came and sat down beside me i had noticed there was a kind of a village back of the beach and enough scenery to outfit a dozen moving picture shows but i thought of course it was a cannibal suburb and i was wondering whether i was to be served with carrots or mushrooms and as i say this dressed up man sits beside me and we become friends in the space of a minute or two for an hour we talked and he told me all about it it seems that he was a man of parts conscientiousness and plausibility besides being educated and a wreck to his appetites he told me all about it colleges had turned him out and distilleries had taken him in did i tell you his name it was clifford wainwright i didn t exactly catch the cause of his being cast away on that particular stretch of south america but i reckon it was his own business i asked him if he d ever been second cook on a tramp fruiter and he said no so that concluded my line of surmises but he talked like the encyclopedia from a berlin to trilo zyria and he carried a watch a silver arrangement with works and up to date within twenty four hours anyhow i m pleased to have met you says wainwright i m a devotee to the great joss booze but my ruminating facilities are unrepaired says he or words to that effect and i hate says he to see fools trying to run the world i never touch a drop says i and there are many kinds of fools and the world runs on its own apex according to science with no meddling from me i was referring says he to the president of this republic his country is in a desperate condition its treasury is empty it s on the verge of war with nicamala and if it wasn t for the hot weather the people would be starting revolutions in every town here is a nation goes on wainwright on the brink of destruction a man of intelligence could rescue it from its impending doom in one day by issuing the necessary edicts and orders president gomez knows nothing of statesmanship or policy do you know adam smith lemme see says i there was a one eared man named smith in fort worth texas but i think his first name was i am referring to the political economist says wainwright s mother smith then says i the one i speak of never was arrested so wainwright boils some more with indignation at the insensibility of people who are not corpulent to fill public positions and then he tells me he is going out to the president s summer palace which is four miles from aguas frescas to instruct him in the art of running steam heated republics come along with me trotter says he and i ll show you what brains can do anything in it i asks the satisfaction says he of redeeming a country of two hundred thousand population from ruin back to prosperity and peace great says i i ll go with you i d prefer to eat a live broiled lobster just now but give me liberty as second choice if i can t be in at the death wainwright and me permeates through the town and he halts at a rum dispensary have you any money he asks i have says i fishing out my silver dollar i always go about with adequate sums of money then we ll drink says wainwright not me says i not any demon ruin or any of its ramifications for mine it s one of my non weaknesses it s my failing says he what s your particular soft point industry says i promptly i m hard working diligent industrious and energetic my dear mr trotter says he surely i ve known you long enough to tell you you are a liar every man must have his own particular weakness and his own particular strength in other things now you will buy me a drink of rum and we will call on president gomez iii well sir trotter went on we walks the four miles out through a virgin conservatory of palms and ferns and other roof garden products to the president s summer white house it was blue and reminded you of what you see on the stage in the third act which they describe as same as the first on the programs there was more than fifty people waiting outside the iron fence that surrounded the house and grounds there was generals and agitators and epergnes in gold laced uniforms and citizens in diamonds and panama hats all waiting to get an audience with the royal five card draw and in a kind of a summer house in front of the mansion we could see a burnt sienna man eating breakfast out of gold dishes and taking his time i judged that the crowd outside had come out for their morning orders and requests and was afraid to intrude but c wainwright wasn t the gate was open and he walked inside and up to the president s table as confident as a man who knows the head waiter in a fifteen cent restaurant and i went with him because i had only seventy five cents and there was nothing else to do the gomez man rises from his chair and looks colored man as he was like he was about to call out for corporal of the guard post number one but wainwright says some phrases to him in a peculiarly lubricating manner and the first thing you know we was all three of us seated at the table with coffee and rolls and iguana cutlets coming as fast as about ninety peons could rustle em and then wainwright begins to talk but the president interrupts him you yankees says he polite assuredly take the cake for assurance i assure you or words to that effect he spoke english better than you or me you ve had a long walk says he but it s nicer in the cool morning to walk than to ride may i suggest some refreshments says he rum says wainwright gimme a cigar says i well sir the two talked an hour keeping the generals and equities all in their good uniforms waiting outside the fence and while i smoked silent i listened to clifford wainwright making a solid republic out of the wreck of one i didn t follow his arguments with any special collocation of international intelligibility but he had mr gomez s attention glued and riveted he takes out a pencil and marks the white linen tablecloth all over with figures and estimates and deductions he speaks more or less disrespectfully of import and export duties and custom house receipts and taxes and treaties and budgets and concessions and such truck that politics and government require and when he gets through the gomez man hops up and shakes his hand and says he s saved the country and the people you shall be rewarded says the president might i suggest another rum says wainwright cigar for me darker brand says i well sir the president sent me and wainwright back to the town in a victoria hitched to two flea bitten selling platers but the best the country afforded i found out afterward that wainwright was a regular beachcomber the smartest man on the whole coast but kept down by rum i liked him one day i inveigled him into a walk out a couple of miles from the village where there was an old grass hut on the bank of a little river while he was sitting on the grass talking beautiful of the wisdom of the world that he had learned in books i took hold of him easy and tied his hands and feet together with leather thongs that i had in my pocket lie still says i and meditate on the exigencies and irregularities of life till i get back i went to a shack in aguas frescas where a mighty wise girl named timotea carrizo lived with her mother the girl was just about as nice as you ever saw in the states she would have been called a brunette but she was better than a brunette i should say she was what you might term an ecru shade i knew her pretty well i told her about my friend wainwright she gave me a double handful of bark calisaya i think it was and some more herbs that i was to mix with it and told me what to do i was to make tea of it and give it to him and keep him from rum for a certain time and for two weeks i did it you know i liked wainwright both of us was broke but timotea sent us goat meat and plantains and tortillas every day and at last i got the curse of drink lifted from clifford wainwright he lost his taste for it and in the cool of the evening him and me would sit on the roof of timotea s mother s hut eating harmless truck like coffee and rice and stewed crabs and playing the accordion about that time president gomez found out that the advice of c wainwright was the stuff he had been looking for the country was pulling out of debt and the treasury bad enough boodle in it for him to amuse himself occasionally with the night latch the people were beginning to take their two hour siestas again every day which was the surest sign of prosperity so down from the regular capital he sends for clifford wainwright and makes him his private secretary at twenty thousand peru dollars a year yes sir so much wainwright was on the water wagon thanks to me and timotea and he was soon in clover with the government gang don t forget what done it calisaya bark with them other herbs mixed make a tea of it and give a cupful every two hours try it yourself it takes away the desire as i said a man can do a lot more for another party than he can for himself wainwright with his brains got a whole country out of trouble and on its feet but what could he do for himself and without any special brains but with some nerve and common sense i put him on his feet because i never had the weakness that he did nothing but a cigar for mine thanks and trotter paused i looked at his tattered clothes and at his deeply sunburnt hard thoughtful face didn t cartright ever offer to do anything for you i asked wainwright corrected trotter yes he offered me some pretty good jobs but i d have bad to leave aguas frescas so i didn t take any of em up say i didn t tell you much about that girl timotea we rather hit it off together she was as good as you find em anywhere spanish mostly with just a twist of lemon peel on top what if they did live in a grass hut and went bare armed a month ago went on trotter she went away i don t know where to but you d better come back to the states i insisted i can promise you positively that my brother will give you a position in cotton sugar or sheetings i am not certain which i think she went back with her mother said trotter to the village in the mountains that they come from tell me what would this job you speak of pay why said i hesitating over commerce i should say fifty or a hundred dollars a month maybe two hundred ain t it funny said trotter digging his toes in the sand what a chump a man is when it comes to paddling his own canoe i don t know of course i m not making a living here i m on the bum but well i wish you could have seen that timotea every man has his own weak spot the gig from the andador was coming ashore to take out the captain purser and myself the lone passenger i ll guarantee said i confidently that my brother will pay you seventy five dollars a month all right then said william trotter i ll but a soft voice called across the blazing sands a girl faintly lemon tinted stood in the calle real and called she was bare armed but what of that it s her said william trotter looking she s come back i m obliged but i can t take the job thanks just the same ain t it funny how we can t do nothing for ourselves but we can do wonders for the other fellow you was about to get me with your financial proposition but we ve all got our weak points timotea s mine and say trotter had turned to leave but he retraced the step or two that he had taken i like to have left you without saying good bye said he it kind of rattles you when they go away unexpected for a month and come back the same way shake hands so long say do you remember them gunshots we heard a while ago up at the cuartel well i knew what they was but i didn t mention it it was clifford wainwright being shot by a squad of soldiers against a stone wall for giving away secrets of state to that nicamala republic oh yes it was rum that did it he backslided and got his i guess we all have our weak points and can t do much toward helping ourselves mine s waiting for me i d have liked to have that job with your brother but we ve all got our weak points so long iv a big black carib carried me on his back through the surf to the ship s boat on the way the purser handed me a letter that he had brought for me at the last moment from the post office in aguas frescas it was from my brother he requested me to meet him at the st charles hotel in new orleans and accept a position with his house in either cotton sugar or sheetings and with five thousand dollars a year as my salary when i arrived at the crescent city i hurried away far away from the st charles to a dim chambre garnie in bienville street and there looking down from my attic window from time to time at the old yellow absinthe house across the street i wrote this story to buy my bread and butter can thim that helps others help thimselves the marionettes originally published in the black cat for april the short story publishing co the policeman was standing at the corner of twenty fourth street and a prodigiously dark alley near where the elevated railroad crosses the street the time was two o clock in the morning the outlook a stretch of cold drizzling unsociable blackness until the dawn a man wearing a long overcoat with his hat tilted down in front and carrying something in one hand walked softly but rapidly out of the black alley the policeman accosted him civilly but with the assured air that is linked with conscious authority the hour the alley s musty reputation the pedestrian s haste the burden he carried these easily combined into the suspicious circumstances that required illumination at the officer s hands the suspect halted readily and tilted back his hat exposing in the flicker of the electric lights an emotionless smooth countenance with a rather long nose and steady dark eyes thrusting his gloved hand into a side pocket of his overcoat he drew out a card and handed it to the policeman holding it to catch the uncertain light the officer read the name charles spencer james m d the street and number of the address were of a neighborhood so solid and respectable as to subdue even curiosity the policeman s downward glance at the article carried in the doctor s hand a handsome medicine case of black leather with small silver mountings further endorsed the guarantee of the card all right doctor said the officer stepping aside with an air of bulky affability orders are to be extra careful good many burglars and hold ups lately bad night to be out not so cold but clammy with a formal inclination of his head and a word or two corroborative of the officer s estimate of the weather doctor james continued his somewhat rapid progress three times that night had a patrolman accepted his professional card and the sight of his paragon of a medicine case as vouchers for his honesty of person and purpose had any one of those officers seen fit on the morrow to test the evidence of that card he would have found it borne out by the doctor s name on a handsome doorplate his presence calm and well dressed in his well equipped office provided it were not too early doctor james being a late riser and the testimony of the neighborhood to his good citizenship his devotion to his family and his success as a practitioner the two years he had lived among them therefore it would have much surprised any one of those zealous guardians of the peace could they have taken a peep into that immaculate medicine case upon opening it the first article to be seen would have been an elegant set of the latest conceived tools used by the box man as the ingenious safe burglar now denominates himself specially designed and constructed were the implements the short but powerful jimmy the collection of curiously fashioned keys the blued drills and punches of the finest temper capable of eating their way into chilled steel as a mouse eats into a cheese and the clamps that fasten like a leech to the polished door of a safe and pull out the combination knob as a dentist extracts a tooth in a little pouch in the inner side of the medicine case was a four ounce vial of nitroglycerine now half empty underneath the tools was a mass of crumpled banknotes and a few handfuls of gold coin the money altogether amounting to eight hundred and thirty dollars to a very limited circle of friends doctor james was known as the swell greek half of the mysterious term was a tribute to his cool and gentlemanlike manners the other half denoted in the argot of the brotherhood the leader the planner the one who by the power and prestige of his address and position secured the information upon which they based their plans and desperate enterprises of this elect circle the other members were skitsie morgan and gum decker expert box men and leopold pretzfelder a jeweller downtown who manipulated the sparklers and other ornaments collected by the working trio all good and loyal men as loose tongued as memnon and as fickle as the north star that night s work had not been considered by the firm to have yielded more than a moderate repayal for their pains an old style two story side bolt safe in the dingy office of a very wealthy old style dry goods firm on a saturday night should have excreted more than twenty five hundred dollars but that was all they found and they had divided it the three of them into equal shares upon the spot as was their custom ten or twelve thousand was what they expected but one of the proprietors had proved to be just a trifle too old style just after dark he had carried home in a shirt box most of the funds on hand doctor james proceeded up twenty fourth street which was to all appearance depopulated even the theatrical folk who affect this district as a place of residence were long since abed the drizzle had accumulated upon the street puddles of it among the stones received the fire of the arc lights and returned it shattered into a myriad liquid spangles a captious wind shower soaked and chilling coughed from the laryngeal flues between the houses as the practitioner s foot struck even with the corner of a tall brick residence of more pretension than its fellows the front door popped open and a bawling negress clattered down the steps to the pavement some medley of words came from her mouth addressed like as not to herself the recourse of her race when alone and beset by evil she looked to be one of that old vassal class of the south voluble familiar loyal irrepressible her person pictured it fat neat aproned kerchiefed this sudden apparition spewed from the silent house reached the bottom of the steps as doctor james came opposite her brain transferring its energies from sound to sight she ceased her clamor and fixed her pop eyes upon the case the doctor carried bress de lawd was the benison the sight drew from her is you a doctor suh yes i am a physician said doctor james pausing den fo god s sake come and see mister chandler suh he done had a fit or sump n he layin jist like he wuz dead miss amy sont me to

feet marked off on de ground and ev ybody a duellin and dat po lamb miss amy lead the way said doctor james setting his foot upon the step if you want me as a doctor as an auditor i m not open to engagements the negress preceded him into the house and up a flight of thickly carpeted stairs twice they came to dimly lighted branching hallways at the second one the now panting conductress turned down a hall stopping at a door and opening it i done brought de doctor miss amy doctor james entered the room and bowed slightly to a young lady standing by the side of a bed he set his medicine case upon a chair removed his overcoat throwing it over the case and the back of the chair an advanced with quiet self possession to the bedside there lay a man sprawling as he had fallen a man dressed richly in the prevailing mode with only his shoe removed lying relaxed and as still as the dead there emanated from doctor james an aura of calm force and reserve strength that was as manna in the desert to the weak and desolate among his patrons always had women especially been attracted by something in his sick room manner it was not the indulgent suavity of the fashionable healer but a manner of poise of sureness of ability to overcome fate of deference and protection and devotion there was an exploring magnetism in his steadfast luminous brown eves a latent authority in the impassive even priestly tranquillity of his smooth countenance that outwardly fitted him for the part of confidant and consoler sometimes at his first professional visit women would tell him where they hid their diamonds at night from the burglars with the ease of much practice doctor james s unroving eyes estimated the order and quality of the room s furnishings the appointments were rich and costly the same glance had secured cognizance of the lady s appearance she was small and scarcely past twenty her face possessed the title to a winsome prettiness now obscured by you would say rather a fixed melancholy than the more violent imprint of a sudden sorrow upon her forehead above one eyebrow was a livid bruise suffered the physician s eye told him within the past six hours doctor james s fingers went to the man s wrist his almost vocal eyes questioned the lady i am mrs chandler she responded speaking with the plaintive southern slur and intonation my husband was taken suddenly ill about ten minutes before you came he has had attacks of heart trouble before some of them were very bad his clothed state and the late hour seemed to prompt her to further explanation he had been out late to a supper i believe doctor james now turned his attention to his patient in whichever of his professions he happened to be engaged he was wont to honor the case or the job with his whole interest the sick man appeared to be about thirty his countenance bore a look of boldness and dissipation but was not without a symmetry of feature and the fine lines drawn by a taste and indulgence in humor that gave the redeeming touch there was an odor of spilled wine about his clothes the physician laid back his outer garments and then with a penknife slit the shirt front from collar to waist the obstacles cleared he laid his ear to the heart and listened intently mitral regurgitation he said softly when he rose the words ended with the rising inflection of uncertainty again he listened long and this time he said mitral insufficiency with the accent of an assured diagnosis madam he began in the reassuring tones that had so often allayed anxiety there is a probability as he slowly turned his head to face the lady he saw her fall white and swooning into the arms of the old negress po lamb po lamb has dey done killed aunt cindy s own blessed child may de lawd stroy wid his wrath dem what stole her away what break dat angel heart what left lift her feet said doctor james assisting to support the drooping form where is her room she must be put to bed in here suh the woman nodded her kerchiefed head toward a door dat s miss amy s room they carried her in there and laid her on the bed her pulse was faint but regular she passed from the swoon without recovering consciousness into a profound slumber she is quite exhausted said the physician sleep is a good remedy when she wakes give her a toddy with an egg in it if she can take it how did she get that bruise upon her forehead she done got a lick there suh de po lamb fell no suh the old woman s racial mutability swept her into a sudden flare of indignation old cindy ain t gwineter lie for dat debble he done it suh may de lawd wither de hand what dar now cindy promise her sweet lamb she ain t gwine tell miss amy got hurt suh on de head doctor james stepped to a stand where a handsome lamp burned and turned the flame low stay here with your mistress he ordered and keep quiet so she will sleep if she wakes give her the toddy if she grows any weaker let me know there is something strange about it dar s mo strange t ings dan dat round here began the negress but the physician hushed her in a seldom employed peremptory concentrated voice with which he had often allayed hysteria itself he returned to the other room closing the door softly behind him the man on the bed had not moved but his eyes were open his lips seemed to form words doctor james bent his head to listen the money the money was what they were whispering can you understand what i say asked the doctor speaking low but distinctly the head nodded slightly i am a physician sent for by your wife you are mr chandler i am told you are quite ill you must not excite or distress yourself at all the patient s eyes seemed to beckon to him the doctor stooped to catch the same faint words the money the twenty thousand dollars where is this money in the bank the eyes expressed a negative tell her the whisper was growing fainter the twenty thousand dollars her money his eyes wandered about the room you have placed this money somewhere doctor james s voice was toiling like a siren s to conjure the secret from the man s failing intelligence is it in this room he thought he saw a fluttering assent in the dimming eyes the pulse under his fingers was as fine and small as a silk thread there arose in doctor james s brain and heart the instincts of his other profession promptly as he acted in everything he decided to learn the whereabouts of this money and at the calculated and certain cost of a human life drawing from his pocket a little pad of prescription blanks he scribbled upon one of them a formula suited according to the best practice to the needs of the sufferer going to the door of the inner room he softly called the old woman gave her the prescription and bade her take it to some drug store and fetch the medicine when she had gone muttering to herself the doctor stepped to the bedside of the lady she still slept soundly her pulse was a little stronger her forehead was cool save where the inflammation of the bruise extended and a slight moisture covered it unless disturbed she would yet sleep for hours he found the key in the door and locked it after him when he returned doctor james looked at his watch he could call half an hour his own since before that time the old woman could scarcely return from her mission then he sought and found water in a pitcher and a glass tumbler opening his medicine case he took out the vial containing the nitroglycerine the oil as his brethren of the brace and bit term it one drop of the faint yellow thickish liquid he let fall in the tumbler he took out his silver hypodermic syringe case and screwed the needle into its place carefully measuring each modicum of water in the graduated glass barrel of the syringe he diluted the one drop with nearly half a tumbler of water two hours earlier that night doctor james had with that syringe injected the undiluted liquid into a hole drilled in the lock of a safe and had destroyed with one dull explosion the machinery that controlled the movement of the bolts he now purposed with the same means to shiver the prime machinery of a human being to rend its heart and each shock was for the sake of the money to follow the same means but in a different guise whereas that was the giant in its rude primary dynamic strength this was the courtier whose no less deadly arms were concealed by velvet and lace for the liquid in the tumbler and in the syringe that the physician carefully filled was now a solution of glonoin the most powerful heart stimulant known to medical science two ounces had riven the solid door of the iron safe with one fiftieth part of a minim he was now about to still forever the intricate mechanism of a human life but not immediately it was not so intended first there would be a quick increase of vitality a powerful impetus given to every organ and faculty the heart would respond bravely to the fatal spur the blood in the veins return more rapidly to its source but as doctor james well knew over stimulation in this form of heart disease means death as sure as by a rifle shot when the clogged arteries should suffer congestion from the increased flow of blood pumped into them by the power of the burglar s oil they would rapidly become no thoroughfare and the fountain of life would cease to flow the physician bared the chest of the unconscious chandler easily and skilfully he injected subcutaneously the contents of the syringe into the muscles of the region over the heart true to his neat habits in both professions he next carefully dried his needle and re inserted the fine wire that threaded it when not in use in three minutes chandler opened his eyes and spoke in a voice faint but audible inquiring who attended upon him doctor james again explained his presence there where is my wife asked the patient she is asleep from exhaustion and worry said the doctor i would not awaken her unless it isn t necessary chandler spoke with spaces between his words caused by his short breath that some demon was driving too fast she wouldn t thank you to disturb her on my account doctor james drew a chair to the bedside conversation must not be squandered a few minutes ago he began in the grave candid tones of his other profession you were trying to tell me something regarding some money i do not seek your confidence but it is my duty to advise you that anxiety and worry will work against your recovery if you have any communication to make about this to relieve your mind about this twenty thousand dollars i think was the amount you mentioned you would better do so chandler could not turn his head but he rolled his eyes in the direction of the speaker did i say where this money is no answered the physician i only inferred from your scarcely intelligible words that you felt a solicitude concerning its safety if it is in this room doctor james paused did he only seem to perceive a flicker of understanding a gleam of suspicion upon the ironical features of his patient had he seemed too eager had he said too much chandler s next words restored his confidence where should it be he gasped but in the safe there with his eyes he indicated a corner of the room where now for the first time the doctor perceived a small iron safe half concealed by the trailing end of a window curtain rising he took the sick man s wrist his pulse was beating in great throbs with ominous intervals between lift your arm said doctor james you know i can t move doctor the physician stepped swiftly to the hall door opened it and listened all was still without further circumvention he went to the safe and examined it of a primitive make and simple design it afforded little more security than protection against light fingered servants to his skill it was a mere toy a thing of straw and paste board the money was as good as in his hands with his clamps he could draw the knob punch the tumblers and open the door in two minutes perhaps in another way he might open it in one kneeling upon the floor he laid his ear to the combination plate and slowly turned the knob as he had surmised it was locked at only a day com upon one number his keen ear caught the faint warning click as the tumbler was disturbed he used the clue the handle turned he swung the door wide open the interior of the safe was bare not even a scrap of paper rested within the hollow iron cube doctor james rose to his feet and walked back to the bed a thick dew had formed upon the dying man s brow but there was a mocking grim smile on his lips and in his eyes i never saw it before he said painfully medicine and burglary wedded do you make the combination pay dear doctor than that situation afforded there was never a more rigorous test of doctor james s greatness trapped by the diabolic humor of his victim into a position both ridiculous and unsafe he maintained his dignity as well as his presence of mind taking out his watch he waited for the man to die you were just a shade too anxious about that money but it never was in any danger from you dear doctor it s safe perfectly safe it s all in the hands of the bookmakers twenty thousand amy s money i played it at the races lost every cent of it i ve been a pretty bad boy burglar excuse me doctor but i ve been a square sport i don t think i ever met such an eighteen carat rascal as you are doctor excuse me burglar in all my rounds is it contrary to the ethics of your gang burglar to give a victim excuse me patient a drink of water doctor james brought him a drink he could scarcely swallow it the reaction from the powerful drug was coming in regular intensifying waves but his moribund fancy must have one more grating fling gambler drunkard spendthrift i ve been those but a doctor burglar the physician indulged himself to but one reply to the other s caustic taunts bending low to catch chandler s fast crystallizing gaze he pointed to the sleeping lady s door with a gesture so stern and significant that the prostrate man half lifted his head with his remaining strength to see he saw nothing but he caught the cold words of the doctor the last sounds hie was to hear i never yet struck a woman it were vain to attempt to con such men there is no curriculum that can reckon with them in its ken thev are offshoots from the types whereof men say he will do this or he will do that we only know that they exist and that we can observe them and tell one another of their bare performances as children watch and speak of the marionettes yet it were a droll study in egoism to consider these two one an assassin and a robber standing above his victim the other baser in his offences if a lesser law breaker lying abhorred in the house of the wife he had persecuted spoiled and smitten one a tiger the other a dog wolf to consider each of them sickening at the foulness of the other and each flourishing out of the mire of his manifest guilt his own immaculate standard of conduct if not of honor the one retort of doctor james must have struck home to the other s remaining shreds of shame and manhood for it proved the coup de grace a deep blush suffused his face an ignominous rosa mortis the respiration ceased and with scarcely a tremor chandler expired close following upon his last breath came the negress bringing the medicine with a hand gently pressing upon the closed eyelids doctor james told her of the end not grief but a hereditary rapprochement with death in the abstract moved her to a dismal watery snuffling accompanied by her usual jeremiad dar now it s in de lawd s hands he am de jedge ob de transgressor and de suppo t of dem in distress he gwine hab suppo t us now cindy done paid out de last quarter fer dis bottle of physic and it nebber come to no use do i understand asked doctor james that mrs chandler has no money money suh you know what make miss amy fall down and so weak stahvation sub nothin to eat in dis house but some crumbly crackers in three days dat angel sell her finger rings and watch mont s ago dis fine house suh wid de red cyarpets and shiny bureaus it s all hired and de man talkin scan lous about de rent dat debble scuse me lawd he done in yo hands fer jedgment now he made way wid everything the physician s silence encouraged her to continue the history that he gleaned from cindy s disordered monologue was an old one of illusion wilfulness disaster cruelty and pride standing out from the blurred panorama of her gabble were little clear pictures an ideal home in the far south a quickly repented marriage an unhappy season full of wrongs and abuse and of late an inheritance of money that promised deliverance its seizure and waste by the dog wolf during a two months absence and his return in the midst of a scandalous carouse unobtruded but visible between every line ran a pure white thread through the smudged warp of the story the simple all enduring sublime love of the old negress following her mistress unswervingly through everything to the end when at last she paused the physician spoke asking if the house contained whiskey or liquor of any sort there was the old woman informed him half a bottle of brandy left in the sideboard by the dog wolf prepare a toddy as i told you said doctor james wake your mistress have her drink it and tell her what has happened some ten minutes afterward mrs chandler entered supported by old cindy s arm she appeared to be a little stronger since her sleep and the stimulant she had taken doctor james had covered with a sheet the form upon the bed the lady turned her mournful eyes once with a half frightened look toward it and pressed closer to her loyal protector her eyes were dry and bright sorrow seemed to have done its utmost with her the fount of tears was dried feeling itself paralyzed doctor james was standing near the table his overcoat donned his hat and medicine case in his hand his face was calm and impassive practice had inured him to the sight of human suffering his lambent brown eyes alone expressed a discreet professional sympathy he spoke kindly and briefly stating that as the hour was late and assistance no doubt difficult to procure he would himself send the proper persons to attend to the necessary finalities one matter in conclusion said the doctor pointing to the safe with its still wide open door your husband mrs chandler toward the end felt that he could not live and directed me to open that safe giving me the number upon which the combination is set in case you may need to use it you will remember that the number is forty one turn several times to the right then to the left once stop at forty one he would not permit me to waken you though he knew the end was near in that safe he said he had placed a sum of money not large but enough to enable you to carry out his last request that was that you should return to your old home and in after days when time shall have made it easier forgive his many sins against you he pointed to the table where lay an orderly pile of banknotes surmounted by two stacks of gold coins the money is there as he described it eight hundred and thirty dollars i beg to leave my card with you in case i can be of any service later on so he had thought of her and kindly at the last so late and yet the lie fanned into life one last spark of tenderness where she had thought all was turned to ashes and dust she cried aloud rob rob she turned and upon the ready bosom of her true servitor diluted her grief in relieving tears it is well to think also that in the years to follow the murderer s falsehood shone like a little star above the grave of love comforting her and gaining the forgiveness that is good in itself whether asked for or no hushed and soothed upon the dark bosom like a child by a crooning babbling sympathy at last she raised her head but the doctor was gone the marquis and miss sally originally published in everybody s magazine june without knowing it old bill bascom had the honor of being overtaken by fate the same day with the marquis of borodale the marquis lived in regent square london old bill lived on limping doe creek hardeman county texas the cataclysm that engulfed the marquis took the form of a bursting bubble known as the central and south american mahogany and caoutchouc monopoly old bill s nemesis was in the no less perilous shape of a band of civilized indian cattle thieves from the territory who ran off his entire herd of four hundred head and shot old bill dead as he trailed after them to even up the consequences of the two catastrophes the marquis as soon as he found that all he possessed would pay only fifteen shillings on the pound of his indebtedness shot himself old bill left a family of six motherless sons and daughters who found themselves without even a red steer left to eat or a red cent to buy one with the marquis left one son a young man who had come to the states and established a large and well stocked ranch in the panhandle of texas when this young man learned the news he mounted his pony and rode to town there he placed everything he owned except his horse saddle winchester and fifteen dollars in his pockets in the hands of his lawyers with instructions to sell and forward the proceeds to london to be applied upon the payment of his father s debts then he mounted his pony and rode southward one day arriving about the same time but by different trails two young chaps rode up to the diamond cross ranch on the little piedra and asked for work both were dressed neatly and sprucely in cowboy costume one was a straight set fellow with delicate handsome features short brown hair and smooth face sunburned to a golden brown the other applicant was stouter and broad shouldered with fresh red complexion somewhat freckled reddish curling hair and a rather plain face made attractive by laughing eyes and a pleasant mouth the superintendent of the diamond cross was of the opinion that he could give them work in fact word had reached him that morning that the camp cook a most important member of the outfit had straddled his broncho and departed being unable to withstand the fire of fun and practical jokes of which he was ex officio the legitimate target can either of you cook asked the superintendent i can said the reddish haired fellow promptly i ve cooked in camp quite a lot i m willing to take the job until you ve got something else to offer now that s the way i like to hear a man talk said the superintendent approvingly i ll give you a note to saunders and he ll put you to work thus the names of john bascom and charles norwood were added to the pay roll of the diamond cross the two left for the round up camp immediately after dinner their directions were simple but sufficient keep down the arroyo for fifteen miles till you get there both being strangers from afar young spirited and thus thrown together by chance for a long ride it is likely that the comradeship that afterward existed so strongly between them began that afternoon as they meandered along the little valley of the canada verda they reached their destination just after sunset the main camp of the round up was comfortably located on the bank of a long water hole under a fine mott of timber a number of small a tents pitched upon grassy spots and the big wall tent for provisions showed that the camp was intended to be occupied for a considerable length of time the round up had ridden in but a few moments before hungry and tired to a supperless camp the boys were engaged in an emulous display of anathemas supposed to fit the case of the absconding cook while they were unsaddling and hobbling their ponies the newcomer rode in and inquired for pink saunders the boss ol the round up came forth and was given the superintendent s note pink saunders though a boss during working hours was a humorist in camp where everybody from cook to superintendent is equal after reading the note he waved his hand toward the camp and shouted ceremoniously at the top of his voice gentlemen allow me to present to you the marquis and miss sally at the words both the new arrivals betray confusion the newly employed cook started with a surprised look on his face but immediately recollecting that miss sally is the generic name for the male cook in every west texas cow camp he recovered his composure with a grin at his own expense his companion showed little less discomposure even turning angrily with a bitten lip and reaching for his saddle pommel as if to remount his pony but miss sally touched his arm and said laughingly come now marquis that was quite a compliment from saunders it s that distinguished air of yours and aristocratic nose that made him call you that he began to unsaddle and the marquis restored to equanimity followed his example rolling up his sleeves miss sally sprang for the grub wagon shouting i m the new cook b thunder some of you chaps rustle a little wood for a fire and i ll guarantee you a hot square meal inside of thirty minutes miss sally s energy and good humor as he ransacked the grub wagon for coffee flour and bacon won the good opinion of the camp instantly and also in days following the marquis after becoming better acquainted proved to be a cheerful pleasant fellow always a little reserved and taking no part in the rough camp frolics but the boys gradually came to respect this reserve which fitted the title saunders had given him and even to like him for it saunders had assigned him to a place holding the herd during the cuttings he proved to be a skilful rider and as good with the lariat or in the branding pen as most of them the marquis and miss sally grew to be quite close comrades after supper was over and everything cleaned up you would generally find them together miss sally smoking his brier root pipe and the marquis plaiting a quirt or scraping rawhide for a new pair of hobbles the superintendent did not forget his promise to keep an eye on the cook several times when visiting the camp he held long talks with him he seemed to have taken a fancy to miss sally one afternoon he rode up on his way back to the ranch from a tour of the camps and said to him there ll be a man here in the morning to take your place as soon as he shows up you come to the ranch i want you to take charge of the ranch accounts and correspondence i want somebody that i can depend upon to keep things straight when i m away the wages ll be all right the diamond cross ll hold its end up with a man who ll look after its interests all right said miss sally as quietly as if he had expected the notice all along any objections to my bringing my wife down to the ranch you married said the superintendent frowning a little you didn t mention it when we were talking because i m not said the cook but i d like to be thought i d wait till i got a job under roof i couldn t ask her to live in a cow camp right agreed the superintendent a camp isn t quite the place for a married man but well there s plenty of room at the house and if you suit us as well as i think you will you can afford it you write to her to come on all right said miss sally again i ll ride in as soon as i am relieved to morrow it was a rather chilly night and after supper the cow punchers were lounging about a big fire of dried mesquite chunks their usual exchange of jokes and repartee had dwindled almost to silence but silence in a cow camp generally betokens the brewing of mischief miss sally and the marquis were seated upon a log discussing the relative merits of the lengthened or shortened stirrup in long distance riding the marquis arose presently and went to a tree near by to examine some strips of rawhide he was seasoning for making a lariat just as he left a little puff of wind blew some scraps of tobacco from a cigarette that dry creek smithers was rolling into miss sally s eyes while the cook was rubbing at them with tears flowing phonograph davis so called on account of his strident voice arose and began a speech fellers and citizens i desire to perpound a interrogatory what is the most grievous spectacle what the human mind can contemplate a volley of answers responded to his question a busted flush a maverick when you ain t got your branding iron yourself the hole in the end of some other feller s gun shet up you ignoramuses said old taller the fat cow puncher phony knows what it is he s waitin for to tell us no fellers and citizens continued phonograph them spectacles you ve e numerated air shore grievious and way up yonder close to the so lution but they ain t it the most grievious spectacle air that he pointed to miss sally who was still rubbing his streaming eyes a trustin and a in veegled female a weepin tears on account of her heart bein busted by a false deceiver air we men or air we catamounts to gaze upon the blightin of our miss sally s affections by a a risto crat which has come among us with his superior beauty and his glitterin title to give the weeps to the lovely critter we air bound to pertect air we goin to act like men or air we goin to keep on eaten soggy chuck from her cryin so plentiful over the bread pan it s a gallopin shame said dry creek with a sniffle it ain t human i ve noticed the varmint a palaverin round her frequent and him a marquis ain t that a title phony it s somethin like a king the brushy creek kid hastened to explain only lower in the deck guess it comes in between the jack and the ten spot don t miscontruct me went on phonograph as undervaluatin the a ristocrats some of em air proper people and can travel right along with the watson boys i ve herded some with em myself i ve viewed the elephant with the mayor of fort worth and i ve listened to the owl with the gen ral passenger agent of the katy and they can keep up with the percession from where you laid the chunk but when a marquis monkeys with the innocent affections of a cook lady may i inquire what the case seems to call for the leathers shouted dry creek smithers you hearn er charity was the kid s form of corroboration we ve got your company assented the cow punchers in chorus before the marquis realized their intention two of them seized him by each arm and led him up to the log phonograph davis self appointed to carry out the sentence stood ready with a pair of stout leather leggings in his hands it was the first time they had ever laid hands on the marquis during their somewhat rude sports what are you up to he asked indignantly with flashing eyes go easy marquis whispered rube fellows one of the boys that held him it s all in fun take it good natured and they ll let you off light they re only goin to stretch you over the log and tan you eight or ten times with the leggin s twon t hurt much the marquis with an exclamation of anger his white teeth gleaming suddenly exhibited a surprising strength he wrenched with his arms so violently that the four men were swayed and dragged many yards from the log a cry of anger escaped him and then miss sally his eyes cleared of the tobacco saw and he immediately mixed with the struggling group but at that moment a loud hallo rang in their ears and a buckboard drawn by a team of galloping mustangs spun into the campfire s circle of light every man turned to look and what they saw drove from their minds all thoughts of carrying out phonograph davis s rather time worn contribution to the evening s amusement bigger game than the marquis was at hand and his captors released him and stood staring at the approaching victim the buckboard and team belonged to sam holly a cattleman from the big muddy sam was driving and with him was a stout smooth faced man wearing a frock coat and a high silk hat that was the county judge mr dave hackett candidate for reelection sam was escorting him about the county among the camps to shake up the sovereign voters the men got out hitched the team to a mesquite and walked toward the fire instantly every man in camp except the marquis miss sally and pink saunders who had to play host uttered a frightful yell of assumed terror and fled on all sides into the darkness heavens alive exclaimed hackett are we as ugly as that how do you do mr saunders glad to see you again what are you doing to my hat holly i was afraid of this hat said sam holly meditatively he had taken the hat from hackett s head and was holding it in his hand looking dubiously around at the shadows beyond the firelight where now absolute stillness reigned what do you think saunders pink grinned better elevate it some he said in the tone of one giving disinterested advice the light ain t none too good i wouldn t want it on my head holly stepped upon the hub of a hind wheel of the grub wagon and hung the hat upon a limb of a live oak scarcely had his foot touched the ground when the crash of a dozen six shooters split the air and the hat fell to the ground riddled with bullets a hissing noise was heard as if from a score of rattlesnakes and now the cow punchers emerged on all sides from the darkness stepping high with ludicrously exaggerated caution and hist ing to one another to observe the utmost prudence in approaching they formed a solemn wide circle about the hat gazing at it in manifest alarm and seized every few moments by little stampedes of panicky flight it s the varmint said one in awed tones that flits up and down in the low grounds at night saying willie wallo it s the venomous kypootum proclaimed another it stings after it s dead and hollers after it s buried it s the chief of the hairy tribe said phonograph davis but it s stone dead now boys don t you believe it demurred dry creek it s only possumin it s the dreaded highgollacum fantod from the forest there s only one way to destroy its life he led forward old taller the pound cow puncher old taller placed the hat upright on the ground and solemnly sat upon it crushing it as flat as a pancake hackett had viewed these proceedings with wide open eyes sam holly saw that his anger was rising and said to him here s where you win or lose judge there are sixty votes on the diamond cross the boys are trying your mettle take it as a joke and i don t think you ll regret it and hackett saw the point and rose to the occasion advancing to where the slayers of the wild beast were standing above its remains and declaring it to be at last defunct he said with deep earnestness boys i must thank you for this gallant rescue while driving through the arroyo that cruel monster that you have so fearlessly and repeatedly slaughtered sprang upon us from the tree tops to you i shall consider that i owe my life and also i hope reelection to the office for which i am again a candidate allow me to hand you my card the cow punchers always so sober faced while engaged in their monkey shines relaxed into a grin of approval but phonograph davis his appetite for fun not yet appeased had something more up his sleeve pardner he said addressing hackett with grave severity many a camp would be down on you for turnin loose a pernicious varmint like that in it but bein as we all escaped without loss of life we ll overlook it you can play square with us if you ll do it how s that asked hackett suspiciously you re authorized to perform the sacred rights and lefts of mattermony air you not well yes replied hackett a marriage ceremony conducted by me would be legal a wrong air to be righted in this here camp said phonograpby virtuously a a ristocrat have slighted a umble but beautchoos female wat s pinin for his affections it s the jooty of the camp to drag forth the haughty descendant of a hundred or maybe a hundred and twenty five earls even so at the p int of a lariat and jine him to the weepin lady fellows roundup miss sally and the marquis there s goin to be a weddin this whim of phonograph s was received with whoops of appreciation the cow punchers started to apprehend the principals of the proposed ceremony kindly prompt me said hackett wiping his forehead though the night was cool how far this thing is to be carried and might i expect any further portions of my raiment to be mistaken for wild animals and killed the boys are livelier than usual to night said saunders the ones they are talking about marrying are two of the boys a herd rider and the cook it s another joke you and sam will have to sleep here to night anyway p rhaps you d better see em through with it maybe they ll quiet down after that the matchmakers found miss sally seated on the tongue of the grub wagon calmly smoking his pipe the marquis was leaning idly against one of the trees under which the supply tent was pitched into this tent they were both hustled and phonograph as master of ceremonies gave orders for the preparations you dry creek and jimmy and ben and taller hump yourselves to the wildwood and rustle flowers for the blow out mesquite ll do and get that spanish dagger blossom at the corner of the horse corral for the bride to pack you limpy get out that red and yaller blanket of your n for miss sally s skyirt marquis you ll do thout fixin nobody don t ever look at the groom during their absurd preparation the two principals were left alone for a few moments in the tent the marquis suddenly showed wild perturbation this foolishness must not go on he said turning to miss sally a face white in the light of the lantern hanging to the ridge pole why not said the cook with an amused smile it s fun for the boys and they ve always let you off pretty light in their frolics i don t mind it but you don t understand persisted the marquis pleadingly that man is county judge and his acts are binding i can t oh you don t know the cook stepped forward and took the marquis s hands sally bascom he said i know you know faltered the marquis trembling and you want to more than i ever wanted anything will you here come the boys

upon the bride s appearance in a supposed imitation of the audiences at fashionable weddings hackett rose as the procession halted before him and after a little lecture upon matrimony asked what are your names sally and charles answered the cook join hands charles and sally perhaps there never was a stranger wedding for wedding it was though only two of those present knew it when the ceremony was over the cow punchers gave one yell of congratulation and immediately abandoned their foolery for the night blankets were unrolled and sleep became the paramount question the cook divested of his

mist had swept upon santone that night an opaque terror that laid a hand to the throat of each of the city s guests it was computed that three thousand invalids were hibernating in the town they had come from far and wide for here among these contracted river sliced streets the goddess ozone has elected to linger purest atmosphere sir on earth you might think from the river winding through our town that we are malarial but no sir repeated experiments made both by the government and local experts show that our air contains nothing deleterious nothing but ozone sir pure ozone litmus paper

cannot be blamed for this cold gray fog that came and kissed the lips of the three thousand and then delivered them to the cross that night the tubercles whose ravages hope holds in check multiplied the writhing fingers of the pale mist did not go thence bloodless many of the wooers of ozone capitulated with the enemy that night turning their faces to the wall in that dumb isolated apathy that so terrifies their watchers on the red stream of hemorrhagia a few souls drifted away leaving behind pathetic heaps white and chill as the fog itself two or three came to view this atmospheric wraith as the ghost of impossible joys sent to whisper to them of the egregious folly it is to inhale breath into the lungs only to exhale it again and these used whatever came handy to their relief pistols gas or the beneficent muriate the purchaser of the morphia wanders into the fog and at length finds himself upon a little iron bridge one of the score or more in the heart of the city under which the

they leave the saloon and plunge again into the mist the sidewalks are mere flanges at the base of the houses the street a cold ravine the fog filling it like a freshet not far away is the mexican

thus goodall s tempter deserts him that youth un complaining and uncaring takes a spell at coughing and recovered wanders desultorily on down the street the name of which he neither knows nor recks at a certain point he perceives swinging doors and hears filtering between them a noise of wind and string instruments two men enter from the street as he arrives and he follows them in there is a kind of ante chamber plentifully set with palms and cactuses and oleanders at little marble topped tables some people sit while soft shod attendants bring the beer all is orderly clean melancholy gay of the german method of pleasure at his right is the foot of a stairway a man there holds out his hand goodall extends his full of silver the man selects therefrom a coin goodall goes upstairs and sees there two galleries extending along the sides of a concert hall which he now perceives to lie below and beyond the anteroom he first entered these galleries are divided into boxes or stalls which bestow with the aid of hanging lace curtains a certain privacy upon their occupants passing with aimless feet down the aisle contiguous to these saucy and discreet compartments he is half checked by the sight in one of them of a young woman alone and seated in an attitude of reflection this young woman becomes aware of his approach a smile from her brings him to a standstill and her subsequent invitation draws him though hesitating to the other chair in the box a little table between them goodall is only nineteen there are some whom when the terrible god phthisis wishes to destroy be first makes beautiful and the boy is one of these his face is wax and an awful pulchritude is born of the menacing flame in his cheeks his eyes reflect an unearthly vista engendered by the certainty of his doom as it is forbidden man to guess accurately concerning his fate it is inevitable that he shall tremble at the slightest lifting of the veil the young woman is well dressed and exhibits a beauty of distinctly feminine and tender sort an eve like comeliness that scarcely seems predestined to fade it is immaterial the steps by which the two mount to a certain plane of good understanding they are short and few as befits the occasion a button against the wall of the partition is frequently disturbed and a waiter comes and goes at signal pensive beauty would nothing of wine two thick plaits of her blond hair hang almost to the floor she is a lineal descendant of the lorelei so the waiter brings the brew effervescent icy greenish golden the orchestra on the stage is playing oh rachel the youngsters have exchanged a good bit of information she calls him walter and he calls her miss rosa goodall s tongue is loosened and he has told her everything about himself about his home in tennessee the old pillared mansion under the oaks the stables the hunting the friends he has down to the chickens and the box bushes bordering the walks about his coming south for the climate hoping to escape the hereditary foe of his family all about his three months on a ranch the deer hunts the rattlers and the rollicking in the cow camps then of his advent to santone where he had indirectly learned from a great specialist that his life s calendar probably contains but two more leaves and then of this death white choking night which has come and strangled his fortitude and sent him out to seek a port amid its depressing billows my weekly letter from home failed to come he told her and i was pretty blue i knew i had to go before long and i was tired of waiting i went out and bought morphine at every drug store where they would sell me a few tablets i got thirty six quarter grains and was going back to my room and take them but i met a queer fellow on a bridge who had a new idea goodall fillips a little pasteboard box upon the table i put em all together in there miss rosa being a woman must raise the lid and gave a slight shiver at the innocent looking triturates horrid things but those little white bits they could never kill one indeed they could walter knew better nine grains of morphia why half the amount might miss rosa demands to know about mr hurd of toledo and is told she laughs like a delighted child what a funny fellow but tell me more about your home and your sisters walter i know enough about texas and tarantulas and cowboys the theme is dear just now to his mood and he lays before her the simple details of a true home the little ties and endearments that so fill the exile s heart of his sisters one alice furnishes him a theme he loves to dwell upon she is like you miss rosa he says maybe not quite so pretty but just as nice and good and there walter says miss rosa sharply now talk about something else but a shadow falls upon the wall outside preceding a big softly treading man finely dressed who pauses a second before the curtains and then passes on presently comes the waiter with a message mr rolfe says tell rolfe i m engaged i don t know why it is says goodall of memphis but i don t feel as bad as i did an hour ago i wanted to die but since i ve met you miss rosa i d like so much to live the young woman whirls around the table lays an arm behind his neck and kisses him on the cheek you must dear boy she says i know what was the matter it was the miserable foggy weather that has lowered your spirit and mine too a little but look now with a little spring she has drawn back the curtains a window is in the wall opposite and lo the mist is cleared away the indulgent moon is out again revoyaging the plumbless sky roof and parapet and spire are softly pearl enamelled twice thrice the retrieved river flashes back between the houses the light of the firmament a tonic day will dawn sweet and prosperous talk of death when the world is so beautiful says miss rosa laying her hand on his shoulder do something to please me walter go home to your rest and say i mean to get better and do it if you ask it says the boy with a smile i will the waiter brings full glasses did they ring no but it is well he may leave them a farewell glass miss rosa says to your better health walter he says to our next meeting his eyes look no longer into the void but gaze upon the antithesis of death his foot is set in an undiscovered country to night he is obedient ready to go good night she says i never kissed a girl before he confesses except my sisters you didn t this time she laughs i kissed you good night when shall i see you again he persists you promised me to go home she frowns and get well perhaps we shall meet again soon good night he hesitates his hat in hand she smiles broadly and kisses him once more upon the forehead she watches him far down the aisle then sits again at the table the shadow falls once more against the wall this time the big softly stepping man parts the curtains and looks in miss rosa s eyes meet his and for half a minute they remain thus silent fighting a battle with that king of weapons presently the big man drops the curtains and passes on the orchestra ceases playing suddenly and an important voice can be heard loudly talking in one of the boxes farther down the aisle no doubt some citizen entertains there some visitor to the town and miss rosa leans back in her chair and smiles at some of the words she catches purest atmosphere in the world litmus paper all long nothing hurtful our city nothing but pure ozone the waiter returns for the tray and glasses as he enters the girl crushes a little empty pasteboard box in her hand and throws it in a corner she is stirring something in her glass with her hatpin why miss rosa says the waiter with the civil familiarity he uses putting salt in your beer this early in the night the friendly call published in monthly magazine section july when i used to sell hardware in the west i often made a little town called saltillo in colorado i was always certain of securing a small or a large order from simon bell who kept a general store there bell was one of those six foot low voiced products formed from a union of the west and the south i liked him to look at him you would think he should be robbing stage coaches or juggling gold mines with both hands but he would sell you a paper of tacks or a spool of thread with ten times more patience and courtesy than any saleslady in a city department store i had a twofold object in my last visit to saltillo one was to sell a bill of goods the other to advise bell of a chance that i knew of by which i was certain he could make a small fortune in mountain city a town on the union pacific five times larger than saltillo a mercantile firm was about to go to the wall it had a lively and growing custom but was on the edge of dissolution and ruin mismanagement and the gambling habits of one of the partners explained it the condition of the firm was not yet public property i had my knowledge of it from a private source i knew that if the ready cash were offered the stock and good will could be bought for about one fourth their value on arriving in saltillo i went to bell s store he nodded to me smiled his broad lingering smile went on leisurely selling some candy to a little girl then came around the counter and shook hands well he said his invariably preliminary jocosity fit every call i made i suppose you are out here making kodak pictures of the mountains it s the wrong time of the year to buy any hardware of course i told bell about the bargain in mountain city if he wanted to take advantage of it i would rather have missed a sale than have him overstocked in saltillo it sounds good he said with enthusiasm i d like to branch out and do a bigger business and i m obliged to you for mentioning it but well you come and stay at my house to night and i ll think about it it was then after sundown and time for the larger stores in saltillo to close the clerks in bell s put away their books whirled the combination of the safe put on their coats and hats and left for their homes bell padlocked the big double wooden front doors and we stood for a moment breathing the keen fresh mountain air coming across the foothills a big man walked down the street and stopped in front of the high porch of the store his long black moustache black eyebrows and curly black hair contrasted queerly with his light pink complexion which belonged by rights to a blonde he was about forty and wore a white vest a white hat a watch chain made of five dollar gold pieces linked together and a rather well fitting two piece gray suit of the cut that college boys of eighteen are wont to affect he glanced at me distrustfully and then at bell with coldness and i thought something of enmity in his expression well asked bell as if he were addressing a stranger did you fix up that matter did i the man answered in a resentful tone what do you suppose i ve been here two weeks for the business is to be settled to night does that suit you or have you got something to kick about it s all right said bell i knew you d do it of course you did said the magnificent stranger haven t i done it before you have admitted bell and so have i how do you find it at the hotel rocky grub but i ain t kicking say can you give me any pointers about managing that affair it s my first deal in that line of business you know no i can t answered bell after some thought i ve tried all kinds of ways you ll have to try some of your own tried soft soap barrels of it tried a saddle girth with a buckle on the end of it never none started to once and here s what i got bill held out his right hand even in the deepening twilight i could see on the back of it a long white scar that might have been made by a claw or a knife or some sharp edged tool oh well said the florid man carelessly i ll know what to do later on he walked away without another word when he had gone ten steps he turned and called to bell you keep well out of the way when the goods are delivered so there won t be any hitch in the business all right answered bell i ll attend to my end of the line this talk was scarcely clear in its meaning to me but as it did not concern me i did not let it weigh upon my mind but the singularity of the other man s appearance lingered with me for a while and as we walked toward bell s house i remarked to him your customer seems to be a surly kind of fellow not one that you d like to be snowed in with in a camp on a hunting trip he is that assented bell heartily he reminds me of a rattlesnake that s been poisoned by the bite of a tarantula he doesn t look like a citizen of saltillo i went on no said bell he lives in sacramento he s down here on a little business trip his name is george ringo and he s been my best friend in fact the only friend i ever had for twenty years i was too surprised to make any further comment bell lived in a comfortable plain square two story white house on the edge of the little town i waited in the parlor a room depressingly genteel furnished with red plush straw matting looped up lace curtains and a glass case large enough to contain a mummy full of mineral specimens while i waited i heard upstairs that unmistakable sound instantly recognized the world over a bickering woman s voice rising as her anger and fury grew i could hear between the gusts the temperate rumble of bell s tones striving to oil the troubled waters the storm subsided soon but not before i had heard the woman say in a lower concentrated tone rather more carrying than her high pitched railings this is the last time i tell you the last time oh you will understand the household seemed to consist of only bell and his wife and a servant or two i was introduced to mrs bell at supper at first sight she seemed to be a handsome woman but i soon perceived that her charm had been spoiled an uncontrolled petulance i thought and emotional egotism an absence of poise and a habitual dissatisfaction had marred her womanhood during the meal she showed that false gayety spurious kindliness and reactionary softness that mark the woman addicted to tantrums withal she was a woman who might be attractive to many men after supper bell and i took our chairs outside set them on the grass in the moonlight and smoked the full moon is a witch in her light truthful men dig up for you nuggets of purer gold while liars squeeze out brighter colors from the tubes of their invention i saw bell s broad slow smile come out upon his face and linger there i reckon you think george and me are a funny kind of friends he said the fact is we never did take much interest in each other s company but his idea and mine of what a friend should be was always synonymous and we lived up to it strict all these years now i ll give you an idea of what our idea is a man don t need but one friend the fellow who drinks your liquor and hangs around you slapping you on the back and taking up your time telling you how much he likes you ain t a friend even if you did play marbles at school and fish in the same creek with him as long as you don t need a friend one of that kind may answer but a friend to my mind is one you can deal with on a strict reciprocity basis like me and george have always done a good many years ago him and me was connected in a number of ways we put our capital together and run a line of freight wagons in new mexico and we mined some and gambled a few and then we got into trouble of one or two kinds and i reckon that got us on a better understandable basis than anything else did unless it was the fact that we never had much personal use for each other s ways george is the vainest man i ever see and the biggest brag he could blow the biggest geyser in the yosemite valley back into its hole with one whisper i am a quiet man and fond of studiousness and thought the more we used to see each other personally the less we seemed to like to be together if he ever had slapped me on the back and snivelled over me like i ve seen men do to what they called their friends i know i d have had a rough and tumble with him on the spot same way with george he hated my ways as bad as i did his when we were mining we lived in separate tents so as not to intrude our obnoxiousness on each other but after a long time we begun to know each of us could depend on the other when we were in a pinch up to his last dollar word of honor or perjury bullet or drop of blood we had in the world we never even spoke of it to each other because that would have spoiled it but we tried it out time after time until we came to know i ve grabbed my hat and jumped a freight and rode miles to identify him when he was about to be hung by mistake in idaho for a train robber once i laid sick of typhoid in a tent in texas without a dollar or a change of clothes and sent for george in boise city he came on the next train the first thing he did before speaking to me was to hang up a little looking glass on the side of the tent and curl his moustache and rub some hair dye on his head his hair is naturally a light reddish then he gave me the most scientific cussing i ever had and took off his coat if you wasn t a moses meek little mary s lamb you wouldn t have been took down this way says he haven t you got gumption enough not to drink swamp water or fall down and scream whenever you have a little colic or feel a mosquito bite you he made me a little mad you ve got the bedside manners of a piute medicine man says i and i wish you d go away and let me die a natural death i m sorry i sent for you i ve a mind to says george for nobody cares whether you live or die but now i ve been tricked into coming i might as well stay until this little attack of indigestion or nettle rash or whatever it is passes away two weeks afterward when i was beginning to get around again the doctor laughed and said he was sure that my friend s keeping me mad all the time did more than his drugs to cure me so that s the way george and me was friends there wasn t any sentiment about it it was just give and take and each of us knew that the other was ready for the call at any time i remember once i played a sort of joke on george just to try him i felt a little mean about it afterward because i never ought to have doubted he d do it we was both living in a little town in the san luis valley running some flocks of sheep and a few cattle we were partners but as usual we didn t live together i had an old aunt out from the east visiting for the summer so i rented a little cottage she soon had a couple of cows and some pigs and chickens to make the place look like home george lived alone in a little cabin half a mile out of town one day a calf that we had died that night i broke its bones dumped it into a coarse sack and tied it up with wire i put on an old shirt tore a sleeve most out of it and the collar half off tangled up my hair put some red ink on my hands and spashed some of it over my shirt and face i must have looked like i d been having the fight of my life i put the sack in a wagon and drove out to george s cabin when i halloed he came out in a yellow dressing gown a turkish cap and patent leather shoes george always was a great dresser i dumped the bundle to the ground sh sh says i kind of wild in my way take that and bury it george out somewhere behind your house bury it just like it is and don don t get excited says george and for the lord s sake go and wash your hands and face and put on a clean shirt and he lights his pipe while i drive away at a gallop the next morning he drops around to our cottage where my aunt was fiddling with her flowers and truck in the front yard he bends himself and bows and makes compliments as be could do when so disposed and begs a rose bush from her saying he had turned up a little land back of his cabin and wanted to plant something on it by way of usefulness and ornament so my aunt flattered pulls up one of her biggest by the roots and gives it to him afterward i see it growing where he planted it in a place where the grass had been cleared off and the dirt levelled but neither george nor me ever spoke of it to each other again the moon rose higher possibly drawing water from the sea pixies from their dells and certainly more confidences from simms bell the friend of a friend there come a time not long afterward he went on when i was able to do a good turn for george ringo george had made a little pile of money in beeves and he was up in denver and he showed up when i saw him wearing deer skin vests yellow shoes clothes like the awnings in front of drug stores and his hair dyed so blue that it looked black in the dark he wrote me to come up there quick that he needed me and to bring the best outfit of clothes i had i had em on when i got the letter so i left on the next train george was bell stopped for half a minute listening intently i thought i heard a team coming down the road he explained george was at a summer resort on a lake near denver and was putting on as many airs as he knew how he had rented a little two room cottage and had a chihauhau dog and a hammock and eight different kinds of walking sticks simms he says to me there s a widow woman here that s pestering the soul out of me with her intentions i can t get out of her way it ain t that she ain t handsome and agreeable in a sort of style but her attentions is serious and i ain t ready for to marry nobody and settle down i can t go to no festivity nor sit on the hotel piazza or mix in any of the society round ups but what she cuts me out of the herd and puts her daily brand on me i like this here place goes on george and i m making a hit here in the most censorious circles so i don t want to have to run away from it so i sent for you what do you want me to do i asks george why says he i want you to head her off i want you to cut me out i want you to come to the rescue suppose you seen a wildcat about for to eat me what would you do go for it says i correct says george then go for this mrs de clinton the same how am i to do it i asks by force and awfulness or in some gentler and less lurid manner court her george says get her off my trail feed her take her out in boats hang around her and stick to her get her mashed on you if you can some women are pretty big fools who knows but what she might take a fancy to you had you ever thought i asks of repressing your fatal fascinations in her presence of squeezing a harsh note in the melody of your siren voice of veiling your beauty in other words of giving her the bounce yourself george sees no essence of sarcasm in my remark he twists his moustache and looks at the points of his shoes well simms he said you know how i am about the ladies i can t hurt none of their feelings i m by nature polite and esteemful of their intents and purposes this mrs de clinton don t appear to be the suitable sort for me besides i ain t a marrying man by all means all right said i i ll do the best i can in the case so i bought a new outfit of clothes and a book on etiquette and made a dead set for mrs de clinton she was a fine looking woman cheerful and gay at first i almost had to hobble her to keep her from loping around at george s heels but finally i got her so she seemed glad to go riding with me and sailing on the lake and she seemed real hurt on the mornings when i forgot to send her a bunch of flowers still i didn t like the way she looked at george sometimes out of the corner of her eye george was having a fine time now going with the whole bunch just as he pleased yes m continued bell she certainly was a fine looking woman at that time she s changed some since as you might have noticed at the supper table what i exclaimed i married mrs de clinton went on bell one evening while we were up at the lake when i told george about it he opened his mouth and i thought be was going to break our traditions and say something grateful but he swallowed it back all right says he playing with his dog i hope you won t have too much trouble myself i m not never going to marry that was three years ago said bell we came here to live for a year we got along medium fine and then everything changed for two years i ve been having something that rhymes first class with my name you heard the row upstairs this evening that was a merry welcome compared to the usual average she s tired of me and of this little town life and she rages all day like a panther in a cage i stood it until two weeks ago and then i had to send out the call i located george in sacramento he started the day he got my wire mrs bell came out of the house swiftly toward us some strong excitement or anxiety seemed to possess her but she smiled a faint hostess smile and tried to keep her voice calm the dew is falling she said and it s growing rather late wouldn t you gentlemen rather come into the house bell took some cigars from his pocket and answered it s most too fine a night to turn in yet i think mr ames and i will walk out along the road a mile or so and have another smoke i want to talk with him about some goods that i want to buy up the road or down the road asked mrs bell down said bell i thought she breathed a sigh of relief when we had gone a hundred yards and the house became concealed by trees bell guided me into the thick grove that lined the road and back through them toward the house again we stopped within twenty yards of the house concealed by the dark shadows i wondered at this maneuver and then i heard in the distance coming down the road beyond the house the regular hoofbeats of a team of horses bell held his watch in a ray of moonlight on time within a minute he said that s george s way the team slowed up as it drew near the house and stopped in a patch of black shadows we saw the figure of a woman carrying a heavy valise move swiftly from the other side of the house and hurry to the waiting vehicle then it rolled away briskly in the direction from which it had come i looked at bell inquiringly i suppose i certainly asked him no question she s running away with george said bell simply he s kept me posted about the progress of the scheme all along she ll get a divorce in six months and then george will marry her he never helps anybody halfway it s all arranged between them i began to wonder what friendship was after all when we went into the house bell began to talk easily on other subjects and i took his cue by and by the big chance to buy out the business in mountain city came back to my mind and i began to urge it upon him now that he was free it would be easier for him to make the move and he was sure of a splendid bargain bell was silent for some minutes but when i looked at him i fancied that he was thinking of something else that he was not considering the project why no mr ames he said after a while i can t make that deal i m awful thankful to you though for telling me about it but i ve got to stay here

a satchel and catch the first train for george will be sending out the call a dinner at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the story referred to in this skit appears in the trimmed lamp under the same title the badge of policeman o roon the adventures of an author with his own hero all that day in fact from the moment of his creation van sweller had conducted himself fairly well in my eyes of course i had had to make many concessions but in return he had been no less considerate once or twice we had had sharp brief contentions over certain points of behavior but prevailingly give and take had been our rule his morning toilet provoked our first tilt van sweller went about it confidently the usual thing i suppose old chap he said with a smile and a yawn i ring for a b and s and then i have my tub i splash a good deal in the water of course you are aware that there are two ways in which i can receive tommy carmichael when he looks in to have a chat about polo i can talk to him through the bathroom door or i can be picking at a grilled bone which my man has brought in which would you prefer i smiled with diabolic satisfaction at his coming discomfiture neither i said you will make your appearance on the scene when a gentleman should after you are fully dressed which indubitably private function shall take place behind closed doors and i will feel indebted to you if after you do appear your deportment and manners are such that it will not be necessary to inform the public in order to appease its apprehension that you have taken a bath van sweller slightly elevated his brows oh very well he said a trifle piqued i rather imagine it concerns you more than it does me cut the tub by all means if you think best but it has been the usual thing you know this was my victory but after van sweller emerged from his apartments in the beaujolie i was vanquished in a dozen small but well contested skirmishes i allowed him a cigar but routed him on the question of naming its brand but he worsted me when i objected to giving him a coat unmistakably english in its cut i allowed him to stroll down broadway and even permitted passers by god knows there s nowhere to pass but by to turn their heads and gaze with evident admiration at his erect figure i demeaned myself and as a barber gave him a smooth dark face with its keen frank eye and firm jaw later on he looked in at the club and saw freddy vavasour polo team captain dawdling over grilled bone no dear old boy began van sweller but in an instant i had seized him by the collar and dragged him aside with the scantiest courtesy for heaven s sake talk like a man i said sternly do you think it is manly to use those mushy and inane forms of address that man is neither dear nor old nor a boy to my surprise van sweller turned upon me a look of frank pleasure i am glad to hear you say that he said heartily i used those words because i have been forced to say them so often they really are contemptible thanks for correcting me dear old boy still i must admit that van sweller s conduct in the park that morning was almost without flaw the courage the dash the modesty the skill and fidelity that he displayed atoned for everything this is the way the story runs van sweller has been a gentleman member of the rugged riders the company that made a war with a foreign country famous among his comrades was lawrence o roon a man whom van sweller liked a strange thing and a hazardous one in fiction was that van sweller and o roon resembled each other mightily in face form and general appearance after the war van sweller pulled wires and o roon was made a mounted policeman now one night in new york there are commemorations and libations by old comrades and in the morning mounted policeman o roon unused to potent liquids another premise hazardous in fiction finds the earth bucking and bounding like a bronco with no stirrup into which he may insert foot and save his honor and his badge noblesse oblige surely so out along the driveways and bridle paths trots hudson van sweller in the uniform of his incapacitated comrade as like unto him as one french pea is unto a petit pois it is of course jolly larks for van sweller who has wealth and social position enough for him to masquerade safely even as a police commissioner doing his duty if he wished to do so but society not given to scanning the countenances of mounted policemen sees nothing unusual in the officer on the beat and then comes the runaway that is a fine scene the swaying victoria the impetuous daft horses plunging through the line of scattering vehicles the driver stupidly holding his broken reins and the ivory white face of amy ffolliott as she clings desperately with each slender hand fear has come and gone it has left her expression pensive and just a little pleading for life is not so bitter and then the clatter and swoop of mounted policeman van sweller oh it was but the story has not yet been printed when it is you shall learn bow he sent his bay like a bullet after the imperilled victoria a crichton a croesus and a centaur in one he hurls the invincible combination into the chase when the story is printed you will admire the breathless scene where van sweller checks the headlong team and then he looks into amy ffolliott s eyes and sees two things the possibilities of a happiness he has long sought and a nascent promise of it he is unknown to her but he stands in her sight illuminated by the hero s potent glory she his and he hers by all the golden fond unreasonable laws of love and light literature ay that is a rich moment and it will stir you to find van sweller in that fruitful nick of time thinking of his comrade o roon who is cursing his gyrating bed and incapable legs in an unsteady room in a west side hotel while van sweller holds his badge and his honor van sweller hears miss ffolliott s voice thrillingly asking the name of her preserver if hudson van sweller in policeman s uniform has saved the life of palpitating beauty in the park where is mounted policeman o roon in whose territory the deed is done how quickly by a word can the hero reveal himself thus discarding his masquerade of ineligibility and doubling the romance but there is his friend van sweller touches his cap it s nothing miss he says sturdily that s what we are paid for to do our duty and away he rides but the story does not end there as i have said van sweller carried off the park scene to my decided satisfaction even to me he was a hero when he foreswore for the sake of his friend the romantic promise of his adventure it was later in the day amongst the more exacting conventions that encompass the society hero when we had our liveliest disagreement at noon he went to o roon s room and found him far enough recovered to return to his post which he at once did at about six o clock in the afternoon van sweller fingered his watch and flashed at me a brief look full of such shrewd cunning that i suspected him at once time to dress for dinner old man he said with exaggerated carelessness very well i answered without giving him a clew to my suspicions i will go with you to your rooms and see that you do the thing properly i suppose that every author must be a valet to his own hero he affected cheerful acceptance of my somewhat officious proposal to accompany him i could see that he was annoyed by it and that fact fastened deeper in my mind the conviction that he was meditating some act of treachery when he had reached his apartments he said to me with a too patronizing air there are as you perhaps know quite a number of little distinguishing touches to be had out of the dressing process some writers rely almost wholly upon them i suppose that i am to ring for my man and that he is to enter noiselessly with an expressionless countenance he may enter i said with decision and only enter valets do not usually enter a room shouting college songs or with st vitus s dance in their faces so the contrary may be assumed without fatuous or gratuitous asseveration i must ask you to pardon me continued van sweller gracefully for annoying you with questions but some of your methods are a little new to me shall i don a full dress suit with an immaculate white tie or is there another tradition to be upset you will wear i replied evening dress such as a gentleman wears if it is full your tailor should be responsible for its bagginess and i will leave it to whatever erudition you are supposed to possess whether a white tie is rendered any whiter by being immaculate and i will leave it to the consciences of you and your man whether a tie that is not white and therefore not immaculate could possibly form any part of a gentleman s evening dress if not then the perfect tie is included and understood in the term dress and its expressed addition predicates either a redundancy of speech or the spectacle of a man wearing two ties at once with this mild but deserved rebuke i left van sweller in his dressing room and waited for him in his library about an hour later his valet came out and i heard him telephone for an electric cab then out came van sweller smiling but with that sly secretive design in his eye that was puzzling me i believe he said easily as he smoothed a glove that i will drop in at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers for dinner i sprang up angrily at his words this then was the paltry trick he had been scheming to play upon me i faced him with a look so grim that even his patrician poise was flustered you will never do so i exclaimed with my permission what kind of a return is this i continued hotly for the favors i have granted you i gave you a van to your name when i might have called you perkins or simpson i have humbled myself so far as to brag of your polo ponies your automobiles and the iron muscles that you acquired when you were stroke oar of your varsity eight or eleven whichever it is i created you for the hero of this story and i will not submit to having you queer it i have tried to make you a typical young new york gentleman of the highest social station and breeding you have no reason to complain of my treatment to you amy ffolliott the girl you are to win is a prize for any man to be thankful for and cannot be equalled for beauty provided the story is illustrated by the right artist i do not understand why you should try to spoil everything i had thought you were a gentleman what it is you are objecting to old man asked van sweller in a surprised tone to your dining at i answered see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the pleasure would be yours no doubt but the responsibility would fall upon me you intend deliberately to make me out a tout for a restaurant where you dine tonight has not the slightest connection with the thread of our story you know very well that the plot requires that you be in front of the alhambra opera house at where you are to rescue miss ffolliott a second time as the fire engine crashes into her cab until that time your movements are immaterial to the reader why can t you dine out of sight somewhere as many a hero does instead of insisting upon an inapposite and vulgar exhibition of yourself my dear fellow said van sweller politely but with a stubborn tightening of his lips i m sorry it doesn t please you but there s no help for it even a character in a story has rights that an author cannot ignore the hero of a story of new york social life must dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers at least once during its action must i echoed disdainfully why must who demands it the magazine editors answered van sweller giving me a glance of significant warning but why i persisted to please subscribers around kankakee ill said van sweller without hesitation how do you know these things i inquired with sudden suspicion you never came into existence until this morning you are only a character in fiction anyway i myself created you how is it possible for you to know anything pardon me for referring to it said van sweller with a sympathetic smile but i have been the hero of hundreds of stories of this kind i felt a slow flush creeping into my face i thought i stammered i was hoping that is oh well of course an absolutely original conception in fiction is impossible in these days metropolitan types continued van sweller kindly do not offer a hold for much originality i ve sauntered through every story in pretty much the same way now and then the women writers have made me cut some rather strange capers for a gentleman but the men generally pass me along from one to another without much change but never yet in any story have i failed to dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers you will fail this time i said emphatically perhaps so admitted van sweller looking out of the window into the street below but if so it will be for the first time the authors all send me there i fancy that many of them would have liked to accompany me but for the little matter of the expense i say i will be touting for no restaurant i repeated loudly you are subject to my will and i declare that you shall not appear of record this evening until the time arrives for you to rescue miss ffolliott again if the reading public cannot conceive that you have dined during that interval at some one of the thousands of establishments provided for that purpose that do not receive literary advertisement it may suppose for aught i care that you have gone fasting thank you said van sweller rather coolly you are hardly courteous but take care it is at your own risk that you attempt to disregard a fundamental principle in metropolitan fiction one that is dear alike to author and reader i shall of course attend to my duty when it comes time to rescue your heroine but i warn you that it will be your loss if you fail to send me to night to dine at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i will take the consequences if there are to be any i replied i am not yet come to be sandwich man for an eating house i walked over to a table where i had left my cane and gloves i heard the whirr of the alarm in the cab below and i turned quickly van sweller was gone i rushed down the stairs and out to the curb an empty hansom was just passing i hailed the driver excitedly see that auto cab halfway down the block i shouted follow it don t lose sight of it for an instant and i will give you two dollars if i only had been one of the characters in my story instead of myself i could easily have offered or or even but was all i felt justified in expending with fiction at its present rates the cab driver instead of lashing his animal into a foam proceeded at a deliberate trot that suggested a by the hour arrangement but i suspected van sweller s design and when we lost sight of his cab i ordered my driver to proceed at once to see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i found van sweller at a table under a palm just glancing over the menu with a hopeful waiter hovering at his elbow come with me i said inexorably you will not give me the slip again under my eye you shall remain until van sweller countermanded the order for his dinner and arose to accompany me he could scarcely do less a fictitious character is but poorly equipped for resisting a hungry but live author who comes to drag him forth from a restaurant all he said was you were just in time but i think you are making a mistake you cannot afford to ignore the wishes of the great reading public i took van sweller to my own rooms to my room he had never seen anything like it before sit on that trunk i said to him while i observe whether the landlady is stalking us if she is not i will get things at a delicatessen store below and cook something for you in a pan over the gas jet it will not be so bad of course nothing of this will appear in the story jove old man said van sweller looking about him with interest this is a jolly little closet you live in where the devil do you sleep oh that pulls down and i say what is this under the corner of the carpet oh a frying pan i see clever idea fancy cooking over the gas what larks it will be think of anything you could eat i asked try a chop or what anything said van sweller enthusiastically except a grilled bone two weeks afterward the postman brought me a large fat envelope i opened it and took out something that i had seen before and this typewritten letter from a magazine that encourages society fiction your short story the badge of policeman o roon is herewith returned we are sorry that it has been unfavorably passed upon but it seems to lack in some of the essential requirements of our publication the story is splendidly constructed its style is strong and inimitable and its action and character drawing deserve the highest praise as a story per se it has merit beyond anything that we have read for some time but as we have said it fails to come up to some of the standards we have set could you not re write the story and inject into it the social atmosphere and return it to us for further consideration it is suggested to you that you have the hero van sweller drop in for luncheon or dinner once or twice at or at the see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers which will be in line with the changes desired

the conclusion of the sentence dictates watched her rise as gracefully as a fawn as she mounted the eastern terrace miss lore oh mr penne dictates and yet cortland s position was so far above that of this rustic maiden that he dreaded to consider the social upheaval that would ensue should he marry her in no uncertain tones the traditional voices of his caste and world cried out loudly to him to let her go what should follow miss lore looking up with a start i m sure i can t say mr penne unless with a giggle you would want to add gallegher mr penne coldly pardon me i was not seeking to impose

don t you think you might state that in a less coarse manner mr penne astounded wh wh i m afraid i fail to understand you miss lore his condition why not say he was full or intoxicated it would sound

mr penne helpless under the spell if you will be so good exit miss lore asbestos curtain tictocq these two farcical stories about tictocq appeared in the rolling stone they are reprinted here with all of their local references because written hurriedly and for neighborly reading they nevertheless have an interest for the admirer of o henry they were written in the great french detective in austin a successful political intrigue chapter i it is not generally known that tictocq the famous french detective was in austin last week he registered at the avenue hotel under an assumed name and his quiet and reserved manners singled him out at once for one not to be singled out no one knows why he came to austin but to one or two he vouchsafed the information that his mission was an important one from the french government one report is that the french minister of state has discovered an old statute among the laws of the empire resulting from a treaty between the emperor charlemagne and governor roberts which expressly provides for the north gate of the capital grounds being kept open but this is merely a conjecture last wednesday afternoon a well dressed gentleman knocked at the door of tictocq s room in the hotel the detective opened the door monsieur tictocq i believe said the gentleman you will see on the register that i sign my name q x jones said tictocq and gentlemen would understand that i wish to be known as such if you do not like being referred to as no gentleman i will give you satisfaction any time after july st and fight steve o donnell john mcdonald and ignatius

that can do it tictocq bowed am i to have carte blanche to question every person connected with the hotel the proprietor has already been spoken to everything and everybody is at your service tictocq consulted his watch come to this room to morrow afternoon at o clock with the landlord the populist candidate and any other witnesses elected from both parties and i will return the socks bien

are standing under the oleanders as they go by she is very beautiful says luderic rats says mabel a keen observer would have noted all this time the figure of a solitary man who seemed to avoid the company but by adroit changing of his position and perfectly cool and self possessed manner avoided drawing any especial attention to himself the lion of the evening is herr professor ludwig von bum the pianist he had been found drinking beer in a saloon on east pecan street by colonel st vitus about a week before and according to the austin custom in such cases was invited home by the colonel and the next day accepted into society with large music classes at his service professor von bum is playing the lovely symphony in g minor from beethoven s songs without music the grand chords fill the room with exquisite harmony he plays the extremely difficult passages in the obligato home run in a masterly manner and when he finishes with that grand te deum with arpeggios on the side there is that complete hush in the room that is dearer to the artist s heart than the loudest applause the professor looks around the room is empty empty with the exception of tictocq the great french detective who springs from behind a mass of tropical plants to his side the professor rises in alarm hush says tictocq make no noise at all you have already made enough footsteps are heard outside be quick says tictocq give me those socks there is not a moment to spare vas sagst du ah he confesses says tictocq no socks will do but those you carried off from the populist candidate s room the company is returning no longer hearing the music tictooq hesitates not he seizes the professor throws him upon the floor tears off his shoes and socks and escapes with the latter through the open window into the garden chapter iii tictocq s room in the avenue hotel a knock is heard at the door tictocq opens it and looks at his watch ah he says it is just six entrez messieurs the messieurs entrez there are seven of them the populist candidate who is there by invitation not knowing for what purpose the chairman of the democratic executive committee platform no the hotel proprietor and three or four democrats and populists as near as could be found out i don t know begins the populist candidate what in the h excuse me says tictocq firmly you will oblige me by keeping silent until i make my report i have been employed in this case and i have unravelled it for the honor of france i request that i be heard with attention certainly says the chairman we will be pleased to listen tictocq stands in the centre of the room the electric light burns brightly above him he seems the incarnation of alertness vigor cleverness and cunning the company seat themselves in chairs along the wall when informed of the robbery begins tictocq i first questioned the bell boy he knew nothing i went to the police headquarters they knew nothing i invited one of them to the bar to drink he said there used to be a little colored boy in the tenth ward who stole things and kept them for recovery by the police but failed to be at the place agreed upon for arrest one time and had been sent to jail i then began to think i reasoned no man said i would carry a populist s socks in his pocket without wrapping them up he would not want to do so in the hotel he would want a paper where would he get one at the statesman office of course i went there a young man with his hair combed down on his forehead sat behind the desk i knew he was writing society items for a young lady s slipper a piece of cake a fan a half emptied bottle of cocktail a bunch of roses and a police whistle lay on the desk before him can you tell me if a man purchased a paper here in the last three months i said yes he replied we sold one last night can you describe the man accurately he had blue whiskers a wart between his shoulder blades a touch of colic and an occupation tax on his breath which way did he go out i then went wait a minute said the populist candidate rising i don t see why in the h once more i must beg that you will be silent said tictocq rather sharply you should not interrupt me in the midst of my report i made one false arrest continued tictocq i was passing two finely dressed gentlemen on the street when one of them remarked that he had stole his socks i handcuffed him and dragged him to a lighted store when his companion explained to me that he was somewhat intoxicated and his tongue was not entirely manageable he had been speaking of some business transaction and what he intended to say was that he had sold his stocks i then released him an hour afterward i passed a saloon and saw this professor von bum drinking beer at a table i knew him in paris i said here is my man he worshipped wagner lived on limburger cheese beer and credit and would have stolen anybody s socks i shadowed him to the reception at colonel st vitus s and in an opportune moment i seized him and tore the socks from his feet there they are with a dramatic gesture tictocq threw a pair of dingy socks upon the table folded his arms and threw back his head with a loud cry of rage the populist candidate sprang once more to his feet gol darn it i will say what i want to i the two other populists in the room gazed at him coldly and sternly is this tale true they demanded of the candidate no by gosh it ain t he replied pointing a trembling finger at the democratic chairman there stands the man who has concocted the whole scheme it is an infernal unfair political trick to lose votes for our party how far has thing gone he added turning savagely to the detective all the newspapers have my written report on the matter and the statesman will have it in plate matter next week said tictocq complacently all is lost said the populists turning toward the door for god s sake my friends pleaded the candidate following them listen to me i swear before high heaven that i never wore a pair of socks in my life it is all a devilish campaign lie the populists turn their backs the damage is already done they said the people have heard the story you have yet time to withdraw decently before the race all left the room except tictocq and the democrats let s all go down and open a bottle of fizz on the finance committee said the chairman of the executive committee platform no tracked to doom or the mystery of the rue de peychaud tis midnight in paris a myriad of lamps that line the champs elysees and the rouge et noir cast their reflection in the dark waters of the seine as it flows gloomily

would have loved to paint a garcon is selling absinthe to such of the motley crowd as have a few sous dealing it out in niggardly portions in broken teacups leaning against the bar is carnaignole cusheau generally known as the gray wolf he is the worst man in paris he is more than four feet ten in height and his sharp ferocious looking face and the mass of long tangled gray hair that covers his face and head have earned for him the name he bears his striped blouse is wide open at the neck and falls outside of his dingy leather trousers the handle of a deadly looking knife protrudes from his belt one stroke of its blade would open a box of the finest french sardines voila gray wolf cries couteau the bartender how many victims to day there is no blood upon your hands has the gray wolf

crowd watches him with silent awe he went to the bar laid his card on the counter bought a drink of absinthe and then drawing from his pocket a little mirror set it up on the counter and proceeded to don a false beard and hair and paint his face into wrinkles until he closely resembled an old man seventy one years of age he then went into a dark corner and watched the crowd of people with sharp ferret like eyes gray wolf slipped cautiously to the bar and examined the card left by the newcomer holy saint bridget he exclaims it is tictocq the detective ten minutes later a beautiful woman enters the cellar tenderly nurtured and accustomed to every luxury that money could procure she had when a young vivandiere at the convent of saint susan de la montarde run away with the gray wolf fascinated by his many crimes and the knowledge that his business never allowed him to scrape his feet in the hall or snore parbleu marie snarls the gray wolf que voulez vous avez vous le beau cheval

moutons the horrifed sans culottes shrink back in terror as the gray wolf seizes maria by the hair and cuts her into twenty nine pieces each exactly the same size as he stands with reeking hands above the corpse amid a deep silence the old gray bearded man who has been watching the scene springs forward tears off his false beard and locks and tictocq the famous french detective stands before them spellbound and immovable the denizens of the cellar gaze at the greatest modern detective as he goes about the customary duties of his office he first measures the distance from the murdered woman to a point on the wall then he takes down the name of the bartender and the day of the month and the year then drawing from his pocket a powerful microscope he examines a little of the blood that stands upon the floor in little pools mon dieu he mutters it is as i feared human blood he then enters rapidly in a memorandum book the result of his investigations and leaves the cellar tictocq bends his rapid steps in the direction of the headquarters of the paris gendarmerie but suddenly pausing he strikes his hand upon his brow with a gesture of impatience mille tonnerre he mutters i should have asked the name of that man with the knife in his hand it is reception night at the palace of the duchess valerie du bellairs the apartments are flooded with a mellow light from paraffine candles in solid silver candelabra the company is the most aristocratic and wealthy in paris three or four brass bands are playing behind a portiere between the coal shed and also behind time footmen in gay laced livery bring in beer noiselessly and carry out apple peelings dropped by the guests valerie seventh duchess du bellairs leans back on a solid gold ottoman on eiderdown cushions surrounded by the wittiest the bravest and the handsomest courtiers in the capital ah madame said the prince champvilliers of palms royale corner of seventy third street as montesquiaux says rien de plus bon tutti frutti youth seems your inheritance you are to night the most beautiful the wittiest in your own salon i can scarce believe my own senses when i remember that thirty one years ago you saw it off says the duchess peremptorily the prince bows low and drawing a jewelled dagger stabs himself to the heart the displeasure of your grace is worse than death he says as he takes his overcoat and hat from a corner of the mantelpiece and leaves the room voila says beebe francillon fanning herself languidly that is the way with men flatter them and they kiss your hand loose but a moment the silken leash that holds them captive through their vanity and self opinionativeness and the son of a gun gets on his ear at once the devil go with him i say ah mon princesse sighs the count pumpernickel stooping and whispering with eloquent eyes into her ear you are too hard upon us balzac says all women are not to themselves what no one else is to another do you not agree with him cheese it says the princess philosophy palls upon me i ll shake you hosses says the count arm and arm they go out to the salon au beurre armande de fleury the young pianissimo danseuse from the folies bergere is about to sing she slightly clears her throat and lays a voluptuous cud of chewing gum upon the piano as the first notes of the accompaniment ring through the salon as she prepares to sing the duchess du bellairs grasps the arm of her ottoman in a vice like grip and she watches with an expression of almost anguished suspense she scarcely breathes then as armande de fleury before uttering a note reels wavers turns white as snow and falls dead upon the floor the duchess breathes a sigh of relief the duchess had poisoned her then the guests crowd about the piano gazing with bated breath and shuddering as they look upon the music rack and observe that the song that armande came so near singing is sweet marie twenty minutes later a dark and muffled figure was seen to emerge from a recess in the mullioned wall of the arc de triomphe and pass rapidly northward it was no other than tictocq the detective the network of evidence was fast being drawn about the murderer of marie cusheau it is midnight on the steeple of the cathedral of notadam it is also the same time at other given points in the vicinity the spire of the cathedral is feet above the pavement and a casual observer by making a rapid mathematical calculation would have readily perceived that this cathedral is at least double the height of others that measure only feet at the summit of the spire there is a little wooden platform on which there is room for but one man to stand crouching on this precarious footing which swayed dizzily with every breeze that blew was a man closely muffled and disguised as a wholesale grocer old francois beongfallong the great astronomer who is studying the sidereal spheres from his attic window in the rue de bologny shudders as he turns his telescope upon the solitary figure upon the spire sacre bleu he hisses between his new celluloid teeth it is tictocq the detective i wonder whom he is following now while tictocq is watching with lynx like eyes the hill of montmartre he suddenly hears a heavy breathing beside him and turning gazes into the ferocious eyes of the gray wolf carnaignole cusheau had put on his w u tel co climbers and climbed the steeple parbleu monsieur says tictocq to whom am i indebted for the honor of this visit the gray wolf smiled softly and depreciatingly you are tictocq the detective he said i am then listen i am the murderer of marie cusheau she was my wife and she had cold feet and ate onions what was i to do yet life is sweet to me i do not wish to be guillotined i have heard that you are on my track is it true that the case is in your hands it is thank le bon dieu then i am saved the gray wolf carefully adjusts the climbers on his feet and descends the spire tictocq takes out his notebook and writes in it at last he says i have a clue monsieur le compte carnaignole cusheau once known as the gray wolf stands in the magnificent drawing room of his palace on east th street three days after his confession to tictocq he happened to look in the pockets of a discarded pair of pants and found twenty million francs in gold suddenly the door opens and tictocq the detective with a dozen gensd arme enters the room you are my prisoner says the detective on what charge the murder of marie cusheau on the night of august th your proofs i saw you do it and your own confession on the spire of notadam the count laughed and took a paper from his pocket read this he said here is proof that marie cusheau died of heart failure tictocq looked at the paper it was a check for francs tictocq dismissed the gensd arme with a wave of his hand we have made a mistake monsieurs he said but as he turns to leave the room count carnaignole stops him one moment monsieur the count carnaignole tears from his own face a false beard and reveals the flashing eyes and well known features of tictocq the detective then springing forward he snatches a wig and false eyebrows from his visitor and the gray wolf grinding his teeth in rage stands before him the murderer of marie cusheau was never discovered a snapshot at the president this is the kind of waggish editorial o henry was writing in for the readers of the rolling stone the reader will do well to remember that the paper was for local consumption and that the allusions are to a very special place and time it will be remembered that about a month ago there were special rates offered to the public for a round trip to the city of washington the price of the ticket being exceedingly low we secured a loan of twenty dollars from a public spirited citizen of austin by mortgaging our press and cow with the additional security of our brother s name and a slight draught on major hutchinson for we purchased a round trip ticket two loaves of vienna bread and quite a large piece of cheese which we handed to a member of our reportorial staff with instructions to go to washington interview president cleveland and get a scoop if possible on all other texas papers our reporter came in yesterday morning via the manor dirt road with a large piece of folded cotton bagging tied under each foot it seems that he lost his ticket in washington and having divided the vienna bread and cheese with some disappointed office seekers who were coming home by the same route he arrived home hungry desiring food and with quite an appetite although somewhat late we give his description of his interview with president cleveland i am chief reporter on the staff of the rolling stone about a month ago the managing editor came into the room where we were both sitting engaged in conversation and said oh by the way go to washington and interview president cleveland all right said i take care of yourself five minutes later i was seated in a palatial drawing room car bounding up and down quite a good deal on the elastic plush covered seat i shall not linger upon the incidents of the journey i was given carte blanche to provide myself with every comfort and to spare no expense that i could meet for the regalement of my inside the preparations had been lavish both vienna and germany had been called upon to furnish dainty viands suitable to my palate i changed cars and shirts once only on the journey a stranger wanted me to also change a two dollar bill but i haughtily declined the scenery along the entire road to washington is diversified you find a portion of it on one hand by looking out of the window and upon turning the gaze upon the other side the eye is surprised and delighted by discovering some more of it there were a great many knights of pythias on the train one of them insisted upon my giving him the grip i had with me but he was unsuccessful on arriving in washington which city i instantly recognized from reading the history of george i left the car so hastily that i forgot to fee mr pullman s representative i went immediately to the capitol in a spirit of jeu d esprit i had had made a globular representation of a rolling stone it was of wood painted a dark color and about the size of a small cannon ball i had attached to it a twisted pendant about three inches long to indicate moss i had resolved to use this in place of a card thinking people would readily recognize it as an emblem of my paper i had studied the arrangement of the capitol and walked directly to mr cleveland s private office i met a servant in the hall and held up my card to him smilingly i saw his hair rise on his head and he ran like a deer to the door and lying down rolled down the long flight of steps into the yard ah said i to myself he is one of our delinquent subscribers a little farther along i met the president s private secretary who had been writing a tariff letter and cleaning a duck gun for mr cleveland when i showed him the emblem of my paper he sprang out of a high window into a hothouse filled with rare flowers this somewhat surprised me i examined myself my hat was on straight and there was nothing at all alarming about my appearance i went into the president s private office he was alone he was conversing with tom ochiltree mr ochiltree saw my little sphere and with a loud scream rushed out of the room president cleveland slowly turned his eyes upon me he also saw what i had in my hand and said in a husky voice wait a moment please he searched his coat pocket and presently found a piece of paper on which some words were written he laid this on his desk and rose to his feet raised one hand above him and said in deep tones i die for free trade my country and and all that sort of thing i saw him jerk a string and a camera snapped on another table taking our picture as we stood don t die in the house mr president i said go over into the senate chamber peace murderer he said let your bomb do its deadly work i m no bum i said with spirit i represent the rolling stone of austin texas and this i hold in my hand does the same thing but it seems unsuccessfully the president sank back in his chair greatly relieved i thought you were a dynamiter he said let me see texas texas he walked to a large wall map of the united states and placing his finger thereon at about the location of idaho ran it down in a zigzag doubtful way until he reached texas oh yes here it is i have so many things on my mind i sometimes forget what i should know well let s see texas oh yes that s the state where ida wells and a lot of colored people lynched a socialist named hogg for raising a riot at a camp meeting so you are from texas i know a man from texas named dave culberson how is dave and his family has dave got any children he has a boy in austin i said working around the capitol who is president of texas now i don t exactly oh excuse me i forgot again i thought i heard some talk of its having been made a republic again now mr cleveland i said you answer some of my questions a curious film came over the president s eyes he sat stiffly in his chair like an automaton proceed he said what do you think of the political future of this country i will state that political exigencies demand emergentistical promptitude and while the united states is indissoluble in conception and invisible in intent treason and internecine disagreement have ruptured the consanguinity of patriotism and one moment mr president i interrupted would you mind changing that cylinder i could have gotten all that from the american press association if i had wanted plate matter do you wear flannels what is your favorite poet brand of catsup bird flower and what are you going to do when you are out of a job young man said mr cleveland sternly you are going a little too far my private affairs do not concern the public i begged his pardon and he recovered his good humor in a moment you texans have a great representative in senator mills he said i think the greatest two speeches i ever heard were his address before the senate advocating the removal of the tariff on salt and increasing it on chloride of sodium tom ochiltree is also from our state i said oh no he isn t you must be mistaken replied mr cleveland for he says he is i really must go down to texas some time and see the state i want to go up into the panhandle and see if it is really shaped like it is on the map well i must be going said i when you get back to texas said the president rising you must write to me your visit has awakened in me quite an interest in your state which i fear i have not given the attention it deserves there are many historical and otherwise interesting places that you have revived in my recollection the alamo where davy jones fell goliad sam houston s surrender to montezuma the petrified boom found near austin five cent cotton and the siamese democratic platform born in dallas i should so much like to see the gals in galveston and go to the wake in waco i am glad i met you turn to the left as you enter the hall and keep straight on out i made a low bow to signify that the interview was at an end and withdrew immiediately i had no difficulty in leaving the building as soon as i was outside i hurried downtown in order to obtain refreshments at some place where viands had been placed upon the free list i shall not describe my journey back to austin i lost my return ticket somewhere in the white house and was forced to return home in a manner not especially beneficial to my shoes everybody was well in washington when i left and all send their love an unfinished christmas story probably begun several years before his death published as it here appears in short stories january now a christmas story should be one for a good many years the ingenious writers have been putting forth tales for the holiday numbers that employed every subtle evasive indirect and strategic scheme they could invent to disguise the christmas flavor so far has this new practice been carried that nowadays when you read a story in a holiday magazine the only way you can tell it is a christmas story is to look at the footnote which reads the incidents in the above story happened on december th ed there is progress in this but it is all very sad there are just as many real christmas stories as ever if we would only dig em up me i am for the scrooge and marley christmas story and the annie and willie s prayer poem and the long lost son coming home on the stroke of twelve to the poorly thatched cottage with his arms full of talking dolls and popcorn balls and zip you hear the second mortgage on the cottage go flying off it into the deep snow so this is to warn you that there is no subterfuge about this story and you might come upon stockings hung to the mantel and plum puddings and hark the chimes and wealthy misers loosening up and handing over penny whistles to lame newsboys if you read further once i knocked at a door i have so many things to tell you i keep on losing sight of the story it was the front door of a furnished room house in west teenth street i was looking for a young illustrator named paley originally and irrevocably from terre haute paley doesn t enter even into the first serial rights of this christmas story i mention him simply in explaining why i came to knock at the door some people have so much curiosity the door was opened by the landlady i had seen hundreds like her and i had smelled before that cold dank furnished draught of air that hurried by her to escape immurement in the furnished house she was stout and her face and lands were as white as though she had been drowned in a barrel of vinegar one hand held together at her throat a buttonless flannel dressing sacque whose lines had been cut by no tape or butterick known to mortal woman beneath this a too long flowered black sateen skirt was draped about her reaching the floor in stiff wrinkles and folds the rest of her was yellow her hair in some bygone age had been dipped in the fountain of folly presided over by the merry nymph hydrogen but now except at the roots it had returned to its natural grim and grizzled white her eyes and teeth and finger nails were yellow her chops hung low and shook when she moved the look on her face was exactly that smileless look of fatal melancholy that you may have seen on the countenance of a hound left sitting on the doorstep of a deserted cabin i inquired for paley after a long look of cold suspicion the landlady spoke and her voice matched the dingy roughness of her flannel sacque paley was i sure that was the name and wasn t it likely mr sanderson i meant in the third floor rear no it was paley i wanted again that frozen shrewd steady study of my soul from her pale yellow unwinking eyes trying to penetrate my mask of deception and rout out my true motives from my lying lips there was a mr tompkins in the front hall bedroom two flights up perhaps it was he i was seeking he worked of nights he never came in till seven in the morning or if it was really mr tucker thinly disguised as paley that i was hunting i would have to call between five and but no i held firmly to paley there was no such name among her lodgers click the door closed swiftly in my face and i heard through the panels the clanking of chains and bolts i went down the steps and stopped to consider the number of this house was i was sure paley had said or perhaps it was or i decided to try the second house farther along i rang the bell the door opened and there stood the same woman i wasn t confronted by just a resemblance it was the same woman holding together the same old sacque at her throat and looking at me with the same yellow eyes as if she had never seen me before on earth i saw on the knuckle of her second finger the same red and black spot made probably by a recent burn against a hot stove i stood speechless and gaping while one with moderate haste might have told fifty i couldn t have spoken paley s name even if i had remembered it i did the only thing that a brave man who believes there are mysterious forces in nature that we do not yet fully comprehend could have done in the circumstances i backed down the steps to the sidewalk and then hurried away frontward fully understanding how incidents like that must bother the psychical research people and the census takers of course i heard an explanation of it afterward as we always do about inexplicable things the landlady was mrs kannon and she leased three adjoining houses which she made into one by cutting arched doorways through the walls she sat in the middle house and answered the three bells i wonder why i have maundered so slowly through the prologue i have it it was simply to say to you in the form of introduction rife through the middle west shake hands with mrs kannon for it was in her triple house that the christmas story happened and it was there where i picked up the incontrovertible facts from the gossip of many roomers and met stickney and saw the necktie christmas came that year on thursday and snow came with it stickney harry clarence fowler stickney to whomsoever his full baptismal cognominal burdens may be of interest reached his address at six thirty wednesday afternoon address is new yorkese for home stickney roomed at west teenth street third floor rear hall room he was twenty years and four months old and he worked in a cameras of all kinds photographic supplies and films developed store i don t know what kind of work he did in the store but you must have seen him he is the young man who always comes behind the counter to wait on you and lets you talk for five minutes telling him what you want when you are done he calls the proprietor at the top of his voice to wait on you and walks away whistling between his teeth i don t want to bother about describing to you his appearance but if you are a man reader i will say that stickncy looked precisely like the young chap that you always find sitting in your chair smoking a cigarette after you have missed a shot while playing pool not billiards but pool when you want to sit down yourself there are some to whom christmas gives no christmassy essence of course prosperous people and comfortable people who have homes or flats or rooms with meals and even people who live in apartment houses with hotel service get something of the christmas flavor they give one another presents with the cost mark scratched off with a penknife and they hang holly wreaths in the front windows and when they are asked whether they prefer light or dark meat from the turkey they say both please and giggle and have lots of fun and the very poorest people have the best time of it the army gives em a dinner and the a m issue of the night final edition of the newspaper with the largest circulation in the city leaves a basket at their door full of an apple a lake ronkonkoma squab a scrambled eggplant and a bunch of kalamazoo bleached parsley the poorer you are the more christmas does for you but i ll tell you to what kind of a mortal christmas seems to be only the day before the twenty sixth day of december it s the chap in the big city earning sixteen dollars a week with no friends and few acquaintances who finds himself with only fifty cents in his pocket on christmas eve he can t accept charity he can t borrow he knows no one who would invite him to dinner i have a fancy that when the shepherds left their flocks to follow the star of bethlehem there was a bandy legged young fellow among them who was just learning the sheep business so they said to him bobby we re going to investigate this star route and see what s in it if it should turn out to be the first christmas day we don t want to miss it and as you are not a wise man and as you couldn t possibly purchase a present to take along suppose you stay behind and mind the sheep so as we may say harry stickney was a direct descendant of the shepherd who was left behind to take care of the flocks getting back to facts stickney rang the doorbell of he had a habit of forgetting his latchkey instantly the door opened and there stood mrs kannon clutching her sacque together at the throat and gorgonizing him with her opaque yellow eyes to give you good measure here is a story within a story once a roomer in who had the scotch habit not kilts but a habit of drinking scotch began to figure to himself what might happen if two persons should ring the doorbells of and at the same time visions of two halves of mrs kannon appearing respectively and simultaneously at the two entrances each clutching at a side of an open flapping sacque that could never meet overpowered him bellevue got him evening said stickney cheerlessly as he distributed little piles of muddy slush along the hall matting think we ll have snow you left your key said here the manuscript ends the unprofitable servant left unfinished and published as it here appears in everybody s magazine december i am the richer by the acquaintance of four newspaper men singly they are my encyclopedias friends mentors and sometimes bankers but now and then it happens that all of them will pitch upon the same printworthy incident of the passing earthly panorama and will send in reportorial constructions thereof to their respective journals it is then that for me it is to laugh for it seems that to each of them trained and skilled as he may be the same occurrence presents a different facet of the cut diamond life one will have it let us say that mme andre macarte s apartment was looted by six burglars who descended via the fire escape and bore away a ruby tiara valued at two thousand dollars and a five hundred dollar prize spitz dog which in violation of the expectoration ordinance was making free with the halls of the wuttapesituckquesunoowetunquah apartments my second chiel will take notes to the effect that while a friendly game of pinochle was in progress in the tenement rooms of mrs andy mccarty a lady guest named ruby o hara threw a burglar down six flights of stairs where he was pinioned and held by a two thousand dollar english bulldog amid a crowd of five hundred excited spectators my third chronicler and friend will gather the news threads of the happening in his own happy way setting forth on the page for you to read that the house of antonio macartini was blown up at a m by the black hand society on his refusing to leave two thousand dollars at a certain street corner killing a pet five hundred dollar pomeranian belonging to alderman rubitara s little daughter see photo and diagram opposite number four of my history makers will simply construe from the premises the story that while an audience of two thousand enthusiasts was listening to a rubinstein concert on sixth street a woman who said she was mrs andrew m carter threw a brick through a plate glass window valued at five hundred dollars the carter woman claimed that some one in the building had stolen her dog now the discrepancies in these registrations of the day s doings need do no one hurt surely one newspaper is enough for any man to prop against his morning water bottle to fend off the smiling hatred of his wife s glance if he be foolish enough to read four he is no wiser than a higher critic i remember probably as well as you do having read the parable of the talents a prominent citizen about to journey into a far country first hands over to his servants his goods to one he gives five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his several ability as the text has it there are two versions of this parable as you well know there may be more i do not know when the p c returns he requires an accounting two servants have put their talents out at usury and gained one hundred per cent good the unprofitable one simply digs up the talent deposited with him and hands it out on demand a pattern of behavior for trust companies and banks surely in one version we read that he had wrapped it in a napkin and laid it away but the commentator informs us that the talent mentioned was composed of ounces of silver about worth so the chronicler who mentioned the napkin had either to reduce the amount of the deposit or do a lot of explaining about the size of the napery used in those davs therefore in his version we note that he uses the word pound instead of talent a pound of silver may very well be laid away and carried away in a napkin as any hotel or restaurant man will tell you but let us get away from our mutton when the returned nobleman finds that the one talented servant has nothing to hand over except the original fund entrusted to him he is as angry as a multi millionaire would be if some one should hide under his bed and make a noise like an assessment he orders the unprofitable servant cast into outer darkness after first taking away his talent and giving it to the one hundred per cent financier and breathing strange saws saying from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath which is the same as to say nothing from nothing leaves nothing and now closer draw the threads of parable precept allegory and narrative leading nowhere if you will or else weaving themselves into the little fiction story about cliff mcgowan and his one talent there is but a definition to follow and then the homely actors trip on talent a gift endowment or faculty some peculiar ability power or accomplishment natural or acquired a metaphor borrowed from the parable in matt xxv l in new york city to day there are estimated living creatures training for the stage this does not include seals pigs dogs elephants prize fighters carmens mind readers or japanese wrestlers the bulk of them are in the ranks of the four million out of this number will survive a thousand nine hundred of these will have attained their fulness of fame when they shall dubiously indicate with the point of a hatpin a blurred figure in a flashlight photograph of a stage tout ensemble with the proud commentary that s me eighty in the pinkest of male louis xiv court costumes shall welcome the queen of the mythical pawpaw isles in a few well memorized words turning a tip tilted nose upon the nine hundred ten in tiny lace caps shall dust ibsen furniture for six minutes after the rising of the curtain nine shall attain the circuits besieging with muscle skill eye hand voice wit brain heel and toe the ultimate high walls of stardom one shall inherit broadway sic venit gloria mundi cliff mcgowan and mac mcgowan were cousins they lived on the west side and were talented singing dancing imitations trick bicycle riding boxing german and irish dialect comedy and a little sleight of hand and balancing of wheat straws and wheelbarrows on the ends of their chins came as easy to them as it is for you to fix your rat so it won t show or to dodge a creditor through the swinging doors of a well lighted cafe according as you may belong to the one or the other division of the greatest prestidigitators the people they were slim pale consummately self possessed youths whose fingernails were always irreproachably and clothes seams reproachfully shiny their conversation was in sentences so short that they made kipling s seem as long as court citations having the temperament they did no work any afternoon you could find them on eighth avenue either in front of spinelli s barber shop mike dugan s place or the limerick hotel rubbing their forefinger nails with dingy silk handkerchiefs at any time if you had happened to be standing undecisive near a pool table and cliff and mac had casually as it were drawn near mentioning something disinterestedly about a game well indeed would it have been for you had you gone your way unresponsive which assertion carefully considered is a study in tense punctuation and advice to strangers of all kinships it is likely that the closest is that of cousin between cousins there exist the ties of race name and favor ties thicker than water and yet not coagulated with the jealous precipitations of brotherhood or the enjoining obligations of the matrimonial yoke you can bestow upon a cousin almost the interest and affection that you would give to a stranger you need not feel toward him the contempt and embarrassment that you have for one of your father s sons it is the closer clan feeling that sometimes makes the branch of a tree stronger than its trunk thus were the two mcgowans bonded they enjoyed a quiet celebrity in their district which was a strip west of eighth avenue with the pump for its pivot their talents were praised in a hundred joints their friendship was famed even in a neighborhood where men had been known to fight off the wives of their friends when domestic onslaught was being made upon their friends by the wives of their friends thus do the limitations of english force us to repetends so side by side grim sallow lowering inseparable undefeated the cousins fought their way into the temple of art art with a big a which causes to intervene a lesson in geometry one night at about eleven o clock del delano dropped into mike s place on eighth avenue from that moment instead of remaining a place the cafe became a resort it was as though king edward had condescended to mingle with ten spots of a different suit or joe gans had casually strolled in to look over the tuskegee school or mr shaw of england had accepted an invitation to read selections from rena the snow bird at an unveiling of the proposed monument to james owen o connor at chinquapin falls mississippi in spite of these comparisons you will have to be told why the patronizing of a third rate saloon on the west side by the said del delano conferred such a specific honor upon the place del delano could not make his feet behave and so the world paid him a week to see them misconduct themselves on the vaudeville stage to make the matter plain to you and to swell the number of words he was the best fancy dancer on any of the circuits between ottawa and corpus christi with his eyes fixed on vacancy and his feet apparently fixed on nothing he nightly charmed thousands as his press agent incorrectly stated even taking night performance and matinee together he scarcely could have charmed more than eighteen hundred including those who left after zora the nautch girl had squeezed herself through a hoop twelve inches in diameter and those who were waiting for the moving pictures but del delano was the west side s favorite and nowhere is there a more loyal side five years before our story was submitted to the editors del had crawled from some tenth avenue basement like a lean rat and had bitten his way into the big cheese patched half starved cuffless and as scornful of the hook as an interpreter of ibsen he had danced his way into health as you and i view it and fame in sixteen minutes on amateur night at creary s variety theatre in eighth avenue a bookmaker one of the kind that talent wins with instead of losing sat in the audience asleep dreaming of an impossible pick up among the amateurs after a snore a glass of beer from the handsome waiter and a temporary blindness caused by the diamonds of a transmontane blonde in box e the bookmaker woke up long enough to engage del delano for a three weeks trial engagement fused with a trained dog short circuit covering the three washingtons heights statue and square by the time this story was read and accepted del delano was drawing his three hundred dollars a week which divided by seven sunday acts not in costume being permissible dispels the delusion entertained by most of us that we have seen better days you can easily imagine the worshipful agitation of eighth avenue whenever del delano honored it with a visit after his terpsichorean act in a historically great and vilely ventilated broadway theatre if the west side could claim forty two minutes out of his forty two weeks bookings every year it was an occasion for bonfires and repainting of the pump and now you know why mike s saloon is a resort and no longer a simple place del delano entered mike s alone so nearly concealed in a fur lined overcoat and a derby two sizes too large for him was prince lightfoot that you saw of his face only his pale hatchet edged features and a pair of unwinking cold light blue eyes nearly every man lounging at mike s bar recognized the renowned product of the west side to those who did not wisdom was conveyed by prodding elbows and growls of one sided introduction upon charley one of the bartenders both fame and fortune descended simultaneously he had once been honored by shaking hands with the great delano at a seventh avenue boxing bout so with lungs of brass he now cried hallo del old man what ll it be mike the proprietor who was cranking the cash register heard on the next day he raised charley s wages five a week del delano drank a pony beer paying for it carelessly out of his nightly earnings of and c he nodded amiably but coldly at the long line of mike s patrons and strolled past then into the rear room of the cafe for he heard in there sounds pertaining to his own art the light stirring staccato of a buck and wing dance in the back room mac mcgowan was giving a private exhibition of the genius of his feet a few young men sat at tables looking on critically while they amused themselves seriously with beer they nodded approval at some new fancy steps of mac s own invention at the sight of the great del delano the amateur s feet stuttered blundered clicked a few times and ceased to move the tongues of one s shoes become tied in the presence of the master mac s sallow face took on a slight flush from the uncertain cavity between del delano s hat brim and the lapels of his high fur coat collar came a thin puff of cigarette smoke and then a voice do that last step over again kid and don t hold your arms quite so stiff now then once more mac went through his paces according to the traditions of the man dancer his entire being was transformed into mere feet and legs his gaze and expression became cataleptic his body unbending above the waist but as light as a cork bobbed like the same cork dancing on the ripples of a running brook the beat of his heels and toes pleased you like a snare drum obligato the performance ended with an amazing clatter of leather against wood that culminated in a sudden flat footed stamp leaving the dancer erect and as motionless as a pillar of the colonial portico of a mansion in a kentucky prohibition town mac felt that he had done his best and that del delano would turn his back upon him in derisive scorn an approximate silence followed broken only by the mewing of a cafe cat and the hubbub and uproar of a few million citizens and transportation facilities outside mac turned a hopeless but nervy eye upon del delano s face in it he read disgust admiration envy indifference approval disappointment praise and contempt thus in the countenances of those we hate or love we find what we most desire or fear to see which is an assertion equalling in its wisdom and chiaroscuro the most famous sayings of the most foolish philosophers that the world has ever known del delano retired within his overcoat and hat in two minutes he emerged and turned his left side to mac then he spoke you ve got a foot movement kid like a baby hippopotamus trying to side step a jab from a humming bird and you hold yourself like a truck driver having his picture taken in a third avenue photograph gallery and you haven t got any method or style and your knees are about as limber as a couple of yale pass keys and you strike the eye as weighing let us say pounds while you work but say would you mind giving me your name mcgowan said the humbled amateur mac mcgowan delano the great slowly lighted a cigarette and continued through its smoke in other words you re rotten you can t dance but i ll tell you one thing you ve got throw it all off of your system while you re at it said mac what ve i got genius said del delano except myself it s up to you to be the best fancy dancer in the united states europe asia and the colonial possessions of all three smoke up said mac mcgowan genius repeated the master you ve got a talent for genius your brains are in your feet where a dancer s ought to be you ve been self taught until you re almost ruined but not quite what you need is a trainer i ll take you in hand and put you at the top of the profession there s room there for the two of us you may beat me said the master casting upon him a cold savage look combining so much rivalry affection justice and human hate that it stamped him at once as one of the little great ones of the earth you may beat me but i doubt it i ve got the start and the pull but at the top is where you belong your name you say is robinson mcgowan repeated the amateur mac mcgowan it don t matter said delano suppose you walk up to my hotel with me i d like to talk to you your footwork is the worst i ever saw madigan but well i d like to talk to you you may not think so but i m not so stuck up i came off of the west side myself that overcoat cost me eight hundred dollars but the collar ain t so high but what i can see over it i taught myself to dance and i put in most of nine years at it before i shook a foot in public but i had genius i didn t go too far wrong in teaching myself as you ve done you ve got the rottenest method and style of anybody i ever saw oh i don t think much of the few little steps i take said mac with hypocritical lightness don t talk like a package of self raising buckwheat flour said del delano you ve had a talent handed to you by the proposition higher up and it s up to you to do the proper thing with it i d like to have you go up to my hotel for a talk if you will in his rooms in the king clovis hotel del delano put on a scarlet house coat bordered with gold braid and set out apollinaris and a box of sweet crackers mac s eye wandered forget it said del drink and tobacco may be all right for a man who makes his living with his hands but they won t do if you re depending on your head or your feet if one end of you gets tangled so does the other that s why beer and cigarettes don t hurt piano players and picture painters but you ve got to cut em out if you want to do mental or pedal work now have a cracker and then we ll talk some all right said mac i take it as an honor of course for you to notice my hopping around of course i d like to do something in a professional line of course i can sing a little and do card tricks and irish and german comedy stuff and of course i m not so bad on the trapeze and comic bicycle stunts and hebrew monologues and one moment interrupted del delano before we begin i said you couldn t dance well that wasn t quite right you ve only got two or three bad tricks in your method you re handy with your feet and you belong at the top where i am i ll put you there i ve got six weeks continuous in new york and in four i can shape up your style till the booking agents will fight one another to get you and i ll do it too i m of from and for the west side del delano looks good on bill boards but the family name s crowley now mackintosh mcgowan i mean you ve got your chance fifty times a better one than i had i d be a shine to turn it down said mac and i hope you understand i appreciate it me and my cousin cliff mcgowan was thinking of getting a try out at creary s on amateur night a month from to morrow good stuff said delano i got mine there junius t rollins the booker for kuhn dooley jumped on the stage and engaged me after my dance and the boards were an inch deep in nickels and dimes and quarters there wasn t but nine penny pieces found in the lot i ought to tell you said mac after two minutes of pensiveness that my cousin cliff can beat me dancing we ve always been what you might call pals if you d take him up instead of me now it might be better he s invented a lot of steps that i can t cut forget it said delano mondays wednesdays fridays and saturdays of every week from now till amateur night a month off i ll coach you i ll make you as good as i am and nobody could do more for you my act s over every night at half an hour later i ll take you up and drill you till twelve i ll put you at the top of the bunch right where i am you ve got talent your style s bum but you ve got the genius you let me manage it i m from the west side myself and i d rather see one of the same gang win out before i would an east sider or any of the flatbush or hackensack meadow kind of butt iners i ll see that junius rollins is present on your friday night and if he don t climb over the footlights and offer you fifty a week as a starter i ll let you draw it down from my own salary every monday night now am i talking on the level or am i not amateur night at creary s eighth avenue theatre is cut by the same pattern as amateur nights elsewhere after the regular performance the humblest talent may by previous arrangement with the management make its debut upon the public stage ambitious non professionals mostly self instructed display their skill and powers of entertainment along the broadest lines they may sing dance mimic juggle contort recite or disport themselves along any of the ragged boundary lines of art from the ranks of these anxious tyros are chosen the professionals that adorn or otherwise make conspicuous the full blown stage press agents delight in recounting to open mouthed and close eared reporters stories of the humble beginnings of the brilliant stars whose orbits they control such and such a prima donna they will tell you made her initial bow to the public while turning handsprings on an amateur night one great matinee favorite made his debut on a generous friday evening singing coon songs of his own composition a tragedian famous on two continents and an island first attracted attention by an amateur impersonation of a newly landed scandinavian peasant girl one broadway comedian that turns em away got a booking on a friday night by reciting seriously the graveyard scene in hamlet thus they get their chance amateur night is a kindly boon it is charity divested of almsgiving it is a brotherly hand reached down by members of the best united band of coworkers in the world to raise up less fortunate ones without labelling them beggars it gives you the chance if you can grasp it to step for a few minutes before some badly painted scenery and during the playing by the orchestra of some ten or twelve bars of music and while the soles of your shoes may be clearly holding to the uppers to secure a salary equal to a congressman s or any orthodox minister s could an ambitious student of literature or financial methods get a chance like that by spending twenty minutes in a carnegie library i do not not trow so but shall we look in at creary s let us say that the specific friday night had arrived on which the fortunate mac mcgowan was to justify the flattering predictions of his distinguished patron and incidentally drop his silver talent into the slit of the slot machine of fame and fortune that gives up reputation and dough i offer sure of your acquiescence that we now forswear hypocritical philosophy and bigoted comment permitting the story to finish itself in the dress of material allegations a medium more worthy when held to the line than the most laborious creations of the word milliners page of o henry s manuscript missing here easily among the wings with his patron the great del delano for whatever footlights shone in the city that would be amused the freedom of their unshaded side was del s and if he should take up an amateur see and bring him around see and winking one of his cold blue eyes say to the manager take it from me he s got the goods see you wouldn t expect that amateur to sit on an unpainted bench sudorifically awaiting his turn would you so mac strolled around largely with the nonpareil and the seven waited clammily on the bench a giant in shirt sleeves with a grim kind face in which many stitches had been taken by surgeons from time to time i e with a long stick looped at the end he was the man with the hook the manager with his close smoothed blond hair his one sided smile and his abnormally easy manner pored with patient condescension over the difficult program of the amateurs the last of the professional turns the grand march of the happy huzzard had been completed the last wrinkle and darn of their blue silkolene cotton tights had vanished from the stage the man in the orchestra who played the kettle drum cymbals triangle sandpaper whang doodle hoof beats and catcalls and fired the pistol shots had wiped his brow the illegal holiday of the romans had arrived while the orchestra plays the famous waltz from the dismal wife let us bestow two hundred words upon the psychology of the audience the orchestra floor was filled by people the boxes contained persons in the galleries was the foreordained verdict the claque was there as it had originated in the stone age and was afterward adapted by the french every micky and maggie who sat upon creary s amateur bench wise beyond their talents knew that their success or doom lay already meted out to them by that crowded whistling roaring mass of romans in the three galleries they knew that the winning or the losing of the game for each one lay in the strength of the gang aloft that could turn the applause to its favorite on a broadway first night a wooer of fame may win it from the ticket buyers over the heads of the cognoscenti but not so at creary s the amateur s fate is arithmetical the number of his supporting admirers present at his try out decides it in advance but how these outlying friday nights put to a certain shame the mondays tuesdays wednesdays thursdays saturdays and matinees of the broadway stage you should know here the manuscript ends aristocracy versus hash from the rolling stone the snake reporter of the rolling stone was wandering up the avenue last night on his way home from the y m c a rooms when he was approached by a gaunt hungry looking man with wild eyes and dishevelled hair he accosted the reporter in a hollow weak voice can you tell me sir where i can find in this town a family of scrubs i don t understand exactly let me tell you how it is said the stranger inserting his forefinger in the reporter s buttonhole and badly damaging his chrysanthemum i am a representative from soapstone county and i and my family are houseless homeless and shelterless we have not tasted food for over a week i brought my family with me as i have indigestion and could not get around much with the boys some days ago i started out to find a boarding house as i cannot afford to put up at a hotel i found a nice aristocratic looking place that suited me and went in and asked for the proprietress a very stately lady with a roman nose came in the room she had one hand laid across her stom across her waist and the other held a lace handkerchief i told her i wanted board for myself and family and she condescended to take us i asked for her terms and she said per week i had two dollars in my pocket and i gave her that for a fine teapot that i broke when i fell over the table when she spoke you appear surprised says she you will please remembah that i am the widow of governor riddle of georgiah my family is very highly connected i give you board as a favah i nevah considah money any equivalent for the advantage of my society i well i got out of there and i went to some other places the next lady was a cousin of general mahone of virginia and wanted four dollars an hour for a back room with a pink motto and a burnet granite bed in it the next one was an aunt of davy crockett and asked eight dollars a day for a room furnished in imitation of the alamo with prunes for breakfast and one hour s conversation with her for dinner another one said she was a descendant of benedict arnold on her father s side and captain kidd on the other she took more after captain kidd she only had one meal and prayers a day and counted her society worth a week i found nine widows of supreme judges twelve relicts of governors and generals and twenty two ruins left by various happy colonels professors and majors who valued their aristocratic worth from to per week with weak kneed hash and dried apples on the side i admire people of fine descent but my stomach yearns for pork and beans instead of culture am i not right your words said the reporter convince me that you have uttered what you have said thanks you see how it is i am not wealthy i have only my per diem and my perquisites and i cannot afford to pay for high lineage and moldy ancestors a little corned beef goes further with me than a coronet and when i am cold a coat of arms does not warm me i greatly fear said the reporter with a playful hiccough that you have run against a high toned town most all the first class boarding houses here are run by ladies of the old southern families the very first in the land i am now desperate said the representative as he chewed a tack awhile thinking it was a clove i want to find a boarding house where the proprietress was an orphan found in a livery stable whose father was a dago from east austin and whose grandfather was never placed on the map i want a scrubby ornery low down snuff dipping back woodsy piebald gang who never heard of finger bowls or ward mcallister but who can get up a mess of hot cornbread and irish stew at regular market quotations is there such a place in austin the snake reporter sadly shook his head i do not know he said but i will shake you for the beer ten minutes later the slate in the blue ruin saloon bore two additional characters the prisoner of zembla from the rolling stone so the king fell into a furious rage so that none durst go near him for fear and he gave out that since the princess ostla had disobeyed him there would be a great tourney and to the knight who should prove himself of the greatest valor he would give the hand of the princess and he sent forth a herald to proclaim that he would do this and the herald went about the country making his desire known blowing a great tin horn and riding a noble steed that pranced and gambolled and the villagers gazed upon him and said lo that is one of them tin horn gamblers concerning which the chroniclers have told us and when the day came the king sat in the grandstand holding the gage of battle in his band and by his side sat the princess ostla looking very pale and beautiful but with mournful eyes from which she scarce could keep the tears and the knights which came to the tourney gazed upon the princess in wonder at her beauty and each swore to win so that he could marry her and board with the king suddenly the heart of the princess gave a great bound for she saw among the knights one of the poor students with whom she had been in love the knights mounted and rode in a line past the grandstand and the king stopped the poor student who had the worst horse and the poorest caparisons of any of the knights and said sir knight prithee tell me of what that marvellous shacky and rusty looking armor of thine is made oh king said the young knight seeing that we are about to engage in a big fight i would call it scrap iron wouldn t you ods bodkins said the king the youth hath a pretty wit about this time the princess ostla who began to feel better at the sight of her lover slipped a piece of gum into her mouth and closed her teeth upon it and even smiled a little and showed the beautiful pearls with which her mouth was set whereupon as soon as the knights perceived this of them went over to the king s treasurer and settled for their horse feed and went home it seems very hard said the princess that i cannot marry when i chews but two of the knights were left one of them being the princess lover here s enough for a fight anyhow said the king come hither o knights will ye joust for the hand of this fair lady we joust will said the knights the two knights fought for two hours and at length the princess lover prevailed and stretched the other upon the ground the victorious knight made his horse caracole before the king and bowed low in his saddle on the princess ostla s cheeks was a rosy flush in her eyes the light of excitement vied with the soft glow of love her lips were parted her lovely hair unbound and she grasped the arms of her chair and leaned forward with heaving bosom and happy smile to hear the words of her lover you have foughten well sir knight said the king and if there is any boon you crave you have but to name it then said the knight i will ask you this i have bought the patent rights in your kingdom for schneider s celebrated monkey wrench and i want a letter from you endorsing it you shall have it said the king but i must tell you that there is not a monkey in my kingdom with a yell of rage the victorious knight threw himself on his horse and rode away at a furious gallop the king was about to speak when a horrible suspicion flashed upon him and he fell dead upon the grandstand my god he cried he has forgotten to take the princess with him a strange story from the rolling stone in the northern part of austin there once dwelt an honest family by the name of smothers the family consisted of john smothers his wife himself their little daughter five years of age and her parents making six people toward the population of the city when counted for a special write up but only three by actual count one night after supper the little girl was seized with a severe colic and john smothers hurried down town to get some medicine he never came back the little girl recovered and in time grew up to womanhood the mother grieved very much over her husband s disappearance and it was nearly three months before she married again and moved to san antonio the little girl also married in time and after a few years had rolled around she also had a little girl five years of age she still lived in the same house where they dwelt when her father had left and never returned one night by a remarkable coincidence her little girl was taken with cramp colic on the anniversary of the disappearance of john smothers who would now have been her grandfather if he had been alive and had a steady job i will go downtown and get some medicine for her said john smith for it was none other than he whom she had married no no dear john cried his wife you too might disappear forever and then forget to come back so john smith did not go and together they sat by the bedside of little pansy for that was pansy s name after a little pansy seemed to grow worse and john smith again attempted to go for medicine but his wife would not let him suddenly the door opened and an old man stooped and bent with long white hair entered the room hello here is grandpa said pansy she had recognized him before any of the others the old man drew a bottle of medicine from his pocket and gave pansy a spoonful she got well immediately i was a little late said john smothers as i waited for a street car fickle fortune or how gladys hustled from the rolling stone press me no more mr snooper said gladys vavasour smith i can never be yours you have led me to believe different gladys said bertram d snooper the setting sun was flooding with golden light the oriel windows of a magnificent mansion situated in one of the most aristocratic streets west of the brick yard bertram d snooper a poor but ambitious and talented young lawyer had just lost his first suit he had dared to aspire to the hand of gladys vavasour smith the beautiful and talented daughter of one of the oldest and proudest families in the county the bluest blood flowed in her veins her grandfather had sawed wood for the hornsbys and an aunt on her mother s side had married a man who had been kicked by general lee s mule the lines about bertram d snooper s hands and mouth were drawn tighter as he paced to and fro waiting for a reply to the question he intended to ask gladys as soon as he thought of one at last an idea occurred to him why will you not marry me he asked in an inaudible tone because said gladys firmly speaking easily with great difficulty the progression and enlightenment that the woman of to day possesses demand that the man shall bring to the marriage altar a heart and body as free from the debasing and hereditary iniquities that now no longer exist except in the chimerical imagination of enslaved custom it is as i expected said bertram wiping his heated brow on the window curtain you have been reading books besides that continued gladys ignoring the deadly charge you have no money the blood of the snoopers rose hastily and mantled the cheek of bertram d he put on his coat and moved proudly to the door stay here till i return he said i will be back in fifteen years when he had finished speaking he ceased and left the room when he had gone gladys felt an uncontrollable yearning take possession of her she said slowly rather to herself than for publication i wonder if there was any of that cold cabbage left from dinner she then left the room when she did so a dark complexioned man with black hair and gloomy desperate looking clothes came out of the fireplace where he had been concealed and stated aha i have you in my power at last bertram d snooper gladys vavasour smith shall be mine i am in the possession of secrets that not a soul in the world suspects i have papers to prove that bertram snooper is the heir to the footnote an estate famous in texas legal history it took many many years for adjustment and a large part of the property was of course consumed as expenses of litigation tom bean estate and i have discovered that gladys grandfather who sawed wood for the hornsby s was also a cook in major rhoads fisher s command during the war therefore the family repudiate her and she will marry me in order to drag their proud name down in the dust ha ha ha as the reader has doubtless long ago discovered this man was no other than henry r grasty mr grasty then proceeded to gloat some more and then with a sardonic laugh left for new york fifteen years have elapsed of course our readers will understand that this is only supposed to the the case it really took less than a minute to make the little stars that represent an interval of time we could not afford to stop a piece in the middle and wait fifteen years before continuing it we hope this explanation will suffice we are careful not to create any wrong impressions gladys vavasour smith and henry r grasty stood at the marriage altar mr grasty had evidently worked his rabbit s foot successfully although he was quite a while in doing so just as the preacher was about to pronounce the fatal words on which he would have realized ten dollars and had the laugh on mr grasty the steeple of the church fell off and bertram d snooper entered the preacher fell to the ground with a dull thud he could ill afford to lose ten dollars he was hastily removed and a cheaper one secured bertram d snooper held a statesman in his hand aha he said i thought i would surprise you i just got in this morning here is a paper noticing my arrival he handed it to henry r grasty mr grasty looked at the paper and turned deadly pale it was dated three weeks after mr snooper s arrival foiled again he hissed speak bertram d snooper said gladys why have you come between me and henry i have just discovered that i am the sole heir to tom bean s estate and am worth two million dollars with a glad cry gladys threw herself in bertram s arms henry r grasty drew from his breast pocket a large tin box and opened it took therefrom pages of closely written foolscap what you say is true mr snooper but i ask you to read that he said handing it to bertram snooper mr snooper had no sooner read the document than he uttered a piercing shriek and bit off a large chew of tobacco all is lost he said what is that document asked gladys governor hogg s message it is not as bad as that said bertram but it deprives me of my entire fortune but i care not for that gladys since i have won you what is it speak i implore you said gladys those papers said henry r grasty are the proofs of my appointment as administrator of the tom bean estate with a loving cry gladys threw herself in henry r grasty s arms twenty minutes later bertram d snooper was seen deliberately to enter a beer saloon on seventeenth street an apology this appeared in the rolling stone shortly before it suspended publication never to resume the person who sweeps the office translates letters from foreign countries deciphers communications from graduates of business colleges and does most of the writing for this paper has been confined for the past two weeks to the under side of a large red quilt with a joint caucus of la grippe and measles we have missed two issues of the rolling stone and are now slightly convalescent for which we desire to apologize and express our regrets everybody s term of subscription will be extended enough to cover all missed issues and we hope soon to report that the goose remains suspended at a favorable altitude people who have tried to run a funny paper and entertain a congregation of large piebald measles at the same time will understand something of the tact finesse and hot sassafras tea required to do so we expect to get out the paper regularly from this time on but are forced to be very careful as improper treatment and deleterious after effects of measles combined with the high price of paper and presswork have been known to cause a relapse any one not getting their paper regularly will please come down and see about it bringing with them a ham or any little delicacy relished by invalids lord oakhurst s curse this story was sent to dr beall of greensboro n c in a letter in and so is one of o henry s earliest attempts at writing i lord oakhurst lay dying in the oak chamber in the eastern wing of oakhurst castle through the open window in the calm of the summer evening came the sweet fragrance of the early violets and budding trees and to the dying man it seemed as if earth s loveliness and beauty were never so apparent as on this bright june day his last day of life his young wife whom he loved with a devotion and strength that the presence of the king of terrors himself could not alter moved about the apartment weeping and sorrowful sometimes arranging the sick man s pillow and inquiring of him in low mournful tones if anything could be done to give him comfort and again with stifled sobs eating some chocolate caramels which she carried in the pocket of her apron the servants went to and fro with that quiet and subdued tread which prevails in a house where death is an expected guest and even the crash of broken china and shivered glass which announced their approach seemed to fall upon the ear with less violence and sound than usual lord oakhurst was thinking of days gone by when he wooed and won his beautiful young wife who was then but a charming and innocent girl how clearly and minutely those scenes rose up at the call of his memory he seemed to be standing once more beneath the old chestnut grove where they had plighted their troth in the twilight under the stars while the rare fragrance of the june roses and the smell of supper came gently by on the breeze there he had told her his love how that his whole happiness and future joy lay in the hope that he might win her for a bride that if she would trust her future to his care the devotedness of his lifetime should be hers and his only thought would be to make her life one long day of sunshine and peanut candy how plainly he remembered how she had with girlish shyness and coyness at first hesitated and murmured something to herself about an old bald beaded galoot but when he told her that to him life without her would be a blasted mockery and that his income was a year she threw herself on to him and froze there with the tenacity of a tick on a brindled cow and said with tears of joy hen ery i am thine and now he was dying in a few short hours his spirit would rise up at the call of the destroyer and quitting his poor weak earthly frame would go forth into that dim and dreaded unknown land and solve with certainty that mystery which revealeth itself not to mortal man ii a carriage drove rapidly up the avenue and stopped at the door sir everhard fitzarmond the famous london physician who had been telegraphed for alighted and quickly ascended the marble steps lady oakhurst met him at the door her lovely face expressing great anxiety and grief oh sir everhard i am so glad you have come he seems to be sinking rapidly did you bring the cream almonds i mentioned in the telegram sir everhard did not reply but silently handed her a package and slipping a couple of cloves into his mouth ascended the stairs that led to lord oakhurst s apartment lady oakhurst followed sir everhard approached the bedside of his patient and laid his hand gently on this sick man s diagnosis a shade of feeling passed over his professional countenance as lie gravely and solemnly pronounced these words madam your husband has croaked lady oakhurst at first did not comprehend his technical language and her lovely mouth let up for a moment on the cream almonds but soon his meaning flashed upon her and she seized an axe that her husband was accustomed to keep by his bedside to mangle his servants with and struck open lord oakhurst s cabinet containing his private papers and with eager hands opened the document which she took therefrom then with a wild unearthly shriek that would have made a steam piano go out behind a barn and kick itself in despair she fell senseless to the floor sir everhard fitzarmond picked up the paper and read its contents it was lord oakhurst s will bequeathing all his property to a scientific institution which should have for its object the invention of a means for extracting peach brandy from sawdust sir everhard glanced quickly around the room no one was in sight dropping the will he rapidly transferred some valuable ornaments and rare specimens of gold and silver filigree work from the centre table to his pockets and rang the bell for the servants iii the curse sir everhard fitzarmond descended the stairway of oakhurst castle and passed out into the avenue that led from the doorway to the great iron gates of the park lord oakhurst had been a great sportsman during his life and always kept a well stocked kennel of curs which now rushed out from their hiding places and with loud yelps sprang upon the physician burying their fangs in his lower limbs and seriously damaging his apparel sir everllard startled out of his professional dignity and usual indifference to human suffering by the personal application of feeling gave vent to a most horrible and blighting curse and ran with great swiftness to his carriage and drove off toward the city bexar scrip no from the rolling stone saturday march whenever you visit austin you should by all means go to see the general land office as you pass up the avenue you turn sharp round the corner of the court house and on a steep hill before you you see a medieval castle you think of the rhine the castled crag of drachenfels the lorelei and the vine clad slopes of germany and german it is in every line of its architecture and design the plan was drawn by an old draftsman from the vaterland whose heart still loved the scenes of his native land and it is said he reproduced the design of a certain castle near his birthplace with remarkable fidelity under the present administration a new coat of paint has vulgarized its ancient and venerable walls modern tiles have replaced the limestone slabs of its floors worn in hollows by the tread of thousands of feet and smart and gaudy fixtures have usurped the place of the time worn furniture that has been consecrated by the touch of hands that texas will never cease to honor but even now when you enter the building you lower your voice and time turns backward for you for the atmosphere which you breathe is cold with the exudation of buried generations the building is stone with a coating of concrete the walls are immensely thick it is cool in the summer and warm in the winter it is isolated and sombre standing apart from the other state buildings sullen and decaying brooding on the past twenty years ago it was much the same as now twenty years from now the garish newness will be worn off and it will return to its appearance of gloomy decadence people living in other states can form no conception of the vastness and importance of the work performed and the significance of the millions of records and papers composing the archives of this office the title deeds patents transfers and legal documents connected with every foot of land owned in the state of texas are filed here volumes could be filled with accounts of the knavery the double dealing the cross purposes the perjury the lies the bribery the alteration and erasing the suppressing and destroying of papers the various schemes and plots that for the sake of the almighty dollar have left their stains upon the records of the general land office no reference is made to the employees no more faithful competent and efficient force of men exists in the clerical portions of any government but there is or was for their day is now over a class of land speculators commonly called land sharks unscrupulous and greedy who have left their trail in every department of this office in the shape of titles destroyed patents cancelled homes demolished and torn away forged transfers and lying affidavits before the modern tiles were laid upon the floors there were deep hollows in the limestone slabs worn by the countless feet that daily trod uneasily through its echoing corridors pressing from file room to business room from commissioner s sanctum to record books and back again the honest but ignorant settler bent on saving the little plot of land he called home elbowed the wary land shark who was searching the records for evidence to oust him the lordly cattle baron relying on his influence and money stood at the commissioner s desk side by side with the preemptor whose little potato patch lay like a minute speck of island in the vast billowy sea of his princely pastures and played the old game of freeze out which is as old as cain and abel the trail of the serpent is through it all honest earnest men have wrought for generations striving to disentangle the shameful coil that certain years of fraud and infamy have wound look at the files and see the countless endorsements of those in authority transfer doubtful locked up certificate a forgery locked up signature a forgery patent refused duplicate patented elsewhere field notes forged certificates stolen from office and soon ad infinitum the record books spread upon long tables in the big room upstairs are open to the examination of all open them and you will find the dark and greasy finger prints of half a century s handling the quick hand of the land grabber has fluttered the leaves a million times the damp clutch of the perturbed tiller of the soil has left traces of his calling on the ragged leaves interest centres in the file room this is a large room built as a vault fireproof and entered by but a single door there is no admission on the portal and the precious files are handed out by a clerk in charge only on presentation of an order signed by the commissioner or chief clerk in years past too much laxity prevailed in its management and the files were handled by all corners simply on their request and returned at their will or not at all in these days most of the mischief was done in the file room there are about files each in a paper wrapper and comprising the title papers of a particular tract of land you ask the clerk in charge for the papers relating to any survey in texas they are arranged simply in districts and numbers he disappears from the door you hear the sliding of a tin box the lid snaps and the file is in your hand go up there some day and call for bexar scrip no the file clerk stares at you for a second says shortly out of file it has been missing twenty years the history of that file has never been written before twenty years ago there was a shrewd land agent living in austin who devoted his undoubted talents and vast knowledge of land titles and the laws governing them to the locating of surveys made by illegal certificates or improperly made and otherwise of no value through non compliance with the statutes or whatever flaws his ingenious and unscrupulous mind could unearth he found a fatal defect in the title of the land as on file in bexar scrip no and placed a new certificate upon the survey in his own name the law was on his side every sentiment of justice of right and humanity was against him the certificate by virtue of which the original survey had been made was missing it was not be found in the file and no memorandum or date on the wrapper to show that it had ever been filed under the law the land was vacant unappropriated public domain and open to location the land was occupied by a widow and her only son and she supposed her title good the railroad had surveyed a new line through the property and it had doubled in value sharp the land agent did not communicate with her in any way until he had filed his papers rushed his claim through the departments and into the patent room for patenting then he wrote her a letter offering her the choice of buying from him or vacating at once he received no reply one day he was looking through some files and came across the missing certificate some one probably an employee of the office had by mistake after making some examination placed it in the wrong file and curiously enough another inadvertence in there being no record of its filing on the wrapper had completed the appearance of its having never been filed sharp called for the file in which it belonged and scrutinized it carefully fearing he might have overlooked some endorsement regarding its return to the office on the back of the certificate was plainly endorsed the date of filing according to law and signed by the chief clerk if this certificate should be seen by the examining clerk his own claim when it came up for patenting would not be worth the paper on which it was written sharp glanced furtively around a young man or rather a boy about eighteen years of age stood a few feet away regarding him closely with keen black eyes sharp a little confused thrust the certificate into the file where it properly belonged and began gathering up the other papers the boy came up and leaned on the desk beside him a right interesting office sir he said i have never been in here before all those papers now they are about lands are they not the titles and deeds and such things yes said sharp they are supposed to contain all the title papers this one now said the boy taking up bexar scrip no what land does this represent the title of ah i see six hundred and forty acres in b country absalom harris original grantee please tell me i am so ignorant of these things how can you tell a good survey from a bad one i am told that there are a great many illegal and fraudulent surveys in this office i suppose this one is all right no said sharp the certificate is missing it is invalid that paper i just saw you place in that file i suppose is something else field notes or a transfer probably yes said sharp hurriedly corrected field notes excuse me i am a little pressed for time the boy was watching him with bright alert eyes it would never do to leave the certificate in the file but he could not take it out with that inquisitive boy watching him he turned to the file room with a dozen or more files in his hands and accidentally dropped part of them on the floor as he stooped to pick them up he swiftly thrust bexar scrip no in the inside breast pocket of his coat this happened at just half past four o clock and when the file clerk took the files he threw them in a pile in his room came out and locked the door the clerks were moving out of the doors in long straggling lines it was closing time sharp did not desire to take the file from the land office the boy might have seen him place the file in his pocket and the penalty of the law for such an act was very severe some distance back from the file room was the draftsman s room now entirely vacated by its occupants sharp dropped behind the outgoing stream of men and slipped slyly into this room the clerks trooped noisily down the iron stairway singing whistling and talking below the night watchman awaited their exit ready to close and bar the two great doors to the south and cast it is his duty to take careful note each day that no one remains in the building after the hour of closing sharp waited until all sounds had ceased it was his intention to linger until everything was quiet and then to remove the certificate from the file and throw the latter carelessly on some draftsman s desk as if it had been left there during the business of the day he knew also that he must remove the certificate from the office or destroy it as the chance finding of it by a clerk would lead to its immediately being restored to its proper place and the consequent discovery that his location over the old survey was absolutely worthless as he moved cautiously along the stone floor the loud barking of the little black dog kept by the watchman told that his sharp ears had heard the sounds of his steps the great hollow rooms echoed loudly move as lightly as he could sharp sat down at a desk and laid the file before him in all his queer practices and cunning tricks he had not yet included any act that was downright criminal he had always kept on the safe side of the law but in the deed he was about to commit there was no compromise to be made with what little conscience he had left there is no well defined boundary line between honesty and dishonesty the frontiers of one blend with the outside limits of the other and he who attempts to tread this dangerous ground may be sometimes in one domain and sometimes in the other so the only safe road is the broad highway that leads straight through and has been well defined by line and compass sharp was a man of what is called high standing in the community that is his word in a trade was as good as any man s his check was as good as so much cash and so regarded he went to church regularly went in good society and owed no man anything he was regarded as a sure winner in any land trade he chose to make but that was his occupation the act he was about to commit now would place him forever in the ranks of those who chose evil for their portion if it was found out more than that it would rob a widow and her son of property soon to be of great value which if not legally theirs was theirs certainly by every claim of justice but he had gone too far to hesitate his own survey was in the patent room for patenting his own title was about to be perfected by the state s own hand the certificate must be destroyed he leaned his head on his hands for a moment and as he did so a sound behind him caused his heart to leap with guilty fear but before he could rise a hand came over his shoulder and grasped the file he rose quickly as white as paper rattling his chair loudly on the stone floor the boy who land spoken to him earlier stood contemplating him with contemptuous and flashing eyes and quietly placed the file in the left breast pocket of his coat so mr sharp by nature as well as by name he said it seems that i was right in waiting behind the door in order to see you safely out you will appreciate the pleasure i feel in having done so when i tell you my name is harris my mother owns the land on which you have filed and if there is any justice in texas she shall hold it i am not certain but i think i saw you place a paper in this file this afternoon and it is barely possible that it may be of value to me i was also impressed with the idea that you desired to remove it again but had not the opportunity anyway i shall keep it until to morrow and let the commissioner decide far back among mr sharp s ancestors there must have been some of the old berserker blood for his caution his presence of mind left him and left him possessed of a blind devilish unreasoning rage that showed itself in a moment in the white glitter of his eye give me that file boy he said thickly holding out his hand i am no such fool mr sharp said the youth this file shall be laid before the commissioner to morrow for examination if he finds help help sharp was upon him like a tiger and bore him to the floor the boy was strong and vigorous but the suddenness of the attack gave him no chance to resist he struggled up again to his feet but it was an animal with blazing eyes and cruel looking teeth that fought him instead of a man mr sharp a man of high standing and good report was battling for his reputation presently there was a dull sound and another and still one more and a blade flashing white and then red and edward harris dropped down like some stuffed effigy of a man that boys make for sport with his limbs all crumpled and lax on the stone floor of the land office the old watchman was deaf and heard nothing the little dog barked at the foot of the stairs until his master made him come into his room sharp stood there for several minutes holding in his hand his bloody clasp knife listening to the cooing of the pigeons on the roof and the loud ticking of the clock above the receiver s desk a map rustled on the wall and his blood turned to ice a rat ran across some strewn papers and his scalp prickled and he could scarcely moisten his dry lips with his tongue between the file room and the draftsman s room there is a door that opens on a small dark spiral stairway that winds from the lower floor to the ceiling at the top of the house this stairway was not used then nor is it now it is unnecessary inconvenient dusty and dark as night and was a blunder of the architect who designed the building this stairway ends above at the tent shaped space between the roof and the joists that space is dark and forbidding and being useless is rarely visited sharp opened this door and gazed for a moment up this narrow cobwebbed stairway after dark that night a man opened cautiously one of the lower windows of the land office crept out with great circumspection and disappeared in the shadows one afternoon a week after this time sharp lingered behind again after the clerks had left and the office closed the next morning the first comers noticed a broad mark in the dust on the upstairs floor and the same mark was observed below stairs near a window it appeared as if some heavy and rather bulky object had been dragged along through the limestone dust a memorandum book with e harris written on the flyleaf was picked up on the stairs but nothing particular was thought of any of these signs circulars and advertisements appeared for a long time in the papers asking for information concerning edward harris who left his mother s home on a certain date and had never been heard of since after a while these things were succeeded by affairs of more recent interest and faded from the public mind sharp died two years ago respected and regretted the last two years of his life were clouded with a settled melancholy for which his friends could assign no reason the bulk of his comfortable fortune was made from the land he obtained by fraud and crime the disappearance of the file was a mystery that created some commotion in the land office but he got his patent it is a well known tradition in austin and vicinity that there is a buried treasure of great value somewhere on the banks of shoal creek about a mile west of the city three young men living in austin recently became possessed of what they thought was a clue of the whereabouts of the treasure and thursday night they repaired to the place after dark and plied the pickaxe and shovel with great diligence for about three hours at the end of that time their efforts were rewarded by the finding of a box buried about four feet below the surface which they hastened to open the light of a lantern disclosed to their view the fleshless bones of a human skeleton with clothing still wrapping its uncanny limbs they immediately left the scene and notified the proper authorities of their ghastly find on closer examination in the left breast pocket of the skeleton s coat there was found a flat oblong packet of papers cut through and through in three places by a knife blade and so completely soaked and clotted with blood that it had become an almost indistinguishable mass with the aid of a microscope and the exercise of a little imagination this

mournful minstrelsy pewee pewee doth it ever cry a sad sweet minor threnody that threads the aisles of the dim hot grove like a tale of a wrong or a vanished love and the fancy comes that the wee dun bird perchance was a maid and her heart was stirred by some lover s rhyme in a golden time and broke when the world turned false and cold and her dreams grew dark and her faith grew cold in some fairy far off clime and her soul crept into the pewee s breast and forever she cries with a strange unrest for something lost in the afternoon for something missed from the lavish june for the heart that died in the long ago for the livelong pain that pierceth so thus the pewee cries while the evening lies steeped in the languorous still sunshine rapt to the leaf and the bough rind the vine of some hopeless paradise you can tell your paper the great man said i refused an interview i have nothing to say on the question sir nothing to say to you and then he talked till the sun went down and the chickens went to roost and he seized the collar of the poor young man and never his hold he loosed and the sun went down and the moon came up and he talked till the dawn of day though he said on this

swim by i shudder when the crane strikes at his prey i turn to fly at drops of sudden rain in every little cry of bird i hear a tracking shout from every sodden leaf that s stirred i see a face frown out my soul shakes when the water rat cowed by the blue snake flies black knots from tree holes glimmer at me with accusive eyes through all the murky silence rings a cry not born of earth an endless deep unechoing thing that owns not human birth i see no colors in the sky save red as blood is red i pray to god to still that cry from pallid lips and dead one spot in all that stagnant waste i shun as moles shun light and turn my prow to make all haste to fly before the night a poisonous mound hid from the sun where crabs hold revelry where eels and fishes feed upon the thing that once was he at night i steal along the shore within my hut i creep but awful stars blink through the door to hold me from my sleep the river gurgles like his throat in little choking coves and loudly dins that phantom note from out the awful groves i shout with laughter through the night i rage in greatest glee my fears all vanish with the light oh splendid nights they be i see her weep she calls his name he answers not nor will my soul with joy is all aflame i laugh and laugh and thrill i count her teardrops as they fall i flout my daytime fears i mumble thanks to god for all these gibes and happy

out from the station on your way home i guess you have not received some seven or eight letters from me and hence your silence the mails are so unreliable that they may all have been lost if you don t get this you had better send to washington and get them to look over the dead letter office for the others i have nothing to tell you of any interest except that we all nearly froze to death last night thermometer away below degrees in the shade all night you ought by all means to come back to texas this winter you would love it more and more that same little breeze that you looked for so

the store and i think is going to work for lee among the cows wears a red sash and swears so fluently that he has been mistaken often for a member of the texas legislature if you see dr beall bow to him for me politely but distantly he refuses to waste a line upon me i suppose he is too much engaged in courting to write any letters give dr hall my profoundest regards i think about him invariably whenever he is occupying my thoughts influenced by the contents of the bugle there is an impression general at this ranch that you are president secretary and committee c of the various associations of fruit fairs sewing societies church fairs presbytery general assembly conference medical conventions and baby shows that go to make up the glory and renown of north carolina in general and while i heartily congratulate the aforesaid institutions on their having such a zealous and efficient officer i tremble lest their requirements leave you not time to favor me with a letter in reply to this and assure you that if you would so honor me i would highly appreciate the effort i would rather have a good long letter from you than many bugles in your letter be certain to refer as much as possible to the advantages of civilized life over the barbarous you might mention the theatres you see there the nice things you eat warm fires niggers to cook and bring in wood a special reference to nice beef steak would be advisable you know our being reminded of these luxuries makes us contented and happy when we hear of you people at home eating turkeys and mince pies and getting drunk christmas and having a fine time generally we become more and more reconciled to this country and would not leave it for anything i must close now as i must go and dress for the opera write soon yours very truly w s porter to dr w p beall dr beall of greensboro n c was one of young porter s dearest friends between them there was an almost regular correspondence during porter s first years in texas la salle county texas december dear doctor i send you a play a regular high art full orchestra gilt edged drama i send it to you because of old acquaintance and as a revival of old associations was i not ever ready in times gone by to generously furnish a spatula and other assistance when you did buy the succulent watermelon and was it not by my connivance and help that you did oft from the gentle oscar mayo skates entice but i digress i think that i have so concealed the identity of the characters introduced that no one will be able to place them as they all appear under fictitious names although i admit that many of the incidents and scenes were suggested by actual experiences of the author in your city you will of course introduce the play upon the stage if proper arrangements can be made i have not yet had an opportunity of ascertaining whether edwin booth john mccullough or henry irving can be secured however i will leave all such matters to your judgment and taste some few suggestions i will make with regard to the mounting of the piece which may be of value to you discrimination will be necessary in selecting a fit person to represent the character of bill slax the tramp the part is that of a youth of great beauty and noble manners temporarily under a cloud and is generally rather difficult to fill properly the other minor characters such as damfools citizens police customers countrymen c can be very easily supplied especially the first let it be announced in the patriot for several days that in front of benbow hall at a certain hour a man will walk a tight rope seventy feet from the ground who has never made the attempt before that the exhibition will be free and that the odds are to that the man will be killed a large crowd will gather then let the guilford grays charge one side the reidsville light infantry the other with fixed bayonets and a man with a hat commence taking up a collection in the rear by this means they can be readily driven into the hall and the door locked i have studied a long time about devising a plan for obtaining pay from the audience and have finally struck upon the only feasible one i think after the performance let some one come out on the stage and announce that james forbis will speak two hours the result easily explainable by philosophical and psychological reasons will be as follows the minds of the audience elated and inspired by the hope of immediate departure when confronted by such a terror inspiring and dismal prospect will collapse with the fearful reaction which will take place and for a space of time they will remain in a kind of comatose farewell vain world condition now as this is the time when the interest of the evening is at its highest pitch let the melodious strains of the orchestra steal forth as a committee appointed by the managers of lawyers druggists doctors and revenue officers go around and relieve the audience of the price of admission for each one where one person has no money let it be made up from another but on no account let the whole sum taken be more than the just amount at usual rates as i said before the characters in the play are purely imaginary and therefore not to be confounded with real persons but lest any one feeling some of the idiosyncrasies and characteristics apply too forcibly to his own high moral and irreproachable self should allow his warlike and combative spirits to arise you might as you go kind of casually like produce the impression that i rarely miss my aim with a colt s forty five but if that does not have the effect of quieting the splenetic individual and be still thirsts for bill slax s gore just inform him that if he comes out here he can t get any whiskey within two days journey of my present abode and water will have to be his only beverage while on the warpath this i am sure will avert the bloody and direful conflict accept my lasting regards and professions of respect ever yours bill slax to dr w p beall my dear doctor i wish you a happy c and all that sort of thing don t you know c c i send you a few little productions in the way of poetry c which of course were struck off in an idle moment some of the pictures are not good likenesses and so i have not labelled them which you may do as fast as you discover whom they represent as some of them resemble others more than themselves but the poems are good without exception and will compare favorably with baron alfred s latest on spring i have just come from a hunt in which i mortally wounded a wild hog and as my boots are full of thorns i can t write any longer than this paper will contain for it s all i ve got because i m too tired to write any more for the reason that i have no news to tell i see by the patriot that you are superintendent of public health and assure you that all such upward rise as you make like that will ever be witnessed with interest and pleasure by me c c give my regards to dr and mrs hall it would be uncomplimentary to your powers of perception as well as superfluous to say that i will now close and remain yours truly w s porter to dr w p beall la salle county texas february my dear doctor your appreciated epistle of the th received i was very glad to hear from you i hope to hear again if such irrelevant correspondence will not interfere with your duties as public health eradicator which i believe is the office you hold under county authority i supposed the very dramatic shakespearian comedy to be the last as i heard nothing from you previous before your letter and was about to write another of a more exciting character introducing several bloody single combats a dynamite explosion a ladies oyster supper for charitable purposes c also comprising some mysterious sub rosa transactions known only to myself and a select few new songs and dances and the greensboro poker club having picked up a few points myself relative to this latter amusement i feel competent to give a lucid glittering portrait of the scenes presented under its auspices but if the former drama has reached you safely i will refrain from burdening you any more with the labors of general stage manager c if long hair part of a sombrero mexican spurs c would make a fellow famous i already occupy a topmost niche in the temple frame if my wild untamed aspect had not been counteracted by my well known benevolent and amiable expression of countenance i would have been arrested long ago by the rangers on general suspicions of murder and horse stealing in fact i owe all my present means of lugubrious living to my desperate and bloodthirsty appearance combined with the confident and easy way in which i tackle a winchester rifle there is a gentleman who lives about fifteen miles from the ranch who for amusement and recreation and not altogether without an eye to the profit keeps a general merchandise store this gent for the first few months has been trying very earnestly to sell me a little paper which i would like much to have but am not anxious to purchase said paper is my account receipted occasionally he is absent and the welcome news coming to my ear i mount my fiery boss and gallop wildly up to the store enter with something of the sang froid grace abandon and recherche nonchalance with which charles yates ushers ladies and gentlemen to their seats in the opera house and nervously fingering my butcher knife fiercely demand goods and chattels of the clerk this plan always succeeds this is by way of explanation of this vast and unnecessary stationery of which this letter is composed i am always in too big a hurry to demur at kind and quality but when i get to town i will write you on small gilt edged paper that would suit even the fastidious and discriminating taste of a logan when i get to the city which will be shortly i will send you some account of this country and its inmates you are right i have almost forgotten what a regular old gum chewing ice cream destroying opera ticket vortex ivory clawing girl looks like last summer a very fair specimen of this kind ranged over about fort snell and i used to ride over twice a week on mail days and chew the end of my riding whip while she stood on the bridge and gathered up shells on the sea shore and wore the golden slippers but she has vamoosed and my ideas on the subject are again growing dim if you see anybody about to start to texas to live especially to this part if you will take your scalpyouler and sever the jugular vein cut the brachiopod artery and hamstring him after he knows what you have done for him he will rise and call you blessed this country is a silent but eloquent refutation of bob ingersoll s theory a man here gets prematurely insane melancholy and unreliable and finally dies of lead poisoning in his boots while in a good old land like greensboro a man can die as they do every day with all the benefits of the clergy w s porter austin texas april dear dave i take my pen in hand to let you know that i am well and hope these few lines will find you as well as can be expected i carried out your parting injunction of a floral nature with all the solemnity and sacredness that i would have bestowed upon a dying man s last request promptly at half past three i repaired to the robbers den commonly known as radams horticultural and vegetable emporium and secured the high priced offerings according to promise i asked if the bouquets were ready and the polite but piratical gentleman in charge pointed proudly to two objects on the counter reposing in a couple of vases and said they were i then told him i feared there was some mistake as no buttonhole bouquets had been ordered but he insisted on his former declaration and so i brought them away and sent them to their respective destinations i thought it a pity to spoil a good deck of cards by taking out only one so i bundled up the whole deck and inserted them in the bouquet but finally concluded it would not be right to violet joke my promise and i rose joke superior to such a mean trick and sent only one as directed i have a holiday to day as it is san jacinto day thermopylae had its messenger of defeat but the alamo had none mr president and fellow citizens those glorious heroes who fell for their country on the bloody field of san jacinto etc there is a bazaar to night in

we will see you soon yours as ever w s p austin texas april dear dave i received your letter in answer to mine which you never got till sometime after you had written i snatch a few moments from my arduous labors to reply the colorado has been on the biggest boom i have seen since in the pyrotechnical and not strictly grammatical language of the statesman the cruel devastating flood swept on a dreadful holocaust of swollen turbid waters surging and dashing in mad fury which have never been equalled in human history a pitiable sight was seen the morning after the flood six hundred men out of employment were seen standing on the banks of the river gazing at the rushing stream laden with debris of every description a wealthy new york banker who was present noticing the forlorn appearance of these men at once began to collect a subscription for them appealing in eloquent terms for help for these poor sufferers by the flood he collected one dollar and five horn buttons the dollar he had given himself he learned on inquiry that these men had not been at any employment in six years and all they had lost by the flood was a few fishing poles the banker put his dollar in his pocket and stepped up to the pearl saloon as you will see by this morning s paper there is to be a minstrel show next wednesday for benefit of austin grays i attended the rehearsal last night but am better this morning and the doctor thinks i will pull through with careful attention the jokes are mostly mildewed rockribbed and ancient as the sun i can give you no better idea of the tout ensemble and sine die of the affair than to state that scuddy is going to sing a song mrs harrell brought a lot of crystallized fruits from new orleans for you she wants to know if she shall send them around on bois d arc or keep them til you return answer write to your father he thinks you are leaving him out writing to everybody else first write we have the boss trick here now have sold about ten boxes of cigars

on top of them you lay a small die with the six up that will fit easily in the hole without being noticed you lay the four nickels over this and all presents the appearance of a stack of nickels you do all this privately so everybody will suppose it is nothing but a stack of five cent pieces you then lay another small die on top of the stack with the ace up you have a small tin cup shaped like this illustration made for the purpose you let everybody see the ace and then say you propose to turn the ace into a six you lay the tin cup carefully over the stack this way and feel around in your pocket for a pencil and not finding one the rest of this letter is lost austin texas may dear dave i received your two letters and have commenced two or three in reply but always failed to say what i wanted to and destroyed them all i heard from joe that you would probably remain in colorado i hope you will succeed in making a good thing out of it if you conclude to do so but would like to see you back again in austin if there is anything i can do for you here let me know town is fearfully dull except for the frequent raids of the servant girl annihilators who make things lively during the dead hours of the night if it were not for them items of interest would be very scarce as you may see by the statesman our serenading party has developed new and alarming modes of torture for our helpless and sleeping victims last thursday night we loaded up a small organ on a hack and with our other usual instruments made an assault upon the quiet air of midnight that made the atmosphere turn pale after going the rounds we were halted on the avenue by fritz hartkopf and ordered into his salon we went in carrying the organ etc a large crowd of bums immediately gathered prominent among which were to be seen percy james theodore hillyer randolph burmond charlie hicks and after partaking freely of lemonade we wended our way down and were duly halted and treated in the same manner by other hospitable gentlemen we were called in at several places while wit and champagne rhein wine etc flowed in a most joyous and hilarious manner it was one of the most recherche and per diem affairs ever known in the city nothing occurred to mar the pleasure of the hour except a trifling incident that might be construed as malapropos and post meridian by the hypercritical mr charles sims on attempting to introduce mr charles hicks and your humble servant to young ladies where we had been invited inside forgot our names and required to be informed on the subject before proceeding yours w s p austin texas december dear dave everything wept at your departure especially the clouds last night the clouds had a silver lining three dollars and a half s worth i fulfilled your engagement in grand tout ensemble style but there is a sad bon jour look about the thirty eight cents left in my vest pocket that would make a hired man weep all day long the heavens wept and the heavy sombre clouds went drifting about over head and the north wind howled in maniacal derision and the hack drivers danced on the pavements in wild fierce glee for they knew too well what the stormy day betokened the hack was to call for me at eight at five minutes to eight i went upstairs and dressed in my usual bijou and operatic style and rolled away to the opera emma sang finely i applauded at the wrong times and praised her rendering of the chromatic scale when she was performing on c flat andante pianissimo but otherwise the occasion passed off without anything to mar the joyousness of the hour everybody was there isidor moses and john ireland and fritz hartkopf and prof herzog and bill stacy and all the bong ton elight you will receive a draft to day through the first national bank of colorado for which you will please honor there is no news or there are no news either you like to tell lavaca street is very happy and quiet and enjoys life for jones was sat on by his uncle wash and feels humble and

eastern sky by the rosy fingers of aurora at noon the foul ogre cribbage stalks rampant and seven up for dim distant oysters that only the eye of faith can see the hour grows late the clock strikes another day has vanished gone into the dim recesses of the past leaving its record of misspent hours false hopes and disappointed expectations may a morrow dawn that will bring recompense and requital

your depths the stars do not reflect themselves in your waters they are too dark and troubled and swift what shall we find in your depths rest peace catfish who knows tis but a moment a leap a plunge and then oblivion or another world who can tell a man once dived into your depths and brought up a horse collar and a hoop skirt ah what do we know of the beyond we know that death comes and we return

calliope six handed euchre grover cleveland hill city quartette johnson an early parable in one of his early letters written from austin o henry wrote a long parable that was evidently to tell his correspondent some of the local gossip here it is once upon a time there was a maiden in a land not fax away a maiden of much beauty and rare accomplishments she was beloved by all on account of her goodness of heart and her many charms of disposition her father was a great lord rich and powerful and a mighty man and he loved his daughter with exceeding great love and he cared for her with jealous and loving watchfulness lest any harm should befall her or even the least discomfort should mar her happiness and cause any trouble in her smooth and peaceful life the cunningest masters were engaged to teach her from her youngest days she played upon the harpsichord the loveliest and sweetest music she wrought fancy work in divers strange and wonderful forms that might puzzle all beholders as to what manner of things they might be she sang and all listeners hearkened thereunto as to the voice of an angel she danced stately minuets with the gay knights as graceful as a queen and as light as the thistledown borne above the clover blossoms by the wind she could paint upon china rare and unknown flowers the like unto which man never saw in colors crimson and blue and yellow glorious to behold she conversed in unknown tongues whereof no man knew the meaning and sense and created wild admiration in all by the ease and grace with which she did play upon a new and strange instrument of wondrous sound and structure which she called a banjo she had gone into a strange land far away beyond the rivers that flowed through her father s dominion farther than one could see from the highest castle tower up into the land of ice and snow where wise men famous for learning and ancient lore had gathered together from many lands and countries the daughters of great men kings and powerful rulers railroad men bankers mighty men who wished to bring up their children to be wise and versed in all things old and new here the princess abode for many seasons and she sat at the feet of old wise men who could tell of the world s birth and the stars and read the meaning of the forms of the rocks that make the high mountains and knew the history of all created things that are and here she learned to speak strange tongues and studied the deep mysteries of the past the secrets of the ancients chaldic lore etruscan inscription hidden and mystic sciences and knew the names of all the flowers and things that grow in fields or wood even unto the tiniest weed by the brook in due time the princess came back to her father s castle the big bell boomed from the high tower the heavy iron gates were thrown open banners floated all along the battlemented walls and in the grand hall servants and retainers hurried to and fro bearing gold dishes and great bowls of flaming smoking punch while oxen were roasted whole and hogsheads of ale tapped on the common by the castle walls and thither hied them the villagers one and all to make merry at the corning of the dear princess again she will come back so wise and learned they said so far above us that she will not notice us as she did once but not so the princess with a red rose in her hair and dressed so plain and neat that she looked more like a farmer s daughter than a great king s came down among them from her father s side with nods of love and welcome on her lips and a smile upon her face and took them by the hands as in the old days and none among them so lowly or so poor but what received a kind word from the gracious princess and carried away in their hearts glad feelings that she was still the same noble and gracious lady she always was then night came and torches by thousands lit up the great forest and musicians played and bonfires glowed with sparks flying like myriads of stars among the gloomy trees in the great castle hall were gathered the brave knights and the fairest ladies in the kingdom the jolly old king surrounded by the wise men and officers of state moved about among his guests stately and courteous ravishing music burst forth from all sides and down the hall moved the fair princess in the mazy dance on the arm of a knight who gazed upon her face in rapt devotion and love who was he that dared to look thus upon the daughter of the king sovereign prince of the kingdom and the heiress of her father s wealth and lands he had no title no proud name to place beside a royal one beyond that of an honorable knight but who says that that is not a title that borne worthily makes a man the peer of any that wears a crown he had loved her long when a boy they had roamed together in the great forest about the castle and played among the fountains of the court like brother and sister the king saw them together often and smiled and went his way and said nothing the years went on and they were together as much as they could be the summer days when the court went forth into the forest mounted on prancing steeds to chase the stags with hounds all clad in green and gold with waving plumes and shining silver and ribbons of gay colors this knight was by the princess side to guide her through the pathless swamps where the hunt ranged and saw that no harm came to her and now that she had come back after years of absence he went to her with fear lest she should have changed for her old self and would not be to him as she was when they were boy and girl together but no there was the same old kindly welcome the same smiling greeting the warm pressure of the hand the glad look in the eyes as of yore the knight s heart beat wildly and a dim new awakened hope arose in him was she too far away after all he felt worthy of her and of any one in fact but he was without riches only a knight errant with his sword for his fortune and his great love his only title and he had always refrained from ever telling her anything of his love for his pride prevented him and you know a poor girl even though she be a princess cannot say to a man i am rich but let that be no bar between us i am yours and will let my wealth pass if you will give up your pride no princess can say this and the knight s pride would not let him say anything of the kind and so you see there was small chance of their ever coming to an understanding well the feasting and dancing went on and the knight and the princess danced and sang together and walked out where the moon was making a white wonder of the great fountain and wandered under the rows of great oaks but spoke no word of love though no mortal man knows what thoughts passed in their heads and she gave long accounts of the wonders she had seen in the far icy north in the great school of wise men and the knight talked of the wild and savage men he had seen in the far west where he had been in battles with the heathen in a wild and dreary land and she heard with pity his tales of suffering and trials in the desert among wild animals and fierce human kings and inside the castle the music died away and the lights grew dim and the villagers had long since gone to their homes and the knight and the princess still talked of old times and the moon climbed high in the eastern sky one day there came news from a country far to the west where lay the possessions of the knight the enemy had robbed him of his treasure driven away his cattle and he found it was best to hie him away and rescue his inheritance and goods he buckled on his sword and mounted his good war horse he rode to the postern gate of the castle to make his adieus to the princess when he told her he was going away to the wild western country to do battle with the heathen she grew pale and her eyes took on a look of such pain and fear that the knight s heart leaped and then sank in his bosom a his pride still kept him from speaking the words that might have made all well she bade him farewell in a low voice and tears even stood in leer eyes but what could she say or do the knight put spurs to his horse and dashed away over the hills without ever looking back and the princess stood looking over the gate at him till the last sight of his plume below the brow of the hill the knight was gone many suitors flocked about the princess mighty lords and barons of great wealth were at her feet and attended her every journey they came and offered themselves and their fortunes again and again but none of them found favor in her eyes will the princess listen to no one they began to say among themselves has she given her heart to some one who is not among us no one could say a great and mighty physician young and of wondrous power in his art telephoned to her every night if he might come down how his suit prospered no one could tell but he persevered with great and astonishing diligence a powerful baron who assisted in regulating the finances of the kingdom and who was a direct descendant of a great prince who was cast into a lion s den knelt at her feet a gay and lively lord who lived in a castle hung with ribbons and streamers and gay devices of all kinds with other nobles of like character prostrated themselves before her but she would listen to none of them the princess rode about in quiet ways in the cool evenings upon a gray palfrey alone and very quiet and she seemed to grow silent and thoughtful as time went on and no news came from the western wars and the knight came not back again to his daughter margaret toledo ohio oct dear margaret i got your very nice long letter a good many days ago it didn t come straight to me but went to a wrong address first i was very glad indeed to hear from you and

mrs hale is up in maine for a weeks vacation say bill i m sending your ms back by mail to day i kept it a little longer after you sent for it because one of the mcclure phillips firm wanted to see it first everybody says it is full of good stuff but thinks it should be put in a more connected shape by some skilful writer who has been trained to that sort work it seems to me that you ought to do better with it out there than you could here if you can get somebody out there to publish it it ought to sell all right n y is a pretty cold proposition and it can t see as far as the oklahoma country when it is looking for sales how about trying indianapolis or chicago duffy told me about the other ms sent out by your friend abbott kind of a bum friendly trick wasn t it why don t you get arizona s hand done and send it on seems to me you could handle a short story all right my regards to mrs jennings and bro frank write some more still bill dear jennings n y may got your letter all right hope you ll follow it soon i d advise you not to build any high hopes on your book just consider that you re on a little pleasure trip and taking it along as a side line mighty few mss ever get to be books

let me know in advance a day or two gallot is in grand rapids maybe he will run over for a day or two in haste and truly yours w s p it was hard to get o henry to take an interest in his books he was always eager to be at the undone work to be writing a new story instead of collecting old ones this letter came from north carolina it shows how much thought he gave always to titles land o the sky monday my dear colonel steger as i wired you to day i like man about town for a title but i am sending in a few others for you to look at and if any other suits you better i m agreeable here they are in preferred order the venturers transfers merry go rounds babylonica brickdust from babel babes in the jungle if none of these hit you right let me know and i ll get busy again but i think man about town is about the right thing it gives the city idea without using the old hackneyed words i am going to write you a letter in a day or so touchin on and appertainin to other matters and topics i am still improving and feeling pretty good colonel bingham has put in a new ash sifter and expects you to come down and see that it works all right all send regards to you you seem to have made quite a hit down here for a yankee salutations and good wishes yours s p this letter was found unfinished among his papers after his death his publishers had discussed many times his writing of a novel but the following letter constitutes the only record of his own opinions in the matter the date is surely or my dear mr steger my idea is to write the story of a man an individual not a type but a man who at the same time i want to represent a human nature type if such a person could exist the story will teach no lesson inculcate no moral advance no theory i want it to be something that it won t or can t be but as near as i can make it the true record of a man s thoughts his description of his mischances and adventures his true opinions of life as he has seen it and his absolutely honest deductions comments and views upon the different phases of life that he passes through i do not remember ever to have read an autobiography a biography or a piece of fiction that told the truth of course i have read stuff such as rousseau and zola and george moore and various memoirs that were supposed to be window panes in their respective breasts but mostly all of them were either liars actors or posers of course i m not trying to belittle the greatness of their literary expression all of us have to be prevaricators hypocrites and liars every day of our lives otherwise the social structure would fall into pieces the first day we must act in one another s presence just as we must wear clothes it is for the best the trouble about writing the truth has been that the writers have kept in their minds one or another or all of three thoughts that made a handicap they were trying either to do a piece of immortal literature or to shock the public or to please editors some of them succeeded in all three but they did not write the truth most autobiographies are insincere from beginning to end about the only chance for the truth to be told is in fiction it is well understood that all the truth cannot be told in print but how about nothing but the truth that s what i want to do i want the man who is telling the story to tell it not as he would to a reading public or to a confessor but something in this way suppose he were marooned on an island in mid ocean with no hope of ever being rescued and in order to pass away some of the time he should tell a story to himself embodying his adventure and experiences and opinions having a certain respect for himself let us hope he would leave out the realism that he would have no chance of selling in the market he would omit the lies and self conscious poses and would turn out to his one auditor something real and true so as truth is not to be found in history autobiography press reports nor at the bottom of an h g wells let us hope that fiction may be the means of bringing out a few grains of it the hero of the story will be a man born and raised in a somnolent little southern town his education is about a common school one but he learns afterward from reading and life i m going to try to give him a style in narrative and speech the best i ve got in the shop i m going to take him through all the main phases of life wild adventure city society something of the under world and among many characteristic planes of the phases i want him to acquire all the sophistication that experience can give him and always preserve his individual honest human view and have him tell the truth about everything it is time to say now that by the truth i don t mean the objectionable stuff that so often masquerades under the name i mean true opinions a true estimate of all things as they seem to the hero if you find a word or a suggestive line or sentence in any of my copy you cut it out and deduct it from the royalties i want this man to be a man of natural intelligence of individual character absolutely open and broad minded and show how the creator of the earth has got him in a rat trap put him here willy nilly you know the omar verse and then i want to show what he does about it there is always the eternal question from the primal source what are you going to do about it please don t think for the half of a moment that the story is going to be anything of an autobiography i have a distinct character in my mind for the part and he does not at all here the letter ends he never finished it the story of holding up a train in sixes and sevens there appears an article entitled holding up a train now the facts were given to o henry by an old and dear friend who in his wild avenging youth had actually held up trains to day he is mr al jennings of oklahoma city okla a prominent attorney he has permitted the publication of two letters o henry wrote him the first outlining the story as he thought his friend jennings ought to write it and the second announcing that with o henry s revision the manuscript had been accepted from w s porter to al jennings september st year not given but probably dear pard in regard to that article i will give you my idea of what is wanted say we take for a title the art and humor of the hold up or something like that i would suggest that in writing you assume a character we have got to respect the conventions and delusions of the public to a certain extent an article written as you would naturally write it would be regarded as a fake and an imposition remember that the traditions must be preserved wherever they will not interfere with the truth write in as simple plain and unembellished a style as you know how make your sentences short put in as much realism and as many facts as possible where you want to express an opinion or comment on the matter do it as practically and plainly as you can give it life and the vitality of facts now i will give you a sort of general synopsis of my idea of course everything is subject to your own revision and change the article we will say is written by a typical train hoister one without your education and powers of expression bouquet but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from his standpoint not from john wanamaker s yet in order to please john we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in and on the contrary do not depreciate a profession that is really only fnanciering with spurs on describe the facts and details all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his hands up in a pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see here is a rough draft of my idea begin abruptly without any philosophizing with your idea of the best times places and conditions for the hold up compare your opinions of this with those of others mention some poorly conceived attempts and failures of others giving your opinion why as far as possible refer to actual occurrences and incidents describe the manner of a hold up how many men is best where they are stationed how do they generally go into it nervous or joking or solemnly the details of stopping the train the duties of each man of the gang the behavior of the train crew and passengers here give as many brief odd and humorous incidents as you can think of your opinions on going through the passengers when is it done and when not done how is the boodle gotten at how does the express clerk generally take it anything done with the mail car under what circumstances will a train robber shoot a passenger or a train man suppose a man refuses to throw up his hands queer articles found on passengers a chance here for some imaginative work queer and laughable incidents of any kind refer whenever apropos to actual hold ups and facts concerning them of interest what could two or three brave and determined passengers do if they were to try why don t they try how long does it take to do the business does the train man ever stand in with the hold up best means of getting away how and when is the money divided how is it mostly spent best way to manoeuvre afterward how to get caught and how not to comment on the methods of officials who try to capture here s your chance to get even these ideas are some that occur to me casually you will of course have many far better i suggest that you make the article anywhere from to words get as much meat in it as you can and by the way stuff it full of western genuine slang not the eastern story paper kind get all the quaint cowboy expressions and terms of speech you can think of information is what we want clothed in the peculiar western style of the character we want to present the main idea is to be natural direct and concise i hope you will understand what i say i don t but try her a whack and send it along as soon as you can and let s see what we can do by the way mr everybody pays good prices i thought i would when i get your story put it into the shape my judgment decides upon and then send both your ms and mine to the magazine if he uses mine we ll whack up shares on the proceeds if he uses yours you get the check direct if he uses neither we are out only a few stamps sincerely your friend w s p and here is the letter telling his pard that the article had been bought by everybody s magazine this is dated pittsburg october th obviously the same year dear pard you re it i always told you you were a genius all you need is to succeed in order to make a success i enclose your letter which explains itself when you see your baby in print don t blame me if you find strange ear marks and brands on it i slashed it and cut it and added lots of stuff that never happened but i followed your facts and ideas and that is what made it valuable i ll think up some other idea for an article and we ll collaborate again some time eh i have all the work i can do and am selling it right along have averaged about per month since august st and yet i don t overwork don t think i ever will i commence about a m and generally knock off about or p m as soon as check mentioned in letter comes i ll send you your sheer of the boodle by the way please keep my nom de plume strictly to yourself i don t want any one to know just yet give my big regards to billy reason with him and try to convince him that we believe him to be pure merino and of more than average width with the kindest remembrances to yourself i remain your friend w s p at this time o henry was unknown and thought himself lucky to sell a story at any price strictly business more stories of the four million strictly business i suppose you know all about the stage and stage people you ve been touched with and by actors and you read the newspaper criticisms and the jokes in the weeklies about the rialto and the chorus girls and the long haired tragedians and i suppose that a condensed list of your ideas about the mysterious stageland would boil down to something like this leading ladies have five husbands paste diamonds and figures no better than your own madam if they weren t padded chorus girls are inseparable from peroxide panhards and pittsburg all shows walk back to new york on tan oxford and railroad ties irreproachable actresses reserve the comic landlady part for their mothers on broadway and their step aunts on the road kyrle bellew s real name is boyle o kelley the ravings of john mccullough in the phonograph were stolen from the first sale of the ellen terry memoirs joe weber is funnier than e h sothern but henry miller is getting older than he was all theatrical people on leaving the theatre at night drink champagne and eat lobsters until noon the next day after all the moving pictures have got the whole bunch pounded to a pulp now few of us know the real life of the stage people if we did the profession might be more overcrowded than it is we look askance at the players with an eye full of patronizing superiority and we go home and practise all sorts of elocution and gestures in front of our looking glasses latterly there has been much talk of the actor people in a new light it seems to have been divulged that instead of being motoring bacchanalias and diamond hungry loreleis they are businesslike folk students and ascetics with childer and homes and libraries owning real estate and conducting their private affairs in as orderly and unsensational a manner as any of us good citizens who are bound to the chariot wheels of the gas rent coal ice and wardmen whether the old or the new report of the sock and buskiners be the true one is a surmise that has no place here i offer you merely this little story of two strollers and for proof of its truth i can show you only the dark patch above the cast iron of the stage entrance door of keetor s old vaudeville theatre made there by the petulant push of gloved hands too impatient to finger the clumsy thumb latch and where i last saw cherry whisking through like a swallow into her nest on time to the minute as usual to dress for her act the vaudeville team of hart cherry was an inspiration but hart had been roaming through the eastern and western circuits for four years with a mixed up act comprising a monologue three lightning changes with songs a couple of imitations of celebrated imitators and a buck and wing dance that had drawn a glance of approval from the bass viol player in more than one house than which no performer ever received more satisfactory evidence of good work the greatest treat an actor can have is to witness the pitiful performance with which all other actors desecrate the stage in order to give himself this pleausre he will often forsake the sunniest broadway corner between thirty fourth and forty fourth to attend a matin ee offering by his less gifted brothers once during the lifetime of a minstrel joke one comes to scoff and remains to go through with that most difficult exercise of thespian muscles the audible contact of the palm of one hand against the palm of the other one afternoon bob hart presented his solvent serious well known vaudevillian face at the box office window of a rival attraction and got his d h coupon for an orchestra seat a b c and d glowed successively on the announcement spaces and passed into oblivion each plunging mr hart deeper into gloom others of the audience shrieked squirmed whistled and applauded but bob hart all the mustard and a whole show in himself sat with his face as long and his hands as far apart as a boy holding a hank of yarn for his grandmother to wind into a ball but when h came on the mustard suddenly sat up straight h was the happy alphabetical prognosticator of winona cherry in character songs and impersonations there were scarcely more than two bites to cherry but she delivered the merchandise tied with a pink cord and charged to the old man s account she first showed you a deliciously dewy and ginghamy country girl with a basket of property daisies who informed you ingenuously that there were other things to be learned at the old log school house besides cipherin and nouns especially when the teach er kept me in vanishing with a quick flirt of gingham apron strings she reappeared in considerably less than a trice as a fluffy parisienne so near does art bring the old red mill to the moulin rouge and then but you know the rest and so did bob hart but he saw somebody else he thought he saw that cherry was the only professional on the short order stage that he had seen who seemed exactly to fit the part of helen grimes in the sketch he had written and kept tucked away in the tray of his trunk of course bob hart as well as every other normal actor grocer newspaper man professor curb broker and farmer has a play tucked away somewhere they tuck em in trays of trunks trunks of trees desks haymows pigeonholes inside pockets safe deposit vaults handboxes and coal cellars waiting for mr frohman to call they belong among the fifty seven different kinds but bob hart s sketch was not destined to end in a pickle jar he called it mice will play he had kept it quiet and hidden away ever since he wrote it waiting to find a partner who fitted his conception of helen grimes and here was helen herself with all the innocent abandon the youth the sprightliness and the flawless stage art that his critical taste demanded after the act was over hart found the manager in the box office and got cherry s address at five the next afternoon he called at the musty old house in the west forties and sent up his professional card by daylight in a secular shirtwaist and plain voile skirt with her hair curbed and her sister of charity eyes winona cherry might have been playing the part of prudence wise the deacon s daughter in the great unwritten new england drama not yet entitled anything i know your act mr hart she said after she had looked over his card carefully what did you wish to see me about i saw you work last night said hart i ve written a sketch that i ve been saving up it s for two and i think you can do the other part i thought i d see you about it come in the parlor said miss cherry i ve been wishing for something of the sort i think i d like to act instead of doing turns bob hart drew his cherished mice will play from his pocket and read it to her read it again please said miss cherry and then she pointed out to him clearly how it could be improved by introducing a messenger instead of a telephone call and cutting the dialogue just before the climax while they were struggling with the pistol and by completely changing the lines and business of helen grimes at the point where her jealousy overcomes her hart yielded to all her strictures without argument she had at once put her finger on the sketch s weaker points that was her woman s intuition that he had lacked at the end of their talk hart was willing to stake the judgment experience and savings of his four years of vaudeville that mice will play would blossom into a perennial flower in the garden of the circuits miss cherry was slower to decide after many puckerings of her smooth young brow and tappings on her small white teeth with the end of a lead pencil she gave out her dictum mr hart said she i believe your sketch is going to win out that grimes part fits me like a shrinkable flannel after its first trip to a handless hand laundry i can make it stand out like the colonel of the forty fourth regiment at a little mothers bazaar and i ve seen you work i know what you can do with the other part but business is business how much do you get a week for the stunt you do now two hundred answered hart i get one hundred for mine said cherry that s about the natural discount for a woman but i live on it and put a few simoleons every week under the loose brick in the old kitchen hearth the stage is all right i love it but there s something else i love better that s a little country home some day with plymouth rock chickens and six ducks wandering around the yard now let me tell you mr hart i am strictly business if you want me to play the opposite part in your sketch i ll do it and i believe we can make it go and there s something else i want to say there s no nonsense in my make up i m on the level and i m on the stage for what it pays me just as other girls work in stores and offices i m going to save my money to keep me when i m past doing my stunts no old ladies home or retreat for imprudent actresses for me if you want to make this a business partnership mr hart with all nonsense cut out of it i m in on it i know something about vaudeville teams in general but this would have to be one in particular i want you to know that i m on the stage for what i can cart away from it every pay day in a little manila envelope with nicotine stains on it where the cashier has licked the flap it s kind of a hobby of mine to want to cravenette myself for plenty of rainy days in the future i want you to know just how i am i don t know what an all night restaurant looks like i drink only weak tea i never spoke to a man at a stage entrance in my life and i ve got money in five savings banks miss cherry said bob hart in his smooth serious tones you re in on your own terms i ve got strictly business pasted in my hat and stenciled on my make up box when i dream of nights i always see a five room bungalow on the north shore of long island with a jap cooking clam broth and duckling in the kitchen and me with the title deeds to the place in my pongee coat pocket swinging in a hammock on the side porch reading stanleys explorations into africa and nobody else around you never was interested in africa was you miss cherry not any said cherry what i m going to do with my money is to bank it you can get four per cent on deposits even at the salary i ve been earning i ve figured out that in ten years i d have an income of about a month just from the interest alone well i might invest some of the principal in a little business say trimming hats or a beauty parlor and make more well said hart you ve got the proper idea all right all right anyhow there are mighty few actors that amount to anything at all who couldn t fix themselves for the wet days to come if they d save their money instead of blowing it i m glad you ve got the correct business idea of it miss cherry i think the same way and i believe this sketch will more than double what both of us earn now when we get it shaped up the subsequent history of mice will play is the history of all successful writings for the stage hart cherry cut it pieced it remodeled it performed surgical operations on the dialogue and business changed the lines restored em added more cut em out renamed it gave it back the old name rewrote it substituted a dagger for the pistol restored the pistol put the sketch through all the known processes of condensation and improvement they rehearsed it by the old fashioned boardinghouse clock in the rarely used parlor until its warning click at five minutes to the hour would occur every time exactly half a second before the click of the unloaded revolver that helen grimes used in rehearsing the thrilling climax of the sketch yes that was a thriller and a piece of excellent work in the act a real caliber revolver was used loaded with a real cartridge helen grimes who is a western girl of decidedly buffalo billish skill and daring is tempestuously in love with frank desmond the private secretary and confidential prospective son in law of her father arapahoe grimes quarter million dollar cattle king owning a ranch that judging by the scenery is in either the bad lands or amagensett l i desmond in private life mr bob hart wears puttees and meadow brook hunt riding trousers and gives his address as new york leaving you to wonder why he comes to the bad lands or amagansett as the case may be and at the same time to conjecture mildly why a cattleman should want puttees about his ranch with a secretary in em well anyhow you know as well as i do that we all like that kind of play whether we admit it or not something along in between bluebeard jr and cymbeline played in the russian there were only two parts and a half in mice will play hart and cherry were the two of course and the half was a minor part always played by a stage hand who merely came in once in a tuxedo coat and a panic to announce that the house was surrounded by indians and to turn down the gas fire in the grate by the manager s orders there was another girl in the sketch a fifth avenue society swelless who was visiting the ranch and who had sirened jack valentine when he was a wealthy club man on lower third avenue before he lost his money this girl appeared on the stage only in the photographic state jack had her sarony stuck up on the mantel of the amagan of the bad lands droring room helen was jealous of course and now for the thriller old arapahoe grimes dies of angina pectoris one night so helen informs us in a stage ferryboat whisper over the footlights while only his secretary was present and that same day he was known to have had in cash in his ranch library just received for the sale of a drove of beeves in the east that accounts for the price we pay for steak the cash disappears at the same time jack valentine was the only person with the ranchman when he made his alleged croak gawd knows i love him but if he has done this deed you sabe don t you and then there are some mean things said about the fifth avenue girl who doesn t come on the stage and can we blame her with the vaudeville trust holding down prices until one actually must be buttoned in the back by a call boy maids cost so much but wait here s the climax helen grimes chaparralish as she can be is goaded beyond imprudence she convinces herself that jack valentine is not only a falsetto but a financier to lose at one fell swoop and a lover in riding trousers with angles in the sides like the variations on the chart of a typhoid fever patient is enough to make any perfect lady mad so then they stand in the ranch library which is furnished with mounted elk heads didn t the elks have a fish fry in amagensett once and the d enouement begins i know of no more interesting time in the run of a play unless it be when the prologue ends helen thinks jack has taken the money who else was there to take it the box office manager was at the front on his job the orchestra hadn t left their seats and no man could get past old jimmy the stage door man unless he could show a skye terrier or an automobile as a guarantee of eligibility goaded beyond imprudence as before said helen says to jack valentine robber and thief and worse yet stealer of trusting hearts this should be your fate with that out she whips of course the trusty caliber but i will be merciful goes on helen you shall live that will be your punishment i will show you how easily i could have sent you to the death that you deserve there is her picture on the mantel i will send through her more beautiful face the bullet that should have pierced your craven heart and she does it and there s no fake blank cartridges or assistants pulling strings helen fires the bullet the actual bullet goes through the face of the photograph and then strikes the hidden spring of the sliding panel in the wall and lo the panel slides and there is the missing in convincing stacks of currency and bags of gold it s great you know how it is cherry practised for two months at a target on the roof of her boarding house it took good shooting in the sketch she had to hit a brass disk only three inches in diameter covered by wall paper in the panel and she had to stand in exactly the same spot every night and the photo had to be in exactly the same spot and she had to shoot steady and true every time of course old arapahoe had tucked the funds away there in the secret place and of course jack hadn t taken anything except his salary which really might have come under the head of obtaining money under but that is neither here nor there and of course the new york girl was really engaged to a concrete house contractor in the bronx and necessarily jack and helen ended in a half nelson and there you are after hart and cherry had gotten mice will play flawless they had a try out at a vaudeville house that accommodates the sketch was a house wrecker it was one of those rare strokes of talent that inundates a theatre from the roof down the gallery wept and the orchestra seats being dressed for it swam in tears after the show the booking agents signed blank checks and pressed fountain pens upon hart and cherry five hundred dollars a week was what it panned out that night at bob hart took off his hat and bade cherry good night at her boarding house door mr hart said she thoughtfully come inside just a few minutes we ve got our chance now to make good and make money what we want to do is to cut expenses every cent we can and save all we can right said bob it s business with me you ve got your scheme for banking yours and i dream every night of that bungalow with the jap cook and nobody around to raise trouble anything to enlarge the net receipts will engage my attention come inside just a few minutes repeated cherry deeply thoughtful i ve got a proposition to make to you that will reduce our expenses a lot and help you work out your own future and help me work out mine and all on business principles mice will play had a tremendously successful run in new york for ten weeks rather neat for a vaudeville sketch and then it started on the circuits without following it it may be said that it was a solid drawing card for two years without a sign of abated popularity sam packard manager of one of keetor s new york houses said of hart cherry as square and high toned a little team as ever came over the circuit it s a pleasure to read their names on the booking list quiet hard workers no johnny and mabel nonsense on the job to the minute straight home after their act and each of em as gentlemanlike as a lady i don t expect to handle any attractions that give me less trouble or more respect for the profession and now after so much cracking of a nutshell here is the kernel of the story at the end of its second season mice will play came back to new york for another run at the roof gardens and summer theatres there was never any trouble in booking it at the top notch price bob hart had his bungalow nearly paid for and cherry had so many savings deposit bank books that she had begun to buy sectional bookcases on the instalment plan to hold them i tell you these things to assure you even if you can t believe it that many very many of the stage people are workers with abiding ambitions just the same as the man who wants to be president or the grocery clerk who wants a home in flatbush or a lady who is anxious to flop out of the count pan into the prince fire and i hope i may be allowed to say without chipping into the contribution basket that they often move in a mysterious way their wonders to perform but listen at the first performance of mice will play in new york at the westphalia no hams alluded to theatre winona cherry was nervous when she fired at the photograph of the eastern beauty on the mantel the bullet instead of penetrating the photo and then striking the disk went into the lower left side of bob hart s neck not expecting to get it there hart collapsed neatly while cherry fainted in a most artistic manner the audience surmising that they viewed a comedy instead of a tragedy in which the principals were married or reconciled applauded with great enjoyment the cool head who always graces such occasions rang the curtain down and two platoons of scene shifters respectively and more or less respectfully removed hart cherry from the stage the next turn went on and all went as merry as an alimony bell the stage hands found a young doctor at the stage entrance who was waiting for a patient with a decoction of am b ty roses the doctor examined hart carefully and laughed heartily no headlines for you old sport was his diagnosis if it had been two inches to the left it would have undermined the carotid artery as far as the red front drug store in flatbush and back again as it is you just get the property man to bind it up with a flounce torn from any one of the girls valenciennes and go home and get it dressed by the parlor floor practitioner on your block and you ll be all right excuse me i ve got a serious case outside to look after after that bob hart looked up and felt better and then to where he lay came vincente the tramp juggler great in his line vincente a solemn man from brattleboro vt named sam griggs at home sent toys and maple sugar home to two small daughters from every town he played vincente had moved on the same circuits with hart cherry and was their peripatetic friend bob said vincente in his serious way i m glad it s no worse the little lady is wild about you who asked hart cherry said the juggler we didn t know how bad you were hurt and we kept her away it s taking the manager and three girls to hold her it was an accident of course said hart cherry s all right she wasn t feeling in good trim or she couldn t have done it there s no hard feelings she s strictly business the doctor says i ll be on the job again in three days don t let her worry man said sam griggs severely puckering his old smooth lined face are you a chess automaton or a human pincushion cherry s crying her heart out for you calling bob bob every second with them holding her hands and keeping her from coming to you what s the matter with her asked hart with wide open eyes the sketch ll go on again in three days i m not hurt bad the doctor says she won t lose out half a week s salary i know it was an accident what s the matter with her you seem to be blind or a sort of a fool said vincente the girl loves you and is almost mad about your hurt what s the matter with you is she nothing to you i wish you could hear her call you loves me asked bob hart rising from the stack of scenery on which he lay cherry loves me why it s impossible i wish you could see her and hear her said griggs but man said bob hart sitting up it s impossible it s impossible i tell you i never dreamed of such a thing no human being said the tramp juggler could mistake it she s wild for love of you how have you been so blind but my god said bob hart rising to his feet it s too late it s too late i tell you sam it s too late it can t be you must be wrong it s impossible there s some mistake she s crying for you said the tramp juggler for love of you she s fighting three and calling your name so loud they don t dare to raise the curtain wake up man for love of me said bob hart with staring eyes don t i tell you it s too late it s too late man why cherry and i have been married two years the gold that glittered a story with a moral appended is like the bill of a mosquito it bores you and then injects a stinging drop to irritate your conscience therefore let us have the moral first and be done with it all is not gold that glitters but it is a wise child that keeps the stopper in his bottle of testing acid where broadway skirts the corner of the square presided over by

but succeed the general bewildered and dismayed by the resounding streets welcomed his deliverer as a caballero with a most disinterested heart i have a desire said the general to return to the hotel of o brien in which i am stop caramba se or there is a loudness and rapidness of going and coming in the city of this nueva york mr kelley s politeness would not suffer the distinguished colombian to brave the dangers of the return unaccompanied at the door of the hotel espanol they paused a little lower down on the opposite side of the street shone the modest illuminated sign of el refugio mr kelley to whom few streets were unfamiliar knew the place exteriorly as a dago joint all foreigners mr kelley classed under the two heads of dagoes and frenchmen he proposed to the general that they repair thither and substantiate their acquaintance with a liquid foundation an hour later found general falcon and mr kelley seated at a table in the conspirator s corner of el refugio bottles and glasses were between them for the tenth time the general confided the secret of his mission to the estados unidos he was here he declared to purchase arms stands of winchester rifles for the colombian revolutionists he had drafts in his pocket drawn by the cartagena bank on its new york correspondent for at other tables other revolutionists were shouting their political secrets to their fellow plotters but none was as loud as the general he pounded the table he hallooed for some wine he roared to his friend that his errand was a secret one and not to be hinted at to a living soul mr kelley himself was stirred to sympathetic enthusiasm he grasped the general s hand across the table monseer he said earnestly i don t know where this country of yours is but i m for it i guess it must be a branch of the united states though for the poetry guys and the schoolmarms call us columbia too sometimes it s a lucky thing for you that you butted into me to night i m the only man in new york that can get this gun deal through for you the secretary of war of the united states is me best friend he s in the city now and i ll see him for you to morrow in the meantime monseer you keep them drafts tight in your inside pocket i ll call for you to morrow and take you to see him say that ain t the district of columbia you re talking about is it concluded mr kelley with a sudden qualm you can t capture that with no guns it s been tried with more no no no exclaimed the general it is the republic of colombia it is a g r reat republic on the top side of america of the south yes yes all right said mr kelley reassured now suppose we trek along home and go by by i ll write to the secretary to night and make a date with him it s a ticklish job to get guns out of new york mcclusky himself can t do it they parted at the door of the hotel espanol the general rolled his eyes at the moon and sighed it is a great country your nueva york he said truly the cars in the streets devastate one and the engine that cooks the nuts terribly makes a squeak in the ear but ah se or kelley the se oras with hair of much goldness and admirable fatness they are magnificas muy magnificas kelley went to the nearest telephone booth and called up mccrary s caf e far up on broadway he asked for jimmy dunn is that jimmy dunn asked kelley yes came the answer you re a liar sang back kelley joyfully your e the secretary of war wait there till i come up i ve got the finest thing down here in the way of a fish you ever baited for it s a colorado maduro with a gold band around it and free coupons enough to buy a red hall lamp and a statuette of psyche rubbering in the brook i ll be up on the next car jimmy dunn was an a m of crookdom he was an artist in the confidence line he never saw a bludgeon in his life and he scorned knockout drops in fact he would have set nothing before an intended victim but the purest of drinks if it had been possible to procure such a thing in new york it was the ambition of spider kelley to elevate himself into jimmy s class these two gentlemen held a conference that night at mccrary s kelley explained he s as easy as a gumshoe he s from the island of colombia where there s a strike or a feud or something going on and they ve sent him up here to buy winchesters to arbitrate the thing with he showed me two drafts for each and one for on a bank here s truth jimmy i felt real mad with him because he didn t have it in thousand dollar bills and hand it to me on a silver waiter now we ve got to wait till he goes to the bank and gets the money for us they talked it over for two hours and then dunn said bring him to no broadway at four o clock to morrow afternoon in due time kelley called at the hotel espanol for the general he found the wily warrior engaged in delectable conversation with mrs o brien the secretary of war is waitin for us said kelley the general tore himself away with an effort ay se or he said with a sigh duty makes a call but se or the se oras of your estados unidos how beauties for exemplification take you la madame o brien que magnifica she is one goddess one juno what you call one ox eyed juno now mr kelley was a wit and better men have been shriveled by the fire of their own imagination sure he said with a grin but you mean a peroxide juno don t you mrs o brien heard and lifted an auriferous head her businesslike eye rested for an instant upon the disappearing form of mr kelley except in street cars one should never be unnecessarily rude to a lady when the gallant colombian and his escort arrived at the broadway address they were held in an anteroom for half an hour and then admitted into a well equipped office where a distinguished looking man with a smooth face wrote at a desk general falcon was presented to the secretary of war of the united states and his mission made known by his old friend mr kelley ah colombia said the secretary significantly when he was made to understand i m afraid there will be a little difficutly in that case the president and i differ in our sympathies there he prefers the established government while i the secretary gave the general a mysterious but encouraging smile you of course know general falcon that since the tammany war an act of congress has been passed requiring all manufactured arms and ammunition exported from this country to pass through the war department now if i can do anything for you i will be glad to do so to oblige my old friend mr kelley but it must be in absolute secrecy as the president as i have said does not regard favorably the efforts of your revolutionary party in colombia i will have my orderly bring a list of the available arms now in the warehouse the secretary struck a bell and an orderly with the letters a d t on his cap stepped promptly into the room bring me schedule b of the small arms inventory said the secretary the orderly quickly returned with a printed paper the secretary studied it closely i find he said that in warehouse of government stores there is shipment of stands of winchester rifles that were ordered by the sultan of morocco who forgot to send the cash with his order our rule is that legal tender must be paid down at the time of purchase my dear kelley your friend general falcon shall have this lot of arms if he desires it at the manufacturer s price and you will forgive me i am sure if i curtail our interview i am expecting the japanese minister and charles murphy every moment as one result of this interview the general was deeply grateful to his esteemed friend mr kelley as another the nimble secretary of war was extremely busy during the next two days buying empty rifle cases and filling them with bricks which were then stored in a warehouse rented for that purpose as still another when the general returned to the hotel espanol mrs o brien went up to him plucked a thread from his lapel and said say se or i don t want to butt in but what does that monkey faced cat eyed rubber necked tin horn tough want with you sangre de mi vida exclaimed the general impossible it is that you speak of my good friend se or kelley come into the summer garden said mrs o brien i want to have a talk with you let us suppose that an hour has elapsed and you say said the general that for the sum of can be purchased the furnishment of the house and the lease of one year with this garden so lovely so resembling unto the patios of my cara colombia and dirt cheap at that sighed the lady ah dios breathed general falcon what to me is war and politics this spot is one paradise my country it have other brave heroes to continue the fighting what to me should be glory and the shooting of mans ah no it is here i have found one angel let us buy the hotel espanol and you shall be mine and the money shall not be waste on guns mrs o brien rested her blond pompadour against the shoulder of the colombian patriot oh se or she sighed happily ain t you terrible two days later was the time appointed for the delivery of the arms to the general the boxes of supposed rifles were stacked in the rented warehouse and the secretary of war sat upon them waiting for his friend kelley to fetch the victim mr kelley hurried at the hour to the hotel espanol he found the general behind the desk adding up accounts i have decide said the general to buy not guns i have to day buy the insides of this hotel and there shall be marrying of the general perrico ximenes villablanca falcon with la madame o brien mr kelley almost strangled say you old bald headed bottle of shoe polish he spluttered you re a swindler that s what you are you ve bought a boarding house with money belonging to your infernal country wherever it is ah said the general footing up a column that is what you call politics war and revolution they are not nice yes it is not best that one shall always follow minerva no it is of quite desirable to keep hotels and be with that juno that ox eyed juno ah what hair of the gold it is that she have mr kelley choked again ah senor kelley said the general feelingly and finally is it that you have never eaten of the corned beef hash that madame o brien she make babes in the jungle montague silver the finest street man and art grafter in the west says to me once in little rock if you ever lose your mind billy and get too old to do honest swindling among grown men go to new york in the west a sucker is born every minute but in new york they appear in chunks of roe you can t count em two years afterward i found that i couldn t remember the names of the russian admirals and i noticed some gray hairs over my left ear so i knew the time had arrived for me to take silver s advice i struck new york about noon one day and took a walk up broadway and i run against silver himself all encompassed up in a spacious kind of haberdashery leaning against a hotel and rubbing the half moons on his nails with a silk handkerchief paresis or superannuated i asks him hello billy says silver i m glad to see you yes it seemed to me that the west was accumulating a little too much wiseness i ve been saving new york for dessert i know it s a low down trick to take things from these people they only know this and that and pass to and fro and think ever and anon i d hate for my mother to know i was skinning these weak minded ones she raised me better is there a crush already in the waiting rooms of the old doctor that does skin grafting i asks well no says silver you needn t back epidermis to win to day i ve only been here a month but i m ready to begin and the members of willie manhattan s sunday school class each of whom has volunteered to contribute a portion of cuticle toward this rehabilitation may as well send their photos to the evening daily i ve been studying the town says silver and reading the papers every day and i know it as well as the cat in the city hall knows an o sullivan people here lie down on the floor and scream and kick when you are the least bit slow about taking money from them come up in my room and i ll tell you we ll work the town together billy for the sake of old times silver takes me up in a hotel he has a quantity of irrelevant objects lying about there s more ways of getting money from these metropolitan hayseeds says silver than there is of cooking rice in charleston s c they ll bite at anything the brains of most of em commute the wiser they are in intelligence the less perception of cognizance they have why didin t a man the other day sell j p morgan an oil portrait of rockefeller jr for andrea del sarto s celebrated painting of the young saint john you see that bundle of printed stuff in the corner billy that s gold mining stock i started out one day to sell that but i quit it in two hours why got arrested for blocking the street people fought to buy it i sold the policeman a block of it on the way to the station house and then i took it off the market i don t want people to give me their money i want some little consideration connected with the transaction to keep my pride from being hurt i want em to guess the missing letter in chic go or draw to a pair of nines before they pay me a cent of money now there s another little scheme that worked so easy i had to quit it you see that bottle of blue ink on the table i tattooed an anchor on the back of my hand and went to a bank and told em i was admiral dewey s nephew they offered to cash my draft on him for a thousand but i didn t know my uncle s first name it shows though what an easy town it is as for burglars they won t go in a house now unless there s a hot supper ready and a few college students to wait on em they re slugging citizens all over the upper part of the city and i guess taking the town from end to end it s a plain case of assault and battery monty says i when silver had slacked up you may have manhattan correctly discriminated in your perorative but i doubt it i ve only been in town two hours but it don t dawn upon me that it s ours with a cherry in it there ain t enough rus in urbe about it to suit me i d be a good deal much better satisfied if the citizens had a straw or more in their hair and run more to velveteen vests and buckeye watch charms they don t look easy to me you ve got it billy says silver all emigrants have it new york s bigger than little rock or europe and it frightens a foreigner you ll be all right i tell you i feel like slapping the people here because they don t send me all their money in laundry baskets with germicide sprinkled over it i hate to go down on the street to get it who wears the diamonds in this town why winnie the wiretapper s wife and bella the buncosteerer s bride new yorkers can be worked easier than a blue rose on a tidy the only thing that bothers me is i know i ll break the cigars in my vest pocket when i get my clothes all full of twenties i hope you are right monty says i but i wish all the same i had been satisfied with a small business in little rock the crop of farmers is never so short out there but what you can get a few of em to sign a petition for a new post office that you can discount for at the county bank the people hear appear to possess instincts of self preservation and illiberality i fear me that we are not cultured enough to tackle this game don t worry says silver i ve got this jayville near tarrytown correctly estimated as sure as north river is the hudson and east river ain t a river why there are people living in four blocks of broadway who never saw any kind of a building except a skyscraper in their lives a good live hustling western man ought to get conspicuous enough here inside of three months to incur either jerome s clemency or lawson s displeasure hyperbole aside says i do you know of any immediate system of buncoing the community out of a dollar or two except by applying to the salvation army or having a fit on miss helen gould s doorsteps dozens of em says silver how much capital have you got billy a thousand i told him i ve got says he we ll pool and do a big piece of business there s so many ways we can make a million that i don t know how to begin the next morning silver meets me at the hotel and he is all sonorous and stirred with a kind of silent joy we re to meet j p morgan this afternoon says he a man i know in the hotel wants to introduce us he s a friend of his he says he likes to meet people from the west that sounds nice and plausible says i i d like to know mr morgan it won t hurt us a bit says silver to get acquainted with a few finance kings i kind of like the social way new york has with strangers the man silver knew was named klein at three o clock klein brought his wall street friend to see us in silver s room mr morgan looked some like his pictures and he had a turkish towel wrapped around his left foot and he walked with a cane mr silver and mr pescud says klein it sounds superfluous says he to mention the name of the greatest financial cut it out klein says mr morgan i m glad to know you gents i take great interest in the west klein tells me you re from little rock i think i ve a railroad or two out there somewhere if either of you guys would like to deal a hand or two of stud poker i now pierpont cuts in klein you forget excuse me gents says morgan since i ve had the gout so bad i sometimes play a social game of cards at my house neither of you never knew one eyed peters did you while you was around little rock he lived in seattle new mexico before we could answer mr morgan hammers on the floor with his can and begins to walk up and down swearing in a loud tone of voice they have been pounding your stocks to day on the street pierpont asks klein smiling stocks no roars mr morgan it s that picture i sent an agent to europe to buy i just thought about it he cabled me to day that it ain t to be found in all italy i d pay to morrow for that picture yes i give the agent a la carte in purchasing it i cannot understand why the art galleries will allow a de vinchy to why mr morgan says klein i thought you owned all of the de vinchy paintings what is the picture like mr morgan asks silver it must be as big as the side of the flatiron building i m afraid your art education is on the bum mr silver says morgan the picture is inches by and it is called love s idle hour it represents a number of cloak models doing the two step on the bank of a purple river the cablegram said it might have been brought to this country my collection will never be complete without that picture well so long gents us financiers must keep early hours mr morgan and klein went away together in a cab me and silver talked about how simple and unsuspecting great people was and silver said what a shame it would be to try to rob a man like mr morgan and i said i thought it would be rather imprudent myself klein proposes a stroll after dinner and me and him and silver walks down toward seventh avenue to see the sights klein sees a pair of cuff links that instigate his admiration in a pawnshop window and we all go in while he buys em after we got back to the hotel and klein had gone silver jumps at me and waves his hands did you see it says he did you see it billy what i asks why that picture that morgan wants it s hanging in that pawnshop behind the desk i didn t say anything because klein was there it s the article sure as you live the girls are as natural as paint can make them all measuring and and skirts if they had any skirts and they re doing a buck and wing on the bank of a river with the blues what did mr morgan say he d give for it oh don t make me tell you they can t know what it is in that pawnshop when the pawnshop opened the next morning me and silver was standing there as anxious as if we wanted to soak our sunday suit to buy a drink we sauntered inside and began to look at watch chains that s a violent specimen of a chromo you ve got up there remarked silver casual to the pawnbroker but i kind of enthuse over the girl with the shoulderblades and red bunting would an offer of for it cause you to knock over any fragile articles of your stock in hurrying it off the nail the pawnbroker smiles and goes on showing us plate watch chains that picture says he was pledged a year ago by an italian gentleman i loaned him on it it is called love s idle hour and it is by leonardo de vinchy two days ago the legal time expired and it became an unredeemed pledge here is a style of chain that is worn a great deal now at the end of half an hour me and silver paid the pawnbroker and walked out with the picture silver got into a cab with it and started for morgan s office i goes to the hotel and waits for him in two hours silver comes back did you see mr morgan i asks how much did he pay you for it silver sits down and fools with a tassel on the table cover i never exactly saw mr morgan he says because mr morgan s been in europe for a month but what s worrying me billy is this the department stores have all got that same picture on sale framed for and they charge for the frame alone that s what i can t understand the day resurgent i can see the artist bite the end of his pencil and frown when it comes to drawing his easter picture for his legitimate pictorial conceptions of figures pertinent to the festival are but four in number first comes easter pagan goddess of spring here his fancy may have free play a beautiful maiden with decorative hair and the proper number of toes will fill the bill miss clarice st vavasour the well known model will pose for it in the lethergogallagher or whatever it was that trilby called it second the melancholy lady with upturned eyes in a framework of lilies this is magazine covery but reliable third miss manhattan in the fifth avenue easter sunday parade fourth maggie murphy with a new red feather in her old straw hat happy and self conscious in the grand street turnout of course the rabbits do not count nor the easter eggs since the higher criticism has hard boiled them the limited field of its pictorial possibilities proves that easter of all our festival days is the most vague and shifting in our conception it belongs to all religions although the pagans invented it going back still further to the first spring we can see eve choosing with pride a new green leaf from the tree ficus carica now the object of this critical and learned preamble is to set forth the theorem that easter is neither a date a season a festival a holiday nor an occasion what it is you shall find out if you follow in the footsteps of danny mccree easter sunday dawned as it should bright and early in its place on the calendar between saturday and monday at the sun rose and at danny followed its example he went into the kitchen and washed his face at the sink his mother was frying bacon she looked at his hard smooth knowing countenance as he juggled with the round cake of soap and thought of his father when she first saw him stopping a hot grounder between second and third twenty two years before on a vacant lot in harlem where the la paloma apartment house now stands in the front room of the flat danny s father sat by an open window smoking his pipe with his dishevelled gray hair tossed about by the breeze he still clung to his pipe although his sight had been taken from him two years before by a precocious blast of giant powder that went off without permission very few blind men care for smoking for the reason that they cannot see the smoke now could you enjoy having the news read to you from an evening newspaper unless you could see the colors of the headlines tis easter day said mrs mccree scramble mine said danny after breakfast he dressed himself in the sabbath morning costume of the canal street importing house dray chauffeur frock coat striped trousers patent leathers gilded trace chain across front of vest and wing collar rolled brim derby and butterfly bow from schonstein s between fourteenth street and tony s fruit stand saturday night sale you ll be goin out this day of course danny said old man mccree a little wistfully tis a kind of holiday they say well it s fine spring weather i can feel it in the air why should i not be going out demanded danny in his grumpiest chest tones should i stay in am i as good as a horse one day of rest my team has a week who earns the money for the rent and the breakfast you ve just eat i d like to know answer me that all right lad said the old man i m not complainin while me two eyes was good there was nothin better to my mind than a sunday out there s a smell of turf and burnin brush comin in the windy i have me tobaccy a good fine day and rist to ye lad times i wish your mother had larned to read so i might hear the rest about the hippopotamus but let that be now what is this foolishness he talks of hippopotamuses asked danny of his mother as he passed through the kitchen have you been taking him to the zoo and for what i have not said mrs mccree he sets by the windy all day tis little recreation a blind man among the poor gets at all i m thinkin they wander in their minds at times one day he talks of grease without stoppin for the most of an hour i looks to see if there s lard burnin in the fryin pan there is not he says i do not understand tis weary days sundays and holidays and all for a blind man danny there was no better nor stronger than him when he had his two eyes tis a fine day son injoy yeself ag inst the morning there will be cold supper at six have you heard any talk of a hippopotamus asked danny of mike the janitor as he went out the door downstairs i have not said mike pulling his shirtsleeves higher but tis the only subject in the animal natural and illegal lists of outrages that i ve not been compained to about these two days see the landlord or else move out if ye like have ye hippopotamuses in the lease no then it was the old man who spoke of it said danny likely there s nothing in it danny walked up the street to the avenue and then struck northward into the heart of the district where easter modern easter in new bright raiment leads the pascal march out of towering brown churches came the blithe music of anthems from the choirs the broad sidewalks were moving parterres of living flowers so it seemed when your eye looked upon the ester girl gentlemen frock coated silk hatted gardeniaed sustained the background of the tradition children carried lilies in their hands the windows of the brownstone mansions were packed with the most opulent creations of flora the sister of the lady of the lilies around a corner white gloved pink gilled and tightly buttoned walked corrigan the cop shield to the curb danny knew him why corrigan he asked is easter i know it comes the first you re full after the moon rises on the seventeenth of march but why is it a proper and religious ceremony or does the governor appoint it out of politics tis an annual celebration said corrigan with the judicial air of the third deputy police commissioner peculiar to new york it extends up to harlem sometimes they has the reserves out at one hundred and twenty fifth street in my opinion tis not political thanks said danny and say did you ever hear a man complain of hippopotamuses when not specially in drink i mean nothing larger than sea turtles said corrigan reflecting and there was wood alcohol in that danny wandered the double heavy incumbency of enjoying simultaneously a sunday and a festival day was his the sorrows of the hand toiler fit him easily they are worn so often that they hang with the picturesque lines of the best tailor made garments that is why well fed artists of pencil and pen find in the griefs of the common people their most striking models but when the philistine would disport himself the grimness of melpomene herself attends upon his capers therefore danny set his jaw hard at easter and took his pleasure sadly the family entrance of dugan s caf e was feasible so danny yielded to the vernal season as far as a glass of bock seated in a dark linoleumed humid back room his heart and mind still groped after the mysterious meaning of the springtime jubilee say tim he said to the waiter why do they have easter skiddoo said tim closing a sophisticated eye is that a new one all right tony pastor s for you last night i guess i give it up what s the answer two apples or a yard and a half from dugan s danny turned back eastward the april sun seemed to stir in him a vague feeling that he could not construe he made a wrong diagnosis and decided that it was katy conlon a block from her house on avenue a he met her going to church they pumped hands on the corner gee but you look dumpish and dressed up said katy what s wrong come away with me to church and be cheerful what s doing at church asked danny why it s easter sunday silly i waited till after eleven expectin you might come around to go what does this easter stand for katy asked danny gloomily nobody seems to know nobody as blind as you said katy with spirit you haven t even looked at my new hat and skirt why it s when all the girls put on new spring clothes silly are you coming to church with me i will said danny if this easter is pulled off there they ought to be able to give some excuse for it not that the hat ain t a beauty the green roses are great at church the preacher did some expounding with no pounding he spoke rapidly for he was in a hurry to get home to his early sabbath dinner but he knew his business there was one word that controlled his theme resurrection not a new creation but a new life arising out of the old the congregation had heard it often before but there was a wonderful hat a combination of sweet peas and lavender in the sixth pew from the pulpit it attracted much attention after church danny lingered on a corner while katy waited with pique in her sky blue eyes are you coming along to the house she asked but don t mind me i ll get there all right you seem to be studyin a lot about something all right will i see you at any time specially mr mccree i ll be around wednesday night as usual said danny turning and crossing the street katy walked away with the green roses dangling indignantly danny stopped two blocks away he stood still with his hands in his pockets at the curb on the corner his face was that of a graven image deep in his soul something stirred so small so fine so keen and leavening that his hard fibres did not recognize it it was something more tender than the april day more subtle than the call of the senses purer and deeper rooted than the love of woman for had he not turned away from green roses and eyes that had kept him chained for a year and danny did not know what it was the preacher who was in a hurry to go to his dinner had told him but danny had had no libretto with which to follow the drowsy intonation but the preacher spoke the truth suddenly danny slapped his leg and gave forth a hoarse yell of delight hippopotamus he shouted to an elevated road pillar well how is that for a bum guess why blast my skylights i know what he was driving at now hippopotamus wouldn t that send you to the bronx it s been a year since he heard it and he didn t miss it so very far we quit at b c and this comes next well a wooden man wouldn t have guessed what he was trying to get out of him danny caught a crosstown car and went up to the rear flat that his labor supported old man mccree was still sitting by the window his extinct pipe lay on the sill will that be you lad he asked danny flared into the rage of a strong man who is surprised at the outset of committing a good deed who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house he snapped viciously have i no right to come in ye re a faithful lad said old man mccree with a sigh is it evening yet danny reached up on a shelf and took down a thick book labeled in gilt letters the history of greece dust was on it half an inch thick he laid it on the table and found a place in it marked by a strip of paper and then he gave a short roar at the top of his voice and said was it the hippopotamus you wanted to be read to about then did i hear ye open the book said old man mccree many and weary be the months since my lad has read it to me i dinno but i took a great likings to them greeks ye left off at a place tis a fine day outside lad be out and take rest from your work i have gotten used to me chair by the windy and me pipe pel peloponnesus was the place where we left off and not hippopotamus said danny the war began there it kept something doing for thirty years the headlines says that a guy named philip of macedon in b c got to be boss of greece by getting the decision at the battle of cher cheronaea i ll read it with his hand to his ear rapt in the peloponnesian war old man mccree sat for an hour listening then he got up and felt his way to the door of the kitchen mrs mccree was slicing cold meat she looked up tears were running from old man mccree s eyes do you hear our lad readin to me he said there is none finer in the land my two eyes have come back to me again after supper he said to danny tis a happy day this easter and now ye will be off to see katy in the evening well enough who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house said danny angrily have i no right to stay in it after supper there is yet to come the reading of the battle of corinth b c when the kingdom as they say became an in integral portion of the roman empire am i nothing in this house the fifth wheel the ranks of the bed line moved closer together for it was cold they were alluvial deposit of the stream of life lodged in the delta of fifth avenue and broadway the bed liners stamped their freezing feet looked at the empty benches in madison square whence jack frost had evicted them and muttered to one another in a confusion of tongues the flatiron building with its impious cloud piercing architecture looming mistily above them on the opposite delta might well have stood for the tower of babel whence these polyglot idlers had been called by the winged walking delegate of the lord standing on a pine box a head higher than his flock of goats the preacher exhorted whatever transient and shifting audience the north wind doled out to him it was a slave market fifteen cents bought you a man you deeded him to morpheus and the recording angel gave you credit the preacher was incredibly earnest and unwearied he had looked over the list of things one may do for one s fellow man and had assumed for himself the task of putting to bed all who might apply at his soap box on the nights of wednesday and sunday that left but five nights for other philanthropists to handle and had they done their part as well this wicked city might have become a vast arcadian dormitory where all might snooze and snore the happy hours away letting problem plays and the rent man and business go to the deuce the hour of eight was but a little while past sightseers in a small dark mass of pay ore were gathered in the shadow of general worth s monument now and then shyly ostentatiously carelessly or with conscientious exactness one would step forward and bestow upon the preacher small bills or silver then a lieutenant of scandinavian coloring and enthusiasm would march away to a lodging house with a squad of the redeemed all the while the preacher exhorted the crowd in terms beautifully devoid of eloquence splendid with the deadly accusative monotony of truth before the picture of the bed liners fades you must hear one phrase of the preacher s the one that formed his theme that night it is worthy of being stenciled on all the white ribbons in the world no man ever learned to be a drunkard on five cent whisky think of it tippler it covers the ground from the sprouting rye to the potter s field a clean profiled erect young man in the rear rank of the bedless emulated the terrapin drawing his head far down into the shell of his coat collar it was a well cut tweed coat and the trousers still showed signs of having flattened themselves beneath the compelling goose but conscientiously i must warn the milliner s apprentice who reads this expecting a reginald montressor in straits to peruse no further the young man was no other than thomas mcquade ex coachman discharged for drunkenness one month before and now reduced to the grimy ranks of the one night bed seekers if you live in smaller new york you must know the van smuythe family carriage drawn by the two pound to shot bays the carriage is shaped like a bath tub in each end of it reclines an old lady van smuythe holding a black sunshade the size of a new year s eve feather tickler before his downfall thomas mcquade drove the van smuythe bays and was himself driven by annie the van smuythe lady s maid but it is one of the saddest things about romance that a tight shoe or an empty commissary or an aching tooth will make a temporary heretic of any cupid worshiper and thomas s physical troubles were not few therefore his soul was less vexed with thoughts of his lost lady s maid than it was by the fancied presence of certain non existent things that his racked nerves almost convinced him were flying dancing crawling and wriggling on the asphalt and in the air above and around the dismal campus of the bed line army nearly four weeks of straight whisky and a diet limited to crackers bologna and pickles often guarantees a psycho zoological sequel thus desperate freezing angry beset by phantoms as he was he felt the need of human sympathy and intercourse the bed liner standing at his right was a young man of about his own age shabby but neat what s the diagnosis of your case freddy asked thomas with the freemasonic familiarity of the damned booze that s mine you don t look like a panhandler neither am i a month ago i was pushing the lines over the backs of the finest team of percheron buffaloes that ever made their mile down fifth avenue in and look at me now say how do you come to be at this bed bargain counter rummage sale the other young man seemed to welcome the advances of the airy ex coachman no said he mine isn t exactly a case of drink unless we allow that cupid is a bartender i married unwisely according to the opinion of my unforgiving relatives i ve been out of work for a year because i don t know how to work and i ve been sick in bellevue and other hospitals for months my wife and kid had to go back to her mother i was turned out of the hospital yesterday and i haven t a cent that s my tale of woe tough luck said thomas a man alone can pull through all right but i hate to see the women and kids get the worst of it just then there hummed up fifth avenue a motor car so splendid so red so smoothly running so craftily demolishing the speed regulations that it drew the attention even of the listless bed liners suspended and pinioned on its left side was an extra tire when opposite the unfortunate company the fastenings of this tire became loosed it fell to the asphalt bounded and rolled rapidly in the wake of the flying car thomas mcquade scenting an opportunity darted from his place among the preacher s goats in thirty seconds he had caught the rolling tire swung it over his shoulder and was trotting smartly after the car on both sides of the avenue people were shouting whistling and waving canes at the red car pointing to the enterprising thomas coming up with the lost tire one dollar thomas had estimated was the smallest guerdon that so grand an automobilist could offer for the service he had rendered and save his pride two blocks away the car had stopped there was a little brown muffled chauffeur driving and an imposing gentleman wearing a magnificent sealskin coat and a silk hat on a rear seat thomas proffered the captured tire with his best ex coachman manner and a look in the brighter of his reddened eyes that was meant to be suggestive to the extent of a silver coin or two and receptive up to higher denominations but the look was not so construed the sealskinned gentleman received the tire placed it inside the car gazed intently at the ex coachman and muttered to himself inscrutable words strange strange said he once or twice even i myself have fancied that the chaldean chiroscope has availed could it be possible then he addressed less mysterious words to the waiting and hopeful thomas sir i thank you for your kind rescue of my tire and i would ask you if i may a question do you know the family of van smuythes living in washington square north oughtn t i to replied thomas i lived there wish i did yet the sealskinned gentleman opened a door of the car step in please he said you have been expected thomas mcquade obeyed with surprise but without hesitation a seat in a motor car seemed better than standing room in the bed line but after the lap robe had been tucked about him and the auto had sped on its course the peculiarity of the invitation lingered in his mind maybe the guy hasn t got any change was his diagnosis lots of these swell rounders don t lug about any ready money guess he ll dump me out when he gets to some joint where he can get cash on his mug anyhow it s a cinch that i ve got that open air bed convention beat to a finish submerged in his greatcoat the mysterious automobilist seemed himself to marvel at the surprises of life wonderful amazing strange he repeated to himself constantly when the car had well entered the crosstown seventies it swung eastward a half block and stopped before a row of high stooped brownstone front houses be kind enough to enter my house with me said the sealskinned gentleman when they had alighted he s going to dig up sure reflected thomas following him inside there was a dim light in the hall his host conducted him through a door to the left closing it after him and leaving them in absolute darkness suddenly a luminous globe strangely decorated shone faintly in the centre of an immense room that seemed to thomas more splendidly appointed than any he had ever seen on the stage or read of in fairy tales the walls were hidden by gorgeous red hangings embroidered with fantastic gold figures at the rear end of the room were draped porti eres of dull gold spangled with silver crescents and stars the furniture was of the costliest and rarest styles the ex coachman s feet sank into rugs as fleecy and deep as snowdrifts there were three or four oddly shaped stands or tables covered with black velvet drapery thomas mcquade took in the splendors of this palatial apartment with one eye with the other he looked for his imposing conductor to find that he had disappeared b gee muttered thomas this listens like a spook shop shouldn t wonder if it ain t one of these moravian nights adventures that you read about wonder what became of the furry guy suddenly a stuffed owl that stood on an ebony perch near the illuminated globe slowly raised his wings and emitted from his eyes a brilliant electric glow with a fright born imprecation thomas seized a bronze statuette of hebe from a cabinet near by and hurled it with all his might at the terrifying and impossible fowl the owl and his perch went over with a crash with the sound there was a click and the room was flooded with light from a dozen frosted globes along the walls and ceiling the gold porti eres parted and closed and the mysterious automobilist entered the room he was tall and wore evening dress of perfect cut and accurate taste a vandyke beard of glossy golden brown rather long and wavy hair smoothly parted and large magnetic orientally occult eyes gave him a most impressive and striking appearance if you can conceive a russian grand duke in a rajah s throneroom advancing to greet a visiting emperor you will gather something of the majesty of his manner but thomas mcquade was too near his d t s to be mindful of his p s and q s when he viewed this silken polished and somewhat terrifying host he thought vaguely of dentists say doc said he resentfully that s a hot bird you keep on tap i hope i didn t break anything but i ve nearly got the williwalloos and when he threw them candle power lamps of his on me i took a snap shot at him with that little brass flatiron girl that stood on the sideboard that is merely a mechanical toy said the gentleman with a wave of his hand may i ask you to be seated while i explain why i brought you to my house perhaps you would not understand nor be in sympathy with the psychological prompting that caused me to do so so i will come to the point at once by venturing to refer to your admission that you know the van smuythe family of washington square north any silver missing asked thomas tartly any joolry displaced of course i know em any of the old ladies sunshades disappeared well i know em and then what the grand duke rubbed his white hands together softly wonderful he murmured wonderful shall i come to believe in the chaldean chiroscope myself let me assure you he continued that there is nothing for you to fear instead i think i can promise you that very good fortune awaits you we will see do they want me back asked thomas with something of his old professional pride in his voice i ll promise to cut out the booze and do the right thing if they ll try me again but how did you get wise doc b gee it s the swellest employment agency i was ever in with its flashlight owls and so forth with an indulgent smile the gracious host begged to be excused for two minutes he went out to the sidewalk and gave an order to the chauffeur who still waited with the car returning to the mysterious apartment he sat by his guest and began to entertain him so well by his witty and genial converse that the poor bed liner almost forgot the cold streets from which he had been so recently and so singularly rescued a servant brought some tender cold fowl and tea biscuits and a glass of miraculous wine and thomas felt the glamour of arabia envelop him thus half an hour sped quickly and then the honk of the returned motor car at the door suddenly drew the grand duke to his feet with another soft petition for a brief absence two women well muffled against the cold were admitted at the front door and suavely conducted by the master of the house down the hall through another door to the left and into a smaller room which was screened and segregated from the larger front room by heavy double porti eres here the furnishings were even more elegant and exquisitely tasteful than in the other on a gold inlaid rosewood table were scattered sheets of white paper and a queer triangular instrument or toy apparently of gold standing on little wheels the taller woman threw back her black veil and loosened her cloak she was fifty with a wrinkled and sad face the other young and plump took a chair a little distance away and to the rear as a servant or an attendant might have done you sent for me professor cherubusco said the elder woman wearily i hope you have something more definite than usual to say i ve about lost the little faith i had in your art i would not have responded to your call this evening if my sister had not insisted upon it madam said the professor with his princeliest smile the true art cannot fail to find the true psychic and potential branch sometimes requires time we have not succeeded i admint with the cards the crystal the stars the magic formulae of zarazin nor the oracle of po but we have at last discovered the true psychic route the chaldean chiroscope has been successful in our search the professor s voice had a ring that seemed to proclaim his belief in his own words the elderly lady looked at him with a little more interest why there was no sense in those words that it wrote with my hands on it she said what do you mean the words were these said professor cherubusco rising to his full magnificent height by the fifth wheel of the chariot he shall come i haven t seen many chariots said the lady but i never saw one with five wheels progress said the professor progress in science and mechanics has accomplished it though to be exact we may speak of it only as an extra tire progress in occult art has advanced in proportion madam i repeat that the chaldean chiroscope has succeeded i can not only answer the question that you have propounded but i can produce before your eyes the proof thereof and now the lady was disturbed both in her disbelief and in her poise o professor she cried anxiously when where has he been found do not keep me in suspense i beg you will excuse me for a very few minutes said professor cherubusco and i think i can demonstrate to you the efficacy of the true art thomas was contentedly munching the last crumbs of the bread and fowl when the enchanter appeared suddenly at his side are you willing to return to your old home if you are assured of a welcome and restoration to favor he asked with his courteous royal smile do i look bughouse answered thomas enough of the footback life for me but will they have me again the old lady is as fixed in her ways as a nut on a new axle my dear young man said the other she has been searching for you everywhere great said thomas i m on the job that team of dropsical domedaries they call horses is a handicap for a first class coachman like myself but i ll take the job back sure doc they re good people to be with and now a change came o er the suave countenance of the caliph of bagdad he looked keenly and suspiciously at the ex coachman may i ask what your name is he said shortly you ve been looking for me said thomas and don t know my name you re a funny kind of sleuth you must be one of the central office gumshoers i m thomas mcquade of course and i ve been chauffeur of the van smuythe elephant team for a year they fired me a month ago for well doc you saw what i did to your old owl i went broke on booze and when i saw the tire drop off your whiz wagon i was standing in that squad of hoboes at the worth monument waiting for a free bed now what s the prize for the best answer to all this to his intense surprise thomas felt himself lifted by the collar and dragged without a word of explanation to the front door this was opened and he was kicked forcibly down the steps with one heavy disillusionizing humiliating impact of the stupendous arabian s shoe as soon as the ex coachman had recovered his feet and his wits he hastened as fast as he could eastward toward broadway crazy guy was his estimate of the mysterious automobilist just wanted to have some fun kiddin i guess he might have dug up a dollar anyhow now i ve got to hurry up and get back to that gang of bum bed hunters before they all get preached to sleep when thomas reached the end of his two mile walk he found the ranks of the homeless reduced to a squad of perhaps eight or ten he took the proper place of a newcomer at the left end of the rear rank in a file in front of him was the young man who had spoken to him of hospitals and something of a wife and child sorry to see you back again said the young man turning to speak to him i hoped you had struck something better than this me said thomas oh i just took a run around the block to keep warm i see the public ain t lending to the lord very fast to night in this kind of weather said the young man charity avails itself of the proverb and both begins and ends at home and the preacher and his vehement lieutenant struck up a last hymn of petition to providence and man those of the bed liners whose windpipes still registered above degrees hopelessly and tunelessly joined in in the middle of the second verse thomas saw a sturdy girl with wind tossed drapery battling against the breeze and coming straight toward him from the opposite sidewalk annie he yelled and ran toward her you fool you fool she cried weeping and laughing and hanging upon his neck why did you do it the stuff explained thomas briefly you know but subsequently nit not a drop he led her to the curb how did you happen to see me i came to find you said annie holding tight to his sleeve oh you big fool professor cherubusco told us that we might find you here professor ch dont know the guy what saloon does he work in he s a clairvoyant thomas the greatest in the world he found you with the chaldean telescope he said he s a liar said thomas i never had it he never saw me have anybody s telescope and he said you came in a chariot with five wheels or something annie said thoms solicitously you re giving me the wheels now if i had a chariot i d have gone to bed in it long ago and without any singing and preaching for a nightcap either listen you big fool the missis says she ll take you back i begged her to but you must behave and you can go up to the house to night and your old room over the stable is ready great said thomas earnestly you are it annie but when did these stunts happen to night at professor cherubusco s he sent his automobile for the missis and she took me along i ve been there with her before what s the professor s line he s a clairvoyant and a witch the missis consults him he knows everything but he hasn t done the missis any good yet though she s paid him hundreds of dollars but he told us that the stars told him we could find you here what s the old lady want this cherry buster to do that s a family secret said annie and now you ve asked enough questions come on home you big fool they had moved but a little way up the street when thomas stopped got any dough with you annie he asked annie looked at him sharply oh i know what that look means said thomas you re wrong not another drop but there s a guy that was standing next to me in the bed line over there that s in bad shape he s the right kind and he s got wives or kids or something and he s on the sick list no booze if you could dig up half a dollar for him so he could get a decent bed i d like it annie s fingers began to wiggle in her purse sure i ve got money said she lots of it twelve dollars and then she added with woman s ineradicable suspicion of vicarious benevolence bring him here and let me see him first thomas went on his mission the wan bed liner came readily enough as the two drew near annie looked up from her purse and screamed mr walter oh mr walter is that you annie said the young man meekly oh mr walter and the missis hunting high and low for you does mother want to see me he asked with a flush coming out on his pale cheek she s been hunting for you high and low sure she wants to see you she wants you to come home she s tried police and morgues and lawyers and advertising and detectives and rewards and everything and then she took up clearvoyants you ll go right home won t you mr walter gladly if she wants me said the young man three years is a long time i suppose i ll have to walk up though unless the street cars are giving free rides i used to walk and beat that old plug team of bays we used to drive to the carriage have they got them yet they have said thomas feelingly and they ll have em ten years from now the life of the royal elephantibus truckhorseibus is one hundred and forty nine years i m the coachman just got my reappointment five minutes ago let s all ride up in a surface car that is er if annie will pay the fares on the broadway car annie handed each one of the prodigals a nickel to pay the conductor seems to me you are mighty reckless the way you throw large sums of money around said thomas sarcastically in that purse said annie decidedly is exactly i shall take every cent of it to morrow and give it to professor cherubusco the greatest man in the world well said thomas i guess he must be a pretty fly guy to pipe off things the way he does i m glad his spooks told him where you could find me if you ll give me his address some day i ll go up there myself and shake his hand presently thomas moved tentatively in his seat and thoughtfully felt an abrasion or two on his knees and his elbows say annie said he confidentially maybe it s one of the last dreams of booze but i ve a kind of a recollection of riding in authomobile with a swell guy that took me to a house full of eagles and arc lights he fed me on biscuits and hot air and then kicked me down the front steps if it was the d t s why am i so sore shut up you fool said annie if i could find that funny guy s house said thomas in conclusion i d go up there some day and punch his nose for him the poet and the peasant the other day a poet friend of mine who has lived in close communion with nature all his life wrote a poem and took it to an editor it was a living pastoral full of the genuine breath of the fields the song of birds and the pleasant chatter of trickling streams when the poet called again to see about it with hopes of a beefsteak dinner in his heart it was handed back to him with the comment too artificial several of us met over spaghetti and dutchess county chianti and swallowed indignation with slippery forkfuls and there we dug a pit for the editor with us was conant a well arrived writer of fiction a man who had trod on asphalt all his life and who had never looked upon bucolic scenes except with sensations of disgust from the windows of express trains conant wrote a poem and called it the doe and the brook it was a fine specimen of the kind of work you would expect from a poet who had strayed with amaryllis only as far as the florist s windows and whose sole ornithological discussion had been carried on with a waiter conant signed this poem and we sent it to the same editor but this has very little to do with the story just as the editor was reading the first line of the poem on the next morning a being stumbled off the west shore ferryboat and loped slowly up forty second street the invader was a young man with light blue eyes a hanging lip and hair the exact color of the little orphan s afterward discovered to be the earl s daughter in one of mr blaney s plays his trousers were corduroy his coat short sleeved with buttons in the middle of his back one bootleg was outside the corduroys you looked expectantly though in vain at his straw hat for ear holes its shape inaugurating the suspicion that it had been ravaged from a former equine possessor in his hand was a valise description of it is an impossible task a boston man would not have carried his lunch and law books to his office in it and above one ear in his hair was a wisp of hay the rustic s letter of credit his badge of innocence the last clinging touch of the garden of eden lingering to shame the gold brick men knowingly smilingly the city crowds passed him by they saw the raw stranger stand in the gutter and stretch his neck at the tall buildings at this they ceased to smile and even to look at him it had been done so often a few glanced at the antique valise to see what coney attraction or brand of chewing gum he might be thus dinning into his memory but for the most part he was ignored even the newsboys looked bored when he scampered like a circus clown out of the way of cabs and street cars at eighth avenue stood bunco harry with his dyed mustache and shiny good natured eyes harry was too good an artist not to be pained at the sight of an actor overdoing his part he edged up to the countryman who had stopped to open his mouth at a jewelry store window and shook his head too thick pal he said critically too thick by a couple of inches i don t know what your lay is but you ve got the properties too thick that hay now why they don t even allow that on proctor s circuit any more i don t understand you mister said the green one i m not lookin for any circus i ve just run down from ulster county to look at the town bein that the hayin s over with gosh but it s a whopper i thought poughkeepsie was some punkins but this here town is five times as big oh well said bunco harry raising his eyebrows i didn t mean to butt in you don t have to tell i thought you ought to tone down a little so i tried to put you wise wish you success at your graft whatever it is come and have a drink anyhow i wouldn t mind having a glass of lager beer acknowledged the other they went to a caf e frequented by men with smooth faces and shifty eyes and sat at their drinks i m glad i come across you mister said haylocks how d you like to play a game or two of seven up i ve got the keerds he fished them out of noah s valise a rare inimitable deck greasy with bacon suppers and grimy with the soil of cornfields bunco harry laughed loud and briefly not for me sport he said firmly i don t go against that make up of yours for a cent but i still say you ve overdone it the reubs haven t dressed like that since i doubt if you could work brooklyn for a key winding watch with that layout oh you needn t think i ain t got the money boasted haylocks he drew forth a tightly rolled mass of bills as large as a teacup and laid it on the table got that for my share of grandmother s farm he announced there s in that roll thought i d come to the city and look around for a likely business to go into bunco harry took up the roll of money and looked at it with almost respect in his smiling eyes i ve seen worse he said critically but you ll never do it in them clothes you want to get light tan shoes and a black suit and a straw hat with a colored band and talk a good deal about pittsburg and freight differentials and drink sherry for breakfast in order to work off phony stuff like that what s his line asked two or three shifty eyed men of bunco harry after haylocks had gathered up his impugned money and departed the queer i guess said harry or else he s one of jerome s men or some guy with a new graft he s too much hayseed maybe that his i wonder now oh no it couldn t have been real money haylocks wandered on thirst probably assailed him again for he dived into a dark groggery on a side street and bought beer at first sight of him their eyes brightened but when his insistent and exaggerated rusticity became apparent their expressions changed to wary suspicion haylocks swung his valise across the bar keep that a while for me mister he said chewing at the end of a virulent claybank cigar i ll be back after i knock around a spell and keep your eye on it for there s inside of it though maybe you wouldn t think so to look at me somewhere outside a phonograph struck up a band piece and haylocks was off for it his coat tail buttons flopping in the middle of his back divvy mike said the men hanging upon the bar winking openly at one another honest now said the bartender kicking the valise to one side you don t think i d fall to that do you anybody can see he ain t no jay one of mcadoo s come on squad i guess he s a shine if he made himself up there ain t no parts of the country now where they dress like that since they run rural free delivery to providence rhode island if he s got nine fifty in that valise it s a ninety eight cent waterbury that s stopped at ten minutes to ten when haylocks had exhausted the resources of mr edison to amuse he returned for his valise and then down broadway he gallivanted culling the sights with his eager blue eyes but still and evermore broadway rejected him with curt glances and sardonic smiles he was the oldest of the gags that the city must endure he was so flagrantly impossible so ultra rustic so exaggerated beyond the most freakish products of the barnyard the hayfield and the vaudeville stage that he excited only weariness and suspicion and the wisp of hay in his hair was so genuine so fresh and redolent of the meadows so clamorously rural that even a shellgame man would have put up his peas and folded his table at the sight of it haylocks seated himself upon a flight of stone steps and once more exhumed his roll of yellow backs from the valise the outer one a twenty he shucked off and beckoned to a newsboy son said he run somewhere and get this changed for me i m mighty nigh out of chicken feed i guess you ll get a nickel if you ll hurry up a hurt look appeared through the dirt on the newsy s face aw watchert ink g wan and get yer funny bill changed yerself dey ain t no farm clothes yer got on g wan wit yer stage money on a corner lounged a keen eyed steerer for a gambling house he was haylocks and his expression suddenly grew cold and virtuous mister said the rural one i ve heard of places in this here town where a fellow could have a good game of old sledge or peg a card at keno i got in this valise and i come down from old ulster to see the sights know where a fellow could get action on about or i m goin to have some sport and then maybe i ll buy out a business of some kind the steerer looked pained and investigated a white speck on his left forefinger nail cheese it old man he murmured reproachfully the central office must be bughouse to send you out looking like such a gillie you couldn t get within two blocks of a sidewalk crap game in them tony pastor props the recent mr scotty from death valley has got you beat a crosstown block in the way of elizabethan scenery and mechanical accessories let it be skiddoo for yours nay i know of no gilded halls where one may bet a patrol wagon on the ace rebuffed once again by the great city that is so swift to detect artificialities haylocks sat upon the curb and presented his thoughts to hold a conference it s my clothes said he durned if it ain t they think i m a hayseed and won t have nothin to do with me nobody never made fun of this hat in ulster county i guess if you want folks to notice you in new york you must dress up like they do so haylocks went shopping in the bazaars where men spake through their noses and rubbed their hands and ran the tape line ecstatically over the buldge in his inside pocket where reposed a red nubbin of corn with an even number of rows and messengers bearing parcels and boxes streamed to his hotel on broadway within the lights of long acre at o clock in the evening one descended to the sidewalk whom ulster county would have foresworn bright tan were his shoes his hat the latest block his light gray trousers were deeply creased a gay blue silk handkerchief flapped from the breast pocket of his elegant english walking coat his collar might have graced a laundry window his blond hair was trimmed close the wisp of hay was gone for an instant he stood resplendent with the leisurely air of a boulevardier concocting in his mind the route for his evening pleasures and then he turned down the gay bright street with the easy and graceful tread of a millionaire but in the instant that he had paused the wisest and keenest eyes in the city had enveloped him in their field of vision a stout man with gray eyes picked two of his friends with a lift of his eyebrows from the row of loungers in front of the hotel the juiciest jay i ve seen in six months said the man with gray eyes come along it was half past eleven when a man galloped into the west forty seventh street police station with the story of his wrongs nine hundred and fifty dollars he gasped all my share of grandmother s farm the desk seargeant wrung from him the name jabez bulltongue of locust valley farm ulster county and then bagan to take descriptions of the strong arm gentlemen when conant went to see the editor about the fate of his poem he was received over the head of the office boy into the inner office that is decorated with the statuettes by rodin and j g brown when i read the first line of the doe and the brook said the editor i knew it to be the work of one whose life has been heart to heart with nature the finished art of the line did not blind me to that fact to use a somewhat homely comparison it was as if a wild free child of the woods and fields were to don the garb of fashion and walk down broadway beneath the apparel the man would show thanks said conant i suppose the check will be round on thursday as usual the morals of this story have somehow gotten mixed you can take your choice of stay on the farm or don t write poetry the robe of peace mysteries follow one another so closely in a great city that the reading public and the friends of johnny bellchambers have ceased to marvel at his sudden and unexplained disappearance nearly a year ago this particular mystery has now been cleared up but the solution is so strange and incredible to the mind of the average man that only a select few who were in close touch with bellchambers will give it full credence johnny bellchambers as is well known belonged to the intrinsically inner circle of the elite without any of the ostentation of the fashionable ones who endeavor to attract notice by eccentric display of wealth and show he still was au fait in everything that gave deserved lustre to his high position in the ranks of society especially did he shine in the matter of dress in this he was the despair of imitators always correct exquisitely groomed and possessed of an unlimited wardrobe he was conceded to be the best dressed man in new york and therefore in america there was not a tailor in gotham who would not have deemed it a precious boon to have been granted the privilege of making bellchambers clothes without a cent of pay as he wore them they would have been a priceless advertisement trousers were his special passion here nothing but perfection would he notice he would have worn a patch as quickly as he would have overlooked a wrinkle he kept a man in his apartments always busy pressing his ample supply his friends said that three hours was the limit of time that he would wear these garments without exchanging bellchambers disappeared very suddenly for three days his absence brought no alarm to his friends and then they began to operate the usual methods of inquiry all of them failed he had left absolutely no trace behind then the search for a motive was instituted but none was found he had no enemies he had no debts there was no woman there were several thousand dollars in his bank to his credit he had never showed any tendency toward mental eccentricity in fact he was of a particularly calm and well balanced temperament every means of tracing the vanished man was made use of but without avail it was one of those cases more numerous in late years where men seem to have gone out like the flame of a candle leaving not even a trail of smoke as a witness in may tom eyres and lancelot gilliam two of bellchambers old friends went for a little run on the other side while pottering around in italy and switzerland they happened one day to hear of a monastery in the swiss alps that promised something outside of the ordinary tourist beguiling attractions the monastery was almost inaccessible to the average sightseer being on an extremely rugged and precipitous spur of the mountains the attractions it possessed but did not advertise were first an exclusive and divine cordial made by the monks that was said to far surpass benedictine and chartreuse next a huge brass bell so purely and accurately cast that it had not ceased sounding since it was first rung three hundred years ago finally it was asserted that no englishman had ever set foot within its walls eyres and gilliam decided that these three reports called for investigation it took them two days with the aid of two guides to reach the monastery of st gondrau it stood upon a frozen wind swept crag with the snow piled about it in treacherous drifting masses they were hospitably received by the brothers whose duty it was to entertain the infrequent guest they drank of the precious cordial finding it rarely potent and reviving they listened to the great ever echoing bell and learned that they were pioneer travelers in those gray stone walls over the englishman whose restless feet have trodden nearly every corner of the earth at three o clock on the afternoon they arrived the two young gothamites stood with good brother cristofer in the great cold hallway of the monastery to watch the monks march past on their way to the refectory they came slowly pacing by twos with their heads bowed treading noiselessly with sandaled feet upon the rough stone flags as the procession slowly filed past eyres suddenly gripped gilliam by the arm look he whispered eagerly at the one just opposite you now the one on this side with his hand at his waist if that isn t johnny bellchambers then i never saw him gilliam saw and recognized the lost glass of fashion what the deuce said he wonderingly is old bell doing here tommy it surely can t be he never heard of bell having a turn for the religious fact is i ve heard him say things when a four in hand didn t seem to tie up just right that would bring him up for court martial before any church it s bell without a doubt said eyres firmly or i m pretty badly in need of an oculist but think of johnny bellchambers the royal high chancellor of swell togs and the mahatma of pink teas up here in cold storage doing penance in a snuff colored bathrobe i can t get it straight in my mind let s ask the jolly old boy that s doing honors brother cristofer was appealed to for information by that time the monks had passed into the refectory he could not tell to which one they referred bellchambers ah the brothers of st gondrau abandoned their worldly names when they took the vows did the gentlemen wish to speak with one of the brothers if they would come to the refectory and indicate the one they wished to see the reverend abbot in authority would doubtless permit it eyres and gilliam went into the dining hall and pointed out to brother cristofer the man they had seen yes it was johnny bellchambers they saw his face plainly now as he sat among the dingy brothers never looking up eating broth from a coarse brown bowl permission to speak to one of the brothers was granted to the two travelers by the abbot and they waited in a reception room for him to come when he did come treading softly in his sandals both eyres and gilliam looked at him in perplexity and astonishment it was johnny bellchambers but he had a different look upon his smooth shaven face was an expression of ineffable peace of rapturous attainment of perfect and complete happiness his form was proudly erect his eyes shone with a serene and gracious light he was as neat and well groomed as in the old new york days but how differently was he clad now he seemed clothed in but a single garment a long robe of rough brown cloth gathered by a cord at the waist and falling in straight loose folds nearly to his feet he shook hands with his visitors with his old ease and grace of manner if there was any embarrassment in that meeting it was not manifested by johnny bellchambers the room had no seats they stood to converse glad to see you old man said eyres somewhat awkwardly wasn t expecting to find you up here not a bad idea though after all society s an awful sham must be a relief to shake the giddy whirl and retire to er contemplation and er prayer and hymns and those things oh cut that tommy said bellchambers cheerfully don t be afraid that i ll pass around the plate i go through these thing um bobs with the rest of these old boys because they are the rules i m brother ambrose here you know i m given just ten minutes to talk to you fellows that s rather a new design in waistcoats you have on isn t it gilliam are they wearing those things on broadway now it s the same old johnny said gilliam joyfully what the devil i mean why oh confound it what did you do it for old man peel the bathrobe pleaded eyres almost tearfully and go back with us the old crowd ll go wild to see you this isn t in your line bell i know half a dozen girls that wore the willow on the quiet when you shook us in that unaccountable way hand in your resignation or get a dispensation or whatever you have to do to get a release from this ice factory you ll get catarrh here johnny and my god you haven t any socks on bellchambers looked down at his sandaled feet and smiled you fellows don t understand he said soothingly it s nice of you to want me to go back but the old life will never know me again i have reached here the goal of all my ambitions i am entirely happy and contented here i shall remain for the remainder of my days you see this robe that i wear bellchambers caressingly touched the straight hanging garment at last i have found something that will not bag at the knees i have attained at that moment the deep boom of the great brass bell reverberated through the monastery it must have been a summons to immediate devotions for brother ambrose bowed his head turned and left the chamber without another word a slight wave of his hand as he passed through the stone doorway seemed to say a farewell to his old friends they left the monastery without seeing him again and this is the story that tommy eyres and lancelot gilliam brought back with them from their latest european tour the girl and the graft the other day i ran across my old friend ferguson pogue pogue is a conscientious grafter of the highest type his headquarters is the western hemisphere and his line of business is anything from speculating in town lots on the great staked plains to selling wooden toys in connecticut made by hydraulic pressure from nutmegs ground to a pulp now and then when pogue has made a good haul he comes to new york for a rest he says the jug of wine and loaf of bread and thou in the wilderness business is about as much rest and pleasure to him as sliding down the bumps at coney would be to president taft give me says pogue a big city for my vacation especially new york i m not much fond of new yorkers and manhattan is about the only place on the globe where i don t find any while in the metropolis pogue can always be found at one of two places one is a little second hand bookshop on fourth avenue where he reads books about his hobbies mahometanism and taxidermy i found him at the other his hall bedroom in eighteenth street where he sat in his stocking feet trying to pluck the banks of the wabash out of a small zither four years he has practised this tune without arriving near enough to cast the longest trout line to the water s edge on the dresser lay a blued steel colt s forty five and a tight roll of tens and twenties large enough around to belong to the spring rattlesnake story class a chambermaid with a room cleaning air fluttered nearby in the hall unable to enter or to flee scandalized by the stocking feet aghast at the colt s yet powerless with her metropolitan instincts to remove herself beyond the magic influence of the yellow hued roll i sat on his trunk while ferguson pogue talked no one could be franker or more candid in his conversation beside his expression the cry of henry james for lacteal nourishment at the age of one month would have seemed like a chaldean cryptogram he told me stories of his profession with pride for he considered it an art and i was curious enough to ask him whether he had known any women who followed it ladies said pogue with western chivalry well not to any great extent they don t amount to much in special lines of graft because they re all so busy in general lines what why they have to who s got the money in the world the men did you ever know a man to give a woman a dollar without any consideration a man will shell out his dust to another man free and easy and gratis but if he drops a penny in one of the machines run by the madam eve s daughters amalgamated association and the pineapple chewing gum don t fall out when he pulls the lever you can hear him kick to the superintendent four blocks away man is the hardest proposition a woman has to go up against he s the low grade one and she has to work overtime to make him pay two times out of five she s salted she can t put in crushers and costly machinery he d notice em and be onto the game they have to pan out what they get and it hurts their tender hands some of em are natural sluice troughs and can carry out to the ton the dry eyed ones have to depend on signed letters false hair sympathy the kangaroo walk cowhide whips ability to cook sentimental juries conversational powers silk underskirts ancestry rouge anonymous letters violet sachet powders witnesses revolvers pneumatic forms carbolic acid moonlight cold cream and the evening newspapers you are outrageous ferg i said surely there is none of this graft as you call it in a perfect and harmonious matrimonial union well said pogue nothing that would justify you every time in calling police headquarters and ordering out the reserves and a vaudeville manager on a dead run but it s this way suppose you re a fifth avenue millionaire soaring high on the right side of copper and cappers you come home at night and bring a diamond brooch to the lady who s staked your for a claim you hand it over she says oh george and looks to see if it s backed she comes up and kisses you you ve waited for it you get it all right it s graft but i m telling you about artemisia blye she was from kansas and she suggested corn in all of its phases her hair was as yellow as the silk her form was as tall and graceful as a stalk in the low grounds during a wet summer her eyes were as big and startling as bunions and green was her favorite color on my last trip into the cool recesses of your sequestered city i met a human named vaucross he was worth that is he had a million he told me he was in business on the street a sidewalk merchant says i sarcastic exactly says he senior partner of a paving concern i kind of took to him for this reason i met him on broadway one night when i was out of heart luck tobacco and place he was all silk hat diamonds and front he was all front if you had gone behind him you would have only looked yourself in the face i looked like a cross between count tolstoy and a june lobster i was out of luck i had but let me lay my eyes on that dealer again vaucross stopped and talked to me a few minutes and then he took me to a high toned restaurant to eat dinner there was music and then some beethoven and bordelaise sauce and cussing in french and frangipangi and some hauteur and cigarettes when i am flush i know them places i declare i must have looked as bad as a magazine artist sitting there without any money and my hair all rumpled like i was booked to read a chapter from elsie s school days at a brooklyn bohemian smoker but vaucross treated me like a bear hunter s guide he wasn t afraid of hurting the waiter s feelings mr pogue he explains to me i am using you go on says i i hope you don t wake up and then he tells me you know the kind of man he was he was a new yorker his whole ambition was to be noticed he wanted to be conspicuous he wanted people to point him out and bow to him and tell others who he was he said it had been the desire of his life always he didn t have but a million so he couldn t attract attention by spending money he said he tried to get into public notice one time by planting a little public square on the east side with garlic for free use of the poor but carnegie heard of it and covered it over at once with a library in the gaelic language three times he had jumped in the way of automibiles but the only result was five broken ribs and a notice in the papers that an unknown man five feet ten with four amalgam filled teeth supposed to be the last of the famous red leary gang had been run over ever try the reporters i asked him last month says mr vaucross my expenditure for lunches to reporters was get anything out of that i asks that reminds me says he add for perpsin yes i got indigestion how am i supposed to push along your scramble for prominence i inquires contrast something of that sort to night says vaucross it grieves me but i am forced to resort to eccentricity and here he drops his napkin in his soup and rises up and bows to a gent who is devastating a potato under a palm across the room the police commissioner says my climber gratified friend says i in a hurry have ambitions but don t kick a rung out of your ladder when you use me as a stepping stone to salute the police you spoil my appetite on the grounds that i may be degraded and incriminated be thoughtful at the quaker city squab en casserole the idea about artemisia blye comes to me suppose i can manage to get you in the papers says i a column or two every day in all of em and your picture in most of em for a week how much would it be worth to you ten thousand dollars says vaucross warm in a minute but no murder says he and i won t wear pink pants at a cotillon i wouldn t ask you to says i this is honorable stylish and uneffiminate tell the waiter to bring a demi tasse and some other beans and i will disclose to you the opus moderandi we closed the deal an hour later in the rococo rouge et noise room i telegraphed that night to miss artemisia in salina she took a couple of photographs and an autograph letter to an elder in the fourth presbyterian church in the morning and got some transportation and she stopped in topeka long enough to trade a flashlight interior and a valentine to the vice president of a trust company for a mileage book and a package of five dollar notes with scrawled on the band the fifth evening after she got my wire she was waiting all d ecollet ee and dressed up for me and vaucross to take her to dinner in one of these new york feminine apartment houses where a man can t get in unless he plays bezique and smokes depilatory powder cigarettes she s a stunner says vaucross when he saw her they ll give her a two column cut sure this was the scheme the three of us concocted it was business straight through vaucross was to rush miss blye with all the style and display and emotion he could for a month of course that amounted to nothing as far as his ambitions were concerned the sight of a man in a white tie and patent leather pumps pouring greenbacks through the large end of a cornucopia to purchase nutriment and heartsease for tall willowy blondes in new york is as common a sight as blue turtles in delirium tremens but he was to write her love letters the worst kind of love letters such as your wife publishes after you are dead every day at the end of the month he was to drop her and she would bring suit for for breach of promise miss artemisia was to get if she won the suit that was all and if she lost she was to get it anyhow there was a signed contract to that effect sometimes they had me out with em but not often i couldn t keep up to their style she used to pull out his notes and criticize them like bills of lading say you she d say what do you call this letter to a hardware merchant from his nephew on learning that his aunt has nettlerash you eastern duffers know as much about writing love letters as a kansas grasshopper does about tugboats my dear miss blye wouldn t that put pink icing and a little red sugar bird on your bridal cake how long do you expect to hold an audience in a court room with that kind of stuff you want to get down to business and call me tweedlums babe and honeysuckle and sing yourself mama s own big bad puggy wuggy boy if you want any limelight to concentrate upon your sparse gray hairs get sappy after that vaucross dipped his pen in the indelible tabasco his notes read like something or other in the original i could see a jury sitting up and women tearing one another s hats to hear em read and i could see piling up for mr vaucross as much notoriousness as archbishop crammer or the brooklyn bridge or cheese on salad ever enjoyed he seemed mighty pleased at the prospects they agreed on a night and i stood on fifth avenue outside a solemn restaurant and watched em a process server walked in and handed vaucross the papers at this table everybody looked at em and he looked as proud as cicero i went back to my room and lit a five cent cigar for i knew the was as good as ours about two hours later somebody knocked at my door there stood vaucross and miss artemisia and she was clinging yes sir clinging to his arm and they tells me they d been out and got married and they articulated some trivial cadences about love and such and they laid down a bundle on the table and said good night and left and that s why i say concluded ferguson pogue that a woman is too busy occupied with her natural vocation and instinct of graft such as is given her for self preservation and amusement to make any great success in special lines what was in the bundle they left i asked with my usual curiosity why said ferguson there was a scalper s railroad ticket as far as kansas city and two pairs of mr vaucross s old pants the call of the tame when the inauguration was accomplished the proceedings were made smooth by the presence of the rough riders it is well known that a herd of those competent and loyal ex warrriors paid a visit to the big city the newspaper reporters dug out of their trunks the old broad brimmed hats and leather belts that they wear to north beach fish fries and mixed with the visitors no damage was done beyond the employment of the wonderful plural tenderfeet in each of the scribe s stories the westerners mildly contemplated the skyscrapers as high as the third story yawned at broadway hunched down in the big chairs in hotel corridors and altogether looked as bored and dejected as a member of ye ancient and honorable artillery separated during a sham battle from his valet out of this sightseeing delegations of good king teddy s gentlemen of the royal bear hounds dropped one greenbrier nye of pin feather ariz the daily cyclone of sixth avenue s rush hour swept him away from the company of his pardners true the dust from a thousand rustling skirts filled his eyes the mighty roar of trains rushing across the sky deafened him the lightning flash of twice ten hundred beaming eyes confused his vision the storm was so sudden and tremendous that greenbrier s first impulse was to lie down and grab a root and then he remembered that the disturbance was human and not elemental and he backed out of it with a grin into a doorway the reporters had written that but for the widebrimmed hats the west was not visible upon these gauchos of the north heaven sharpen their eyes the suit of black diagonal wrinkled in impossible places the bright blue four in hand factory tied the low turned down collar pattern of the days of seymour and blair white glazed as the letters on the window of the open day and night except sunday restaurants the out curve at the knees from the saddle grip the peculiar spread of the half closed right thumb and fingers from the stiff hold upon the circling lasso the deeply absorbed weather tan that the hottest sun of cape may can never equal the seldom winking blue eyes that unconsciously divided the rushing crowds into fours as though they were being counted out of a corral the segregated loneliness and solemnity of expression as of an emperor or of one whose horizons have not intruded upon him nearer than a day s ride these brands of the west were set upon greenbrier nye oh yes he wore a broadbrimmed hat gentle reader just like those the madison square post office mail carriers wear when they go up to bronx park on sunday afternoons suddenly greenbrier nye jumped into the drifting herd of metropolitan cattle seized upon a man dragged him out of the stream and gave him a buffet upon his collarbone that sent him reeling against a wall the victim recovered his hat with the angry look of a new yorker who has suffered an outrage and intends to write to the trib about it but he looked at his assailant and knew that the blow was in consideration of love and affection after the manner of the west which greets its friends with contumely and uproar and pounding fists and receives its enemies in decorum and order such as the judicious placing of the welcoming bullet demands god in the mountains cried greenbrier holding fast to the foreleg of his cull can this be longhorn merritt the other man was oh look on broadway any day for the pattern business man latest rolled brim derby good barber business digestion and tailor greenbrier nye he exclaimed grasping the hand that had smitten him my dear fellow so glad to see you how did you come to oh to be sure the inaugural ceremonies i remember you joined the rough riders you must come and have luncheon with me of course greenbrier pinned him sadly but firmly to the wall with a hand the size shape and color of a mcclellan saddle longy he said in a melancholy voice that disturbed traffic what have they been doing to you you act just like a citizen they done made you into an inmate of the city directory you never made no such johnny branch execration of yourself as that out on the gila come and have lunching with me you never defined grub by any such terms of reproach in them days i ve been living in new york seven years said merritt it s been eight since we punched cows together in old man garcia s outfit well let s go to a caf e anyhow it sounds good to hear it called grub again they picked their way through the crowd to a hotel and drifted as by a natural law to the bar speak up invited greenbrier a dry martini said merritt oh lord cried greenbrier and yet me and you once saw the same pink gila monsters crawling up the walls of the same hotel in canon diablo a dry but let that pass whiskey straight and they re on you merritt smiled and paid they lunched in a small extension of the dining room that connected with the caf e merritt dexterously diverted his friend s choice that hovered over ham and eggs to a pur ee of celery a salmon cutlet a partridge pie and a desirable salad on the day said greenbrier grieved and thunderous when i can t hold but one drink before eating when i meet a friend i ain t seen in eight years at a by table in a thirty cent town at o clock on the third day of the week i want nine broncos to kick me forty times over a acre section of land get them statistics right old man laughed merritt waiter bring an absinthe frapp e and what s yours greenbrier whiskey straight mourned nye out of the neck of a bottle you used to take it longy straight out of the neck of a bottle on a galloping pony arizona redeye not this ab oh what s the use they re on you merritt slipped the wine card under his glass all right i suppose you think i m spoiled by the city i m as good a westerner as you are greenbrier but somehow i can t make up my mind to go back out there new york is comfortable comfortable i make a good living and i live it no more wet blankets and riding herd in snowstorms and bacon and cold coffee and blowouts once in six months for me i reckon i ll hang out here in the future we ll take in the theatre to night greenbrier and after that we ll dine at i ll tell you what you are merritt said greenbrier laying one elbow in his salad and the other in his butter you are a concentrated effete unconditional short sleeved gotch eared miss sally walker god made you perpendicular and suitable to ride straddle and use cuss words in the original wherefore you have suffered his handiwork to elapse by removing yourself to new york and putting on little shoes tied with strings and making faces when you talk i ve seen you rope and tie a steer in if you was to see one now you d write to the police commissioner about it and these flapdoodle drinks that you inoculate your system with these little essences of cowslip with acorns in em and paregoric flip they ain t anyways in assent with the cordiality of manhood i hate to see you this way well mr greenbrier said merritt with apology in his tone in a way you are right sometimes i do feel like i was being raised on the bottle but i tell you new york is comfortable comfortable there s something about it the sights and the crowds and the way it changes every day and the very air of it that seems to tie a one mile long stake rope around a man s neck with the other end fastened somewhere about thirty fourth street i don t know what it is god knows said greenbrier sadly and i know the east has gobbled you up you was venison and now you re veal you put me in mind of a japonica in a window you ve been signed sealed and diskivered requiescat in hoc signo you make me thirsty a green chartreuse here said merritt to the waiter whiskey straight sighed greenbrier and they re on you you renegade of the round ups guilty with an application for mercy said merritt you don t know how it is greenbrier it s so comfortable here that please loan me your smelling salts pleaded greenbrier if i hadn t seen you once bluff three bluffers from mazatzal city with an empty gun in phoenix greenbrier s voice died away in pure grief cigars he called harshly to the waiter to hide his emotion a pack of turkish cigarettes for mine said merritt they re on you chanted greenbrier struggling to conceal his contempt at seven they dined in the where to dine well column that evening a galaxy had assembled there bright shone the lights o er fair women and br let it go anyhow brave men the orchestra played charmingly hardly had a tip from a diner been placed in its hands by a waiter when it would burst forth into soniferousness the more beer you contributed to it the more meyerbeer it gave you which is reciprocity merritt put forth exertions on the dinner greenbrier was his old friend and he liked him he persuaded him to drink a cocktail i take the horehound tea said greenbrier for old times sake but i d prefer whiskey straight they re on you right said merritt now run your eye down that bill of fare and see if it seems to hitch on any of these items lay me on my lava bed said greenbrier with bulging eyes all these specimens of nutriment in the grub wagon what s this horse with the heaves i pass but look along here s truck for twenty roundups all spelled out in different directions wait till i see the viands ordered merritt turned to the wine list this medoc isn t bad he suggested you re the doc said greenbrier i d rather have whiskey straight it s on you greenbrier looked around the room the waiter brought things and took dishes away he was observing he saw a new york restaurant crowd enjoying itself how was the range when you left the gila asked merritt fine said greenbrier you see that lady in the red speckled silk at that table well she could warm over her beans at my campfire yes the range was good she looks as nice as a white mustang i see once on black river when the coffee came greenbrier put one foot on the seat of the chair next to him you said it was a comfortable town longy he said meditatively yes it s a comfortable town it s different from the plains in a blue norther what did you call that mess in the crock with the handle longy oh yes squabs in a cash roll they re worth the roll that white mustang had just such a way of turning his head and shaking his mane look at her longy if i thought i could sell out my ranch at a fair price i believe i d gyar song he suddenly cried in a voice that paralyzed every knife and fork in the restaurant the waiter dived toward the table two more of them cocktail drinks ordered greenbrier merritt looked at him and smiled significantly they re on me said greenbrier blowing a puff of smoke to the ceiling the unknown quantity the poet longfellow or was it confucius the inventor of wisdom remarked life is real life is earnest and things are not what they seem as mathematics are or is thanks old subscriber the only just rule

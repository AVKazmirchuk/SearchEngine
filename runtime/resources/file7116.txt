was sitting in the sun playing with his toes and told him to put on his trousers and run for the doctor come back says i sit down maxy and forget it tis not ice you see nor a lunatic upon it tis only an exile full of homesickness sitting on a lump of glass that s just cost him a thousand dollars now what was it johnny said to the widow first i d like to hear it again maxy honest don t mind what i said maximilian jones and i sat down and talked he was about as sick of the country as i was for the grafters were squeezing him for half the profits of his rosewood and rubber down in the bottom of a tank of water i had a dozen bottles of sticky frisco beer and i fished these up and we fell to talking about home and the flag and hail columbia and home fried potatoes and the drivel we contributed would have sickened any man enjoying those blessings but at that time we were out of em you can t appreciate home till you ve left it money till it s spent your wife till she s joined a woman s club nor old glory till you see it hanging on a broomstick on the shanty of a consul in a foreign town and sitting there me and maximilian jones scratching at our prickly heat and kicking at the lizards on the floor became afflicted with a dose of patriotism and affection for our country there was me billy casparis reduced from a capitalist to a pauper by over addiction to my glass in the lump declares my troubles off for the present and myself to be an uncrowned sovereign of the greatest country on earth and maximilian jones pours out whole drug stores of his wrath on oligarchies and potentates in red trousers and calico shoes and we issues a declaration of interference in which we guarantee that the fourth day of july shall be celebrated in salvador with all the kinds of salutes explosions honours of war oratory and liquids known to tradition yes neither me nor jones breathed with soul so dead there shall be rucuses in salvador we say and the monkeys had better climb the tallest cocoanut trees and the fire department get out its red sashes and two tin buckets about this time into the factory steps a native man incriminated by the name of general mary esperanza dingo he was some pumpkin both in politics and colour and the friend of me and jones he was full of politeness and a kind of intelligence having picked up the latter and managed to preserve the former during a two years residence in philadelphia studying medicine for a salvadorian he was not such a calamitous little man though he always would play jack queen king ace deuce for a straight general mary sits with us and has a bottle while he was in the states he had acquired a synopsis of the english language and the art of admiring our institutions by and by the general gets up and tiptoes to the doors and windows and other stage entrances remarking hist at each one they all do that in salvador before they ask for a drink of water or the time of day being conspirators from the cradle and matinee idols by proclamation hist says general dingo again and then he lays his chest on the table quite like gaspard the miser good friends senores to morrow will be the great day of liberty and independence the hearts of americans and salvadorians should beat together of your history and your great washington i know is it not so now me and jones thought that nice of the general to remember when the fourth came it made us feel good he must have heard the news going round in philadelphia about that disturbance we had with england yes says me and maxy together we knew it we were talking about it when you came in and you can bet your bottom concession that there ll be fuss and feathers in the air to morrow we are few in numbers but the welkin may as well reach out to push the button for it s got to ring i too shall assist says the general thumping his collar bone i too am on the side of liberty noble americans we will make the day one to be never forgotten for us american whisky says jones none of your scotch smoke or anisada or three star hennessey to morrow we ll borrow the consul s flag old man billfinger shall make orations and we ll have a barbecue on the plaza fireworks says i will be scarce but we ll have all the cartridges in the shops for our guns i ve got two navy sixes i brought from denver there is one cannon said the general one big cannon that will go boom and three hundred men with rifles to shoot oh say says jones generalissimo you re the real silk elastic we ll make it a joint international celebration please general get a white horse and a blue sash and be grand marshal with my sword says the general rolling his eyes i shall ride at the head of the brave men who gather in the name of liberty and you might we suggest see the commandante and advise him that we are going to prize things up a bit we americans you know are accustomed to using municipal regulations for gun wadding when we line up to help the eagle scream he might suspend the rules for one day we don t want to get in the calaboose for spanking his soldiers if they get in our way do you see hist says general mary the commandant is with us heart and soul he will aid us he is one of us we made all the arrangements that afternoon there was a buck coon from georgia in salvador who had drifted down there from a busted up coloured colony that had been started on some possumless land in mexico as soon as he heard us say barbecue he wept for joy and groveled on the ground he dug his trench on the plaza and got half a beef on the coals for an all night roast me and maxy went to see the rest of the americans in the town and they all sizzled like a seidlitz with joy at the idea of solemnizing an old time fourth there were six of us all together martin dillard a coffee planter henry barnes a railroad man old man billfinger an educated tintype taker me and jonesy and jerry the boss of the barbecue there was also an englishman in town named sterrett who was there to write a book on domestic architecture of the insect world we felt some bashfulness about inviting a britisher to help crow over his own country but we decided to risk it out of our personal regard for him we found sterrett in pajamas working at his manuscript with a bottle of brandy for a paper weight englishman says jones let us interrupt your disquisition on bug houses for a moment to morrow is the fourth of july we don t want to hurt your feelings but we re going to commemorate the day when we licked you by a little refined debauchery and nonsense something that can be heard above five miles off if you are broad gauged enough to taste whisky at your own wake we d be pleased to have you join us do you know says sterrett setting his glasses on his nose i like your cheek in asking me if i ll join you blast me if i don t you might have known i would without asking not as a traitor to my own country but for the intrinsic joy of a blooming row on the morning of the fourth i woke up in that old shanty of an ice factory feeling sore i looked around at the wreck of all i possessed and my heart was full of bile from where i lay on my cot i could look through the window and see the consul s old ragged stars and stripes hanging over his shack you re all kinds of a fool billy casparis i said to myself and of all your crimes against sense it does look like this idea of celebrating the fourth should receive the award of demerit your business is busted up your thousand dollars is gone into the kitty of this corrupt country on that last bluff you made you ve got just fifteen chili dollars left worth forty six cents each at bedtime last night and steadily going down to day you ll blow in your last cent hurrahing for that flag and to morrow you ll be living on bananas from the stalk and screwing your drinks out of your friends what s the flag done for you while you were under it you worked for what you got you wore your finger nails down skinning suckers and salting mines and driving bears and alligators off your town lot additions how much does patriotism count for on deposit with the little man with the green eye shade in the savings bank adds up your book suppose you were to get pinched over here in this irreligious country for some little crime or other and appealed to your country for protection what would it do for you turn your appeal over to a committee of one railroad man an army officer a member of each labour union and a coloured man to investigate whether any of your ancestors were ever related to a cousin of mark hanna and then file the papers in the smithsonian institution until after the next election that s the kind of a sidetrack the stars and stripes would switch you onto you can see that i was feeling like an indigo plant but after i washed my face in some cool water and got out my navys and ammunition and started up to the saloon of the immaculate saints where we were to meet i felt better and when i saw those other american boys come swaggering into the trysting place cool easy conspicuous fellows ready to risk any kind of a one card draw or to fight grizzlies fire or extradition i began to feel glad i was one of em so i says to myself again billy you ve got fifteen dollars and a country left this morning blow in the dollars and blow up the town as an american gentleman should on independence day it is my recollection that we began the day along conventional lines the six of us for sterrett was along made progress among the cantinas divesting the bars as we went of all strong drink bearing american labels we kept informing the atmosphere as to the glory and preeminence of the united states and its ability to subdue outjump and eradicate the other nations of the earth and as the findings of american labels grew more plentiful we became more contaminated with patriotism maximilian jones hopes that our late foe mr sterrett will not take offense at our enthusiasm he sets down his bottle and shakes sterrett s hand as white man to white man says he denude our uproar of the slightest taint of personality excuse us for bunker hill patrick henry and waldorf astor and such grievances as might lie between us as nations fellow hoodlums says sterrett on behalf of the queen i ask you to cheese it it is an honour to be a guest at disturbing the peace under the american flag let us chant the passionate strains of yankee doodle while the senor behind the bar mitigates the occasion with another round of cochineal and aqua fortis old man billfinger being charged with a kind of rhetoric makes speeches every time we stop we explained to such citizens as we happened to step on that we were celebrating the dawn of our own private brand of liberty and to please enter such inhumanities as we might commit on the list of unavoidable casualties about eleven o clock our bulletins read a considerable rise in temperature accompanied by thirst and other alarming symptoms we hooked arms and stretched our line across the narrow streets all of us armed with winchesters and navys for purposes of noise and without malice we stopped on a street corner and fired a dozen or so rounds and began a serial assortment of united states whoops and yells probably the first ever heard in that town when we made that noise things began to liven up we heard a pattering up a side street and here came general mary esperanza dingo on a white horse with a couple of hundred brown boys following him in red undershirts and bare feet dragging guns ten feet long jones and me had forgot all about general mary and his promise to help us celebrate we fired another salute and gave another yell while the general shook hands with us and waved his sword oh general shouts jones this is great this will be a real pleasure to the eagle get down and have a drink drink says the general no there is no time to drink vive la libertad don t forget e pluribus unum says henry barnes viva it good and strong says i likewise viva george washington god save the union and i says bowing to sterrett don t discard the queen thanks says sterrett the next round s mine all in to the bar army too but we were deprived of sterrett s treat by a lot of gunshots several square sway which general dingo seemed to think he ought to look after he spurred his old white plug up that way and the soldiers scuttled along after him mary is a real tropical bird says jones he s turned out the infantry to help us to honour to the fourth we ll get that cannon he spoke of after a while and fire some window breakers with it but just now i want some of that barbecued beef let us on to the plaza there we found the meat gloriously done and jerry waiting anxious we sat around on the grass and got hunks of it on our tin plates maximilian jones always made tender hearted by drink cried some because george washington couldn t be there to enjoy the day there was a man i love billy he says weeping on my shoulder poor george to think he s gone and missed the fireworks a little more salt please jerry from what we could hear general dingo seemed to be kindly contributing some noise while we feasted there were guns going off around town and pretty soon we heard that cannon go boom just as he said it would and then men began to skin along the edge of the plaza dodging in among the orange trees and houses we certainly had things stirred up in salvador we felt proud of the occasion and grateful to general dingo sterrett was about to take a bite off a juicy piece of rib when a bullet took it away from his mouth somebody s celebrating with ball cartridges says he reaching for another piece little over zealous for a non resident patriot isn t it don t mind it i says to him twas an accident they happen you know on the fourth after one reading of the declaration of independence in new york i ve known the s r o sign to be hung out at all the hospitals and police stations but then jerry gives a howl and jumps up with one hand clapped to the back of his leg where another bullet has acted over zealous and then comes a quantity of yells and round a corner and across the plaza gallops general mary esperanza dingo embracing the neck of his horse with his men running behind him mostly dropping their guns by way of discharging ballast and chasing em all is a company of feverish little warriors wearing blue trousers and caps assistance amigos the general shouts trying to stop his horse assistance in the name of liberty that s the campania azul the president s bodyguard says jones what a shame they ve jumped on poor old mary just because he was helping us to celebrate come on boys it s our fourth do we let that little squad of a d t s break it up i vote no says martin dillard gathering his winchester it s the privilege of an american citizen to drink drill dress up and be dreadful on the fourth of july no matter whose country he s in fellow citizens says old man billfinger in the darkest hour of freedom s birth when our brave forefathers promulgated the principles of undying liberty they never expected that a bunch of blue jays like that should be allowed to bust up an anniversary let us preserve and protect the constitution we made it unanimous and then we gathered our guns and assaulted the blue troops in force we fired over their heads and then charged em with a yell and they broke and ran we were irritated at having our barbecue disturbed and we chased em a quarter of a mile some of em we caught and kicked hard the general rallied his troops and joined in the chase finally they scattered in a thick banana grove and we couldn t flush a single one so we sat down and rested if i were to be put severe through the third degree i wouldn t be able to tell much about the rest of the day i mind that we pervaded the town considerable calling upon the people to bring out more armies for us to destroy i remember seeing a crowd somewhere and a tall man that wasn t billfinger making a fourth of july speech from a balcony and that was about all somebody must have hauled the old ice factory up to where i was and put it around me for there s where i was when i woke up the next morning as soon as i could recollect by name and address i got up and held an inquest my last cent was gone i was all in and then a neat black carriage drives to the door and out steps general dingo and a bay man in a silk hat and tan shoes yes says i to myself i see it now you re the chief de policeos and high lord chamberlain of the calaboosum and you want billy casparis for excess of patriotism and assault with intent all right might as well be in jail anyhow but it seems that general mary is smiling and the bay man shakes my hand and speaks in the american dialect general dingo has informed me senor casparis of your gallant service in our cause i desire to thank you with my person the bravery of you and the other senores americanos turned the struggle for liberty in our favour our party triumphed the terrible battle will live forever in history battle says i what battle and i ran my mind back along history trying to think senor casparis is modest says general dingo he led his brave compadres into the thickest of the fearful conflict yes without their aid the revolution would have failed why now says i don t tell me there was a revolution yesterday that was only a fourth of but right there i abbreviated it seemed to me it might be best after the terrible struggle says the bay man president bolano was forced to fly to day caballo is president by proclamation ah yes beneath the new administration i am the head of the department of mercantile concessions on my file i find one report senor casparis that you have not made ice in accord with your contract and here the bay man smiles at me cute oh well says i i guess the report s straight i know they caught me that s all there is to it do not say so says the bay man he pulls off a glove and goes over and lays his hand on that chunk of glass ice says he nodding his head solemn general dingo also steps over and feels of it ice says the general i ll swear to it if senor casparis says the bay man will present himself to the treasury on the sixth day of this month he will receive back the thousand dollars he did deposit as a forfeit adios senor the general and the bay man bowed themselves out and i bowed as often as they did and when the carriage rolls away through the sand i bows once more deeper than ever till my hat touches the ground but this time twas not intended for them for over their heads i saw the old flag fluttering in the breeze above the consul s roof and twas to it i made my profoundest salute the emancipation of billy in the old old square porticoed mansion with the wry window shutters and the paint peeling off in discoloured flakes lived one of the last war governors the south has forgotten the enmity of the great conflict but it refuses to abandon its old traditions and idols in governor pemberton as he was still fondly called the inhabitants of elmville saw the relic of their state s ancient greatness and glory in his day he had been a man large in the eye of his country his state had pressed upon him every honour within its gift and now when he was old and enjoying a richly merited repose outside the swift current of public affairs his townsmen loved to do him reverence for the sake of the past the governor s decaying mansion stood upon the main street of elmville within a few feet of its rickety paling fence every morning the governor would descend the steps with extreme care and deliberation on account of his rheumatism and then the click of his gold headed cane would be heard as he slowly proceeded up the rugged brick sidewalk he was now nearly seventy eight but he had grown old gracefully and beautifully his rather long smooth hair and flowing parted whiskers were snow white his full skirted frock croak was always buttoned snugly about his tall spare figure he wore a high well kept silk hat known as a plug in elmville and nearly always gloves his manners were punctilious and somewhat overcharged with courtesy the governor s walks up lee avenue the principal street developed in their course into a sort of memorial triumphant procession everyone he met saluted him with profound respect many would remove their hats those who were honoured with his personal friendship would pause to shake hands and then you would see exemplified the genuine beau ideal southern courtesy upon reaching the corner of the second square from the mansion the governor would pause another street crossed the venue there and traffic to the extent of several farmers wagons and a peddler s cart or two would rage about the junction then the falcon eye of general deffenbaugh would perceive the situation and the general would hasten with ponderous solicitude from his office in the first national bank building to the assistance of his old friend when the two exchanged greetings the decay of modern manners would become accusingly apparent the general s bulky and commanding figure would bend lissomely at a point where you would have regarded its ability to do so with incredulity the governor would take the general s arm and be piloted safely between the hay wagons and the sprinkling cart to the other side of the street proceeding to the post office in the care of his friend the esteemed statesmen would there hold an informal levee among the citizens who were come for their morning mail here gathering two or three prominent in law politics or family the pageant would make a stately progress along the avenue stopping at the palace hotel where perhaps would be found upon the register the name of some guest deemed worthy of an introduction to the state s venerable and illustrious son if any such were found an hour or two would be spent in recalling the faded glories of the governor s long vanished administration on the return march the general would invariably suggest that his excellency being no doubt fatigued it would be wise to recuperate for a few minutes at the drug emporium of mr appleby r fentress an elegant gentleman sir one of the chatham county fentresses so many of our best blooded families have had to go into trade sir since the war mr appleby r fentress was a connoisseur in fatigue indeed if he had not been his memory alone should have enabled him to prescribe for the majestic invasion of his pharmacy was a casual happening that had surprised him almost daily for years mr fentress knew the formula of and possessed the skill to compound a certain potion antagonistic to fatigue the salient ingredient of which he described no doubt in pharmaceutical terms as genuine old hand made clover leaf private stock nor did the ceremony of administering the potion ever vary mr fentress would first compound two of the celebrated mixtures one for the governor and the other for the general to sample then the governor would make this little speech in his high piping quavering voice no sir not one drop until you have prepared one for yourself and join us mr fentress your father sir was one of my most valued supporters and friends during my administration and any mark of esteem i can confer upon his son is not only a pleasure but a duty sir blushing with delight at the royal condescension the druggist would obey and all would drink to the general s toast the prosperity of our grand old state gentlemen the memory of her glorious past the health of her favourite son some one of the old guard was always at hand to escort the governor home sometimes the general s business duties denied him the privilege and then judge broomfield or colonel titus or one of the ashford county slaughters would be on hand to perform the rite such were the observances attendant upon the governor s morning stroll to the post office how much more magnificent impressive and spectacular then was the scene at public functions when the general would lead forth the silver haired relic of former greatness like some rare and fragile waxwork figure and trumpet his pristine eminence to his fellow citizens general deffenbaugh was the voice of elmville some said he was elmville at any rate he had no competitor as the mouthpiece he owned enough stock in the daily banner to dictate its utterance enough shares in the first national bank to be the referee of its loans and a war record that left him without a rival for first place at barbecues school commencements and decoration days besides these acquirements he was possessed with endowments his personality was inspiring and triumphant undisputed sway had moulded him to the likeness of a fatted roman emperor the tones of his voice were not otherwise than clarion to say that the general was public spirited would fall short of doing him justice he had spirit enough for a dozen publics and as a sure foundation for it all he had a heart that was big and stanch yes general deffenbaugh was elmville one little incident that usually occurred during the governor s morning walk has had its chronicling delayed by more important matters the procession was accustomed to halt before a small brick office on the avenue fronted by a short flight of steep wooden steps a modest tin sign over the door bore the words wm b pemberton attorney at law looking inside the general would roar hello billy my boy the less distinguished members of the escort would call morning billy the governor would pipe good morning william then a patient looking little man with hair turning gray along the temples would come down the steps and shake hands with each one of the party all elmville shook hands when it met the formalities concluded the little man would go back to his table heaped with law books and papers while the procession would proceed billy pemberton was as his sign declared a lawyer by profession by occupation and common consent he was the son of his father this was the shadow in which billy lived the pit out of which he had unsuccessfully striven for years to climb and he had come to believe the grave in which his ambitions were destined to be buried filial respect and duty he paid beyond the habit of most sons but he aspired to be known and appraised by his own deeds and worth after many years of tireless labour he had become known in certain quarters far from elmville as a master of the principles of the law twice he had gone to washington and argued cases before the highest tribunal with such acute logic and learning that the silken gowns on the bench had rustled from the force of it his income from his practice had grown until he was able to support his father in the old family mansion which neither of them would have thought of abandoning rickety as it was in the comfort and almost the luxury of the old extravagant days yet he remained to elmville as only billy pemberton the son of our distinguished and honoured fellow townsman ex governor pemberton thus was he introduced at public gatherings where he sometimes spoke haltingly and prosily for his talents were too serious and deep for extempore brilliancy thus was he presented to strangers and to the lawyers who made the circuit of the courts and so the daily banner referred to him in print to be the son of was his doom what ever he should accomplish would have to be sacrificed upon the altar of this magnificent but fatal parental precedence the peculiarity and the saddest thing about billy s ambition was that the only world he thirsted to conquer was elmville his nature was diffident and unassuming national or state honours might have oppressed him but above all things he hungered for the appreciation of the friends among whom he had been born and raised he would not have plucked one leaf from the garlands that were so lavishly bestowed upon his father he merely rebelled against having his own wreathes woven from those dried and self same branches but elmville billied and sonned him to his concealed but lasting chagrin until at length he grew more reserved and formal and studious than ever there came a morning when billy found among his mail a letter from a very high source tendering him the appointment to an important judicial position in the new island possessions of our country the honour was a distinguished one for the entire nation had discussed the probable recipients of these positions and had agreed that the situation demanded only men of the highest character ripe learning and evenly balanced mind billy could not subdue a certain exultation at this token of the success of his long and arduous labours but at the same time a whimsical smile lingered around his mouth for he foresaw in which column elmville would place the credit we congratulate governor pemberton upon the mark of appreciation conferred upon his son elmville rejoices with our honoured citizen governor pemberton at his son s success put her there billy judge billy pemberton sir son of our state s war hero and the people s pride these were the phrases printed and oral conjured up by billy s prophetic fancy grandson of his state and stepchild to elmville thus had fate fixed his kinship to the body politic billy lived with his father in the old mansion the two and an elderly lady a distant relative comprised the family perhaps though old jeff the governor s ancient coloured body servant should be included without doubt he could have claimed the honour there were other servants but thomas jefferson pemberton sah was a member of de fambly jeff was the one elmvillian who gave to billy the gold of approval unmixed with the alloy of paternalism to him mars william was the greatest man in talbot county beaten upon though he was by the shining light that emanates from an ex war governor and loyal as he remained to the old regime his faith and admiration were billy s as valet to a hero and a member of the family he may have had superior opportunities for judging jeff was the first one to whom bill revealed the news when he reached home for supper jeff took his plug hat and smoothed it before hanging it upon the hall rack dar now said the old man i knowed it was er comin i knowed it was gwine ter happen er judge you says mars william dem yankees done made you er judge it s high time sah dey was doin somep n to make up for dey rascality endurin de war i boun dey holds a confab and says le s make mars william pemberton er judge and dat ll settle it does you have to go way down to dem fillypines mars william or kin you judge em from here i d have to live there most of the time of course said billy i wonder what de gubnor gwine say bout dat speculated jeff billy wondered too after supper when the two sat in the library according to their habit the governor smoking his clay pipe and billy his cigar the son dutifully confessed to having been tendered the appointment for a long time the governor sat smoking without making any comment billy reclined in his favourite rocker waiting perhaps still flushed with satisfaction over the tender that had come to him unsolicited in his dingy little office above the heads of the intriguing time serving clamorous multitude at last the governor spoke and though his words were seemingly irrelevant they were to the point his voice had a note of martyrdom running through its senile quaver my rheumatism has been growing steadily worse these past months william i am sorry father said billy gently and i am nearly seventy eight i am getting to be an old man i can recall the names of but two or three who were in public life during my administration what did you say is the nature of this position that is offered you william a federal judgeship father i believe it is considered to be a somewhat flattering tender it is outside of politics and wire pulling you know no doubt no doubt few of the pembertons have engaged in professional life for nearly a century none of them have ever held federal positions they have been land holders slave owners and planters on a large scale one of two of the derwents your mother s family were in the law have you decided to accept this appointment william i am thinking it over said billy slowly regarding the ash of his cigar you have been a good son to me continued the governor stirring his pipe with the handle of a penholder i ve been your son all my life said billy darkly i am often gratified piped the governor betraying a touch of complacency by being congratulated upon having a son with such sound and sterling qualities especially in this our native town is your name linked with mine in the talk of our citizens i never knew anyone to forget the vindculum murmured billy unintelligibly whatever prestige pursued the parent i may be possessed of by virtue of my name and services to the state has been yours to draw upon freely i have not hesitated to exert it in your behalf whenever opportunity offered and you have deserved it william you ve been the best of sons and now this appointment comes to take you away from me i have but a few years left to live i am almost dependent upon others now even in walking and dressing what would i do without you my son the governor s pipe dropped to the floor a tear trickled from his eye his voice had risen and crumbled to a weakling falsetto and ceased he was an old old man about to be bereft of a son that cherished him billy rose and laid his hand upon the governor s shoulder don t worry father he said cheerfully i m not going to accept elmville is good enough for me i ll write to night and decline it at the next interchange of devoirs between the governor and general deffenbaugh on lee avenue his excellency with a comfortable air of self satisfaction spoke of the appointment that had been tendered to billy the general whistled that s a plum for billy he shouted who d have thought that billy but confound it it s been in him all the time it s a boost for elmville it ll send real estate up it s an honour to our state it s a compliment to the south we ve all been blind about billy when does he leave we must have a reception great gatlings that job s eight thousand a year there s been a car load of lead pencils worn to stubs figuring on those appointments think of it our little wood sawing mealy mouthed billy angel unawares doesn t begin to express it elmville is disgraced forever until she lines up in a hurry for ratification and apology the venerable moloch smiled fatuously he carried the fire with which to consume all these tributes to billy the smoke of which would ascend as an incense to himself william said the governor with modest pride has declined the appointment he refuses to leave me in my old age he is a good son the general swung round and laid a large forefinger upon the bosom of his friend much of the general s success had been due to his dexterity in establishing swift lines of communication between cause and effect governor he said with a keen look in his big ox like eyes you ve been complaining to billy about your rheumatism my dear general replied the governor stiffly my son is forty two he is quite capable of deciding such questions for himself and i as his parent feel it my duty to state that your remark about er rheumatism is a mighty poor shot from a very small bore sir aimed at a purely personal and private affliction if you will allow me retorted the general you ve afflicted the public with it for some time and twas no small bore at that this first tiff between the two old comrades might have grown into something more serious but for the fortunate interruption caused by the ostentatious approach of colonel titus and another one of the court retinue from the right county to whom the general confided the coddled statesman and went his way after billy had so effectually entombed his ambitions and taken the veil so to speak in a sonnery he was surprised to discover how much lighter of heart and happier he felt he realized what a long restless struggle he had maintained and how much he had lost by failing to cull the simple but wholesome pleasures by the way his heart warmed now to elmville and the friends who had refused to set him upon a pedestal it was better he began to think to be billy and his father s son and to be hailed familiarly by cheery neighbours and grown up playmates than to be your honour and sit among strangers hearing maybe through the arguments of learned counsel that old man s feeble voice crying what would i do without you my son billy began to surprise his acquaintances by whistling as he walked up the street others he astounded by slapping them disrespectfully upon their backs and raking up old anecdotes he had not had the time to recollect for years though he hammered away at his law cases as thoroughly as ever he found more time for relaxation and the company of his friends some of the younger set were actually after him to join the golf club a striking proof of his abandonment to obscurity was his adoption of a most undignified rakish little soft hat reserving the plug for sundays and state occasions billy was beginning to enjoy elmville though that irreverent burgh had neglected to crown him with bay and myrtle all the while uneventful peace pervaded elmville the governor continued to make his triumphal parades to the post office with the general as chief marshal for the slight squall that had rippled their friendship had to all indications been forgotten by both but one day elmville woke to sudden excitement the news had come that a touring presidential party would honour elmville by a twenty minute stop the executive had promised a five minute address from the balcony of the palace hotel elmville rose as one man that man being of course general deffenbaugh to receive becomingly the chieftain of all the clans the train with the tiny stars and stripes fluttering from the engine pilot arrived elmville had done her best there were bands flowers carriages uniforms banners and committees without end high school girls in white frocks impeded the steps of the party with roses strewn nervously in bunches the chieftain had seen it all before scores of times he could have pictured it exactly in advance from the blue and gray speech down to the smallest rosebud yet his kindly smile of interest greeted elmville s display as if it had been the only and original in the upper rotunda of the palace hotel the town s most illustrious were assembled for the honour of being presented to the distinguished guests previous to the expected address outside elmville s inglorious but patriotic masses filled the streets here in the hotel general deffenbaugh was holding in reserve elmville s trump card elmville knew for the trump was a fixed one and its lead consecrated by archaic custom at the proper moment governor pemberton beautifully venerable magnificently antique tall paramount stepped forward upon the arm of the general elmville watched and harked with bated breath never until now when a northern president of the united states should clasp hands with ex war governor pemberton would the breach be entirely closed would the country be made one and indivisible no north not much south very little east and no west to speak of so elmville excitedly scraped kalsomine from the walls of the palace hotel with its sunday best and waited for the voice to speak and billy we had nearly forgotten billy he was cast for son and he waited patiently for his cue he carried his plug in his hand and felt serene he admired his father s striking air and pose after all it was a great deal to be a son of a man who could so gallantly hold the position of a cynosure for three generations general deffenbaugh cleared his throat elmville opened its mouth and squirmed the chieftain with the kindly fateful face was holding out his hand smiling ex war governor pemberton extended his own across the chasm but what was this the general was saying mr president allow me to present to you one who has the honour to be the father of our foremost distinguished citizen learned and honoured jurist beloved townsman and model southern gentleman the honourable william b pemberton the enchanted kiss but a clerk in the cut rate drug store was samuel tansey yet his slender frame was a pad that enfolded the passion of romeo the gloom of laura the romance of d artagnan and the desperate inspiration of melnotte pity then that he had been denied expression that he was doomed to the burden of utter timidity and diffidence that fate had set him tongue tied and scarlet before the muslin clad angels whom he adored and vainly longed to rescue clasp comfort and subdue the clock s hands were pointing close upon the hour of ten while tansey was playing billiards with a number of his friends on alternate evenings he was released from duty at the store after seven o clock even among his fellow men tansey was timorous and constrained in his imagination he had done valiant deeds and performed acts of distinguished gallantry but in fact he was a sallow youth of twenty three with an over modest demeanour and scant vocabulary when the clock struck ten tansey hastily laid down his cue and struck sharply upon the show case with a coin for the attendant to come and receive the pay for his score what s your hurry tansey called one got another engagement tansey got an engagement echoed another not on your life tansey s got to get home at motten by her peek s orders it s no such thing chimed in a pale youth taking a large cigar from his mouth tansey s afraid to be late because miss katie might come down stairs to unlock the door and kiss him in the hall this last delicate piece of raillery sent a fiery tingle into tansey s blood for the indictment was true barring the kiss that was a thing to dream of to wildly hope for but too remote and sacred a thing to think of lightly casting a cold and contemptuous look at the speaker a punishment commensurate with his own diffident spirit tansey left the room descending the stairs into the street for two years he had silently adored miss peek worshipping her from a spiritual distance through which her attractions took on stellar brightness and mystery mrs peek kept a few choice boarders among whom was tansey the other young men romped with katie chased her with crickets in their fingers and jollied her with an irreverent freedom that turned tansey s heart into cold lead in his bosom the signs of his adoration were few a tremulous good morning stealthy glances at her during meals and occasionally oh rapture a blushing delirious game of cribbage with her in the parlour on some rare evening when a miraculous lack of engagement kept her at home kiss him in the hall aye he feared it but it was an ecstatic fear such as elijah must have felt when the chariot lifted him into the unknown but to night the gibes of his associates had stung him to a feeling of forward lawless mutiny a defiant challenging atavistic recklessness spirit of corsair adventurer lover poet bohemian possessed him the stars he saw above him seemed no more unattainable no less high than the favour of miss peek or the fearsome sweetness of her delectable lips his fate seemed to him strangely dramatic and pathetic and to call for a solace consonant with its extremity a saloon was near by and to this he flitted calling for absinthe beyond doubt the drink most adequate to his mood the tipple of the roue the abandoned the vainly sighing lover once he drank of it and again and then again until he felt a strange exalted sense of non participation in worldly affairs pervade him tansey was no drinker his consumption of three absinthe anisettes within almost as few minutes proclaimed his unproficiency in the art tansey was merely flooding with unproven liquor his sorrows which record and tradition alleged to be drownable coming out upon the sidewalk he snapped his fingers defiantly in the direction of the peek homestead turned the other way and voyaged columbus like into the wilds of an enchanted street nor is the figure exorbitant for beyond his store the foot of tansey had scarcely been set for years store and boarding house between these ports he was charted to run and contrary currents had rarely deflected his prow tansey aimlessly protracted his walk and whether it was his unfamiliarity with the district his recent accession of audacious errantry or the sophistical whisper of a certain green eyed fairy he came at last to tread a shuttered blank and echoing thoroughfare dark and unpeopled and suddenly this way came to an end as many streets do in the spanish built archaic town of san antone butting its head against an imminent high brick wall no the street still lived to the right and to the left it breathed through slender tubes of exit narrow somnolent ravines cobble paved and unlighted accommodating a rise in the street to the right was reared a phantom flight of five luminous steps of limestone flanked by a wall of the same height and of the same material upon one of these steps tansey seated himself and bethought him of his love and how she might never know she was his love and of mother peek fat vigilant and kind not unpleased tansey thought that he and katie should play cribbage in the parlour together for the cut rate had not cut his salary which sordidly speaking ranked him star boarder at the peek s and he thought of captain peek katie s father a man he dreaded and abhorred a genteel loafer and spendthrift battening upon the labour of his women folk a very queer fish and according to repute not of the freshest the night had turned chill and foggy the heart of the town with its noises was left behind reflected from the high vapours its distant lights were manifest in quivering cone shaped streamers in questionable blushes of unnamed colours in unstable ghostly waves of far electric flashes now that the darkness was become more friendly the wall against which the street splintered developed a stone coping topped with an armature of spikes beyond it loomed what appeared to be the acute angles of mountain peaks pierced here and there by little lambent parallelograms considering this vista tansey at length persuaded himself that the seeming mountains were in fact the convent of santa mercedes with which ancient and bulky pile he was better familiar from different coigns of view a pleasant note of singing in his ears reinforced his opinion high sweet holy carolling far and harmonious and uprising as of sanctified nuns at their responses at what hour did the sisters sing he tried to think was it six eight twelve tansey leaned his back against the limestone wall and wondered strange things followed the air was full of white fluttering pigeons that circled about and settled upon the convent wall the wall blossomed with a quantity of shining green eyes that blinked and peered at him from the solid masonry a pink classic nymph came from an excavation in the cavernous road and danced barefoot and airy upon the ragged flints the sky was traversed by a company of beribboned cats marching in stupendous aerial procession the noise of singing grew louder an illumination of unseasonable fireflies danced past and strange whispers came out of the dark without meaning or excuse without amazement tansey took note of these phenomena he was on some new plane of understanding though his mind seemed to him clear and indeed happily tranquil a desire for movement and exploration seized him he rose and turned into the black gash of street to his right for a time the high wall formed one of its boundaries but further on two rows of black windowed houses closed it in here was the city s quarter once given over to the spaniard here were still his forbidding abodes of concrete and adobe standing cold and indomitable against the century from the murky fissure the eye saw flung against the sky the tangled filigree of his moorish balconies through stone archways breaths of dead vault chilled air coughed upon him his feet struck jingling iron rings in staples stone buried for half a cycle along these paltry avenues had swaggered the arrogant don had caracoled and serenaded and blustered while the tomahawk and the pioneer s rifle were already uplifted to expel him from a continent and tansey stumbling through this old world dust looked up dark as it was and saw andalusian beauties glimmering on the balconies some of them were laughing and listening to the goblin music that still followed others harked fearfully through the night trying to catch the hoof beats of caballeros whose last echoes from those stones had died away a century ago those women were silent but tansey heard the jangle of horseless bridle bits the whirr of riderless rowels and now and then a muttered malediction in a foreign tongue but he was not frightened shadows nor shadows of sounds could daunt him afraid no afraid of mother peek afraid to face the girl of his heart afraid of tipsy captain peek nay nor of these apparitions nor of that spectral singing that always pursued him singing he would show them he lifted up a strong and untuneful voice when you hear them bells go tingalingling serving notice upon those mysterious agencies that if it should come to a face to face encounter there ll be a hot time in the old town to night how long tansey consumed in treading this haunted byway was not clear to him but in time he emerged into a more commodious avenue when within a few yards of the corner he perceived through a window that a small confectionary of mean appearance was set in the angle his same glance that estimated its meagre equipment its cheap soda water fountain and stock of tobacco and sweets took cognizance of captain peek within lighting a cigar at a swinging gaslight as tansey rounded the corner captain peek came out and they met vis a vis an exultant joy filled tansey when he found himself sustaining the encounter with implicit courage peek indeed he raised his hand and snapped his fingers loudly it was peek himself who quailed guiltily before the valiant mien of the drug clerk sharp surprise and a palpable fear bourgeoned upon the captain s face and verily that face was one to rather call up such expressions on the faces of others the face of a libidinous heathen idol small eyed with carven folds in the heavy jowls and a consuming pagan license in its expression in the gutter just beyond the store tansey saw a closed carriage standing with its back toward him and a motionless driver perched in his place why it s tansey exclaimed captain peek how are you tansey h have a cigar tansey why it s peek cried tansey jubilant at his own temerity what deviltry are you up to now peek back streets and a closed carriage fie peek there s no one in the carriage said the captain smoothly everybody out of it is in luck continued tansey aggressively i d love for you to know peek that i m not stuck on you you re a bottle nosed scoundrel why the little rat s drunk cried the captain joyfully only drunk and i thought he was on go home tansey and quit bothering grown persons on the street but just then a white clad figure sprang out of the carriage and a shrill voice katie s voice sliced the air sam sam help me sam tansey sprung toward her but captain peek interposed his bulky form wonder of wonders the whilom spiritless youth struck out with his right and the hulking captain went over in a swearing heap tansey flew to katie and took her in his arms like a conquering knight she raised her face and he kissed her violets electricity caramels champagne here was the attainment of a dream that brought no disenchantment oh sam cried katie when she could i knew you would come to rescue me what do you suppose the mean things were going to do with me have your picture taken said tansey wondering at the foolishness of his remark no they were going to eat me i heard them talking about it eat you said tansey after pondering a moment that can t be there s no plates but a sudden noise warned him to turn down upon him were bearing the captain and a monstrous long bearded dwarf in a spangled cloak and red trunk hose the dwarf leaped twenty feet and clutched them the captain seized katie and hurled her shrieking back into the carriage himself followed and the vehicle dashed away the dwarf lifted tansey high above his head and ran with him into the store holding him with one hand he raised the lid of an enormous chest half filled with cakes of ice flung tansey inside and closed down the cover the force of the fall must have been great for tansey lost consciousness when his faculties revived his first sensation was one of severe cold along his back and limbs opening his eyes he found himself to be seated upon the limestone steps still facing the wall and convent of santa mercedes his first thought was of the ecstatic kiss from katie the outrageous villainy of captain peek the unnatural mystery of the situation his preposterous conflict with the improbable dwarf these things roused and angered him but left no impression of the unreal i ll go back there to morrow he grumbled aloud and knock the head off that comic opera squab running out and picking up perfect strangers and shoving them into cold storage but the kiss remained uppermost in his mind i might have done that long ago he mused she liked it too she called me sam four times i ll not go up that street again too much scrapping guess i ll move down the other way wonder what she meant by saying they were going to eat her tansey began to feel sleepy but after a while he decided to move along again this time he ventured into the street to his left it ran level for a distance and then dipped gently downward opening into a vast dim barren space the old military plaza to his left some hundred yards distant he saw a cluster of flickering lights along the plaza s border he knew the locality at once huddled within narrow confines were the remnants of the once famous purveyors of the celebrated mexican national cookery a few years before their nightly encampments upon the historic alamo plaza in the heart of the city had been a carnival a saturnalia that was renowned throughout the land then the caterers numbered hundreds the patrons thousands drawn by the coquettish senoritas the music of the weird spanish minstrels and the strange piquant mexican dishes served at a hundred competing tables crowds thronged the alamo plaza all night travellers rancheros family parties gay gasconading rounders sightseers

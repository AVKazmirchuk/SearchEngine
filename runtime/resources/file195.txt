a white sport all right the young lady unfolded the letter somewhat doubtfully and read it dear dr arnold i want to thank you for your most kind and opportune aid to my daughter last friday evening when she was overcome by an attack of her old heart trouble in the conservatory at mrs waldron s reception had you not been near to catch her as she fell and to render proper attention we might have lost her i would be glad if you would call and undertake the treatment of her case gratefully yours robert ashburton the young lady refolded the letter and handed it to the boy de gent wants an answer said the messenger wot s de word the lady s eyes suddenly flashed on him bright smiling and wet tell that guy on the other bench she said with a happy tremulous laugh that his girl wants him the furnished room restless shifting fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of the population of the red brick district of the lower west side homeless they have a hundred homes they flit from furnished room to furnished room transients forever transients in abode transients in heart and mind they sing home sweet home in ragtime they carry their lares et penates in a bandbox their vine is entwined about a picture hat a rubber plant is their fig tree hence the houses of this district having had a thousand dwellers should have a thousand tales to tell mostly dull ones no doubt but it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the wake of all these vagrant guests one evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red mansions ringing their bells at the twelfth he rested his lean hand baggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and forehead the bell sounded faint and far away in some remote hollow depths to the door of this the twelfth house whose bell he had rung came a housekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome surfeited worm that had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy with edible lodgers he asked if there was a room to let come in said the housekeeper her voice came from her throat her throat seemed lined with fur i have the third floor back vacant since a week back should you wish to look at it the young man followed her up the stairs a faint light from no particular source mitigated the shadows of the halls they trod noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn it seemed to have become vegetable to have degenerated in that rank sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to the staircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter at each turn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall perhaps plants had once been set within them if so they had died in that foul and tainted air it may be that statues of the saints had stood there but it was not difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them forth in the darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished pit below this is the room said the housekeeper from her furry throat it s a nice room it ain t often vacant i had some most elegant people in it last summer no trouble at all and paid in advance to the minute the water s at the end of the hall sprowls and mooney kept it three months they done a vaudeville sketch miss b retta sprowls you may have heard of her oh that was just the stage names right there over the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung framed the gas is here and you see there is plenty of closet room it s a room everybody likes it never stays idle long do you have many theatrical people rooming here asked the young man they comes and goes a good proportion of my lodgers is connected with the theatres yes sir this is the theatrical district actor people never stays long anywhere i get my share yes they comes and they goes he engaged the room paying for a week in advance he was tired he said and would take possession at once he counted out the money the room had been made ready she said even to towels and water as the housekeeper moved away he put for the thousandth time the question that he carried at the end of his tongue a young girl miss vashner miss eloise vashner do you remember such a one among your lodgers she would be singing on the stage most likely a fair girl of medium height and slender with reddish gold hair and a dark mole near her left eyebrow no i don t remember the name them stage people has names they change as often as their rooms they comes and they goes no i don t call that one to mind no always no five months of ceaseless interrogation and the inevitable negative so much time spent by day in questioning managers agents schools and choruses by night among the audiences of theatres from all star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find what he most hoped for he who had loved her best had tried to find her he was sure that since her disappearance from home this great water girt city held her somewhere but it was like a monstrous quicksand shifting its particles constantly with no foundation its upper granules of to day buried to morrow in ooze and slime the furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of pseudo hospitality a hectic haggard perfunctory welcome like the specious smile of a demirep the sophistical

supper and load the shot gun and wait if he comes in my back yard he ll go away in a ambulance instead of a bridal chaise with rosy held in the clutches of morpheus for a many hours deep slumber and the bloodthirsty parent waiting armed and forewarned ikey felt that his rival was close indeed upon discomfiture all night in the blue light drug store he waited at his duties for chance news of the tragedy but none came at eight o clock in the morning the day clerk arrived and ikey started hurriedly for mrs riddle s to learn the outcome and lo as he stepped out of the store who but chunk mcgowan sprang from a passing street car and grasped his hand chunk mcgowan with a victor s smile and flushed with joy pulled it off said chunk with elysium in his grin rosy bit the fire escape on time to a second and we was under the wire at the reverend s at o she s up at the flat she cooked eggs this mornin in a blue kimono lord how lucky i am you must pace up some day ikey and feed with us i ve got a

last night at riddle s and i looked at rosy and i says to myself chunk if you get the girl get her on the square don t try any hocus pocus with a thoroughbred like her and i keeps the paper you give me in my pocket and then my lamps fall on another party present who i says to myself is failin in a proper affection toward his comin son in law so i watches my chance and dumps that powder in old man riddle s coffee see mammon and the archer old anthony rockwall retired manufacturer and proprietor of rockwall s eureka soap looked out the library window of his fifth avenue mansion and grinned his neighbour to the right the aristocratic clubman g van schuylight suffolk jones came out to his waiting motor car wrinkling a contumelious nostril as usual at the italian renaissance sculpture of the soap palace s front elevation stuck up old statuette of nothing doing commented the ex soap king the eden musee ll get that old frozen nesselrode yet if he don t watch out i ll have this house painted red white and blue next summer and see if that ll make his dutch nose turn up any higher and then anthony rockwall who never cared for bells went to the door of his library and shouted mike in the same voice that had once chipped off pieces of the welkin on the kansas prairies tell my son said anthony to the answering menial to come in here before he leaves the house when young rockwall entered the library the old man laid aside his newspaper looked at him with a kindly grimness on his big smooth ruddy countenance rumpled his mop of white hair with one hand and rattled the keys in his pocket with the other richard said anthony rockwail what do you pay for the soap that you use richard only six months home from college was startled a little he had not yet taken the measure of this sire of his who was as full of unexpectednesses as a girl at her first party six dollars a dozen i think dad and your clothes i suppose about sixty dollars as a rule you re a gentleman said anthony decidedly i ve heard of these young bloods spending a dozen for soap and going over the hundred mark for clothes you ve got as much money to waste as any of em and yet you stick to what s decent and moderate now i use the old eureka not only for sentiment but it s the purest soap made whenever you pay more than cents a cake for soap you buy bad perfumes and labels but cents is doing very well for a young man in your generation position and condition as i said you re a gentleman they say it takes three generations to make one they re off money ll do it as slick as soap grease it s made you one by hokey it s almost made one of me i m nearly as impolite and disagreeable and ill mannered as these two old knickerbocker gents on each side of me that can t sleep of nights because i bought in between em there are some things that money can t accomplish remarked young rockwall rather gloomily now don t say that said old anthony shocked i bet my money on money every time i ve been through the encyclopaedia down to y looking for something you can t buy with it and i expect to have to take up the appendix next week i m for money against the field tell me something money won t buy for one thing answered richard rankling a little it won t buy one into the exclusive circles of society oho won t it thundered the champion of the root of evil you tell me where your exclusive circles would be if the first astor hadn t had the money to pay for his steerage

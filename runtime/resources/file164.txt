breath for fresh eloquence i seized my advantage you have classified him i cried with joy you have painted his portrait in the gallery of city types but i must meet one face to face i must study the man about town at first hand where shall i find him how shall i know him without seeming to hear me the critic went on and his cab driver was waiting for his fare too he is the sublimated essence of butt in the refined intrinsic extract of rubber the concentrated purified irrefutable unavoidable spirit of curiosity and inquisitiveness a new sensation is the breath in his nostrils when his experience is exhausted he explores new fields with the indefatigability of a excuse me i interrupted but can you produce one of this type it is a new thing to me i must study it i will search the town over until i find one its habitat must be here on broadway i am about to dine here said my friend come inside and if there is a man about town present i will point him out to you i know most of the regular patrons here i am not dining yet i said to him you will excuse me i am going to find my man about town this night if i have to rake new york from the battery to little coney island i left the hotel and walked down broadway the pursuit of my type gave a pleasant savour of life and interest to the air i breathed i was glad to be in a city so great so complex and diversified leisurely and with something of an air i strolled along with my heart expanding at the thought that i was a citizen of great gotham a sharer in its magnificence and pleasures a partaker in its glory and prestige i turned to cross the street i heard something buzz like a bee and then i took a long pleasant ride with santos dumont when i opened my eyes i remembered a smell of gasoline and i said aloud hasn t it passed yet a hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow that was not at all fevered a young doctor came along grinned and handed me a morning newspaper want to see how it happened he asked cheerily i read the article its headlines began where i heard the buzzing leave off the night before it closed with these lines bellevue hospital where it was said that his injuries were not serious he appeared to be a typica man about town the cop and the anthem on his bench in madison square soapy moved uneasily when wild geese honk high of nights and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands and when soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park you may know that winter is near at hand a dead leaf fell in soapy s lap that was jack frost s card jack is kind to the regular denizens of madison square and gives fair warning of his annual call at the corners of four streets he hands his pasteboard to the north wind footman of the mansion of all outdoors so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready soapy s mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him to resolve himself into a singular committee of ways and means to provide against the coming rigour and therefore he moved uneasily on his bench the hibernatorial ambitions of soapy were not of the highest in them there were no considerations of mediterranean cruises of soporific southern skies drifting in the vesuvian bay three months on the island was what his soul craved three months of assured board and bed and congenial company safe from boreas and bluecoats seemed to soapy the essence of things desirable for years the hospitable blackwell s had been his winter quarters just as his more fortunate fellow new yorkers had bought their tickets to palm beach and the riviera each winter so soapy had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the island and now the time was come on the previous night three sabbath newspapers distributed beneath his coat about his ankles and over his lap had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square so the island loomed big and timely in soapy s mind he scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the city s dependents in soapy s opinion the law was more benign than philanthropy there was an endless round of institutions municipal and eleemosynary on which he might set out and receive lodging and food accordant with the simple life but to one of soapy s proud spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered if not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy as caesar had his brutus every bed of charity must have its toll of a bath every loaf of bread its compensation of a private and personal inquisition wherefore it is better to be a guest of the law which though conducted by rules does not meddle unduly with a gentleman s private affairs soapy having decided to go to the island at once set about accomplishing his desire there were many easy ways of doing this the pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive restaurant and then after declaring insolvency be handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman an accommodating magistrate would do the rest soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of asphalt where broadway and fifth avenue flow together up broadway he turned and halted at a glittering cafe where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the grape the silkworm and the protoplasm

all shirt front danced backward before her and next she was seated at a little table by a railing over which climbed a jessamine vine there seemed to be a wordless invitation to purchase she consulted a collection of small coins in a thin purse and received from them license to order a glass of beer there she sat inhaling and absorbing it all the new coloured new shaped life in a fairy palace in an enchanted wood at fifty tables sat princes and queens clad in all the silks and gems of the world and now and then one of them would look curiously at jerry s fare they saw a plain figure dressed in a pink silk of the kind that is tempered by the word foulard and a plain face that wore a look of love of life that the queens envied twice the long hands of the clocks went round royalties thinned from their al fresco thrones and buzzed or clattered away in their vehicles of state the music retired into cases of wood and bags of leather and baize waiters removed cloths pointedly near the plain figure sitting almost alone jerry s fare rose and held out her numbered card simply is there anything coming on the ticket she asked a waiter told her it was her cab check and that she should give it to the man at the entrance this man took it and called the number only three hansoms stood in line the driver of one of them went and routed out jerry asleep in his cab he swore deeply climbed to the captain s bridge and steered his craft to the pier his fare entered and the cab whirled into the cool fastnesses of the park along the shortest homeward cuts at the gate a glimmer of reason in the form of sudden suspicion seized upon jerry s beclouded mind one or two things occurred to him he stopped his horse raised the trap and dropped his phonographic voice like a lead plummet through the aperture i want to see four dollars before goin any further on th thrip have ye got th dough four dollars laughed the fare softly dear me no i ve only got a few pennies and a dime or two jerry shut down the trap and slashed his oat fed horse the clatter of hoofs strangled but could not drown the sound of his profanity he shouted choking and gurgling curses at the starry heavens he cut viciously with his whip at passing vehicles he scattered fierce and ever changing oaths and imprecations along the streets so that a late truck driver crawling homeward heard and was abashed but he knew his recourse and made for it at a gallop at the house with the green lights beside the steps he pulled up he flung wide the cab doors and tumbled heavily to the ground come on you he said roughly his fare came forth with the casino dreamy smile still on her plain face jerry took her by the arm and led her into the police station a gray moustached sergeant looked keenly across the desk he and the cabby were no strangers sargeant began jerry in his old raucous martyred thunderous tones of complaint i ve got a fare here that jerry paused he drew a knotted red hand across his brow the fog set up by mcgary was beginning to clear away a fare sargeant he continued with a grin that i want to inthroduce to ye it s me wife that i married at ould man walsh s this avening and a divil of a time we had tis thrue shake hands wid th sargeant norah and we ll be off to home before stepping into the cab norah sighed profoundly i ve had such a nice time jerry said she an unfinished story we no longer groan and heap ashes upon our heads when the flames of tophet are mentioned for even the preachers have begun to tell us that god is radium or ether or some scientific compound and that the worst we wicked ones may expect is a chemical reaction this is a pleasing hypothesis but there lingers yet some of the old goodly terror of orthodoxy there are but two subjects upon which one may discourse with a free imagination and without the possibility of being controverted you may talk of your dreams and you may tell what you heard a parrot say both morpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses and your listener dare not attack your recital the baseless fabric of a vision then shall furnish my theme chosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more limited field of pretty polly s small talk i had a dream that was so far removed from the higher criticism that it had to do with the ancient respectable and lamented bar of judgment theory gabriel had played his trump and those of us who could not follow suit were arraigned for examination i noticed at one side a gathering of professional bondsmen in solemn black and collars that buttoned behind but it seemed there was some trouble about their real estate titles and they did not appear to be getting any of us out a fly cop an angel policeman flew over to me and took me by the left wing near at hand was a group of very prosperous looking spirits arraigned for judgment do you belong with that bunch the policeman asked who are they was my answer why said he they are but this irrelevant stuff is taking up space that the story should occupy dulcie worked in a department store she sold hamburg edging or stuffed peppers or automobiles or other little trinkets such as they keep in department stores of what she earned dulcie received six dollars per week the remainder was credited to her and debited to somebody else s account

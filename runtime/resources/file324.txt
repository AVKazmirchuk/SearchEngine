a faint dry point etching of alice the family owned a crumbly brick house and a coachman named joseph in a coat of many colours and a horse so old that he claimed to belong to the order of the perissodactyla and had toes instead of hoofs in the year the family had to buy a new set of harness for their perissodactyl before using it they made joseph smear it over with a mixture of ashes and soot it was the von der ruysling family that bought the territory between the bowery and east river and rivington street and the statue of liberty in the year from an indian chief for a quart of passementerie and a pair of turkey red portieres designed for a harlem flat i have always admired that indian s perspicacity and good taste all this is merely to convince you that the von der ruyslings were exactly the kind of poor aristocrats that turn down their noses at people who have money oh well i don t mean that i mean people who have just money one evening pilkins went down to the red brick house in gramercy square and made what he thought was a proposal to alice v d r alice with her nose turned down and thinking of his money considered it a proposition and refused it and him pilkins summoning all his resources as any good general would have done made an indiscreet references to the advantages that his money would provide that settled it the lady turned so cold that walter wellman himself would have waited until spring to make a dash for her in a dog sled but pilkins was something of a sport himself you can t fool all the millionaires every time the ball drops on the western union building if at any time he said to a v d r you feel that you would like to reconsider your answer send me a rose like that pilkins audaciously touched a jacque rose that she wore loosely in her hair very well said she and when i do you will understand by it that either you or i have learned something new about the purchasing power of money you ve been spoiled my friend no i don t think i could marry you to morrow i will send you back the presents you have given me presents said pilkins in surprise i never gave you a present in my life i would like to see a full length portrait of the man that you would take a present from why you never would let me send you flowers or candy or even art calendars you ve forgotten said alice v d r with a little smile it was a long time ago when our families were neighbours you were seven and i was trundling my doll on the sidewalk you have me a little gray hairy kitten with shoe buttony eyes its head came off and it was full of candy you paid five cents for it you told me so i haven t the candy to return to you i hadn t developed a conscience at three so i ate it but i have the kitten yet and i will wrap it up neatly to night and send it to you to morrow beneath the lightness of alice v d r s talk the steadfastness of her rejection showed firm and plain so there was nothing left for him but to leave the crumbly red brick house and be off with his abhorred millions on his way back pilkins walked through madison square the hour hand of the clock hung about eight the air was stingingly cool but not at the freezing point the dim little square seemed like a great cold unroofed room with its four walls of houses spangled with thousands of insufficient lights only a few loiterers were huddled here and there on the benches but suddenly pilkins came upon a youth sitting brave and as if conflicting with summer sultriness coatless his white shirt sleeves conspicuous in the light from the globe of an electric close to his side was a girl smiling dreamy happy around her shoulders was palpably the missing coat of the cold defying youth it appeared to be a modern panorama of the babes in the wood revised and brought up to date with the exception that the robins hadn t turned up yet with the protecting leaves with delight the money caliphs view a situation that they think is relievable while you wait pilkins sat on the bench one seat removed from the youth he glanced cautiously and saw as men do see and women oh never can that they were of the same order pilkins leaned over after a short time and spoke to the youth who answered smilingly and courteously from general topics the conversation concentrated to the bed rock of grim personalities but pilkins did it as delicately and heartily as any caliph could have done and when it came to the point the youth turned to him soft voiced and with his undiminished smile i don t want to seem unappreciative old man he said with a youth s somewhat too early spontaneity of address but you see i can t accept anything from a stranger i know you re all right and i m tremendously obliged but i couldn t think of borrowing from anybody you see i m marcus clayton the claytons of roanoke county virginia you know the young lady is miss eva bedford i reckon you ve heard of the bedfords she s seventeen and one of the bedfords of bedford county we ve eloped from home

justify the deed i had done my wife could advance no objections save a few mild ones based on the feminine inability to appreciate a good thing such as the little back room of peter hef no of heffelbower co s undertaking establishment in conclusion i will say that to day you will find no man in our town as well liked as jovial and full of merry sayings as i my jokes are again noised about and quoted once more i take pleasure in my wife s confidential chatter without a mercenary thought while guy and viola play at my feet distributing gems of childish humor without fear of the ghastly tormentor who used to dog their steps notebook in hand our business has prospered finely i keep the books and look after the shop while peter attends to outside matters he says that my levity and high spirits would simply turn any funeral into a regular irish wake the sparrows in madison square the young man in straitened circumstances who comes to new york city to enter literature has but one thing to do provided he has studied carefully his field in advance he must go straight to madison square write an article about the sparrows there and sell it to the sun for i cannot recall either a novel or a story dealing with the popular theme of the young writer from the provinces who comes to the metropolis to win fame and fortune with his pen in which the hero does not get his start that way it does seem strange that some author in casting about for startlingly original plots has not hit upon the idea of having his hero write about the bluebirds in union square and sell it to the herald but a search through the files of metropolitan fiction counts up overwhelmingly for the sparrows and the old garden square and the sun always writes the check of course it is easy to understand why this first city venture of the budding author is always successful he is primed by necessity to a superlative effort mid the iron and stone and marble of the roaring city he has found this spot of singing birds and green grass and trees every tender sentiment in his nature is baffling with the sweet pain of homesickness his genius is aroused as it never may be again the birds chirp the tree branches sway the noise of wheels is forgotten he writes with his soul in his pen and he sells it to the sun for i had read of this custom during many years before i came to new york when my friends were using their strongest arguments to dissuade me from coming i only smiled serenely they did not know of that sparrow graft i had up my sleeve when i arrived in new york and the car took me straight from the ferry up twenty third street to madison square i could hear that check rustling in my inside pocket i obtained lodging at an unhyphenated hostelry and the next morning i was on a bench in madison square almost by the time the sparrows were awake their melodious chirping the benignant spring foliage of the noble trees and the clean fragrant grass reminded me so potently of the old farm i had left that tears almost came into my eyes then all in a moment i felt my inspiration the brave piercing notes of those cheerful small birds formed a keynote to a wonderful light fanciful song of hope and joy and altruism like myself they were creatures with hearts pitched to the tune of woods and fields as i was so were they captives by circumstance in the discordant dull city yet with how much grace and glee they bore the restraint and then the early morning people began to pass through the square to their work sullen people with sidelong glances and glum faces hurrying hurrying hurrying and i got my theme cut out clear from the bird notes and wrought it into a lesson and a poem and a carnival dance and a lullaby and then translated it all into prose and began to write for two hours my pencil traveled over my pad with scarcely a rest then i went to the little room i had rented for two days and there i cut it to half and then mailed it white hot to the sun the next morning i was up by daylight and spent two cents of my capital for a paper if the word sparrow was in it i was unable to find it i took it up to my room and spread it out on the bed and went over it column by column something was wrong three hours afterward the postman brought me a large envelope containing my ms and a piece of inexpensive paper about inches by i suppose some of you have seen them upon which was written in violet ink with the sun s thanks i went over to the square and sat upon a bench no i did not think it necessary to eat any breakfast that morning the confounded pests of sparrows were making the square hideous with their idiotic cheep cheep i never saw birds so persistently noisy impudent and disagreeable in all my life by this time according to all traditions i should have been standing in the office of the editor of the sun that personage a tall grave white haired man would strike a silver bell as he grasped my hand and wiped a suspicious moisture from his glasses mr mcchesney he would be saying when a subordinate appeared this is mr henry the young man who sent in that exquisite gem about the sparrows in madison square you may give him a desk at once your salary sir will be a week to begin with this was what i had been led to

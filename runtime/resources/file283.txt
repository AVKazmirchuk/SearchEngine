his corporal s guard of cronies in the shade of his well whittled porch instead of in the matted jungles of mindanao always have his interest and choice been for deeds rather than for words but the consideration and digestion of motives is not beyond him as this story which is his will attest what is it he asked me one moonlit eve as we sat among his boxes and barrels that generally makes men go through dangers and fire and trouble and starvation and battle and such rucouses what does a man do it for why does he try to outdo his fellow humans and be braver and stronger and more daring and showy than even his best friends are what s his game what does he expect to get out of it he don t do it just for the fresh air and exercise what would you say now bill that an ordinary man expects

always on hand when a joyful occasion was had as the morning paper would say looking as happy as a king full and at the same time as uncomfortable as a raw oyster served with sweet pickles he danced like he had hind hobbles on and he had a vocabulary of about three hundred and fifty words that he made stretch over four germans a week and plagiarized from to get him through two ice cream suppers

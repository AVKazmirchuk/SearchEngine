mire of a corrupt st age mr hargraves had used his opportunities well he had caught the major s little idiosyncrasies of speech accent and intonation and his pompous courtliness to perfection exaggerating all to the purposes of the stage when he performed that marvellous bow that the major fondly imagined to be the pink of all salutations the audience sent forth a sudden round of hearty applause miss lydia sat immovable not daring to glance toward her father sometimes her hand next to him would be laid against her cheek as if to conceal the smile which in spite of her disapproval she could not entirely suppress the culmination of hargraves s audacious imitation took place in the third act the scene is where colonel calhoun entertains a few of the neighbouring planters in his den standing at a table in the centre of the stage with his friends grouped about him he delivers that inimitable rambling character monologue so famous in a magnolia flower at the same time that he deftly makes juleps for the party major talbot sitting quietly but white with indignation heard his best stories retold his pet theories and hobbies advanced and expanded and the dream of the anecdotes and reminiscences served exaggerated and garbled his favourite narrative that of his duel with rathbone culbertson was not omitted and it was delivered with more fire egotism and gusto than the major himself put into it the monologue concluded with a quaint delicious witty little lecture on the art of concocting a julep illustrated by the act here major talbot s delicate but showy science was reproduced to a hair s breadth from his dainty handling of the fragrant weed the one thousandth part of a grain too much pressure gentlemen and you extract the bitterness instead of the aroma of this heaven bestowed plant to his solicitous selection of the oaten straws at the close of the scene the audience raised a tumultuous roar of appreciation the portrayal of the type was so exact so sure and thorough that the leading characters in the play were forgotten after repeated calls hargraves came before the curtain and bowed his rather boyish face bright and flushed with the knowledge of success at last miss lydia turned and looked at the major his thin nostrils were working like the gills of a fish he laid both shaking hands upon the arms of his chair to rise we will go lydia he said chokingly this is an abominable desecration before he could rise she pulled him back into his seat we will stay it out she declared do you want to advertise the copy by exhibiting the original coat so they remained to the end hargraves s success must have kept him up late that night for neither at the breakfast nor at the dinner table did he appear about three in the afternoon he tapped at the door of major talbot s study the major opened it and hargraves walked in with his hands full of the morning papers too full of his triumph to notice anything unusual in the major s demeanour i put it all over em last night major he began exultantly i had my inning and i think scored here s what the post says his conception and portrayal of the old time southern colonel with his absurd grandiloquence his eccentric garb his quaint idioms and phrases his moth eaten pride of family and his really kind heart fastidious sense of honour and lovable simplicity is the best delineation of a character role on the boards to day the coat worn by colonel calhoun is itself nothing less than an evolution of genius mr hargraves has captured his public how does that sound major for a first nighter i had the honour the major s voice sounded ominously frigid of witnessing your very remarkable performance sir last night hargraves looked disconcerted you were there i didn t know you ever i didn t know you cared for the theatre oh i say major talbot he exclaimed frankly don t you be offended i admit i did get a lot of pointers from you that helped me out wonderfully in the part but it s a type you know not individual the way the audience caught on shows that half the patrons of that theatre are southerners they recognized it mr hargraves said the major who had remained standing you have put upon me an unpardonable insult you have burlesqued my person grossly betrayed my confidence and misused my hospitality if i thought you possessed the faintest conception of what is the sign manual of a gentleman or what is due one i would call you out sir old as i am i will ask you to leave the room sir the actor appeared to be slightly bewildered and seemed hardly to take in the full meaning of the old gentleman s words i am truly sorry you took offence he said regretfully up here we don t look at things just as you people do i know men who would buy out half the house to have their personality put on the stage so the public would recognize it they are not from alabama sir said the major haughtily perhaps not i have a pretty good memory major let me quote a few lines from your book in response to a toast at a banquet given in milledgeville i believe you uttered and intend to have printed these words the northern man is utterly without sentiment or warmth except in so far as the feelings may be turned to his own commercial profit he will suffer without resentment any imputation cast upon the honour of himself or his loved ones that does not bear with it the consequence of pecuniary loss in his charity he gives with a liberal hand but it must be heralded with the trumpet and chronicled in brass do

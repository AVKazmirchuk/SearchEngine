an intellectual line if it s only to knock somebody s brains out this henry ogden was a peculiar kind of ranchman he wore finger rings and a big gold watch and careful neckties and his face was calm and his nose spectacles was kept very shiny i saw once in muscogee an outlaw hung for murdering six men who was a dead ringer for him but i knew a preacher in arkansas that you would have taken to be his brother i didn t care much for him either way what i wanted was some fellowship and communion with holy saints or lost sinners anything sheepless would do well saint clair says he laying down the book he was reading i guess it must be pretty lonesome for you at first and i don t deny that it s monotonous for me are you sure you corralled your sheep so they won t stray out they re shut up as tight as the jury of a millionaire murderer says i and i ll be back with them long before they ll need their trained nurse so ogden digs up a deck of cards and we play casino after five days and nights of my sheep camp it was like a toot on broadway when i caught big casino i felt as excited as if i had made a million in trinity and when h o loosened up a little and told the story about the lady in the pullman car i laughed for five minutes that showed what a comparative thing life is a man may see so much that he d be bored to turn his head to look at a fire or joe weber or the adriatic sea but let him herd sheep for a spell and you ll see him splitting his ribs laughing at curfew shall not ring to night or really enjoying himself playing cards with ladies by and by ogden gets out a decanter of bourbon and then there is a total eclipse of sheep do you remember reading in the papers about a month ago says he about a train hold up on the m k t the express agent was shot through the shoulder and about in currency taken and it s said that only one man did the job seems to me i do says i but such things happen so often they don t linger long in the human texas mind did they overtake overhaul seize or lay hands upon the despoiler he escaped says ogden and i was just reading in a paper to day that the officers have tracked him down into this part of the country it seems the bills the robber got were all the first issue of currency to the second national bank of espinosa city and so they ve followed the trail where they ve been spent and it leads this way ogden pours out some more bourbon and shoves me the bottle i imagine says i after ingurgitating another modicum of the royal boose that it wouldn t be at all a disingenuous idea for a train robber to run down into this part of the country to hide for a spell a sheep ranch now says i would be the finest kind of a place who d ever expect to find such a desperate character among these song birds and muttons and wild flowers and by the way says i kind of looking h ogden over was there any description mentioned of this single handed terror was his lineaments or height and thickness or teeth fillings or style of habiliments set forth in print why no says ogden they say nobody got a good sight of him because he wore a mask but they know it was a train robber called black bill because he always works alone and because he dropped a handkerchief in the express car that had his name on it all right says i i approve of black bill s retreat to the sheep ranges i guess they won t find him there s one thousand dollars reward for his capture says ogden i don t need that kind of money says i looking mr sheepman straight in the eye the twelve dollars a month you pay me is enough i need a rest and i can save up until i get enough to pay my fare to texarkana where my widowed mother lives if black bill i goes on looking significantly at ogden was to have come down this way say a month ago and bought a little sheep ranch and stop says ogden getting out of his chair and looking pretty vicious do you mean to insinuate nothing says i no insinuations i m stating a hypodermical case i say if black bill had come down here and bought a sheep ranch and hired me to little boy blue em and treated me square and friendly as you ve done he d never have anything to fear from me a man is a man regardless of any complications he may have with sheep or railroad trains now you know where i stand ogden looks black as camp coffee for nine seconds and then he laughs amused you ll do saint clair says he if i was black bill i wouldn t be afraid to trust you let s have a game or two of seven up to night that is if you don t mind playing with a train robber i ve told you says i my oral sentiments and there s no strings to em while i was shuffling after the first hand i asks ogden as if the idea was a kind of a casualty where he was from oh says he from the mississippi valley that s a nice little place says i i ve often stopped over there but didn t you find the sheets a little damp and the food

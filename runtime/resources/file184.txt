working girls and paid em five or six dollars a week to live on are you one of the bunch not on your immortality said i i m only the fellow that set fire to an orphan asylum and murdered a blind man for his pennies the caliph cupid and the clock prince michael of the electorate of valleluna sat on his favourite bench in the park the coolness of the september night quickened the life in him like a rare tonic wine the benches were not filled for park loungers with their stagnant blood are prompt to detect and fly home from the crispness of early autumn the moon was just clearing the roofs of the range of dwellings that bounded the quadrangle on the east children laughed and played about the fine sprayed fountain in the shadowed spots fauns and hamadryads wooed unconscious of the gaze of mortal eyes a hand organ philomel by the grace of our stage carpenter fancy fluted and droned in a side street around the enchanted boundaries of the little park street cars spat and mewed and the stilted trains roared like tigers and lions prowling for a place to enter and above the trees shone the great round shining face of an illuminated clock in the tower of an antique public building prince michael s shoes were wrecked far beyond the skill of the carefullest cobbler the ragman would have declined any negotiations concerning his clothes the two weeks stubble on his face was grey and brown and red and greenish yellow as if it had been made up from individual contributions from the chorus of a musical comedy no man existed who had money enough to wear so bad a hat as his prince michael sat on his favourite bench and smiled it was a diverting thought to him that he was wealthy enough to buy every one of those close ranged bulky window lit mansions that faced him if he chose he could have matched gold equipages jewels art treasures estates and acres with any croesus in this proud city of manhattan and scarcely have entered upon the bulk of his holdings he could have sat at table with reigning sovereigns the social world the world of art the fellowship of the elect adulation imitation the homage of the fairest honours from the highest praise from the wisest flattery esteem credit pleasure fame all the honey of life was waiting in the comb in the hive of the world for prince michael of the electorate of valleluna whenever he might choose to take it but his choice was to sit in rags and dinginess on a bench in a park for he had tasted of the fruit of the tree of life and finding it bitter in his mouth had stepped out of eden for a time to seek distraction close to the unarmoured beating heart of the world these thoughts strayed dreamily through the mind of prince michael as he smiled under the stubble of his polychromatic beard lounging thus clad as the poorest of mendicants in the parks he loved to study humanity he found in altruism more pleasure than his riches his station and all the grosser sweets of life had given him it was his chief solace and satisfaction to alleviate individual distress to confer favours upon worthy ones who had need of succour to dazzle unfortunates by unexpected and bewildering gifts of truly royal magnificence bestowed however with wisdom and judiciousness and as prince michael s eye rested upon the glowing face of the great clock in the tower his smile altruistic as it was became slightly tinged with contempt big thoughts were the prince s and it was always with a shake of his head that he considered the subjugation of the world to the arbitrary measures of time the comings and goings of people in hurry and dread controlled by the little metal moving hands of a clock always made him sad by and by came a young man in evening clothes and sat upon the third bench from the prince for half an hour he smoked cigars with nervous haste and then he fell to watching the face of the illuminated clock above the trees his perturbation was evident and the prince noted in sorrow that its cause was connected in some manner with the slowly moving hands of the timepiece his highness arose and went to the young man s bench i beg your pardon for addressing you he said but i perceive that you are disturbed in mind if it may serve to mitigate the liberty i have taken i will add that i am prince michael heir to the throne of the electorate of valleluna i appear incognito of course as you may gather from my appearance it is a fancy of mine to render aid to others whom i think worthy of it perhaps the matter that seems to distress you is one that would more readily yield to our mutual efforts the young man looked up brightly at the prince brightly but the perpendicular line of perplexity between his brows was not smoothed away he laughed and even then it did not but he accepted the momentary diversion glad to meet you prince he said good humouredly yes i d say you were incog all right thanks for your offer of assistance but i don t see where your butting in would help things any it s a kind of private affair you know but thanks all the same prince michael sat at the young man s side he was often rebuffed but never offensively his courteous manner and words forbade that clocks said the prince are shackles on the feet of mankind i have observed you looking persistently at that clock its face is that of a tyrant its numbers are false as those on a lottery ticket its hands are those of a bunco steerer

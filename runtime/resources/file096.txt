of securing a passage by any outgoing vessel you may choose it is on my personal responsibility that i add congratulations to the gentleman in number upon his taste in feminine charms returning his cigar to his mouth goodwin observed her and saw that her eyes followed it and rested upon it with icy and significant concentration apparently she had not heard a word he had said he understood tossed the cigar out the window and with an amused laugh slid from the table to his feet that is better said the lady it makes it possible for me to listen to you for a second lesson in good manners you might now tell me by whom i am being insulted i am sorry said goodwin leaning one hand on the table that my time is too brief for devoting much of it to a course of etiquette come now i appeal to you good sense you have shown yourself in more than one instance to be well aware of what is to your advantage this is an occasion that demands the exercise of your undoubted intelligence there is no mystery here i am frank goodwin and i have come for the money i entered this room at a venture had i entered the other i would have had it before me now do you want it in words the gentleman in number has betrayed a great trust he has robbed his people of a large sum and it is i who will prevent their losing it i do not say who that gentleman is but if i should be forced to see him and he should prove to be a certain high official of the republic it will be my duty to arrest him the house is guarded i am offering you liberal terms it is not absolutely necessary that i confer personally with the gentleman in the next room bring me the valise containing the money and we will call the affair ended the lady arose from her chair and stood for a moment thinking deeply do you live here mr goodwin she asked presently yes what is your authority for this intrusion i am an instrument of the republic i was advised by wire of the movements of the gentleman in number may i ask you two or three questions i believe you to be a man more apt to be truthful than timid what sort of town is this coralio i think they call it not much of a town said goodwin smiling a banana town as they run grass huts dobes five or six two story houses accomodations limited population half breed spanish and indian caribs and blackamoors no sidewalks to speak of no amusements rather unmoral that a an offhand sketch of course are there any inducements say in a social or in a business way for people to reside here oh yes answered goodwin smiling broadly there are no afternoon teas no hand organs no department stores and there is no extradition treaty he told me went on the lady speaking as if to herself and with a slight frown that there were towns on this coast of beauty and importance that there was a pleasing social order especially an american colony of cultured residents there is an american colony said goodwin gazing at her in some wonder some of the members are all right some are fugitives from justice from the states i recall two exiled bank presidents one army paymaster under a cloud a couple of manslayers and a widow arsenic i believe was the suspicion in her case i myself complete the colony but as yet i have not distinguished myself by any particular crime do not lose hope said the lady dryly i see nothing in your actions tonight to guarantee you further obscurity some mistake has been made i do not know just where but him you shall not disturb tonight the journey has fatigued him so that he has fallen asleep i think in his clothes you talk of stolen money i do not understand you some mistake has been made i will convince you remain where you are and i will bring you the valise that you seem to covet so and show it to you she moved toward the closed door that connected the two rooms but stopped and half turned and bestowed upon goodwin a grave searching look that ended in a quizzical smile you force my door she said and you follow your ruffianly behavior with the basest accusations and yet she hesitated as if to reconsider what she was about to say and yet it is a puzzling thing i am sure there has been some mistake she took a step toward the door but goodwin stayed her by a light touch upon her arm i have said before that women turned to look at him in the streets he was the viking sort of man big good looking and with an air of kindly truculence she was dark and proud glowing or pale as her mood moved her i do not know if eve were light or dark but if such a woman had stood in the garden i know that the apple would have been eaten this woman was to be goodwin s fate and he did not know it but he must have felt the first throes of destiny for as he faced her the knowledge of what report named her turned bitter in her throat if there has been any mistake he said hotly it was yours i do not blame the man who has lost his country his honor and is about to lose the poor consolation of his stolen riches as much as i blame you for by heaven i can very well see how he was brought to it i can understand and pity him it is such women as you that strew this degraded

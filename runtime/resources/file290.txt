coal tar derivatives pernicious fever is a case for a simple mathematician instead of a doctor it is merely this formula vitality the desire to live the duration of the fever the result i took to my bed in the two roomed thatched hut where i had been comfortably established and sent for a gallon of rum that was not for myself drunk stamford was the best doctor between the andes and the pacific he came sat at my bedside and drank himself into condition my boy said he my lily white and reformed romeo medicine will do you no good but i will give you quinine which being bitter will arouse in you hatred and anger two stimulants that will add ten per cent to your chances you are as strong as a caribou calf and you will get well if the fever doesn t get in a knockout blow when you re off your guard for two weeks i lay on my back feeling like a hindoo widow on a burning ghat old atasca an untrained indian nurse sat near the door like a petrified statue of what s the use attending to her duties which were mainly to see that time went by without slipping a cog sometimes i would fancy myself back in the philippines or at worse times sliding off the horsehair sofa in sleepytown one afternoon i ordered atasca to vamose and got up and dressed carefully i took my temperature which i was pleased to find i paid almost dainty attention to my dress choosing solicitously a necktie of a dull and subdued hue the mirror showed that i was looking little the worse from my illness the fever gave brightness to my eyes and color to my face and while i looked at my reflection my color went and came again as i thought of chloe greene and the millions of eons that had passed since i d seen her and of louis devoe and the time he had gained on me i went straight to her house i seemed to float rather than walk i hardly felt the ground under my feet i thought pernicious fever must be a great boon to make one feel so strong i found chloe and louis devoe sitting under the awning in front of the house she jumped up and met me with a double handshake i m glad glad glad to see you out again she cried every word a pearl strung on the string of her sentence you are well tommy or better of course i wanted to come to see you but they wouldn t let me oh yes said i carelessly it was nothing merely a little fever i am out again as you see we three sat there and talked for half an hour or so then chloe looked out yearningly and almost piteously across the ocean i could see in her sea blue eyes some deep and intense desire devoe curse him saw it too what is it we asked in unison cocoanut pudding said chloe pathetically i ve wanted some oh so badly for two days it s got beyond a wish it s an obsession the cocoanut season is over said devoe in that voice of his that gave thrilling interest to his most commonplace words i hardly think one could be found in mojada the natives never use them except when they are green and the milk is fresh they sell all the ripe ones to the fruiterers wouldn t a broiled lobster or a welsh rabbit do as well i remarked with the engaging idiocy of a pernicious fever convalescent chloe came as near to pouting as a sweet disposition and a perfect profile would allow her to come the reverend homer poked his ermine lined face through the doorway and added a concordance to the conversation sometimes said he old campos keeps the dried nuts in his little store on the hill but it would be far better my daughter to restrain unusual desires and partake thankfully of the daily dishes that the lord has set before us stuff said i how was that asked the reverend homer sharply i say it s tough said i to drop into the vernacular that miss greene should be deprived of the food she desires a simple thing like kalsomine pudding perhaps i continued solicitously some pickled walnuts or a fricassee of hungarian butternuts would do as well every one looked at me with a slight exhibition of curiosity louis devoe arose and made his adieus i watched him until he had sauntered slowly and grandiosely to the corner around which he turned to reach his great warehouse and store chloe made her excuses and went inside for a few minutes to attend to some detail affecting the seven o clock dinner she was a passed mistress in housekeeping i had tasted her puddings and bread with beatitude when all had gone i turned casually and saw a basket made of plaited green withes hanging by a nail outside the door jamb with a rush that made my hot temples throb there came vividly to my mind recollections of the head hunters those grim flinty relentless little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed presence from time to time as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move him one creeps forth with his snickersnee and takes up the silent trail back he comes triumphant bearing the severed gory head of his victim his particular brown or white maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft tiger s eyes at the evidence of his love for her i stole softly from the house and returned to my hut from its supporting nails in the wall i took a machete as heavy as a butcher s cleaver and sharper than a safety razor and then i chuckled softly

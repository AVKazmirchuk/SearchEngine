of the dining room the planter vowed that the wanderer should wander no more that his was a goodness and an honesty that should be rewarded and that a debt of gratitude had been made that must be paid for had he not saved them from a doubtless imminent loss and maybe a greater calamity he assured whistling dick that he might consider himself a charge upon the honour of bellemeade that a position suited to his powers would be found for him at once and hinted that the way would be heartily smoothed for him to rise to as high places of emolument and trust as the plantation afforded but now they said he must be weary and the immediate thing to consider was rest and sleep so the mistress spoke to a servant and whistling dick was conducted to a room in the wing of the house occupied by the servants to this room in a few minutes was brought a portable tin bathtub filled with water which was placed on a piece of oiled cloth upon the floor there the vagrant was left to pass the night by the light of a candle he examined the room a bed with the covers neatly turned back revealed snowy pillows and sheets a worn but clean red carpet covered the floor there was a dresser with a beveled mirror a washstand with a flowered bowl and pitcher the two or three chairs were softly upholstered a little table held books papers and a day old cluster of roses in a jar there were towels on a rack and soap in a white dish whistling dick set his candle on a chair and placed his hat carefully under the table after satisfying what we must suppose to have been his curiosity by a sober scrutiny he removed his coat folded it and laid it upon the floor near the wall as far as possible from the unused bathtub taking his coat for a pillow he stretched himself luxuriously upon the carpet when on christmas morning the first streaks of dawn broke above the marshes whistling dick awoke and reached instinctively for his hat then he remembered that the skirts of fortune had swept him into their folds on the night previous and he went to the window and raised it to let the fresh breath of the morning cool his brow and fix the yet dream like memory of his good luck within his brain as he stood there certain dread and ominous sounds pierced the fearful hollow of his ear the force of plantation workers eager to complete the shortened task allotted to them were all astir the mighty din of the ogre labour shook the earth and the poor tattered and forever disguised prince in search of his fortune held tight to the window sill even in the enchanted castle and trembled already from the bosom of the mill came the thunder of rolling barrels of sugar and prison like sounds there was a great rattling of chains as the mules were harried with stimulant imprecations to their places by the waggon tongues a little vicious dummy engine with a train of flat cars in tow stewed and fumed on the plantation tap of the narrow gauge railroad and a toiling hurrying hallooing stream of workers were dimly seen in the half darkness loading the train with the weekly output of sugar here was a poem an epic nay a tragedy with work the curse of the world for its theme the december air was frosty but the sweat broke out upon whistling dick s face he thrust his head out of the window and looked down fifteen feet below him against the wall of the house he could make out that a border of flowers grew and by that token he overhung a bed of soft earth softly as a burglar goes he clambered out upon the sill lowered himself until he hung by his hands alone and then dropped safely no one seemed to be about upon this side of the house he dodged low and skimmed swiftly across the yard to the low fence it was an easy matter to vault this for a terror urged him such as lifts the gazelle over the thorn bush when the lion pursues a crash through the dew drenched weeds on the roadside a clutching slippery rush up the grassy side of the levee to the footpath at the summit and he was free the east was blushing and brightening the wind himself a vagrant rover saluted his brother upon the cheek some wild geese high above gave cry a rabbit skipped along the path before him free to turn to the right or to the left as his mood should send him the river slid past and certainly no one could tell the ultimate abiding place of its waters a small ruffled brown breasted bird sitting upon a dog wood sapling began a soft throaty tender little piping in praise of the dew which entices foolish worms from their holes but suddenly he stopped and sat with his head turned sidewise listening from the path along the levee there burst forth a jubilant stirring buoyant thrilling whistle loud and keen and clear as the cleanest notes of the piccolo the soaring sound rippled and trilled and arpeggioed as the songs of wild birds do not but it had a wild free grace that in a way reminded the small brown bird of something familiar but exactly what he could not tell there was in it the bird call or reveille that all birds know but a great waste of lavish unmeaning things that art had added and arranged besides and that were quite puzzling and strange and the little brown bird sat with his head on one side until the sound died away in the distance the little bird did not know that the part of that

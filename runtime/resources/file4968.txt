prat ing about springtime and flowers in the middle of winter when higgins comes back tell him to bring me a hot rum punch and now get out but who shall shame the bright face of may rogue though she be and disturber of sane men s peace no wise virgins cunning nor cold storage shall make her bow her head in the bright galaxy of months oh yes the story was not quite finished a night passed and higgins helped old man coulson in the morning to his chair by the window the cold of the room was gone heavenly odours and fragrant mild ness entered in hurried mrs widdup and stood by his chair mr coulson reached his bony hand and grasped her plump one mrs widdup he said this house would be no home without you i have half a million dollars if that and the true affection of a heart no lonoer in its youthful prime but still not cold could i found out what made it cold said mrs widdup leanin against his chair twas ice tons of it in the basement and in the furnace room everywhere i shut off the registers that it was coming through into your room mr coulson poor soul and now it s maytime again a true heart went on old man coulson a little wanderingly that the springtime has brought to life again and but what will my daughter say mrs widdup never fear sir said mrs widdup cheerfully miss coulson she ran away with the iceman last night sir a technical error i never cared especially for feuds believing them to be even more overrated products of our country than grapefruit scrapple or honeymoons nevertheless if i may be allowed i will tell you of an indian territory feud of which i was press agent camp follower and inaccessory during the fact i was on a visit to sam durkee s ranch where i had a great time falling off unmanicured ponies and waving my bare hand at the lower jaws of wolves about two miles away sam was a hardened person of about twenty five with a reputation for going home in the dark with perfect equanimity though often with reluctance over in the creek nation was a family bearing the name of tatum i was told that the durkees and tatums had been feuding for years several of each family had bitten the grass and it was expected that more nebuchad nezzars would follow a younger generation of each family was growing up and the grass was keeping pace with them but i gathered that they had fought fairly that they had not lain in cornfields and aimed at the division of their enemies suspenders in the back partly perhaps because there were no cornfields and nobody wore more than one suspender nor had any woman or child of either house ever been harmed in those days and you will find it so yet their women were safe sam durkee had a girl if it were an all fiction magazine that i expect to sell this story to i should say mr durkee rejoiced in a fianc e her name was ella baynes they appeared to be devoted to each other and to have perfect confidence in each other as all couples do who are and have or aren t and haven t she was tolerably pretty with a heavy mass of brown hair that helped her along he introduced me to her which seemed not to lessen her preference for him so i reasoned that they were surely soul mates miss baynes lived in kingfisher twenty miles from the ranch sam lived on a gallop between the two places one day there came to kingfisher a courageous young man rather small with smooth face and regular features he made many inquiries about the business of the town and especially of the inhabitants cognominally he said he was from muscogee and he looked it with his yellow shoes and crocheted four in hand i met him once when i rode in for the mail he said his name was beverly travers which seemed rather improbable there were active times on the ranch just then and sam was too busy to go to town often as an incom petent and generally worthless guest it devolved upon me to ride in for little things such as post cards barrels of flour baking powder smoking tobacco and letters from ella one day when i was messenger for half a gross of cigarette papers and a couple of wagon tires i saw the alleged beverly travers in a yellow wheeled buggy with ella baynes driving about town as ostentatiously as the black waxy mud would permit i knew that this infor mation would bring no balm of gilead to sam s soul so i refrained from including it in the news of the city that i retailed on my return but on the next afternoon an elongated ex cowboy of the name of simmons an old time pal of sam s who kept a feed store in kingfisher rode out to the ranch and rolled and burned many cigar ettes before he would talk when he did make oration his words were these say sam there s been a description of a galoot miscallin himself bevel edged travels impairing the atmospheric air of kingfisher for the past two weeks you know who he was he was not otherwise than ben tatum from the creek nation son of old gopher tatum that your uncle newt shot last february you know what he done this morning he killed your brother lester shot him in the co t house yard i wondered if sam had heard he pulled a twig from a mesquite bush chewed it gravely and said he did did he he killed lester the same said simmons and he did more he run away with your girl the same as to say miss ella baynes i thought you might like to know so i rode out to impart the information i am much obliged jim said sam taking the chewed twig from his mouth yes i m glad you rode out yes i m right glad well i ll be ridin back i reckon that boy i left in the feed store don t know hay from oats he shot lester in the back shot him in the back yes while he was hitchin his hoss i m much obliged jim i kind of thought you d like to know as soon as you could come in and have some coffee before you ride back jim why no i reckon not i must get back to the store and you say yes sam everybody seen em drive away together in a buckboard with a big bundle like clothes tied up in the back of it he was drivin the team he brought over with him from muscogee they ll be hard to over take right away and which i was goin on to tell you they left on the guthrie road but there s no tellin which forks they ll take you know that all right jim much obliged you re welcome sam simmons rolled a cigarette and stabbed his pony with both heels twenty yards away he reined up and called back you don t want no assistance as you might say not any thanks i didn t think you would well so long sam took out and opened a bone handled pocket knife and scraped a dried piece of mud from his left boot i thought at first he was going to swear a vendetta on the blade of it or recite the gipsy s curse the few feuds i had ever seen or read about usually opened that way this one seemed to be presented with a new treat ment thus offered on the stage it would have been hissed off and one of belasco s thrilling melodramas demanded instead i wonder said sam with a profoundly thoughtful expression if the cook has any cold beans left over he called wash the negro cook and finding that he had some ordered him to heat up the pot and make some strong coffee then we went into sam s private room where he slept and kept his armoury dogs and the sad dles of his favourite mounts he took three or four six shooters out of a bookcase and began to look them over whistling the cowboy s lament abstractedly after ward he ordered the two best horses on the ranch saddled and tied to the hitching post now in the feud business in all sections of the country i have observed that in one particular there is a delicate but strict etiquette belonging you must not mention the word or refer to the subject in the presence of a feudist it would be more reprehensible than commenting upon the mole on the chin of your rich aunt i found later on that there is another unwritten rule but i think that belongs solely to the west it yet lacked two hours to supper time but in twenty minutes sam and i were plunging deep into the reheated beans hot coffee and cold beef nothing like a good meal before a long ride said sam eat hearty i had a sudden suspicion why did you have two horses saddled i asked one two one two said sam you can count can t you his mathematics carried with it a momentary qualm and a lesson the thought had not occurred to him that the thought could possibly occur to me not to ride at his side on that red road to revenge and justice it was the higher calculus i was booked for the trail i began to eat more beans in an hour we set forth at a steady gallop eastward our horses were kentucky bred strengthened by the mesquite grass of the west ben tatum s steeds may have been swifter and he had a good lead but if he had heard the punctual thuds of the hoofs of those trailers of ours born in the heart of feudland he might have felt that retribution was creeping up on the hoof prints of his dapper nags i knew that ben tatum s card to play was flight flight until he came within the safer territory of his own henchmen and supporters he knew that the man pur suing him would follow the trail to any end where it might lead during the ride sam talked of the prospect for rain of the price of beef and of the musical glasses you would have thought he had never had a brother or a sweetheart or an enemy on earth there are some sub jects too big even for the words in the unabridged knowing this phase of the feud code but not having practised it sufficiently i overdid the thing by telling some slightly funny anecdotes sam laughed at exactly the right place laughed with his mouth when i caught sight of his mouth i wished i had been blessed with enough sense of humour to have suppressed those anecdotes our first sight of them we had in guthrie tired and hungry we stumbled unwashed into a little yellow pine hotel and sat at a table in the opposite corner we saw the fugitives they were bent upon their meal but looked around at times uneasily the girl was dressed in brown one of these smooth half shiny silky looking affairs with lace collar and cuffs and what i believe they call an accordion plaited skirt she wore a thick brown veil down to her nose and a broad brimmed straw hat with some kind of feathers adorning it the man wore plain dark clothes and his hair was trimmed very short he was such a man as you might see anywhere there they were the murderer and the woman he had stolen there we were the rightful avenger according to the code and the supernumerary who writes these words for one time at least in the heart of the supernumerary there rose the killing instinct for one moment he joined the force of combatants orally what are you waiting for sam i said in a whisper let him have it now sam gave a melancholy sigh you don t understand but he does he said he knows mr tenderfoot there s a rule out here among white men in the nation that you can t shoot a man when he s with a woman i never knew it to be broke yet you can t do it you ve got to get him in a gang of men or by himself that s why he knows it too we all know so that s mr ben tatum one of the pretty men i ll cut him out of the herd before they leave the hotel and regulate his account after supper the flying pair disappeared quickly although sam haunted lobby and stairway and halls half the night in some mysterious way the fugitives eluded him and in the morning the veiled lady in the brown dress with the accordion plaited skirt and the dapper young man with the close clipped hair and the buckboard with the prancing nags were gone it is a monotonous story that of the ride so it shall be curtailed once again we overtook them on a road we were about fifty yards behind they turned in the buckboard and looked at us then drove on without whipping up their horses their safety no longer lay in speed ben tatum knew he knew that the only rock of safety left to him was the code there is no doubt that had he been alone the matter would have been settled quickly with sam durkee in the usual way but he had something at his side that kept still the trigger finger of both it seemed likely that he was no coward so you may perceive that woman on occasions may postpone instead of precipitating conflict between man and man but not willingly or consciously she is oblivious of codes five miles farther we came upon the future great western city of chandler the horses of pursuers and pursued were starved and weary there was one hotel that offered danger to man and entertainment to beast so the four of us met again in the dining room at the ringing of a bell so resonant and large that it had cracked the welkin long ago the dining room was not as large as the one at guthrie just as we were eating apple pie how ben davises and tragedy impinge upon each other i noticed sam looking with keen intentness at our quarry where they were seated at a table across the room the girl still wore the brown dress with lace collar and cuffs and the veil drawn down to her nose the man bent over his plate with his close cropped head held low there s a code i heard sam say either to me or to himself that won t let you shoot a man in the company of a woman but by thunder there ain t one to keep you from killing a woman in the company of a man and quicker than my mind could follow his argument he whipped a colt s automatic from under his left arm and pumped six bullets into the body that the brown dress covered the brown dress with the lace collar and cuffs and the accordion plaited skirt the young person in the dark sack suit from whose head and from whose life a woman s glory had been clipped laid her head on her arms stretched upon the table while people came running to raise ben tatum from the floor in his feminine masquerade that had given sam the opportunity to set aside technically the obliga tions of the code suite homes and their romance few young couples in the big city of bluff began their married existence with greater promise of happiness than did mr and mrs claude turpin they felt no especial animosity toward each other they were comfort ably established in a handsome apartment house that had a name and accommodations like those of a sleeping car they were living as expensively as the couple on the next floor above who had twice their income and their marriage had occurred on a wager a ferry boat and first acquaintance thus securing a sensational newspaper notice with their names attached to pictures of the queen of roumania and m santos dumont turpin s income was per month on pay day after calculating the amounts due for rent instalments on furniture and piano gas and bills owed to the florist confectioner milliner tailor wine merchant and cab company the turpins would find that they still had left to spend how to do this is one of the secrets of metropolitan life the domestic life of the turpins was a beautiful picture to see but you couldn t gaze upon it as you could at an oleograph of don t wake grandma or brook lyn by moonlight you had to blink when looked at it and you heard a fizzing sound just like the machine with a scope at the end of it yes there wasn t much repose about the picture of the turpins domestic life it was something like spearing salmon in the columbia river or jap anese artillery in action every day was just like another as the days are in new york in the morning turpin would take bromo seltzer his pocket change from under the clock his hat no breakfast and his departure for the office at noon mrs turpin would get out of bed and humour put on a kimono airs and the water to boil for coffee turpin lunched downtown he came home at to dress for dinner they always dined out they strayed from the chop house to chop sueydom from terrace to table d h te from rathskeller to roadhouse from caf to casino from maria s to the martha wash ington such is domestic life in the great city your vine is the mistletoe your fig tree bears dates your household gods are mercury and john howard payne for the wedding march you now hear only come with the gypsy bride you rarely dine at the same place twice in succession you tire of the food and besides you want to give them time for the question of that souve nir silver sugar bowl to blow over the turpins were therefore happy they made many warm and delightful friends some of whom they remem bered the next day their home life was an ideal one according to the rules and regulations of the book of bluff there came a time when it dawned upon turpin that his wife was getting away with too much money if you belong to the near swell class in the big city and your income is per month and you find at the end of the month after looking over the bills for current expenses that you yourself have spent you very naturally wonder what has become of the other so you suspect your wife and perhaps you give her a hint that something needs explanation i say vivien said turpin one afternoon when they were enjoying in rapt silence the peace and quiet of their cozy apartment you ve been creating a hiatus big enough for a dog to crawl through in this month s hon orarium you haven t been paying your dressmaker anything on account have you there was a moment s silence no sounds could be heard except the breathing of the fox terrier and the subdued monotonous sizzling of vivien s fulvous locks against the insensate curling irons claude turpin sitting upon a pillow that he had thoughtfully placed upon the convolutions of the apartment sofa narrowly watched the riante lovely face of his wife claudie dear said she touching her finger to her ruby tongue and testing the unresponsive curling irons you do me an injustice mme toinette has not seen a cent of mine since the day you paid your tailor ten dollars on account turpin s suspicions were allayed for the time but one day soon there came an anonymous letter to him that read watch your wife she is blowing in your money secretly i was a sufferer just as you are the place is no blank street a word to the wise etc a man who knows turpin took this letter to the captain of police of the precinct that he lived in my precinct is as clean as a hound s tooth said the captain the lid s shut down as close there as it is over the eye of a williamsburg girl when she s kissed at a party but if you think there s anything queer at the address i ll go there with ye on the next afternoon at turpin and the captain crept softly up the stairs of no blank street a dozen plain clothes men dressed in full police uniforms so as to allay suspicion waited in the hall below at the top of the stairs was a door which was found to be locked the captain took a key from his pocket and unlocked it the two men entered they found themselves in a large room occupied by twenty or twenty five elegantly clothed ladies racing charts hung against the walls a ticker clicked in one corner with a telephone receiver to his ear a man was calling out the various positions of the horses in a very exciting race the occupants of the room looked up at the intruders but as if reassured by the sight of the captain s uniform they reverted their attention to the man at the telephone you see said the captain to turpin the value of an anonymous letter no high minded and self respect ing gentleman should consider one worthy of notice is your wife among this assembly mr turpin she is not said turpin and if she was continued the captain would she be within the reach of the tongue of slander these ladies constitute a browning society they meet to discuss the meaning of the great poet the telephone is connected with boston whence the parent society transmits frequently its interpretations of the poems be ashamed of yer suspicions mr turpin go soak your shield said turpin vivien knows how to take care of herself in a pool room she s not dropping anything on the ponies there must be some thing queer going on here nothing but browning said the captain hear that thanatopsis by a nose drawled the man at the telephone that s not browning that s longfellow said turpin who sometimes read books back to the pasture exclaimed the captain long fellow made the pacing to wagon record of way back in i believe there s something queer about this joint repeated turpin i don t see it said the captain i know it looks like a pool room all right persisted turpin but that s all a blind vivien has been dropping a lot of coin somewhere i believe there s some under handed work going on here a number of racing sheets were tacked close together covering a large space on one of the walls turpin suspicious tore several of them down a door pre viously hidden was revealed turpin placed an ear to the crack and listened intently he heard the soft hum of many voices low and guarded laughter and a sharp metallic clicking and scraping as if from a multitude of tiny but busy objects my god it is as i feared whispered turpin to himself summon your men at once he called to the captain she is in there i know at the blowing of the captain s whistle the uniformed plain clothes men rushed up the stairs into the pool room when they saw the betting paraphernalia distrib uted around they halted surprised and puzzled to know why they had been summoned but the captain pointed to the lock ed door and bade them break it down in a few moments they demolished it with the axes they carried into the other room sprang claude turpin with the captain at his heels the scene was one that lingered long in turpin s mind nearly a score of women women expensively and fashionably clothed many beautiful and of refined appearance had been seated at little marble topped tables when the police burst open the door they shrieked and ran here and there like gayly plumed birds that had been disturbed in a tropical grove some became hysterical one or two fainted several knelt at the feet of the officers and besought them for mercy on account of their families and social position a man who had been seated behind a desk had seized a roll of currency as large as the ankle of a paradise roof gardens chorus girl and jumped out of the window half a dozen attendants huddled at one end of the room breathless from fear upon the tables remained the damning and incon trovertible evidences of the guilt of the habitu es of that sinister room dish after dish heaped high with ice cream and surrounded by stacks of empty ones scraped to the last spoonful ladies said the captain to his weeping circle of prisoner i ll not hold any of yez some of yez i recog nize as having fine houses and good standing in the community with hard working husbands and childer at home but i ll read ye a bit of a lecture before ye go in the next room there s a to shot just dropped in under the wire three lengths ahead of the field is this the way ye waste your husbands money instead of help ing earn it home wid yez the lid s on the ice cream freezer in this precinct claude turpin s wife was among the patrons of the raided room he led her to their apartment in stem silence there she wept so remorsefully and besought his forgiveness so pleadingly that he forgot his just anger and soon he gathered his penitent golden haired vivien in his arms and forgave her darling she murmured half sobbingly as the moon light drifted through the open window glorifying her sweet upturned face i know i done wrong i will never touch ice cream again i forgot you were not a millionaire i used to go there every day but to day i felt some strange sad presentiment of evil and i was not myself i ate only eleven saucers say no more said claude gently as he fondly caressed her waving curls and you are sure that you fully forgive me asked vivien gazing at him entreatingly with dewy eyes of heavenly blue almost sure little one answered claude stooping and lightly touching her snowy forehead with his lips i ll let you know later on i ve got a month s salary down on vanilla to win the three year old steeplechase to morrow and if the ice cream hunch is to the good you are it again see the whirligig of life justice of the peace benaja widdup sat in the door of his office smoking his elder stem pipe half way to the zenith the cumberland range rose blue gray in the afternoon haze a speckled hen swaggered down the main street of the settlement cackling foolishly up the road came a sound of creaking axles and then a slow cloud of dust and then a bull cart bearing ransie bilbro and his wife the cart stopped at the justice s door and the two climbed down ransie was a narrow six feet of sallow brown skin and yellow hair the imperturbability of the mountains hung upon him like a suit of armour the woman was calicoed angled snuff brushed and weary with unknown desires through it all gleamed a faint protest of cheated youth unconscious of its loss the justice of the peace slipped his feet into his shoes for the sake of dignity and moved to let them enter we all said the woman in a voice like the wind blowing through pine boughs wants a divo ce she looked at ransie to see if he noted any flaw or ambiguity or evasion or partiality or self partisanship in her state ment of their business a divo ce repeated ransie with a solemn dod we all can t git along together nohow it s lonesome enough fur to live in the mount ins when a man and a woman keers fur one another but when she s a spittin like a wildcat or a sullenin like a hoot owl in the cabin a man ain t got no call to live with her when he s a no count varmint said the woman without any especial warmth a traipsin along of scalawags and moonshiners and a layin on his back pizen ith co n whiskey and a

gwine to be able fur to sleep o nights the justice of the peace stirred deliberately to his duties he placed his one chair and a wooden stool for his petitioners he opened his book of statutes on the table and scanned the index presently he wiped his spectacles and shifted his inkstand the law and the statutes said he air silent on the subjeck of divo ce as fur as the jurisdiction of this co t air concerned but accordin to equity and the con stitution and the golden rule it s a bad barg in that can t run both ways if a justice of the peace can marry a couple it s plain that he is bound to be able to divo ce em this here office will issue a decree of divo ce and abide by the decision of the supreme co t to hold it good ransie bilbro drew a small tobacco bag from his trousers pocket out of this he shook upon the table a five dollar note sold a b arskin and two foxes fur that he remarked it s all the money we got the regular price of a divo ce in this co t said the justice air five dollars he stuffed the bill into the pocket of his homespun vest with a deceptive air of indiffer ence with much bodily toil and mental travail he wrote the decree upon half a sheet of foolscap and then copied it upon the other ransie bilbro and his wife listened to his reading of the document that was to give them freedom know all men by these presents that ransie bilbro and his wife ariela

let him pay me ali money ransie bilbro was stricken to dumb perplexity there had been no previous hint of alimony women were always bringing up startling and unlooked for issues justice benaja widdup felt that the point demanded judicial decision the authorities were also silent on the subject of alimony but the woman s feet were bare the trail to hogback mountain was steep and flinty ariela bilbro he asked in official tones how much did you low would be good and sufficient ali money in the case befo the co t i lowed she answered fur the shoes and all to say five dollars that ain t much

as well go down to uncle ziah s decided ransie and spend the night he climbed into the cart on one side and ariela climbed in on the other obeying the flap of his rope the little red bull slowly came around on a tack and the cart crawled away in the nimbus arising from its wheels justice of the peace benaja widdup smoked his elder stem pipe late in the afternoon he got his weekly paper and read it until the twilight dimmed its lines then he lit the tallow candle on his table and read until the moon rose marking the time for supper he lived in the double log cabin on the slope near the girdled poplar going home to supper he crossed a little branch darkened by a laurel thicket the dark figure of a man stepped from the laurels and pointed a rifle at his breast his hat was pulled down low and something covered most of his face i want yo money said the figure thout any talk i m gettin nervous and my finger s a wabblin on this here trigger i ve only got f f five dollars said the justice pro ducing it from his vest pocket roll it up came the order and stick it in the end of this here gun bar l the bill was crisp and new even fingers that were clumsy and trembling found little difficulty in making a spill of it and inserting it this with less ease into the muzzle of the rifle now i reckon you kin be goin along said the robber the justice lingered not on his way the next day came the little red bull drawing the cart to the office door justice benaja widdup had his shoes on for he was expecting the visit in his presence ransie bilbro handed to his wife a five dollar bill the official s eye sharply viewed it it seemed to curl up as though it had been rolled and inserted into the end of a gun barrel but the justice refrained from comment it is true that other bills might be inclined to curl he handed each one a decree of divorce each stood awkwardly silent slowly folding the guarantee of freedom the woman cast a shy glance full of constraint at ransie i reckon you ll be goin back up to the cabin she said along ith the bull cart there s bread in the tin box settin on the shelf i put the bacon in the b ilin pot to keep the hounds from gittin it don t forget to wind the

a martyr s voice fur to not want to say good bye less you air so anxious to git away that you don t want me to say it ariela was silent she folded the five dollar bill and her decree carefully and placed them in the bosom of her dress benaja widdup watched the money disappear with mournful eyes behind his spectacles and then with his next words he achieved rank as his thoughts ran with either the great crowd of the world s sympathizers or the little crowd of its great financiers be kind o lonesome in the old cabin to night ranse he said ransie bilbro stared out at the cumberlands clear blue now in the sunlight he did not look at ariela i low it might be lonesome he said but when folks gits mad and wants a divo ce you can t make folks stay there s others wanted a divo ce said ariela speaking to the wooden stool besides nobody don t want no body to stay nobody never said they didn t nobody never said they did i reckon i better start on now to brother ed s nobody can t wind that old clock want me to go back along ith you in the cart and wind it fur you ranse the mountaineer s countenance was proof against emotion but he reached out a big hand and enclosed ariela s thin brown

discord and misunderstandin rollin away from two lovin hearts but it air the duty of the co t to p eserve the morals and integrity of the state the co t reminds you that you air no longer man and wife but air divo ced by regular decree and as such air not entitled to the benefits and purtenances of the mattermonal estate ariela caught ransie s arm did those words mean that she must lose him now

ceremony of marri ge thus fixin things up and enablin the parties in the case to resume the honour ble and elevatin state of mattermony which they desires the fee fur per formin said ceremony will be in this case to wit five dollars aricla caught the gleam of promise in his words swiftly her hand went to her bosom freely as an alighting dove the bill fluttered to the justice s table her sallow cheek coloured as she stood hand in hand with ransie and listened to the reuniting words ransie helped her into the cart and climbed in beside her the little red bull turned once more and they set out hand clasped for the mountains justice of the peace benaja widdup sat in his door and took off his shoes once again he fingered the bill tucked down in his vest pocket once again he smoked his elder stem pipe once again the speck led hen swag gered down the main street of the settlement cackling foolishly a sacrifice hit the editor of the hearthstone magazine his own ideas about the selection of manuscript for his publication his theory is no secret in fact he will expound it to you willingly sitting at his mahogany desk smiling benignantly and tapping his knee gently with his gold rimmed eye glasses the hearthstone he will say does not employ a staff of readers we obtain opinions of the manuscripts submitted to us directly from types of the various classes of our readers that is the editor s theory and this is the way he carries it out when a batch of mss is received the editor stuffs every one of his pockets full of them and distributes them as he goes about during the day the office employees the hall porter the janitor the elevator man messenger boys the waiters at the caf where the editor has luncheon the man at the news stand where he buys his evening paper the grocer and milkman the guard on the uptown elevated train the ticket chopper at sixty th street the cook and maid at his home these are the readers who pass upon mss sent in to the hearthstone magazine if his pockets are not entirely emptied by the time he reaches the bosom of his family the remaining ones are handed over to his wife to read after the baby goes to sleep a few days later the editor gathers in the mss during his regular rounds and con siders the verdict of his assorted readers this system of making up a magazine has been very successful and the circulation paced by the advertising rates is making a wonderful record of speed the hearthstone company also publishes books and its imprint is to be found on several successful works all recommended says the editor by the hearthstone army of volunteer readers now and then according to talkative members of the editorial staff the hearthstone has allowed manuscripts to slip through its fingers on the advice of its heterogeneous readers that afterward proved to be famous sellers when brought out by other houses for instance the gossips say the rise and fall of silas latham was unfavourably passed upon by the elevator man the office boy unanimously rejected the boss in the bishop s carriage was contemptuously looked upon by the street car conductor the deliver ance was turned down by a clerk in the subscription department whose wife s mother had just begun a two months visit at his home the queen s quair came back from the janitor with the comment so is the book but nevertheless the hearthstone adheres to its theory and system and it will never lack volunteer readers for each one of the widely scattered staff from the young lady stenographer in the editorial office to the man who shovels in coal whose adverse decision lost to the hearth stone company the manuscript of the under world has expectations of becoming editor of the magazine some day this method of the hearthstone was well known to allen slayton when he wrote his novelette entitled love is all slayton had hung about the editorial offices of all the magazines so persistently that he was acquainted with the inner workings of every one in gotham he knew not only that the editor of the hearthstone handed his mss around among different types of people for reading but that the stories of sentimental love interest went to miss puffkin the editor s stenographer another of the editor s peculiar customs was to conceal invariably the name of the writer from his readers of mss so that a glittering name might not influence the sincerity of their reports slayton made love is all the effort of his life he gave it six months of the best work of his heart and brain it was a pure love story fine elevated romantic passionate a prose poem that set the divine blessing of love i am transposing from the manuscript high above all earthly gifts and honours and listed it in the catalogue of heaven s choicest rewards slayton s literary ambition was intense he would have sacrificed all other worldly possessions to have gained fame in his chosen art he would almost have cut off his right hand or have offered himself to the knife of the appendi citis fancier to have realized his dream of seeing one of his efforts published in the hearthstone slayton finished love is all and took it to thy hearthstone in person the office of the magazine was in a large conglomerate building presided under by a janitor as the writer stepped inside the door on his way to the elevator a potato masher flew through the hall wreck ing slayton s hat and smashing the glass of the door closely following in the wake of the utensil flew the janitor a bulky unwholesome man suspenderless and sordid panic stricken and breathless a frowsy tall woman with flying hair followed the missile the janitor s foot slipped on the tiled floor he fell in a heap with an exclamation of despair the woman pounced upon him and seized his hair the man bellowed lustily her vengeance wreaked the virago rose and stalked triumphant as minerva back to some cryptic domestic retreat at the rear the janitor got to his feet blown and humiliated this is married life he said to slayton with a certain bruised humour that s the girl i used to lay awake of nights thinking about sorry about your hat mister say don t snitch to the tenants about this will yer i don t want to lose me job slayton took the elevator at the end of the hall and went up to the offices of the hearthstone he left the ms of love is all with the editor who agreed to give him an answer as to its availability at the end of a week slayton formulated his great winning scheme on his way down it struck him with one brilliant flash and he could not refrain from admiring his own genius in conceiving the idea that very night he set about carry ing it into execution miss puffkin the hearthstone stenographer boarded in the same house with the author she was an oldish thin exclusive languishing sentimental maid and slayton had been introduced to her some time before the writer s daring and self sacrificing project was this he knew that the editor of the hearthstone relied strongly upon miss puffkin s judgment in the manuscript of romantic and sentimental fiction her taste represented the immense average of mediocre women who devour novels and stories of that type the central idea and keynote of love is all was love at first sight the enrapturing irresistible soul thrilling feeling that com pels a man or a woman to recognize his or her spirit mate as soon as heart speaks to heart suppose he should impress this divine truth upon miss puffkin personally would she not surely indorse her new and rapturous sensations by recommending highly to the editor of the hearthstone the novelette love is all slayton thought so and that night he took miss puffkin to the theatre the next night he made vehement love to her in the dim parlour of the boarding house he quoted freely from love is all and he wound up with miss puffkin s head on his shoulder and visions of literary fame dancing in his head but slayton did not stop at love making this he said to himself was the turning point of his life and like a true sportsman he went the limit on thursday night he and miss puffkin walked over to the big church in the middle of the block and were married brave slayton chateaubriand died in a garret byron courted a widow keats starved to death poe mixed his drinks de quincey hit the pipe ade lived in chica o james kept on doing it dic kens wore white socks de maupassant wore a strait jacket tom watson became a populist jeremiah wept all these authors did these things for the sake of literature but thou didst cap them all thou marriedst a wife for to carve for thyself a niche in the temple of fame on friday morning mrs slayton said she would go over to the hearthstone office hand in one or two manu ripts that the editor had given to her to read and resign her position as stenographer was there anything er that er you particu larly fancied in the stories you are going to turn in asked slayton with a thumping heart there was one a novelette that i liked so much said his wife i haven t read anything in years that i thought was half as nice and true to life that afternoon slayton hurried down to the hearth stone office he felt that his reward was close at hand with a novelette in the hearthstone literary reputation would soon be his the office boy met him at the railing in the outer office it was not for unsuccessful authors to hold personal colloquy with the editor except at rare intervals slayton hugging himself internally was nursing in his heart the exquisite hope of being able to crush the office boy with his forthcoming success he inquired concerning his novelette the office boy went into the sacred precincts and brought forth a large envelope thick with more than the bulk of a thousand diecks the boss told me to tell you he s sorry said the boy but your manuscript ain t available for the magazine slayton stood dazed can you tell me he stammered whether or no miss puff that is my i mean miss ruffkin handed in a novelette this morning that she had been asked to read sure she did answered the office boy wisely i heard the old man say that miss puffkin said it was a daisy the name of it was married for the mazuma or a working girl s triumph say you said the office boy confidentially your name s slayton ain t it i guess i mixed cases on vou without meanin to do it the boss give me some manu script to hand around the other day and i got the ones for miss puffkin and the janitor mixed i guess it s all right though and then slayton looked closer and saw on the cover of his manuscript under the title love is all the janitor s comment scribbled with a piece of charcoal the you say the roads we take twienty miles west of tucson the sunset express stopped at a tank to take on water besides the aqueous addition the engine of that famous flyer acquired some other things that were not good for it while the fireman was lowering the feeding hose bob tidball shark dodson and a quarter bred creek indian called john big dog climbed on the engine and showed the engineer three round orifices in pieces of ordnance that the carried these orifices so impressed the engineer with their possibilities that he raised both hands in a gesture such as accompanies the ejaculation do tell at the crisp command of shark dodson who was leader of the attacking force the engineer descended to the ground and uncoupled the engine and tender then john big dog perched upon the coal sportively held two guns upon the engine driver and the fireman and suggested that they run the engine fifty yards away and there await further orders shark dodson and bob tidball scorning to put such low grade ore as the passengers through the mill struck out for the rich pocket of the express car they found the messenger serene in the belief that the sunset express was taking on nothing more stimulating and dangerous than aqua pura while bob was knocking this idea out of his head with the butt end of his six shooter shark dodson was already dosing the express car safe with dynamite the safe exploded to the tune of all gold and currency the passengers thrust their heads casually out of the windows to look for the thunder cloud the conductor jerked at the bell rope which sagged down loose and unresisting at his tug shark dodson and bob tidball with their booty in a stout canvas bag tumbled out of the express car and ran awkwardly in their high heeled boots to the engine the engineer sullenly angry but wise ran the engine according to orders rapidly away from the inert train but before this was accomplished the express messenger recovered from bob tidball s persuader to neutrality jumped out of his car with a winchester rifle and took a trick in the game mr john big dog sitting on the coal tender unwittingly made a wrong lead by giving an imitation of a target and the messenger trumped him with a ball exactly between his shoulder blades the creek chevalier of industry rolled off to the ground thus increasing the share of his comrades in the loot by one sixth each two miles from the tank the engineer was ordered to stop the robbers waved a defiant adieu and plunged down the steep slope into the thick woods that lined the track five minutes of crashing through a thicket of chapparal brought them to open woods where three horses were tied to low hanging branches one was waiting for john big dog who would never ride by night or day again this animal the robbers divested of saddle and bridle and set free they mounted the other two with the bag across one pommel and rode fast and with discre tion through the forest and up a primeval lonely gorge here the animal that bore bob tidball slipped on a mossy boulder and broke a foreleg they shot him through the head at once and sat down to hold a council of flight made secure for the present by the tortuous trail they had travelled the question of time was no longer so big many miles and hours lay between them and the spryest posse that could follow shark dodson s horse with trailing rope and dropped bridle panted and cropped thankfully of the grass along the stream in the gorge bob tidball opened the sack drew out double handfuls of the neat packages of currency and the one sack of gold and chuckled with the glee of a child say you old double decked pirate he called joyfully to dodson you said we could do it you got a head for financing that knocks the horns off of anything in arizona what are we going to do about a hoss for you bob we ain t got long to wait here they ll be on our trail before daylight in the mornin oh i guess that cayuse of yourn ll carry double for a while answered the sanguine bob we ll annex the first animal we come across by jingoes we made a haul didn t we accordin to the marks on this money there s apiece it s short of what i expected said shark dodson kicking softly at the packages with the toe of his boot and then he looked pensively at the wet sides of his tired horse old bolivar s mighty nigh played out he said slowly i wish that sorrel of yours hadn t got hurt so do i said bob heartily but it can t be helped bolivar s got plenty of bottom he ll get us both far enough to get fresh mounts dang it shark i can t belp thinkin how funny it is that an easterner like you can come out here and give us western fellows cards and spades in the desperado business what part of the east was you from anyway new york state said shark dodson sitting down on a boulder and chewing a twig i was born on a farm in ulster county i ran away from home when i was seventeen it was an accident my coming west i was walkin along the road with my clothes in a bundle makin for new york city i had an idea of goin there and makin lots of money i always felt like i could do it i came to a place one evenin where the road forked and i didn t know which fork to take i studied about it for half an hour and then i took the left hand that night i run into the camp of a wild west show that was travellin among the little towns and i went west with it i ve often wondered if i wouldn t have turned out different if i d took the other road oh i reckon you d have ended up about the same said bob tidball cheerfully philosophical it ain t the roads we take it s what s inside of us that makes us turn out the way we do shark dodson got up and leaned against a tree i d a good deal rather that sorrel of yourn hadn t hurt himself bob he said again almost pathetically same here agreed bob he was sure a first rate kind of a crowbait but bolivar he ll pull us through all right reckon we d better be movin on hadn t we shark i ll bag this boodle ag in and we ll hit the trail for higher timber bob tidball replaced the spoil in the bag and tied the mouth of it tightly with a cord when he looked up the most prominent object that he saw was the muzzle of shark dodson s held upon him without a waver stop your funnin said bob with a grin we got to be hittin the breeze set still said shark you ain t goin to hit no breeze bob i hate to tell you but there ain t any chance for but one of us bolivar he s plenty tired and he can t carry double we been pards me and you shark dodson for three

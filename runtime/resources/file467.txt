was for their day is now over a class of land speculators commonly called land sharks unscrupulous and greedy who have left their trail in every department of this office in the shape of titles destroyed patents cancelled homes demolished and torn away forged transfers and lying affidavits before the modern tiles were laid upon the floors there were deep hollows in the limestone slabs worn by the countless feet that daily trod uneasily through its echoing corridors pressing from file room to business room from commissioner s sanctum to record books and back again the honest but ignorant settler bent on saving the little plot of land he called home elbowed the wary land shark who was searching the records for evidence to oust him the lordly cattle baron relying on his influence and money stood at the commissioner s desk side by side with the preemptor whose little potato patch lay like a minute speck of island in the vast billowy sea of his princely pastures and played the old game of freeze out which is as old as cain and abel the trail of the serpent is through it all honest earnest men have wrought for generations striving to disentangle the shameful coil that certain years of fraud and infamy have wound look at the files and see the countless endorsements of those in authority transfer doubtful locked up certificate a forgery locked up signature a forgery patent refused duplicate patented elsewhere field notes forged certificates stolen from office and soon ad infinitum the record books spread upon long tables in the big room upstairs are open to the examination of all open them and you will find the dark and greasy finger prints of half a century s handling the quick hand of the land grabber has fluttered the leaves a million times the damp clutch of the perturbed tiller of the soil has left traces of his calling on the ragged leaves interest centres in the file room this is a large room built as a vault fireproof and entered by but a single door there is no admission on the portal and the precious files are handed out by a clerk in charge only on presentation of an order signed by the commissioner or chief clerk in years past too much laxity prevailed in its management and the files were handled by all corners simply on their request and returned at their will or not at all in these days most of the mischief was done in the file room there are about files each in a paper wrapper and comprising the title papers of a particular tract of land you ask the clerk in charge for the papers relating to any survey in texas they are arranged simply in districts and numbers he disappears from the door you hear the sliding of a tin box the lid snaps and the file is in your hand go up there some day and call for bexar scrip no the file clerk stares at you for a second says shortly out of file it has been missing twenty years the history of that file has never been written before twenty years ago there was a shrewd land agent living in austin who devoted his undoubted talents and vast knowledge of land titles and the laws governing them to the locating of surveys made by illegal certificates or improperly made and otherwise of no value through non compliance with the statutes or whatever flaws his ingenious and unscrupulous mind could unearth he found a fatal defect in the title of the land as on file in bexar scrip no and placed a new certificate upon the survey in his own name the law was on his side every sentiment of justice of right and humanity was against him the certificate by virtue of which the original survey had been made was missing it was not be found in the file and no memorandum or date on the wrapper to show that it had ever been filed under the law the land was vacant unappropriated public domain and open to location the land was occupied by a widow and her only son and she supposed her title good the railroad had surveyed a new line through the property and it had doubled in value sharp the land agent did not communicate with her in any way until he had filed his papers rushed his claim through the departments and into the patent room for patenting then he wrote her a letter offering her the choice of buying from him or vacating at once he received no reply one day he was looking through some files and came across the missing certificate some one probably an employee of the office had by mistake after making some examination placed it in the wrong file and curiously enough another inadvertence in there being no record of its filing on the wrapper had completed the appearance of its having never been filed sharp called for the file in which it belonged and scrutinized it carefully fearing he might have overlooked some endorsement regarding its return to the office on the back of the certificate was plainly endorsed the date of filing according to law and signed by the chief clerk if this certificate should be seen by the examining clerk his own claim when it came up for patenting would not be worth the paper on which it was written sharp glanced furtively around a young man or rather a boy about eighteen years of age stood a few feet away regarding him closely with keen black eyes sharp a little confused thrust the certificate into the file where it properly belonged and began gathering up the other papers the boy came up and leaned on the desk beside him a right interesting office sir he said i have never been in here before all those papers now they are about lands

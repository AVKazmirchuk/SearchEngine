in persuading a drowning man to clutch a straw i inveigled him into accompanying me to a cool corner in a dim cafe and it came to pass that man servants set before us brewage and lucullus polk spake unto me relating the wherefores of his beleaguering the antechambers of the princes of the earth did you ever hear of the s a a p railroad in texas well that don t stand for samaritan actor s aid philanthropy i was down that way managing a summer bunch of the gum and syntax chewers that play the idlewild parks in the western hamlets of course we went to pieces when the soubrette ran away with a prominent barber of beeville i don t know what became of the rest of the company i believe there were some salaries due and the last i saw of the troupe was when i told them that forty three cents was all the treasury contained i say i never saw any of them after that but i heard them for about twenty minutes i didn t have time to look back but after dark i came out of the woods and struck the s a a p agent for means of transportation he at once extended to me the courtesies of the entire railroad kindly warning me however not to get aboard any of the rolling stock about ten the next morning i steps off the ties into a village that calls itself atascosa city i bought a thirty cent breakfast and a ten cent cigar and stood on the main street jingling the three pennies in my pocket dead broke a man in texas with only three cents in his pocket is no better off than a man that has no money and owes two cents one of luck s favourite tricks is to soak a man for his last dollar so quick that he don t have time to look it there i was in a swell st louis tailor made blue and green plaid suit and an eighteen carat sulphate of copper scarf pin with no hope in sight except the two great texas industries the cotton fields and grading new railroads i never picked cotton and i never cottoned to a pick so the outlook had ultramarine edges all of a sudden while i was standing on the edge of the wooden sidewalk down out of the sky falls two fine gold watches in the middle of the street one hits a chunk of mud and sticks the other falls hard and flies open making a fine drizzle of little springs and screws and wheels i looks up for a balloon or an airship but not seeing any i steps off the sidewalk to investigate but i hear a couple of yells and see two men running up the street in leather overalls and high heeled boots and cartwheel hats one man is six or eight feet high with open plumbed joints and a heartbroken cast of countenance he picks up the watch that has stuck in the mud the other man who is little with pink hair and white eyes goes for the empty case and says i win then the elevated pessimist goes down under his leather leg holsters and hands a handful of twenty dollar gold pieces to his albino friend i don t know how much money it was it looked as big as an earthquake relief fund to me i ll have this here case filled up with works says shorty and throw you again for five hundred i m your company says the high man i ll meet you at the smoked dog saloon an hour from now the little man hustles away with a kind of swiss movement toward a jewelry store the heartbroken person stoops over and takes a telescopic view of my haberdashery them s a mighty slick outfit of habiliments you have got on mr man says he i ll bet a hoss you never acquired the right title and interest in and to them clothes in atascosa city why no says i being ready enough to exchange personalities with this moneyed monument of melancholy i had this suit tailored from a special line of coatericks vestures and pantings in st louis would you mind putting me sane says i on this watch throwing contest i ve been used to seeing time pieces treated with more politeness and esteem except women s watches of course which by nature they abuse by cracking walnuts with em and having em taken showing in tintype pictures me and george he explains are up from the ranch having a spell of fun up to last month we owned four sections of watered grazing down on the san miguel but along comes one of these oil prospectors and begins to bore he strikes a gusher that flows out twenty thousand or maybe it was twenty million barrels of oil a day and me and george gets one hundred and fifty thousand dollars seventy five thousand dollars apiece for the land so now and then we saddles up and hits the breeze for atascosa city for a few days of excitement and damage here s a little bunch of the dinero that i drawed out of the bank this morning says he and shows a roll of twenties and fifties as big around as a sleeping car pillow the yellowbacks glowed like a sunset on the gable end of john d s barn my knees got weak and i sat down on the edge of the board sidewalk you must have knocked around a right smart goes on this oil grease us i shouldn t be surprised if you have saw towns more livelier than what atascosa city is sometimes it seems to me that there ought to be some more ways of having a good time than there is here specially when you ve got

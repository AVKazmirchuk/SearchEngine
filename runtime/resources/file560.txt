as far as the roads are cut out oh i don t know said sam reflectively but i certainly do get there on variations i guess i can handle anything in five flats about as well as any of em but you look kind of fagged out uncle ben ain t you feeling right well this evening little tired that s all sam if you ain t played yourself out let s have that mexican piece that starts off with huile huile palomita it seems that that song always kind of soothes and comforts me after i ve been riding far or anything bothers me why seguramente senor said sam i ll hit her up for you as often as you like and before i forget about it uncle ben you want to jerk bradshaw up about them last hams he sent us they re just a little bit strong a man sixty five years old living on a sheep ranch and beset by a complication of disasters cannot successfully and continuously dissemble moreover a troubadour has eyes quick to see unhappiness in others around him because it disturbs his own ease so on the next day sam again questioned the old man about his air of sadness and abstraction then old man ellison told him the story of king james s threats and orders and that pale melancholy and red ruin appeared to have marked him for their own the troubadour took the news thoughtfully he had heard much about king james on the third day of the seven days of grace allowed him by the autocrat of the range old man ellison drove his buckboard to frio city to fetch some necessary supplies for the ranch bradshaw was hard but not implacable he divided the old man s order by two and let him have a little more time one article secured was a new fine ham for the pleasure of the troubadour five miles out of frio city on his way home the old man met king james riding into town his majesty could never look anything but fierce and menacing but to day his slits of eyes appeared to be a little wider than they usually were good day said the king gruffly i ve been wanting to see you i hear it said by a cowman from sandy yesterday that you was from jackson county mississippi originally i want to know if that s a fact born there said old man ellison and raised there till i was twenty one this man says went on king james that he thinks you was related to the jackson county reeveses was he right aunt caroline reeves said the old man was my half sister she was my aunt said king james i run away from home when i was sixteen now let s re talk over some things that we discussed a few days ago they call me a bad man and they re only half right there s plenty of room in my pasture for your bunch of sheep and their increase for a long time to come aunt caroline used to cut out sheep in cake dough and bake em for me you keep your sheep where they are and use all the range you want how s your finances the old man related his woes in detail dignifiedly with restraint and candour she used to smuggle extra grub into my school basket i m speaking of aunt caroline said king james i m going over to frio city to day and i ll ride back by your ranch to morrow i ll draw out of the bank there and bring it over to you and i ll tell bradshaw to let you have everything you want on credit you are bound to have heard the old saying at home that the jackson county reeveses and kings would stick closer by each other than chestnut burrs well i m a king yet whenever i run a cross a reeves so you look out for me along about sundown to morrow and don t worry about nothing shouldn t wonder if the dry spell don t kill out the young grass old man ellison drove happily ranchward once more the smiles filled out his wrinkles very suddenly by the magic of kinship and the good that lies somewhere in all hearts his troubles had been removed on reaching the ranch he found that sam galloway was not there his guitar hung by its buckskin string to a hackberry limb moaning as the gulf breeze blew across its masterless strings the kiowa endeavoured to explain sam he catch pony said he and say he ride to frio city what for no can damn sabe say he come back to night maybe so that all as the first stars came out the troubadour rode back to his haven he pastured his pony and went into the house his spurs jingling martially old man ellison sat at the kitchen table having a tin cup of before supper coffee he looked contented and pleased hello sam said he i m darned glad to see ye back i don t know how i managed to get along on this ranch anyhow before ye dropped in to cheer things up i ll bet ye ve been skylarking around with some of them frio city gals now that s kept ye so late and then old man ellison took another look at sam s face and saw that the minstrel had changed the man of action and while sam is unbuckling from his waist old man ellison s six shooter that the latter had left behind when he drove to town we may well pause to remark that anywhere and whenever a troubadour lays down the guitar and takes up the sword trouble is sure to follow it is not the expert thrust

pineville and we took the trolley car to his home it is a big neighbourless cottage on a hill surrounded by a hundred mountains we got off at his little private station where john s family and amaryllis met and greeted us amaryllis looked at me a trifle anxiously a rabbit came bounding across the hill between us and the house i threw down my suit case and pursued it hotfoot after i had run twenty yards and seen it disappear i sat down on the grass and wept disconsolately i can t catch a rabbit any more i sobbed i m of no further use in the world i may as well be dead oh what is it what is it brother john i heard amaryllis say nerves a little unstrung said john in his calm way don t worry get up you rabbit chaser and come on to the house before the biscuits get cold it was about twilight and the mountains came up nobly to miss murfree s descriptions of them soon after dinner i announced that i believed i could sleep for a year or two including legal holidays so i was shown to a room as big and cool as a flower garden where there was a bed as broad as a lawn soon afterward the remainder of the household retired and then there fell upon the land a silence i had not heard a silence before in years it was absolute i raised myself on my elbow and listened to it sleep i thought that if i only could hear a star twinkle or a blade of grass sharpen itself i could compose myself to rest i thought once that i heard a sound like the sail of a catboat flapping as it veered about in a breeze but i decided that it was probably only a tack in the carpet still i listened suddenly some belated little bird alighted upon the window sill and in what he no doubt considered sleepy tones enunciated the noise generally translated as cheep i leaped into the air hey what s the matter down there called john from his room above mine oh nothing i answered except that i accidentally bumped my head against the ceiling the next morning i went out on the porch and looked at the mountains there were forty seven of them in sight i shuddered went into the big hall sitting room of the house selected pancoast s family practice of medicine from a bookcase and began to read john came in took the book away from me and led me outside he has a farm of three hundred acres furnished with the usual complement of barns mules peasantry and harrows with three front teeth broken off i had seen such things in my childhood and my heart began to sink then john spoke of alfalfa and i brightened at once oh yes said i wasn t she in the chorus of let s see green you know said john and tender and you plow it under after the first season i know said i and the grass grows over her right said john you know something about farming after all i know something of some farmers said i and a sure scythe will mow them down some day on the way back to the house a beautiful and inexplicable creature walked across our path i stopped irresistibly fascinated gazing at it john waited patiently smoking his cigarette he is a modern farmer after ten minutes he said are you going to stand there looking at that chicken all day breakfast is nearly ready a chicken said i a white orpington hen if you want to particularize a white orpington hen i repeated with intense interest the fowl walked slowly away with graceful dignity and i followed like a child after the pied piper five minutes more were allowed me by john and then he took me by the sleeve and conducted me to breakfast after i had been there a week i began to grow alarmed i was sleeping and eating well and actually beginning to enjoy life for a man in my desperate condition that would never do so i sneaked down to the trolley car station took the car for pineville and went to see one of the best physicians in town by this time i knew exactly what to do when i needed medical treatment i hung my hat on the back of a chair and said rapidly doctor i have cirrhosis of the heart indurated arteries neurasthenia neuritis acute indigestion and convalescence i am going to live on a strict diet i shall also take a tepid bath at night and a cold one in the morning i shall endeavour to be cheerful and fix my mind on pleasant subjects in the way of drugs i intend to take a phosphorous pill three times a day preferably after meals and a tonic composed of the tinctures of gentian cinchona calisaya and cardamom compound into each teaspoonful of this i shall mix tincture of nux vomica beginning with one drop and increasing it a drop each day until the maximum dose is reached i shall drop this with a medicine dropper which can be procured at a trifling cost at any pharmacy good morning i took my hat and walked out after i had closed the door i remembered something that i had forgotten to say i opened it again the doctor had not moved from where he had been sitting but he gave a slightly nervous start when he saw me again i forgot to mention said i that i shall also take absolute rest and exercise after this consultation i felt much better the reestablishing in my mind of the fact that i was hopelessly ill gave me so much satisfaction that i almost became gloomy again there is nothing more alarming to a neurasthenic than to feel himself growing well and cheerful john looked after me carefully after i had evinced so much interest in his white orpington chicken he tried his best to divert my mind and was particular to lock his hen house of nights gradually the tonic mountain air the wholesome food and the daily walks among the hills so alleviated my malady that i became utterly wretched and despondent i heard of a country doctor who lived in the mountains nearby i went to see him and told him the whole story he was a gray bearded man with clear blue wr inkled eyes in a home made suit of gray jeans in order to save time i diagnosed my case touched my nose with my right forefinger struck myself below the knee to make my foot kick sounded my chest stuck out my tongue and asked him the price of cemetery lots in pineville he lit his pipe and looked at me for about three minutes brother he said after a while you are in a mighty bad way there s a chance for you to pull through but it s a mighty slim one what can it be i asked eagerly i have taken arsenic and gold phosphorus exercise nux vomica hydrotherapeutic baths rest excitement codein and aromatic spirits of ammonia is there anything left in the pharmacopoeia somewhere in these mountains said the doctor there s a plant growing a flowering plant that ll cure you and it s about the only thing that will it s of a kind that s as old as the world but of late it s powerful scarce and hard to find you and i will have to hunt it up i m not engaged in active practice now i m getting along in years but i ll take your case you ll have to come every day in the afternoon and help me hunt for this plant till we find it the city doctors may know a lot about new scientific things but they don t know much about the cures that nature carries around in her saddlebags so every day the old doctor and i hunted the cure all plant among the mountains and valleys of the blue ridge together we toiled up steep heights so slippery with fallen autumn leaves that we had to catch every sapling and branch within our reach to save us from falling we waded through gorges and chasms breast deep with laurel and ferns we followed the banks of mountain streams for miles we wound our way like indians through brakes of pine road side hill side river side mountain side we explored in our search for the miraculous plant as the old doctor said it must have grown scarce and hard to find but we followed our quest day by day we plumbed the valleys scaled the heights and tramped the plateaus in search of the miraculous plant mountain bred he never seemed to tire i often reached home too fatigued to do anything except fall into bed and sleep until morning this we kept up for a month one evening after i had returned from a six mile tramp with the old doctor amaryllis and i took a little walk under the trees near the road we looked at the mountains drawing their royal purple robes around them for their night s repose i m glad you re well again she said when you first came you frightened me i thought you were really ill well again i almost shrieked do you know that i have only one chance in a thousand to live amaryllis looked at me in surprise why said she you are as strong as one of the plough mules you sleep ten or twelve hours every night and you are eating us out of house and home what more do you want i tell you said i that unless we find the magic that is the plant we are looking for in time nothing can save me the doctor tells me so what doctor doctor tatum the old doctor who lives halfway up black oak mountain do you know him i have known him since i was able to talk and is that where you go every day is it he who takes you on these long walks and climbs that have brought back your health and strength god bless the old doctor just then the old doctor himself drove slowly down the road in his rickety old buggy i waved my hand at him and shouted that i would be on hand the next day at the usual time he stopped his horse and called to amaryllis to come out to him they talked for five minutes while i waited then the old doctor drove on when we got to the house amaryllis lugged out an encyclopaedia and sought a word in it the doctor said she told me that you needn t call any more as a patient but he d be glad to see you any time as a friend and then he told me to look up my name in the encyclopaedia and tell you what it means it seems to be the name of a genus of flowering plants and also the name of a country girl in theocritus and virgil what do you suppose the doctor meant by that i know what he meant said i i know now a word to a brother who may have come under the spell of the unquiet lady neurasthenia the formula was true even though gropingly at times the physicians of the walled cities had put their fingers upon the specific medicament and so for the exercise one is referred to good doctor tatum on black oak mountain take the road to your right at the methodist meeting house in the pine grove absolute rest and exercise what rest more remedial than to sit with amaryllis in the shade and with a sixth sense read the wordless theocritan idyl of the gold bannered blue mountains marching orderly into the dormitories of the night october and june the captain gazed gloomily at his sword that hung upon the wall in the closet near by was stored his faded uniform stained and worn by weather and service what a long long time it seemed since those old days of war s alarms and now veteran that he was of his country s strenuous times he had been reduced to abject surrender by a woman s soft eyes and smiling lips as he sat in his quiet room he held in his hand the letter he had just received from her the letter that had caused him to wear that look of gloom he re read the fatal paragraph that had destroyed his hope in declining the honour you have done me in asking me to be your wife i feel that i ought to speak frankly the reason i have for so doing is the great difference between our ages i like you very very much but i am sure that our marriage would not be a happy one i am sorry to have to refer to this but i believe that you will appreciate my honesty in giving you the true reason the captain sighed and leaned his head upon his hand yes there were many years between their ages but he was strong and rugged he had position and wealth would not his love his tender care and the advantages he could bestow upon her make her forget the question of age besides he was almost sure that she cared for him the captain was a man of prompt action in the field he had been distinguished for his decisiveness and energy he would see her and plead his cause again in person age what was it to come between him and the one he loved in two hours he stood ready in light marching order for his greatest battle he took the train for the old southern town in tennessee where she lived theodora deming was on the steps of the handsome porticoed old mansion enjoying the summer twilight when the captain entered the gate and came up the gravelled walk she met him with a smile that was free from embarrassment as the captain stood on the step below her the difference in their ages did not appear so great he was tall and straight and clear eyed and browned she was in the bloom of lovely womanhood i wasn t expecting you said theodora but now that you ve come you may sit on the step didn t you get my letter i did said the captain and that s why i came i say now theo reconsider your answer won t you theodora smiled softly upon him he carried his years well she was really fond of his strength his wholesome looks his manliness perhaps if no no she said shaking her head positively it s out of the question i like you a whole lot but marrying won t do my age and yours are but don t make me say it again i told you in my letter the captain flushed a little through the bronze on his face he was silent for a while gazing sadly into the twilight beyond a line of woods that he could see was a field where the boys in blue had once bivouacked on their march toward the sea how long ago it seemed now truly fate and father time had tricked him sorely just a few years interposed between himself and happiness theodora s hand crept down and rested in the clasp of his firm brown one she felt at least that sentiment that is akin to love don t take it so hard please she said gently it s all for the best i ve reasoned it out very wisely all by myself some day you ll be glad i didn t marry you it would be very nice and lovely for a while but just think in only a few short years what different tastes we would have one of us would want to sit by the fireside and read and maybe nurse neuralgia or rheumatism of evenings while the other would be crazy for balls and theatres and late suppers no my dear friend while it isn t exactly january and may it s a clear case of october and pretty early in june i d always do what you wanted me to do theo if you wanted to no you wouldn t you think now that you would but you wouldn t please don t ask me any more the captain had lost his battle but he was a gallant warrior and when he rose to make his final adieu his mouth was grimly set and his shoulders were squared he took the train for the north that night on the next evening he was back in his room where his sword was hanging against the wall he was dressing for dinner tying his white tie into a very careful bow and at the same time he was indulging in a pensive soliloquy pon my honour i believe theo was right after all nobody can deny that she s a peach but she must be twenty eight at the very kindest calculation for you see the captain was only nineteen and his sword had never been drawn except on the parade ground at chattanooga which was as near as he ever got to the spanish american war the church with an overshot wheel lakelands is not to be found in the catalogues of fashionable summer resorts it lies on a low spur of the cumberland range of mountains on a little tributary of the clinch river lakelands proper is a contented village of two dozen houses situated on a forlorn narrow gauge railroad line you wonder whether the railroad lost itself in the pine woods and ran into lakelands from fright and loneliness or whether lakelands got lost and huddled itself along the railroad to wait for the ears to carry it home you wonder again why it was named lakelands there are no lakes and the lands about are too poor to be worth mentioning half a mile from the village stands the eagle house a big roomy old mansion run by josiah rankin for the accommodation of visitors who desire the mountain air at inexpensive rates the eagle house is delightfully mismanaged it is full of ancient instead of modern improvements and it is altogether as comfortably neglected and pleasingly disarranged as your own home but you are furnished with clean rooms and good and abundant fare yourself and the piny woods must do the rest nature has provided a mineral spring grape vine swings and croquet even the wickets are wooden you have art to thank only for the fiddle and guitar music twice a week at the hop in the rustic pavilion the patrons of the eagle house are those who seek recreation as a necessity as well as a pleasure they are busy people who may be likened to clocks that need a fortnight s winding to insure a year s running of their wheels you will find students there from the lower towns now and then an artist or a geologist absorbed in construing the ancient strata of the hills a few quiet families spend the summers there and often one or two tired members of that patient sisterhood known to lakelands as schoolmarms a quarter of a mile from the eagle house was what would have been described to its guests as an object of interest in the catalogue had the eagle house issued a catalogue this was an old old mill that was no longer a mill in the words of josiah rankin it was the only church in the united states sah with an overshot wheel and the only mill in the world sah with pews and a pipe organ the guests of the eagle house attended the old mill church each sabbath and heard the preacher liken the purified christian to bolted flour ground to usefulness between the millstones of experience and suffering every year about the beginning of autumn there came to the eagle house one abram strong who remained for a time an honoured and beloved guest in lakelands he was called father abram because his hair was so white his face so strong and kind and florid his laugh so merry and his black clothes and broad hat so priestly in appearance even new guests after three or four days acquaintance gave him this familiar title father abram came a long way to lakelands he lived in a big roaring town in the northwest where he owned mills not little mills with pews and an organ in them but great ugly mountain like mills that the freight trains crawled around all day like ants around an ant heap and now you must be told about father abram and the mill that was a church for their stories run together in the days when the church was a mill mr strong was the miller there was no jollier dustier busier happier miller in all the land than he he lived in a little cottage across the road from the mill his hand was heavy but his toll was light and the mountaineers brought their grain to him across many weary miles of rocky roads the delight of the miller s life was his little daughter aglaia that was a brave name truly for a flaxen haired toddler but the mountaineers love sonorous and stately names the mother had encountered it somewhere in a book and the deed was done in her babyhood aglaia herself repudiated the name as far as common use went and persisted in calling herself dums the miller and his wife often tried to coax from aglaia the source of this mysterious name but without results at last they arrived at a theory in the little garden behind the cottage was a bed of rhododendrons in which the child took a peculiar delight and interest it may have been that she perceived in dums a kinship to the formidable name of her favourite flowers when aglaia was four years old she and her father used to go through a little performance in the mill every afternoon that never failed to come off the weather permitting when supper was ready her mother would brush her hair and put on a clean apron and send her across to the mill to bring her father home when the miller saw her coming in the mill door he would come forward all white with the flour dust and wave his hand and sing an old miller s song that was familiar in those parts and ran something like this the wheel goes round the grist is ground the dusty miller s merry he sings all day his work is play while thinking of his dearie then aglaia would run to him laughing and call da da come take dums home and the miller would swing her to his shoulder and march over to supper singing the miller s song every evening this would take place one day only a week after her fourth birthday aglaia disappeared when last seen she was plucking wild flowers by the side of the road in front of the cottage a little while later her mother went out to see that she did not stray too faraway and she was already gone of course every effort was made to find her the neighbours gathered and searched the woods and the mountains for miles around they dragged every foot of the mill race and the creek for a long distance below the dam never a trace of her did they find a night or two before there had been a family of wanderers camped in a grove near by it was conjectured that they might have stolen the child but when their wagon was overtaken and searched she could not be found the miller remained at the mill for nearly two years and then his hope of finding her died out he and his wife moved to the northwest in a few years he was the owner of a modern mill in one of the important milling cities in that region mrs strong never recovered from the shock caused by the loss of aglaia and two years after they moved away the miller was left to bear his sorrow alone when abram strong became prosperous he paid a visit to lakelands and the old mill the scene was a sad one for him but he was a strong man and always appeared cheery and kindly it was then that he was inspired to convert the old mill into a church lakelands was too poor to build one and the still poorer mountaineers could not assist there was no place of worship nearer than twenty miles the miller altered the appearance of the mill as little as possible the big overshot wheel was left in its place the young people who came to the church used to cut their initials in its soft and slowly decaying wood the dam was partly destroyed and the clear mountain stream rippled unchecked down its rocky bed inside the mill the changes were greater the shafts and millstones and belts and pulleys were of course all removed there were two rows of benches with aisles between and a little raised platform and pulpit at one end on three sides overhead was a gallery containing seats and reached by a stairway inside there was also an organ a real pipe organ in the gallery that was the pride of the congregation of the old mill church miss phoebe summers was the organist the lakelands boys proudly took turns at pumping it for her at each sunday s service the rev mr banbridge was the preacher and rode down from squirrel gap on his old white horse without ever missing a service and abram strong paid for everything he paid the preacher five hundred dollars a year and miss phoebe two hundred dollars thus in memory of aglaia the old mill was converted into a blessing for the community in which she had once lived it seemed that the brief life of the child had brought about more good than the three score years and ten of many but abram strong set up yet another monument to her memory out from his mills in the northwest came the aglaia flour made from the hardest and finest wheat that could be raised the country soon found out that the aglaia flour had two prices one was the highest market price and the other was nothing wherever there happened a calamity that left people destitute a fire a flood a tornado a strike or a famine there would go hurrying a generous consignment of the aglaia at its nothing price it was given away cautiously and judiciously but it was freely given and not a penny could the hungry ones pay for it there got to be a saying that whenever there was a disastrous fire in the poor districts of a city the fire chief s buggy reached the scene first next the aglaia flour wagon and then the fire engines so this was abram strong s other monument to aglaia perhaps to a poet the theme may seem too utilitarian for beauty but to some the fancy will seem sweet and fine that the pure white virgin flour flying on its mission of love and charity might be likened to the spirit of the lost child whose memory it signalized there came a year that brought hard times to the cumberlands grain crops everywhere were light and there were no local crops at all mountain floods had done much damage to property even game in the woods was so scarce that the hunters brought hardly enough home to keep their folk alive especially about lakelands was the rigour felt as soon as abram strong heard of this his messages flew and the little narrow gauge cars began to unload aglaia flour there the miller s orders were to store the flour in the gallery of the old mill church and that every one who attended the church was to carry home a sack of it two weeks after that abram strong came for his yearly visit to the eagle house and became father abram again that season the eagle house had fewer guests than usual among them was rose chester miss chester came to lakelands from atlanta where she worked in a department store this was the first vacation outing of her life the wife of the store manager had once spent a summer at the eagle house she had taken a fancy to rose and had persuaded her to go there for her three weeks holiday the manager s wife gave her a letter to mrs rankin who gladly received her in her own charge and care miss chester was not very strong she was about twenty and pale and delicate from an indoor life but one week of lakelands gave her a brightness and spirit that changed her wonderfully the time was early september when the cumberlands are at their greatest beauty the mountain foliage was growing brilliant with autumnal colours one breathed aerial champagne the nights were deliciously cool causing one to snuggle cosily under the warm blankets of the eagle house father abram and miss chester became great friends the old miller learned her story from mrs rankin and his interest went out quickly to the slender lonely girl who was making her own way in the world the mountain country was new to miss chester she had lived many years in the warm flat town of atlanta and the grandeur and variety of the cumberlands delighted her she was determined to enjoy every moment of her stay her little hoard of savings had been estimated so carefully in connection with her expenses that she knew almost to a penny what her very small surplus would be when she returned to work miss chester was fortunate in gaining father abram for a friend and companion he knew every road and peak and slope of the mountains near lakelands through him she became acquainted with the solemn delight of the shadowy tilted aisles of the pine forests the dignity of the bare crags the crystal tonic mornings the dreamy golden afternoons full of mysterious sadness so her health improved and her spirits grew light she had a laugh as genial and hearty in its feminine way as the famous laugh of father abram both of them were natural optimists and both knew how to present a serene and cheerful face to the world one day miss chester learned from one of the guests the history of father abram s lost child quickly she hurried away and found the miller seated on his favourite rustic bench near the chalybeate spring he was surprised when his little friend slipped her hand into his and looked at him with tears in her eyes oh father abram she said i m so sorry i didn t know until to day about your little daughter you will find her yet some day oh i hope you will the miller looked down at her with his strong ready smile thank you miss rose he said in his usual cheery tones but i do not expect to find aglaia for a few years i hoped that she had been stolen by vagrants and that she still lived but i have lost that hope i believe that she was drowned i can understand said miss chester how the doubt must have made it so hard to bear and yet you are so cheerful and so ready to make other people s burdens light good father abram good miss rose mimicked the miller smiling who thinks of others more than you do a whimsical mood seemed to strike miss chester oh father abram she cried wouldn t it be grand if i should prove to be your daughter wouldn t it be romantic and wouldn t you like to have me for a daughter indeed i would said the miller heartily if aglaia had lived i could wish for nothing better than for her to have grown up to be just such a little woman as you are maybe you are aglaia he continued falling in with her playful mood can t you remember when we lived at the mill miss chester fell swiftly into serious meditation her large eyes were fixed vaguely upon something in the distance father abram was amused at her quick return to seriousness she sat thus for a long time before she spoke no she said at length with a long sigh i can t remember anything at all about a mill i don t think that i ever saw a flour mill in my life until i saw your funny little church and if i were your little girl i would remember it wouldn t i i m so sorry father abram so am i said father abram humouring her but if you cannot remember that you are my little girl miss rose surely you can recollect being some one else s you remember your own parents of course oh yes i remember them very well especially my father he wasn t a bit like you father abram oh i was only making believe come now you ve rested long enough you promised to show me the pool where you can see the trout playing this afternoon i never saw a trout late one afternoon father abram set out for the old mill alone he often went to sit and think of the old days when he lived in the cottage across the road time had smoothed away the sharpness of his grief until he no longer found the memory of those times painful but whenever abram strong sat in the melancholy september afternoons on the spot where dums used to run in every day with her yellow curls flying the smile that lakelands always saw upon his face was not there the miller made his way slowly up the winding steep road the trees crowded so close to the edge of it that he walked in their shade with his hat in his hand squirrels ran playfully upon the old rail fence at his right quails were calling to their young broods in the wheat stubble the low sun sent a torrent of pale gold up the ravine that opened to the west early september it was within a few days only of the anniversary of aglaia s disappearance the old overshot wheel half covered with mountain ivy caught patches of the warm sunlight filtering through the trees the cottage across the road was still standing but it would doubtless go down before the next winter s mountain blasts it was overrun with morning glory and wild gourd vines and the door hung by one hinge father abram pushed open the mill door and entered softly and then he stood still wondering he heard the sound of some one within weeping inconsolably he looked and saw miss chester sitting in a dim pew with her head bowed upon an open letter that her hands held father abram went to her and laid one of his strong hands firmly upon hers she looked up breathed his name and tried to speak further not yet miss rose said the miller kindly don t try to talk yet there s nothing as good for you as a nice quiet little cry when you are feeling blue it seemed that the old miller who had known so much sorrow himself was a magician in driving it away from others miss chester s sobs grew easier presently she took her little plain bordered handkerchief and wiped away a drop or two that had fallen from her eyes upon father abram s big hand then she looked up and smiled through her tears miss chester could always smile before her tears had dried just as father abram could smile through his own grief in that way the two were very much alike the miller asked her no questions but by and by miss chester began to tell him it was the old story that always seems so big and important to the young and that brings reminiscent smiles to their elders love was the theme as may be supposed there was a young man in atlanta full of all goodness and the graces who had discovered that miss chester also possessed these qualities above all other people in atlanta or anywhere else from greenland to patagonia she showed father abram the letter over which she had been weeping it was a manly tender letter a little superlative and urgent after the style of love letters written by young men full of goodness and the graces he proposed for miss chester s hand in marriage at once life he said since her departure for a three weeks visit was not to be endured he begged for an immediate answer and if it were favourable he promised to fly ignoring the narrow gauge railroad at once to lakelands and now where does the trouble come in asked the miller when he had read the letter i cannot marry him said miss chester do you want to marry him asked father abram oh i love him she answered but down went her head and she sobbed again come miss rose said the miller you can give me your confidence i do not question you but i think you can trust me i do trust you said the girl i will tell you why i must refuse ralph i am nobody i haven t even a name the name i call myself is a lie ralph is a noble man i love him with all my heart but i can never be his what talk is this said father abram you said that you remember your parents why do you say you have no name i do not understand i do remember them said miss chester i remember them too well my first recollections are of our life somewhere in the far south we moved many times to different towns and states i have picked cotton and worked in factories and have often gone without enough food and clothes my mother was sometimes good to me my father was always cruel and beat me i think they were both idle and unsettled one night when we were living in a little town on a river near atlanta they had a great quarrel it was while they were abusing and taunting each other that i learned oh father abram i learned that i didn t even have the right to be don t you understand i had no right even to a name i was nobody i ran away that night i walked to atlanta and found work i gave myself the name of rose chester and have earned my own living ever since now you know why i cannot marry ralph and oh i can never tell him why better than any sympathy more helpful than pity was father abram s depreciation of her woes why dear dear is that all he said fie fie i thought something was in the way if this perfect young man is a man at all he will not care a pinch of bran for your family tree dear miss rose take my word for it it is yourself he cares for tell him frankly just as you have told me and i ll warrant that he will laugh at your story and think all the more of you for it i shall never tell him said miss chester sadly and i shall never marry him nor any one else i have not the right but they saw a long shadow come bobbing up the sunlit road and then came a shorter one bobbing by its side and presently two strange figures approached the church the long shadow was made by miss phoebe summers the organist come to practise tommy teague aged twelve was responsible for the shorter shadow it was tommy s day to pump the organ for miss phoebe and his bare toes proudly spurned the dust of the road miss phoebe in her lilac spray chintz dress with her accurate little curls hanging over each ear courtesied low to father abram and shook her curls ceremoniously at miss chester then she and her assistant climbed the steep stairway to the organ loft in the gathering shadows below father abram and miss chester lingered they were silent and it is likely that they were busy with their memories miss chester sat leaning her head on her hand with her eyes fixed far away father abram stood in the next pew looking thoughtfully out of the door at the road and the ruined cottage suddenly the scene was transformed for him back almost a score of years into the past for as tommy pumped away miss phoebe struck a low bass note on the organ and held it to test the volume of air that it contained the church ceased to exist so far as father abram was concerned the deep booming vibration that shook the little frame building was no note from an organ but the humming of the mill machinery he felt sure that the old overshot wheel was turning that he was back again a dusty merry miller in the old mountain mill and now evening was come and soon would come aglaia with flying colours toddling across the road to take him home to supper father abram s eyes were fixed upon the broken door of the cottage and then came another wonder in the gallery overhead the sacks of flour were stacked in long rows perhaps a mouse had been at one of them anyway the jar of the deep organ note shook down between the cracks of the gallery floor a stream of flour covering father abram from head to foot with the white dust and then the old miller stepped into the aisle and waved his arms and began to sing the miller s song the wheel goes round the grist is ground the dusty miller s merry and then the rest of the miracle happened miss chester was leaning forward from her pew as pale as the flour itself her wide open eyes staring at father abram like one in a waking dream when he began the song she stretched out her arms to him her lips moved she called to him in dreamy tones da da come take dums home miss phoebe released the low key of the organ but her work had been well done the note that she struck had beaten down the doors of a closed memory and father abram held his lost aglaia close in his arms when you visit lakelands they will tell you more of this story they will tell you how the lines of it were afterward traced and the history of the miller s daughter revealed after the gipsy wanderers had stolen her on that september day attracted by her childish beauty but you should wait until you sit comfortably on the shaded porch of the eagle house and then you can have the story at your ease it seems best that our part of it should close while miss phoebe s deep bass note was yet reverberating softly and yet to my mind the finest thing of it all happened while father abram and his daughter were walking back to the eagle house in the long twilight almost too glad to speak father she said somewhat timidly and doubtfully have you a great deal of money a great deal said the miller well that depends there is plenty unless you want to buy the moon or something equally expensive would it cost very very much asked aglaia who had always counted her dimes so carefully to send a telegram to atlanta ah said father abram with a little sigh i see you want to ask ralph to come aglaia looked up at him with a tender smile i want to ask him to wait she said i have just found my father and i want it to be just we two for a while i want to tell him he will have to wait new york by camp fire light away out in the creek nation we learned things about new york we were on a hunting trip and were camped one night on the bank of a little stream bud kingsbury was our skilled hunter and guide and it was from his lips that we had explanations of manhattan and the queer folks that inhabit it bud had once spent a month in the metropolis and a week or two at other times and he was pleased to discourse to us of what he had seen fifty yards away from our camp was pitched the teepee of a wandering family of indians that had come up and settled there for the night an old old indian woman was trying to build a fire under an iron pot hung upon three sticks bud went over to her assistance and soon had her fire going when he came back we complimented him playfully upon his gallantry oh said bud don t mention it it s a way i have whenever i see a lady trying to cook things in a pot and having trouble i always go to the rescue i done the same thing once in a high toned house in new york city heap big society teepee on fifth avenue that injun lady kind of recalled it to my mind yes i endeavours to be polite and help the ladies out the camp demanded the particulars i was manager of the triangle b ranch in the panhandle said bud it was owned at that time by old man sterling of new york he wanted to sell out and he wrote for me to come on to new york and explain the ranch to the syndicate that wanted to buy so i sends to fort worth and has a forty dollar suit of clothes made and hits the trail for the big village well when i got there old man sterling and his outfit certainly laid themselves out to be agreeable we had business and pleasure so mixed up that you couldn t tell whether it was a treat or a trade half the time we had trolley rides and cigars and theatre round ups and rubber parties rubber parties said a listener inquiringly sure said bud didn t you never attend em you walk around and try to look at the tops of the skyscrapers well we sold the ranch and old man sterling asks me round to his house to take grub on the night before i started back it wasn t any high collared affair just me and the old man and his wife and daughter but they was a fine haired outfit all right and the lilies of the field wasn t in it they made my fort worth clothes carpenter look like a dealer in horse blankets and gee strings and then the table was all pompous with flowers and there was a whole kit of tools laid out beside everybody s plate you d have thought you was fixed out to burglarize a restaurant before you could get your grub but i d been in new york over a week then and i was getting on to stylish ways i kind of trailed behind and watched the others use the hardware supplies and then i tackled the chuck with the same weapons it ain t much trouble to travel with the high flyers after you find out their gait i got along fine i was feeling cool and agreeable and pretty soon i was talking away fluent as you please all about the ranch and the west and telling em how the indians eat grasshopper stew and snakes and you never saw people so interested but the real joy of that feast was that miss sterling just a little trick she was not bigger than two bits worth of chewing plug but she had a way about her that seemed to say she was the people and you believed it and yet she never put on any airs and she smiled at me the same as if i was a millionaire while i was telling about a creek dog feast and listened like it was news from home by and by after we had eat oysters and some watery soup and truck that never was in my repertory a methodist preacher brings in a kind of camp stove arrangement all silver on long legs with a lamp under it miss sterling lights up and begins to do some cooking right on the supper table i wondered why old man sterling didn t hire a cook with all the money he had pretty soon she dished out some cheesy tasting truck that she said was rabbit but i swear there had never been a molly cotton tail in a mile of it the last thing on the programme was lemonade it was brought around in little flat glass bowls and set by your plate i was pretty thirsty and i picked up mine and took a big swig of it right there was where the little lady had made a mistake she had put in the lemon all right but she d forgot the sugar the best housekeepers slip up sometimes i thought maybe miss sterling was just learning to keep house and cook that rabbit would surely make you think so and i says to myself little lady sugar or no sugar i ll stand by you and i raises up my bowl again and drinks the last drop of the lemonade and then all the balance of em picks up their bowls and does the same and then i gives miss sterling the laugh proper just to carry it off like a joke so she wouldn t feel bad about the mistake after we all went into the sitting room she sat down and talked to me quite awhile it was so kind of you mr kingsbury says she to bring my blunder off so nicely it was so stupid of me to forget the sugar never you mind says i some lucky man will throw his rope over a mighty elegant little housekeeper some day not far from here if you mean me mr kingsbury says she laughing out loud i hope he will be as lenient with my poor housekeeping as you have been don t mention it says i anything to oblige the ladies bud ceased his reminiscences and then some one asked him what he considered the most striking and prominent trait of new yorkers the most visible and peculiar trait of new york folks answered bud is new york most of em has new york on the brain they have heard of other places such as waco and paris and hot springs and london but they don t believe in em they think that town is all merino now to show you how much they care for their village i ll tell you about one of em that strayed out as far as the triangle b while i was working there this new yorker come out there looking for a job on the ranch he said he was a good horseback rider and there was pieces of tanbark hanging on his clothes yet from his riding school well for a while they put him to keeping books in the ranch store for he was a devil at figures but he got tired of that and asked for something more in the line of activity the boys on the ranch liked him all right but he made us tired shouting new york all the time every night he d tell us about east river and j p morgan and the eden musee and hetty green and central park till we used to throw tin plates and branding irons at him one day this chap gets on a pitching pony and the pony kind of sidled up his back and went to eating grass while the new yorker was coming down he come down on his head on a chunk of mesquit wood and he didn t show any designs toward getting up again we laid him out in a tent and he begun to look pretty dead so gideon pease saddles up and burns the wind for old doc sleeper s residence in dogtown thirty miles away the doctor comes over and he investigates the patient boys says he you might as well go to playing seven up for his saddle and clothes for his head s fractured and if he lives ten minutes it will be a remarkable case of longevity of course we didn t gamble for the poor rooster s saddle that was one of doc s jokes but we stood around feeling solemn and all of us forgive him for having talked us to death about new york i never saw anybody about to hand in his checks act more peaceful than this fellow his eyes were fixed way up in the air and he was using rambling words to himself all about sweet music and beautiful streets and white robed forms and he was smiling like dying was a pleasure he s about gone now said doc whenever they begin to think they see heaven it s all off blamed if that new york man didn t sit right up when he heard the doc say that say says he kind of disappointed was that heaven confound it all i thought it was broadway some of you fellows get my clothes i m going to get up and i ll be blamed concluded bud if he wasn t on the train with a ticket for new york in his pocket four days afterward the adventures of shamrock jolnes i am so fortunate as to count shamrock jolnes the great new york detective among my muster of friends jolnes is what is called the inside man of the city detective force he is an expert in the use of the typewriter and it is his duty whenever there is a murder mystery to be solved to sit at a desk telephone at headquarters and take down the messages of cranks who phone in their confessions to having committed the crime but on certain off days when confessions are coming in slowly and three or four newspapers have run to earth as many different guilty persons jolnes will knock about the town with me exhibiting to my great delight and instruction his marvellous powers of observation and deduction the other day i dropped in at headquarters and found the great detective gazing thoughtfully at a string that was tied tightly around his little finger good morning whatsup he said without turning his head i m glad to notice that you ve had your house fitted up with electric lights at last will you please tell me i said in surprise how you knew that i am sure that i never mentioned the fact to any one and the wiring was a rush order not completed until this morning nothing easier said jolnes genially as you came in i caught the odour of the cigar you are smoking i know an expensive cigar and i know that not more than three men in new york can afford to smoke cigars and pay gas bills too at the present time that was an easy one but i am working just now on a little problem of my own why have you that string on your finger i asked that s the problem said jolnes my wife tied that on this morning to remind me of something i was to send up to the house sit down whatsup and excuse me for a few moments the distinguished detective went to a wall telephone and stood with the receiver to his ear for probably ten minutes were you listening to a confession i asked when he had returned to his chair perhaps said jolnes with a smile it might be called something of the sort to be frank with you whatsup i ve cut out the dope i ve been increasing the quantity for so long that morphine doesn t have much effect on me any more i ve got to have something more powerful that telephone i just went to is connected with a room in the waldorf where there s an author s reading in progress now to get at the solution of this string after five minutes of silent pondering jolnes looked at me with a smile and nodded his head wonderful man i exclaimed already it is quite simple he said holding up his finger you see that knot that is to prevent my forgetting it is therefore a forget me knot a forget me not is a flower it was a sack of flour that i was to send home beautiful i could not help crying out in admiration suppose we go out for a ramble suggested jolnes there is only one case of importance on hand just now old man mccarty one hundred and four years old died from eating too many bananas the evidence points so strongly to the mafia that the police have surrounded the second avenue katzenjammer gambrinus club no and the capture of the assassin is only the matter of a few hours the detective force has not yet been called on for assistance jolnes and i went out and up the street toward the corner where we were to catch a surface car half way up the block we met rheingelder an acquaintance of ours who held a city hall position good morning rheingelder said jolnes halting nice breakfast that was you had this morning always on the lookout for the detective s remarkable feats of deduction i saw jolnes s eye flash for an instant upon a long yellow splash on the shirt bosom and a smaller one upon the chin of rheingelder both undoubtedly made by the yolk of an egg oh dot is some of your detectiveness said rheingelder shaking all over with a smile vell i pet you trinks und cigars all round dot you cannot tell vot i haf eaten for breakfast done said jolnes sausage pumpernickel and coffee rheingelder admitted the correctness of the surmise and paid the bet when we had proceeded on our way i said to jolnes i thought you looked at the egg spilled on his chin and shirt front i did said jolnes that is where i began my deduction rheingelder is a very economical saving man yesterday eggs dropped in the market to twenty eight cents per dozen to day they are quoted at forty two rheingelder ate eggs yesterday and to day he went back to his usual fare a little thing like this isn t anything whatsup it belongs to the primary arithmetic class when we boarded the

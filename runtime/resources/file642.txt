pulmonary gasoline runabout to see the many buildings and rows of buildings that he owned in the city for alexander was sole heir they had amused blinker very much the houses looked so incapable of producing the big sums of money that lawyer oldport kept pilling up in banks for him to spend in the evening blinker went to one of his clubs intending to dine nobody was there except some old fogies playing whist who spoke to him with grave politeness and glared at him with savage contempt everybody was out of town but here he was kept in like a schoolboy to write his name over and over on pieces of paper his wounds were deep blinker turned his back on the fogies and said to the club steward who had come forward with some nonsense about cold fresh salmon roe symons i m going to coney island he said it as one might say all s off i m going to jump into the river the joke pleased symons he laughed within a sixteenth of a note of the audibility permitted by the laws governing employees certainly sir he tittered of course sir i think i can see you at coney mr blinker blinker got a pager and looked up the movements of sunday steamboats then he found a cab at the first corner and drove to a north river pier he stood in line as democratic as you or i and bought a ticket and was trampled upon and shoved forward until at last he found himself on the upper deck of the boat staring brazenly at a girl who sat alone upon a camp stool but blinker did not intend to be brazen the girl was so wonderfully good looking that he forgot for one minute that he was the prince incog and behaved just as he did in society she was looking at him too and not severely a puff of wind threatened blinker s straw hat he caught it warily and settled it again the movement gave the effect of a bow the girl nodded and smiled and in another instant he was seated at her side she was dressed all in white she was paler than blinker imagined milkmaids and girls of humble stations to be but she was as tidy as a cherry blossom and her steady supremely frank gray eyes looked out from the intrepid depths of an unshadowed and untroubled soul how dare you raise your hat to me she asked with a smile redeemed severity i didn t blinker said but he quickly covered the mistake by extending it to i didn t know how to keep from it after i saw you i do not allow gentlemen to sit by me to whom i have not been introduced she said with a sudden haughtiness that deceived him he rose reluctantly but her clear teasing laugh brought him down to his chair again i guess you weren t going far she declared with beauty s magnificent self confidence are you going to coney island asked blinker me she turned upon him wide open eyes full of bantering surprise why what a question can t you see that i m riding a bicycle in the park her drollery took the form of impertinence and i am laying brick on a tall factory chimney said blinker mayn t we see coney together i m all alone and i ve never been there before it depends said the girl on how nicely you behave i ll consider your application until we get there blinker took pains to provide against the rejection of his application he strove to please to adopt the metaphor of his nonsensical phrase he laid brick upon brick on the tall chimney of his devoirs until at length the structure was stable and complete the manners of the best society come around finally to simplicity and as the girl s way was that naturally they were on a mutual plane of communication from the beginning he learned that she was twenty and her name was florence that she trimmed hats in a millinery shop that she lived in a furnished room with her best chum elia who was cashier in a shoe store and that a glass of milk from the bottle on the window sill and an egg that boils itself while you twist up your hair makes a breakfast good enough for any one florence laughed when she heard blinker well she said it certainly slows that you have imagination it gives the smiths a chance for a little rest anyhow they landed at coney and were dashed on the crest of a great human wave of mad pleasure seekers into the walks and avenues of fairyland gone into vaudeville

bumped him sticky children tumbled howling under his feet candying his clothes insolent youths strolling among the booths with hard won canes under one arm and easily won girls on the other blew defiant smoke from cheap cigars into his face the publicity gentlemen with megaphones each before his own stupendous attraction roared like niagara in his ears music of all kinds that could be tortured from brass reed hide or string fought in the air to grain space for its vibrations against its competitors but what held blinker in awful fascination was the mob the multitude the proletariat

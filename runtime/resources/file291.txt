the other he grasped tightly something flat and round with a shining milled edge the scene presented a field of operations commensurate to chicken s talents and daring after sweeping the horizon to make sure that no official tug was cruising near he insidiously accosted his prey the boy having been early taught by his household to regard altruistic advances with extreme suspicion received the overtures coldly then chicken knew that he must make one of those desperate nerve shattering plunges into speculation that fortune sometimes requires of those who would win her favour five cents was his capital and this he must risk against the chance of winning what lay within the close grasp of the youngster s chubby hand it was a fearful lottery chicken knew but he must accomplish his end by strategy since he had a wholesome terror of plundering infants by force once in a park driven by hunger he had committed an onslaught upon a bottle of peptonized infant s food in the possession of an occupant of a baby carriage the outraged infant had so promptly opened its mouth and pressed the button that communicated with the welkin that help arrived and chicken did his thirty days in a snug coop wherefore he was as he said leary of kids beginning artfully to question the boy concerning his choice of sweets he gradually drew out the information he wanted mamma said he was to ask the drug store man for ten cents worth of paregoric in the bottle he was to keep his hand shut tight over the dollar he must not stop to talk to anyone in the street he must ask the drug store man to wrap up the change and put it in the pocket of his trousers indeed they had pockets two of them and he liked chocolate creams best chicken went into the store and turned plunger he invested his entire capital in c a n d y stocks simply to pave the way to the greater risk following he gave the sweets to the youngster and had the satisfaction of perceiving that confidence was established after that it was easy to obtain leadership of the expedition to take the investment by the hand and lead it to a nice drug store he knew of in the same block there chicken with a parental air passed over the dollar and called for the medicine while the boy crunched his candy glad to be relieved of the responsibility of the purchase and then the successful investor searching his pockets found an overcoat button the extent of his winter trousseau and wrapping it carefully placed the ostensible change in the pocket of confiding juvenility setting the youngster s face homeward and patting him benevolently on the back for chicken s heart was as soft as those of his feathered namesakes the speculator quit the market with a profit of per cent on his invested capital two hours later an iron mountain freight engine pulled out of the railroad yards texas bound with a string of empties in one of the cattle cars half buried in excelsior chicken lay at ease beside him in his nest was a quart bottle of very poor whisky and a paper bag of bread and cheese mr ruggles in his private car was on his trip south for the winter season for a week that car was trundled southward shifted laid over and manipulated after the manner of rolling stock but chicken stuck to it leaving it only at necessary times to satisfy his hunger and thirst he knew it must go down to the cattle country and san antonio in the heart of it was his goal there the air was salubrious and mild the people indulgent and long suffering the bartenders there would not kick him if he should eat too long or too often at one place they would swear at him as if by rote and without heat they swore so drawlingly and they rarely paused short of their full vocabulary which was copious so that chicken had often gulped a good meal during the process of the vituperative prohibition the season there was always spring like the plazas were pleasant at night with music and gaiety except during the slight and infrequent cold snaps one could sleep comfortably out of doors in case the interiors should develop inhospitability at texarkana his car was switched to the i and g n then still southward it trailed until at length it crawled across the colorado bridge at austin and lined out straight as an arrow for the run to san antonio when the freight halted at that town chicken was fast asleep in ten minutes the train was off again for laredo the end of the road those empty cattle cars were for distribution along the line at points from which the ranches shipped their stock when chicken awoke his car was stationary looking out between the slats he saw it was a bright moonlit night scrambling out he saw his car with three others abandoned on a little siding in a wild and lonesome country a cattle pen and chute stood on one side of the track the railroad bisected a vast dim ocean of prairie in the midst of which chicken with his futile rolling stock was as completely stranded as was robinson with his land locked boat a white post stood near the rails going up to it chicken read the letters at the top s a laredo was nearly as far to the south he was almost a hundred miles from any town coyotes began to yelp in the mysterious sea around him chicken felt lonesome he had lived in boston without an education in chicago without nerve in philadelphia without a sleeping place in new york without a pull and in pittsburg sober and yet he had never felt so lonely as now suddenly through the intense silence he heard the whicker of a horse the sound came from the side of the track toward the east and chicken began to explore timorously in that direction he stepped high along the mat of curly mesquit grass for he was afraid of everything there might be in this wilderness snakes rats brigands centipedes mirages cowboys fandangoes tarantulas tamales he had read of them in the story papers rounding a clump of prickly pear that reared high its fantastic and menacing array of rounded heads he was struck to shivering terror by a snort and a thunderous plunge as the horse himself startled bounded away some fifty yards and then resumed his grazing but here was the one thing in the desert that chicken did not fear he had been reared on a farm he had handled horses understood them and could ride approaching slowly and speaking soothingly he followed the animal which after its first flight seemed gentle enough and secured the end of the twenty foot lariat that dragged after him in the grass it required him but a few moments to contrive the rope into an ingenious nose bridle after the style of the mexican borsal in another he was upon the horse s back and off at a splendid lope giving the animal free choice of direction he will take me somewhere said chicken to himself it would have been a thing of joy that untrammelled gallop over the moonlit prairie even to chicken who loathed exertion but that his mood was not for it his head ached a growing thirst was upon him the somewhere whither his lucky mount might convey him was full of dismal peradventure and now he noted that the horse moved to a definite goal where the prairie lay smooth he kept his course straight as an arrow s toward the east deflected by hill or arroyo or impractical spinous brakes he quickly flowed again into the current charted by his unerring instinct at last upon the side of a gentle rise he suddenly subsided to a complacent walk a stone s cast away stood a little mott of coma trees beneath it a jacal such as the mexicans erect a one room house of upright poles daubed with clay and roofed with grass or tule reeds an experienced eye would have estimated the spot as the headquarters of a small sheep ranch in the moonlight the ground in the nearby corral showed pulverized to a level smoothness by the hoofs of the sheep everywhere was carelessly distributed the paraphernalia of the place ropes bridles saddles sheep pelts wool sacks feed troughs and camp litter the barrel of drinking water stood in the end of the two horse wagon near the door the harness was piled promiscuous upon the wagon tongue soaking up the dew chicken slipped to earth and tied the horse to a tree he halloed again and again but the house remained quiet the door stood open and he entered cautiously the light was sufficient for him to see that no one was at home the room was that of a bachelor ranchman who was content with the necessaries of life chicken rummaged intelligently until he found what he had hardly dared hope for a small brown jug that still contained something near a quart of his desire half an hour later chicken now a gamecock of hostile aspect emerged from the house with unsteady steps he had drawn upon the absent ranchman s equipment to replace his own ragged attire he wore a suit of coarse brown ducking the coat being a sort of rakish bolero jaunty to a degree boots he had donned and spurs that whirred with every lurching step buckled around him was a belt full of cartridges with a big six shooter in each of its two holsters prowling about he found blankets a saddle and bridle with which he caparisoned his steed again mounting he rode swiftly away singing a loud and tuneless song bud king s band of desperadoes outlaws and horse and cattle thieves were in camp at a secluded spot on the bank of the frio their depredations in the rio grande country while no bolder than usual had been advertised more extensively and captain kinney s company of rangers had been ordered down to look after them consequently bud king who was a wise general instead of cutting out a hot trail for the upholders of the law as his men wished to do retired for the time to the prickly fastnesses of the frio valley though the move was a prudent one and not incompatible with bud s well known courage it raised dissension among the members of the band in fact while they thus lay ingloriously perdu in the brush the question of bud king s fitness for the leadership was argued with closed doors as it were by his followers never before had bud s skill or efficiency been brought to criticism but his glory was wandering and such is glory s fate in the light of a newer star the sentiment of the band was crystallizing into the opinion that black eagle could lead them with more lustre profit and distinction this black eagle sub titled the terror of the border had been a member of the gang about three months one night while they were in camp on the san miguel water hole a solitary horseman on the regulation fiery steed dashed in among them the newcomer was of a portentous and devastating aspect a beak like nose with a predatory curve projected above a mass of bristling blue black whiskers his eye was cavernous and fierce he was spurred sombreroed booted garnished with revolvers abundantly drunk and very much unafraid few people in the country drained by the rio bravo would have cared thus to invade alone the camp of bud king but this fell bird swooped fearlessly upon them and demanded to be fed hospitality in the prairie country is not limited even if your enemy pass your way you must feed him before you shoot him you must empty your larder into him before you empty your lead so the stranger of undeclared intentions was set down to a mighty feast a talkative bird he was full of most marvellous loud tales and exploits and speaking a language at times obscure but never colourless he was a new sensation to bud king s men who rarely encountered new types they hung delighted upon his vainglorious boasting the spicy strangeness of his lingo his contemptuous familiarity with life the world and remote places and the extravagant frankness with which he conveyed his sentiments to their guest the band of outlaws seemed to be nothing more than a congregation of country bumpkins whom he was stringing for grub just as he would have told his stories at the back door of a farmhouse to wheedle a meal and indeed his ignorance was not without excuse for the bad man of the southwest does not run to extremes those brigands might justly have been taken for a little party of peaceable rustics assembled for a fish fry or pecan gathering gentle of manner slouching of gait soft voiced unpicturesquely clothed not one of them presented to the eye any witness of the desperate records they had earned for two days the glittering stranger within the camp was feasted then by common consent he was invited to become a member of the band he consented presenting for enrollment the prodigious name of captain montressor this name was immediately overruled by the band and piggy substituted as a compliment to the awful and insatiate appetite of its owner thus did the texas border receive the most spectacular brigand that ever rode its chaparral for the next three months bud king conducted business as usual escaping encounters with law officers and being content with reasonable profits the band ran off some very good companies of horses from the ranges and a few bunches of fine cattle which they got safely across the rio grande and disposed of to fair advantage often the band would ride into the little villages and mexican settlements terrorizing the inhabitants and plundering for the provisions and ammunition they needed it was during these bloodless raids that piggy s ferocious aspect and frightful voice gained him a renown more widespread and glorious than those other gentle voiced and sad faced desperadoes could have acquired in a lifetime the mexicans most apt in nomenclature first called him the black eagle and used to frighten the babes by threatening them with tales of the dreadful robber who carried off little children in his great beak soon the name extended and black eagle the terror of the border became a recognized factor in exaggerated newspaper reports and ranch gossip the country from the nueces to the rio grande was a wild but fertile stretch given over to the sheep and cattle ranches range was free the inhabitants were few the law was mainly a letter and the pirates met with little opposition until the flaunting and garish piggy gave the band undue advertisement then mckinney s ranger company headed for those precincts and bud king knew that it meant grim and sudden war or else temporary retirement regarding the risk to be unnecessary he drew off his band to an almost inaccessible spot on the bank of the frio wherefore as has been said dissatisfaction arose among the members and impeachment proceedings against bud were premeditated with black eagle in high favour for the succession bud king was not unaware of the sentiment and he called aside cactus taylor his trusted lieutenant to discuss it if the boys said bud ain t satisfied with me i m willing to step out they re buckin against my way of handlin em and specially because i concludes to hit the brush while sam kinney is ridin the line i saves em from bein shot or sent up on a state contract and they up and says i m no good it ain t so much that explained cactus as it is they re plum locoed about piggy they want them whiskers and that nose of his to split the wind at the head of the column there s somethin mighty seldom about piggy declared bud musingly i never yet see anything on the hoof that he exactly grades up with he can shore holler a plenty and he straddles a hoss from where you laid the chunk but he ain t never been smoked yet you know cactus we ain t had a row since he s been with us piggy s all right for skearin the greaser kids and layin waste a cross roads store i reckon he s the finest canned oyster buccaneer and cheese pirate that ever was but how s his appetite for fightin i ve knowed some citizens you d think was starvin for trouble get a bad case of dyspepsy the first dose of lead they had to take he talks all spraddled out said cactus bout the rookuses he s been in he claims to have saw the elephant and hearn the owl i know replied bud using the cowpuncher s expressive phrase of skepticism but it sounds to me this conversation was held one night in camp while the other members of the band eight in number were sprawling around the fire lingering over their supper when bud and cactus ceased talking they heard piggy s formidable voice holding forth to the others as usual while he was engaged in checking though never satisfying his ravening appetite wat s de use he was saying of chasin little red cowses and hosses round for t ousands of miles dere ain t nuttin in it gallopin t rough dese bushes and briers and gettin a t irst dat a brewery couldn t put out and missin meals say you know what i d do if i was main finger of dis bunch i d stick up a train i d blow de express car and make hard dollars where you guys get wind youse makes me tired dis sook cow kind of cheap sport gives me a pain later on a deputation waited on bud they stood on one leg chewed mesquit twigs and circumlocuted for they hated to hurt his feelings bud foresaw their business and made it easy for them bigger risks and larger profits was what they wanted the suggestion of piggy s about holding up a train had fired their imagination and increased their admiration for the dash and boldness of the instigator they were such simple artless and custom bound bush rangers that they had never before thought of extending their habits beyond the running off of live stock and the shooting of such of their acquaintances as ventured to interfere bud acted on the level agreeing to take a subordinate place in the gang until black eagle should have been given a trial as leader after a great deal of consultation studying of time tables and discussion of the country s topography the time and place for carrying out their new enterprise was decided upon at that time there was a feedstuff famine in mexico and a cattle famine in certain parts of the united states and there was a brisk international trade much money was being shipped along the railroads that connected the two republics it was agreed that the most promising place for the contemplated robbery was at espina a little station on the i and g n about forty miles north of laredo the train stopped there one minute the country around was wild and unsettled the station consisted of but one house in which the agent lived black eagle s band set out riding by night arriving in the vicinity of espina they rested their horses all day in a thicket a few miles distant the train was due at espina at p m they could rob the train and be well over the mexican border with their booty by daylight the next morning to do black eagle justice he exhibited no signs of flinching from the responsible honours that had been conferred upon him he assigned his men to their respective posts with discretion and coached them carefully as to their duties on each side of the track four of the band were to lie concealed in the chaparral gotch ear rodgers was to stick up the station agent bronco charlie was to remain with the horses holding them in readiness at a spot where it was calculated the engine would be when the train stopped bud king was to lie hidden on one side and black eagle himself on the other the two would get the drop on the engineer and fireman force them to descend and proceed to the rear then the express car would be looted and the escape made no one was to move until black eagle gave the signal by firing his revolver the plan was perfect at ten minutes to train time every man was at his post effectually concealed by the thick chaparral that grew almost to the rails the night was dark and lowering with a fine drizzle falling from the flying gulf clouds black eagle crouched behind a bush within five yards of the track two six shooters were belted around him occasionally he drew a large black bottle from his pocket and raised it to his mouth a star appeared far down the track which soon waxed into the headlight of the approaching train it came on with an increasing roar the engine bore down upon the ambushing desperadoes with a glare and a shriek like some avenging monster come to deliver them to justice black eagle flattened himself upon the ground the engine contrary to their calculations instead of stopping between him and bud king s place of concealment passed fully forty years farther before it came to a stand the bandit leader rose to his feet and peered through the bush his men all lay quiet awaiting the signal immediately opposite black eagle was a thing that drew his attention instead of being a regular passenger train it was a mixed one before him stood a box car the door of which by some means had been left slightly open black eagle went up to it and pushed the door farther open an odour came forth a damp rancid familiar musty intoxicating beloved odour stirring strongly at old memories of happy days and travels black eagle sniffed at the witching smell as the returned wanderer smells of the rose that twines his boyhood s cottage home nostalgia seized him he put his hand inside excelsior dry springy curly soft enticing covered the floor outside the drizzle had turned to a chilling rain the train bell clanged the bandit chief unbuckled his belt and cast it with its revolvers upon the ground his spurs followed quickly and his broad sombrero black eagle was moulting the train started with a rattling jerk the ex terror of the border scrambled into the box car and closed the door stretched luxuriously upon the excelsior with the black bottle clasped closely to his breast his eyes closed and a foolish happy smile upon his terrible features chicken ruggles started upon his return trip undisturbed with the band of desperate bandits lying motionless awaiting the signal to attack the train pulled out from espina as its speed increased and the black masses of chaparral went whizzing past on either side the express messenger lighting his pipe looked through his window and remarked feelingly what a jim dandy place for a hold up a retrieved reformation a guard came to the prison shoe shop where jimmy valentine was assiduously stitching uppers and escorted him to the front office there the warden handed jimmy his pardon which had been signed that morning by the governor jimmy took it in a tired kind of way he had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence he had expected to stay only about three months at the longest when a man with as many friends on the outside as jimmy valentine had is received in the stir it is hardly worth while to cut his hair now valentine said the warden you ll go out in the morning brace up and make a man of yourself you re not a bad fellow at heart stop cracking safes and live straight me said jimmy in surprise why i never cracked a safe in my life oh no laughed the warden of course not let s see now how was it you happened to get sent up on that springfield job was it because you wouldn t prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high toned society or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you it s always one or the other with you innocent victims me said jimmy still blankly virtuous why warden i never was in springfield in my life take him back cronin said the warden and fix him up with outgoing clothes unlock him at seven in the morning and let him come to the bull pen better think over my advice valentine at a quarter past seven on the next morning jimmy stood in the warden s outer office he had on a suit of the villainously fitting ready made clothes and a pair of the stiff squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests the clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity the warden gave him a cigar and shook hands valentine was chronicled on the books pardoned by governor and mr james valentine walked out into the sunshine disregarding the song of the birds the waving green trees and the smell of the flowers jimmy headed straight for a restaurant there he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him from there he proceeded leisurely to the depot he tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door and boarded his train three hours set him down in a little town near the state line he went to the cafe of one mike dolan and shook hands with mike who was alone behind the bar sorry we couldn t make it sooner jimmy me boy said mike but we had that protest from springfield to buck against and the governor nearly balked feeling all right fine said jimmy got my key he got his key and went upstairs unlocking the door of a room at the rear everything was just as he had left it there on the floor was still ben price s collar button that had been torn from that eminent detective s shirt band when they had overpowered jimmy to arrest him pulling out from the wall a folding bed jimmy slid back a panel in the wall and dragged out a dust covered suit case he opened this and gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar s tools in the east it was a complete set made of specially tempered steel the latest designs in drills punches braces and bits jimmies clamps and augers with two or three novelties invented by jimmy himself in which he took pride over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at a place where they make such things for the profession in half an hour jimmy went down stairs and through the cafe he was now dressed in tasteful and well fitting clothes and carried his dusted and cleaned suit case in his hand got anything on asked mike dolan genially me said jimmy in a puzzled tone i don t understand i m representing the new york amalgamated short snap biscuit cracker and frazzled wheat company this statement delighted mike to such an extent that jimmy had to take a seltzer and milk on the spot he never touched hard drinks a week after the release of valentine there was a neat job of safe burglary done in richmond indiana with no clue to the author a scant eight hundred dollars was all that was secured two weeks after that a patented improved burglar proof safe in logansport was opened like a cheese to the tune of fifteen hundred dollars currency securities and silver untouched that began to interest the rogue catchers then an old fashioned bank safe in jefferson city became active and threw out of its crater an eruption of bank notes amounting to five thousand dollars the losses were now high enough to bring the matter up into ben price s class of work by comparing notes a remarkable similarity in the methods of the burglaries was noticed ben price investigated the scenes of the robberies and was heard to remark that s dandy jim valentine s autograph he s resumed business look at that combination knob jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in wet weather he s got the only clamps that can do it and look how clean those tumblers were punched out jimmy never has to drill but one hole yes i guess i want mr valentine he ll do his bit next time without any short time or clemency foolishness ben price knew jimmy s habits he had learned them while working on the springfield case long jumps quick get aways no confederates and a taste for good society these ways had helped mr valentine to become noted as a successful dodger of retribution it was given out that ben price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman and other people with burglar proof safes felt more at ease one afternoon jimmy valentine and his suit case climbed out of the mail hack in elmore a little town five miles off the railroad down in the black jack country of arkansas jimmy looking like an athletic young senior just home from college went down the board side walk toward the hotel a young lady crossed the street passed him at the corner and entered a door over which was the sign the elmore bank jimmy valentine looked into her eyes forgot what he was and became another man she lowered her eyes and coloured slightly young men of jimmy s style and looks were scarce in elmore jimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if he were one of the stockholders and began to ask him questions about the town feeding him dimes at intervals by and by the young lady came out looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suit case and went her way isn that young lady polly simpson asked jimmy with specious guile naw said the boy she s annabel adams her pa owns this bank why d you come to elmore for is that a gold watch chain i m going to get a bulldog got any more dimes jimmy went to the planters hotel registered as ralph d spencer and engaged a room he leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the clerk he said he had come to elmore to look for a location to go into business how was the shoe business now in the town he had thought of the shoe business was there an opening the clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of jimmy he himself was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded youth of elmore but he now perceived his shortcomings while trying to figure out jimmy s manner of tying his four in hand he cordially gave information yes there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line there wasn t an exclusive shoe store in the place the dry goods and general stores handled them business in all lines was fairly good hoped mr spencer would decide to locate in elmore he would find it a pleasant town to live in and the people very sociable mr spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look over the situation no the clerk needn t call the boy he would carry up his suit case himself it was rather heavy mr ralph spencer the phoenix that arose from jimmy valentine s ashes ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love remained in elmore and prospered he opened a shoe store and secured a good run of trade socially he was also a success and made many friends and he accomplished the wish of his heart he met miss annabel adams and became more and more captivated by her charms at the end of a year the situation of mr ralph spencer was this he had won the respect of the community his shoe store was flourishing and he and annabel were engaged to be married in two weeks mr adams the typical plodding country banker approved of spencer annabel s pride in him almost equalled her affection he was as much at home in the family of mr adams and that of annabel s married sister as if he were already a member one day jimmy sat down in his room and wrote this letter which he mailed to the safe address of one of his old friends in st louis dear old pal i want you to be at sullivan s place in little rock next wednesday night at nine o clock i want you to wind up some little matters for me and also i want to make you a present of my kit of tools i

world be sure to be at sully s for i must see you i ll bring along the tools with me your old friend jimmy on the monday night after jimmy wrote this letter ben price jogged unobtrusively into elmore in a livery buggy he lounged about town in his quiet way until he found out what he wanted to know from the drug store across the street from spencer s shoe store he got a good look at ralph d spencer going to marry the banker s daughter are you jimmy said ben to himself softly well i don t know the next morning jimmy took breakfast at the adamses he was going to little rock that day to order his wedding suit and buy something nice for annabel that would be the first time he had left town since he came to elmore it had been more than a year now since those last professional jobs and he thought he could safely venture out after breakfast quite a family party went downtown together mr adams annabel jimmy and annabel s married sister with her two little girls aged five and nine they came by the hotel where jimmy still boarded and he ran up to his room and brought along his suit case then they went on to the bank there stood jimmy s horse and buggy and dolph gibson who was going to drive him over to the railroad station all went inside the high carved oak railings into the banking room jimmy included for mr adams s future son in law was welcome anywhere the clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good looking agreeable young man who was going to marry miss annabel jimmy set his suit case down annabel whose heart was bubbling with happiness and lively youth put on jimmy s hat and picked up the suit case wouldn t i make a nice drummer said annabel my ralph how heavy it is feels like it was full of gold bricks lot of nickel plated shoe horns in there said jimmy coolly that i m going to return thought i d save express charges by taking them up i m getting awfully economical the elmore bank had just put in a new safe and vault mr adams was very proud of it and insisted on an inspection by every one the vault was a small one but it had a new patented door it fastened with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single handle and had a time lock mr adams beamingly explained its workings to mr spencer who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest the two children may and agatha were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs while they were thus engaged ben price sauntered in and leaned on his elbow looking casually inside between the railings he told the teller that he didn t want anything he was just waiting for a man he knew suddenly there was a scream or two from the women and a commotion unperceived by the elders may the nine year old girl in a spirit of play had shut agatha in the vault she had then shot the bolts and turned the knob of the combination as she had seen mr adams do the old banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment the door can t be opened he groaned the clock hasn t been wound nor the combination set agatha s mother screamed again hysterically hush said mr adams raising his trembling hand all be quite for a moment agatha he called as loudly as he could listen to me during the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror my precious darling wailed the mother she will die of fright open the door oh break it open can t you men do something there isn t a man nearer than little rock who can open that door said mr adams in a shaky voice my god spencer what shall we do that child she can t stand it long in there there isn t enough air and besides she ll go into convulsions from fright agatha s mother frantic now beat the door of the vault with her hands somebody wildly suggested dynamite annabel turned to jimmy her large eyes full of anguish but not yet despairing to a woman nothing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she worships can t you do something ralph try won t you he looked at her with a queer soft smile on his lips and in his keen eyes annabel he said give me that rose you are wearing will you hardly believing that she heard him aright she unpinned the bud from the bosom of her dress and placed it in his hand jimmy stuffed it into his vest pocket threw off his coat and pulled up his shirt sleeves with that act ralph d spencer passed away and jimmy valentine took his place get away from the door all of you he commanded shortly he set his suit case on the table and opened it out flat from that time on he seemed to be unconscious of the presence of any one else he laid out the shining queer implements swiftly and orderly whistling softly to himself as he always did when at work in a deep silence and immovable the others watched him as if under a spell in a minute jimmy s pet drill was biting smoothly into the steel door in ten minutes breaking his own burglarious record he threw back the bolts and opened the door agatha almost collapsed but safe was gathered into her mother s arms jimmy valentine put on his coat and walked outside the railings towards the front door as he went he thought he heard a far away voice that he once knew call ralph but he never hesitated at the door a big man stood somewhat in his way hello ben said jimmy still with his strange smile got around at last have you well let s go i don t know that it makes much difference now and then ben price acted rather strangely guess you re mistaken mr spencer he said don t believe i recognize you your buggy s waiting for you ain t it and ben price turned and strolled down the street cherchez la femme robbins reporter for the picayune and dumars of l abeille the old french newspaper that has buzzed for nearly a century were good friends well proven by years of ups and downs together they were seated where they had a habit of meeting in the little creole haunted cafe of madame tibault in dumaine street if you know the place you will experience a thrill of pleasure in recalling it to mind it is small and dark with six little polished tables at which you may sit and drink the best coffee in new orleans and concoctions of absinthe equal to sazerac s best madame tibault fat and indulgent presides at the desk and takes your money nicolette and meme madame s nieces in charming bib aprons bring the desirable beverages dumars with true creole luxury was sipping his absinthe with half closed eyes in a whirl of cigarette smoke robbins was looking over the morning pic detecting as young reporters will the gross blunders in the make up and the envious blue pencilling his own stuff had received this item in the advertising columns caught his eye and with an exclamation of sudden interest he read it aloud to his friend public auction at three o clock this afternoon there will be sold to the highest bidder all the common property of the little sisters of samaria at the home of the sisterhood in bonhomme street the sale will dispose of the building ground and the complete furnishings of the house and chapel without reserve this notice stirred the two friends to a reminiscent talk concerning an episode in their journalistic career that had occurred about two years before they recalled the incidents went over the old theories and discussed it anew from the different perspective time had brought there were no other customers in the cafe madame s fine ear had caught the line of their talk and she came over to their table for had it not been her lost money her vanished twenty thousand dollars that had set the whole matter going the three took up the long abandoned mystery threshing over the old dry chaff of it it was in the chapel of this house of the little sisters of samaria that robbins and dumars had stood during that eager fruitless news search of theirs and looked upon the gilded statue of the virgin thass so boys said madame summing up thass ver wicked man m sieur morin everybody shall be cert he steal those money i plaze in his hand for keep safe yes he s boun spend that money somehow madame turned a broad and contemplative smile upon dumars i ond stand you m sieur dumars those day

before he shall die he is like one saint you might s well m sieur dumars go try find those money in the statue of virgin mary that m sieur morin present at those p tite soeurs as try find one femme at madame tibault s last words robbins started slightly and cast a keen sidelong glance at dumars the creole sat unmoved dreamily watching the spirals of his cigarette smoke it was then nine o clock in the morning and a few minutes later the two friends separated going different ways to their day s duties and now follows the brief story of madame tibault s vanished thousands new orleans will readily recall to mind the circumstances attendant upon the death of mr gaspard morin in that city mr morin was an artistic goldsmith and jeweller in the old french quarter and a man held in the highest esteem he belonged to one of the oldest french families and was of some distinction as an antiquary and historian he was a bachelor about fifty years of age he lived in quiet comfort at one of those rare old hostelries in royal street he was found in his rooms one morning dead from unknown causes when his affairs came to be looked into it was found that he was practically insolvent his stock of goods and personal property barely but nearly enough to free him from censure covering his liabilities following came the disclosure that he had been entrusted with the sum of twenty thousand dollars by a former upper servant in the morin family one madame tibault which she had received as a legacy from relatives in france the most searching scrutiny by friends and the legal authorities failed to reveal the disposition of the money it had vanished and left no trace some weeks before his death mr morin had drawn the entire amount in gold coin from the bank where it had been placed while he looked about he told madame tibault for a safe investment therefore mr morin s memory seemed doomed to bear the cloud of dishonesty while madame was of course disconsolate then it was that robbins and dumars representing their respective journals began one of those pertinacious private investigations which of late years the press has adopted as a means to glory and the satisfaction of public curiosity cherchez la femme said dumars that s the ticket agreed robbins all roads lead to the eternal feminine we will find the woman they exhausted the knowledge of the staff of mr morin s hotel from the bell boy down to the proprietor they gently but inflexibly pumped the family of the deceased as far as his cousins twice removed they artfully sounded the employees of the late jeweller and dogged his customers for information concerning his habits like bloodhounds they traced every step of the supposed defaulter as nearly as might be for years along the limited and monotonous paths he had trodden at the end of their labours mr morin stood an immaculate man not one weakness that might be served up as a criminal tendency not one deviation from the path of rectitude not even a hint of a predilection for the opposite sex was found to be placed in his debit his life had been as regular and austere as a monk s his habits simple and unconcealed generous charitable and a model in propriety was the verdict of all who knew him what now asked robbins fingering his empty notebook cherchez la femme said dumars lighting a cigarette try lady bellairs this piece of femininity was the race track favourite of the season being feminine she was erratic in her gaits and there were a few heavy losers about town who had believed she could be true the reporters applied for information mr morin certainly not he was never even a spectator at the races not that kind of a man surprised the gentlemen should ask shall we throw it up suggested robbins and let the puzzle department have a try cherchez la femme hummed dumars reaching for a match try the little sisters of what d you call em it had developed during the investigation that mr morin had held this benevolent order in particular favour he had contributed liberally toward its support and had chosen its chapel as his favourite place of private worship it was said that he went there daily to make his devotions at the altar indeed toward the last of his life his whole mind seemed to have fixed itself upon religious matters perhaps to the detriment of his worldly affairs thither went robbins and dumars and were admitted through the narrow doorway in the blank stone wall that frowned upon bonhomme street an old woman was sweeping the chapel she told them that sister felicite the head of the order was then at prayer at the altar in the alcove in a few moments she would emerge heavy black curtains screened the alcove they waited soon the curtains were disturbed and sister felicite came forth she was tall tragic bony and plain featured dressed in the black gown and severe bonnet of the sisterhood robbins a good rough and tumble reporter but lacking the delicate touch began to speak they represented the press the lady had no doubt heard of the morin affair it was necessary in justice to that gentleman s memory to probe the mystery of the lost money it was known that he had come often to this chapel any information now concerning mr morin s habits tastes the friends he had and so on would be of value in doing him posthumous justice sister felicite had heard whatever she knew would be willingly told but it was very little monsieur morin had been a good friend to the order sometimes contributing as much as a hundred dollars the sisterhood was an independent one depending entirely upon private contributions for the means to carry on its charitable work mr morin had presented the chapel with silver candlesticks and an altar cloth he came every day to worship in the chapel sometimes remaining for an hour he was a devout catholic consecrated to holiness yes and also in the alcove was a statue of the virgin that he had himself modeled cast and presented to the order oh it was cruel to cast a doubt upon so good a man robbins was also profoundly grieved at the imputation but until it was found what mr morin had done with madame tibault s money he feared the tongue of slander would not be stilled sometimes in fact very often in affairs of the kind there was er as the saying goes er a lady in the case in absolute confidence now if perhaps sister felicite s large eyes regarded him solemnly there was one woman she said slowly to whom he bowed to whom he gave his heart robbins fumbled rapturously for his pencil behold the woman said sister felicite suddenly in deep tones she reached a long arm and swept aside the curtain of the alcove in there was a shrine lit to a glow of soft colour by the light pouring through a stained glass window within a deep niche in the bare stone wall stood an image of the virgin mary the colour of pure gold dumars a conventional catholic succumbed to the dramatic in the act he bowed his head for an instant and made the sign of the cross the somewhat abashed robbins murmuring an indistinct apology backed awkwardly away sister felicite drew back the curtain and the reporters departed on the narrow sidewalk of bonhomme street robbins turned to dumars with unworthy sarcasm well what next churchy law fem absinthe said dumars with the history of the missing money thus partially related some conjecture may be formed of the sudden idea that madame tibault s words seemed to have suggested to robbins s brain was it so wild a surmise that the religious fanatic had offered up his wealth or rather madame tibault s in the shape of a material symbol of his consuming devotion stranger things have been done in the name of worship was it not possible that the lost thousands were molded into that lustrous image that the goldsmith had formed it of the pure and precious metal and set it there through some hope of a perhaps disordered brain to propitiate the saints and pave the way to his own selfish glory that afternoon at five minutes to three robbins entered the chapel door of the little sisters of samaria he saw in the dim light a crowd of perhaps a hundred people gathered to attend the sale most of them were members of various religious orders priests and churchmen come to purchase the paraphernalia of the chapel lest they fall into desecrating hands others were business men and agents come to bid upon the realty a clerical looking brother had volunteered to wield the hammer bringing to the office of auctioneer the anomaly of choice diction and dignity of manner a few of the minor articles were sold and then two assistants brought forward the image of the virgin robbins started the bidding at ten dollars a stout man in an ecclesiastical garb went to fifteen a voice from another part of the crowd raised to twenty the three bid alternately raising by bids of five until the offer was fifty dollars then the stout man dropped out and robbins as a sort of coup de main went to a hundred one hundred and fifty said the other voice two hundred bid robbins boldly two fifty called his competitor promptly the reporter hesitated for the space of a lightning flash estimating how much he could borrow from the boys in the office and screw from the business manager from his next month s salary three hundred he offered three fifty spoke up the other in a louder voice a voice that sent robbins diving suddenly through the crowd in its direction to catch dumars its owner ferociously by the collar you unconverted idiot hissed robbins close to his ear pool agreed said dumars coolly i couldn t raise three hundred and fifty dollars with a search warrant but i can stand half what you come bidding against me for i thought i was the only fool in the crowd explained robbins no one else bidding the statue was knocked down to the syndicate at their last offer dumars remained with the prize while robbins hurried forth to wring from the resources and credit of both the price he soon returned with the money and the two musketeers loaded their precious package into a carriage and drove with it to dumars s room in old chartres street nearby they lugged it covered with a cloth up the stairs and deposited it on a table a hundred pounds it weighed if an ounce and at that estimate according to their calculation if their daring theory were correct it stood there worth twenty thousand golden dollars robbins removed the covering and opened his pocket knife sacre muttered dumars shuddering it is the mother of christ what would you do shut up judas said robbins coldly it s too late for you to be saved now with a firm hand he chipped a slice from the shoulder of the image the cut showed a dull grayish metal with a thin coating of gold leaf lead announced robbins hurling his knife to the floor gilded to the devil with it said dumars forgetting his scruples i must have a drink together they walked moodily to the cafe of madame tribault two squares away it seemed that madame s mind had been stirred that day to fresh recollections of the past services of the two young men in her behalf you mustn t sit by those table she interposed as they were about to drop into their accustomed seats thass so boys but no i mek you come at this room like my tres bon amis yes i goin mek for you myself one anisette and one cafe royale ver fine ah i lak treat my fren nize yes plis come in this way madame led them into the little back room into which she sometimes invited the especially favoured of her customers in two comfortable armchairs by a big window that opened upon the courtyard she placed them with a low table between bustling hospitably about she began to prepare the promised refreshments it was the first time the reporters had been honoured with admission to the sacred precincts the room was in dusky twilight flecked with gleams of the polished fine woods and burnished glass and metal that the creoles love from the little courtyard a tiny fountain sent in an insinuating sound of trickling waters to which a banana plant by the window kept time with its tremulous leaves robbins an investigator by nature sent a curious glance roving about the room from some barbaric ancestor madame had inherited a penchant for the crude in decoration the walls were adorned with cheap lithographs florid libels upon nature addressed to the taste of the bourgeoisie birthday cards garish newspaper supplements and specimens of art advertising calculated to reduce the optic nerve to stunned submission a patch of something unintelligible in the midst of the more candid display puzzled robbins and he rose and took a step nearer to interrogate it at closer range then he leaned weakly against the wall and called out madame tibault oh madame since when oh since when have you been in the habit of papering your walls with five thousand dollar united states four per cent gold bonds tell me is this a grimm s fairy tale or should i consult an oculist at his words

guaranteed to produce the desired results her name is belle of kentucky twelve year old bourbon in quarts how does the idea strike you allons said dumars cherchez la femme friends in san rosario the west bound train stopped at san rosario on time at a m a man with a thick black leather wallet under his arm left the train and walked rapidly up the main street of the town there were other passengers who also got off at san rosario but they either slouched limberly over to the railroad eating house or the silver dollar saloon or joined the groups of idlers about the station indecision had no part in the movements of the man with the wallet he was short in stature but strongly built with very light closely trimmed hair smooth determined face and aggressive gold rimmed nose glasses he was well dressed in the prevailing eastern style his air denoted a quiet but conscious reserve force if not actual authority after walking a distance of three squares he came to the centre of the town s business area here another street of importance crossed the main one forming the hub of san rosario s life and commerce upon one corner stood the post office upon another rubensky s clothing emporium the other two diagonally opposing corners were occupied by the town s two banks the first national and the stockmen s national into the first national bank of san rosario the newcomer walked never slowing his brisk step until he stood at the cashier s window the bank opened for business at nine and the working force was already assembled each member preparing his department for the day s business the cashier was examining the mail when he noticed the stranger standing at his window bank doesn t open til nine he remarked curtly but without feeling he had had to make that statement so often to early birds since san rosario adopted city banking hours i am well aware of that said the other man in cool brittle tones will you kindly receive my card the cashier drew the small spotless parallelogram inside the bars of his wicket and read j f c nettlewick national bank examiner oh er will you walk around inside mr er nettlewick your first visit didn t know your business of course walk right around please the examiner was quickly inside the sacred precincts of the bank where he was ponderously introduced to each employee in turn by mr edlinger the cashier a middle aged gentleman of deliberation discretion and method i was kind of expecting sam turner round again pretty soon said mr edlinger sam s been examining us now for about four years i guess you ll find us all right though considering the tightness in business not overly much money on hand but able to stand the storms sir stand the storms mr turner and i have been ordered by the comptroller to exchange districts said the examiner in his decisive formal tones he is covering my old territory in southern illinois and indiana i will take the cash first please perry dorsey the teller was already arranging his cash on the counter for the examiner s inspection he knew it was right to a cent and he had nothing to fear but he was nervous and flustered so was every man in the bank there was something so icy and swift so impersonal and uncompromising about this man that his very presence seemed an accusation he looked to be a man who would never make nor overlook an error mr nettlewick first seized the currency and with a rapid almost juggling motion counted it by packages then he spun the sponge cup toward him and verified the count by bills his thin white fingers flew like some expert musician s upon the keys of a piano he dumped the gold upon the counter with a crash and the coins whined and sang as they skimmed across the marble slab from the tips of his nimble digits the air was full of fractional currency when he came to the halves and quarters he counted the last nickle and dime he had the scales brought and he weighed every sack of silver in the vault he questioned dorsey concerning each of the cash memoranda certain checks charge slips etc carried over from the previous day s work with unimpeachable courtesy yet with something so mysteriously momentous in his frigid manner that the teller was reduced to pink cheeks and a stammering tongue this newly imported examiner was so different from sam turner it had been sam s way to enter the bank with a shout pass the cigars and tell the latest stories he had picked up on his rounds his customary greeting to dorsey had been hello perry haven t skipped out with the boodle yet i see turner s way of counting the cash had been different too he would finger the packages of bills in a tired kind of way and then go into the vault and kick over a few sacks of silver and the thing was done halves and quarters and dimes not for sam turner no chicken feed for me he would say when they were set before him i m not in the agricultural department but then turner was a texan an old friend of the bank s president and had known dorsey since he was a baby while the examiner was counting the cash major thomas b kingman known to every one as major tom the president of the first national drove up to the side door with his old dun horse and buggy and came inside he saw the examiner busy with the money and going into the little pony corral as he called it in which his desk was railed off he began to look over his letters earlier a little incident had occurred that even the sharp eyes of the examiner had failed to notice when he had begun his work at the cash counter mr edlinger had winked significantly at roy wilson the youthful bank messenger and nodded his head slightly toward the front door roy understood got his hat and walked leisurely out with his collector s book under his arm once outside he made a bee line for the stockmen s national that bank was also getting ready to open no customers had as yet presented themselves say you people cried roy with the familiarity of youth and long acquaintance you want to get a move on you there s a new bank examiner over at the first and he s a stem winder he s counting nickles on perry and he s got the whole outfit bluffed mr edlinger gave me the tip to let you know mr buckley president of the stockmen s national a stout elderly man looking like a farmer dressed for sunday heard roy from his private office at the rear and called him has major kingman come down to the bank yet he asked of the boy yes sir he was just driving up as i left said roy i want you to take him a note put it into his own hands as soon as you get back mr buckley sat down and began to write roy returned and handed to major kingman the envelope containing the note the major read it folded it and slipped it into his vest pocket he leaned back in his chair for a few moments as if he were meditating deeply and then rose and went into the vault he came out with the bulky old fashioned leather note case stamped on the back in gilt letters bills discounted in this were the notes due the bank with their attached securities and the major in his rough way dumped the lot upon his desk and began to sort them over by this time nettlewick had finished his count of the cash his pencil fluttered like a swallow over the sheet of paper on which he had set his figures he opened his black wallet which seemed to be also a kind of secret memorandum book made a few rapid figures in it wheeled and transfixed dorsey with the glare of his spectacles that look seemed to say you re safe this time but cash all correct snapped the examiner he made a dash for the individual bookkeeper and for a few minutes there was a fluttering of ledger leaves and a sailing of balance sheets through the air how often do you balance your pass books he demanded suddenly er once a month faltered the individual bookkeeper wondering how many years they would give him all right said the examiner turning and charging upon the general bookkeeper who had the statements of his foreign banks and their reconcilement memoranda ready everything there was found to be all right then the stub book of the certificates of deposit flutter flutter zip zip check all right list of over drafts please thanks h m m unsigned bills of the bank next all right then came the cashier s turn and easy going mr edlinger rubbed his nose and polished his glasses nervously under the quick fire of questions concerning the circulation undivided profits bank real estate and stock ownership presently nettlewick was aware of a big man towering above him at his elbow a man sixty years of age rugged and hale with a rough grizzled beard a mass of gray hair and a pair of penetrating blue eyes that confronted the formidable glasses of the examiner without a flicker er major kingman our president er mr nettlewick said the cashier two men of very different types shook hands one was a finished product of the world of straight lines conventional methods and formal affairs the other was something freer wider and nearer to nature tom kingman had not been cut to any pattern he had been mule driver cowboy ranger soldier sheriff prospector and cattleman now when he was bank president his old comrades from the prairies of the saddle tent and trail found no change in him he had made his fortune when texas cattle were at the high tide of value and had organized the first national bank of san rosario in spite of his largeness of heart and sometimes unwise generosity toward his old friends the bank had prospered for major tom kingman knew men as well as he knew cattle of late years the cattle business had known a depression and the major s bank was one of the few whose losses had not been great and now said the examiner briskly pulling out his watch the last thing is the loans we will take them up now if you please he had gone through the first national at almost record breaking speed but thoroughly as he did everything the running order of the bank was smooth and clean and that had facilitated his work there was but one other bank in the town he received from the government a fee of twenty five dollars for each bank that he examined he should be able to go over those loans and discounts in half an hour if so he could examine the other bank immediately afterward and catch the the only other train that day in the direction he was working otherwise he would have to spend the night and sunday in this uninteresting western town that was why mr nettlewick was rushing matters come with me sir said major kingman in his deep voice that united the southern drawl with the rhythmic twang of the west we will go over them together nobody in the bank knows those notes as i do some of em are a little wobbly on their legs and some are mavericks without extra many brands on their backs but they ll most all pay out at the round up the two sat down at the president s desk first the examiner went through the notes at lightning speed and added up their total finding it to agree with the amount of loans carried on the book of daily balances next he took up the larger loans inquiring scrupulously into the condition of their endorsers or securities the new examiner s mind seemed to course and turn and make unexpected dashes hither and thither like a bloodhound seeking a trail finally he pushed aside all the notes except a few which he arranged in a neat pile before him and began a dry formal little speech i find sir the condition of your bank to be very good considering the poor crops and the depression in the cattle interests of your state the clerical work seems to be done accurately and punctually your past due paper is moderate in amount and promises only a small loss i would recommend the calling in of your large loans and the making of only sixty and ninety day or call loans until general business revives and now there is one thing more and i will have finished with the bank here are six notes aggregating something like they are secured according to their faces by various stocks bonds shares etc to the value of those securities are missing from the notes to which they should be attached i suppose you have them in the safe or vault you will permit me to examine them major tom s light blue eyes turned unflinchingly toward the examiner no sir he said in a low but steady tone those securities are neither in the safe nor in the vault i have taken them you may hold me personally responsible for their absence nettlewick felt a slight thrill he had not expected this he had struck a momentous trail when the hunt was drawing to a close ah said the examiner he waited a moment and then continued may i ask you to explain more definitely the securities were taken by me repeated the major it was not for my own use but to save an old friend in trouble come in here sir and we ll talk it over he led the examiner into the bank s private office at the rear and closed the door there was a desk and a table and half a dozen leather covered chairs on the wall was the mounted head of a texas steer with horns five feet from tip to tip opposite hung the major s old cavalry saber that he had carried at shiloh and fort pillow placing a chair for nettlewick the major seated himself by the window from which he could see the post office and the carved limestone front of the stockmen s national he did not speak at once and nettlewick felt perhaps that the ice could be broken by something so near its own temperature as the voice of official warning your statement he began since you have failed to modify it amounts as you must know to a very serious thing you are aware also of what my duty must compel me to do i shall have to go before the united states commissioner and make i know i know said major tom with a wave of his hand you don t suppose i d run a bank without being posted on national banking laws and the revised statutes do your duty i m not asking any favours but i spoke of my friend i did want you to hear me tell you about bob nettlewick settled himself in his chair there would be no leaving san rosario for him that day he would have to telegraph to the comptroller of the currency he would have to swear out a warrant before the united states commissioner for the arrest of major kingman perhaps he would be ordered to close the bank on account of the loss of the securities it was not the first crime the examiner had unearthed once or twice the terrible upheaval of human emotions that his investigations had loosed had almost caused a ripple in his official calm he had seen bank men kneel and plead and cry like women for a chance an hour s time the overlooking of a single error one cashier had shot himself at his desk before him none of them had taken it with the dignity and coolness of this stern old westerner nettlewick felt that he owed it to him at least to listen if he wished to talk with his elbow on the arm of his chair and his square chin resting upon the fingers of his right hand the bank examiner waited to hear the confession of the president of the first national bank of san rosario when a man s your friend began major tom somewhat didactically for forty years and tried by water fire earth and cyclones when you can do him a little favour you feel like doing it embezzle for him worth of securities thought the examiner we were cowboys together bob and i continued the major speaking slowly and deliberately and musingly as if his thoughts were rather with the past than the critical present and we prospected together for gold and silver over arizona new mexico and a good part of california we were both in the war of sixty one but in different commands we ve fought indians and horse thieves side by side we ve starved for weeks in a cabin in the arizona mountains buried twenty feet deep in snow we ve ridden herd together when the wind blew so hard the lightning couldn t strike well bob and i have been through some rough spells since the first time we met in the branding camp of the old anchor bar ranch and during that time we ve found it necessary more than once to help each other out of tight places in those days it was expected of a man to stick to his friend and he didn t ask any credit for it probably next day you d need him to get at your back and help stand off a band of apaches or put a tourniquet on your leg above a rattlesnake bite and ride for whisky so after all it was give and take and if you didn t stand square with your pardner why you might be shy one when you needed him but bob was a man who was willing to go further than that he never played a limit twenty years ago i was sheriff of this country and i made bob my chief deputy that was before the boom in cattle when we both made our stake i was sheriff and collector and it was a big thing for me then i was married and we had a boy and a girl a four and a six year old there was a comfortable house next to the courthouse furnished by the county rent free and i was saving some money bob did most of the office work both of us had seen rough times and plenty of rustling and danger and i tell you it was great to hear the rain and the sleet dashing against the windows of nights and be warm and safe and comfortable and know you could get up in the morning and be shaved and have folks call you mister and then i had the finest wife and kids that ever struck the range and my old friend with me enjoying the first fruits of prosperity and white shirts and i guess i was happy yes i was happy about that time the major sighed and glanced casually out of the window the bank examiner changed his position and leaned his chin upon his other hand one winter continued the major the money for the county taxes came pouring in so fast that i didn t have time to take the stuff to the bank for a week i just shoved the checks into a cigar box and the money into a sack and locked them in the big safe that belonged to the sheriff s office i had been overworked that week and was about sick anyway my nerves were out of order and my sleep at night didn t seem to rest me the doctor had some scientific name for it and i was taking medicine and so added to the rest i went to bed at night with that money on my mind not that there was much need of being worried for the safe was a good one and nobody but bob and i knew the combination on friday night there was about in cash in the bag on saturday morning i went to the office as usual the safe was locked and bob was writing at his desk i opened the safe and the money was gone i called bob and roused everybody in the court house to announce the robbery it struck me that bob took it pretty quiet considering how much it reflected upon both him and me two days went by and we never got a clew it couldn t have been burglars for the safe had been opened by the combination in the proper way people must have begun to talk for one afternoon in comes alice that s my wife and the boy and girl and alice stamps her foot and her eyes flash and she cries out the lying wretches tom tom and i catch her in a faint and bring her round little by little and she lays her head down and cries and cries for the first time since she took tom kingman s name and fortunes and jack and zilla the youngsters they were always wild as tiger cubs to rush over bob and climb all over him whenever they were allowed to come to the court house they stood and kicked their little shoes and herded together like scared partridges they were having their first trip down into the shadows of life bob was working at his desk and he got up and went out without a word the grand jury was in session then and the next morning bob went before them and confessed that he stole the money he said he lost it in a poker game in fifteen minutes they had found a true bill and sent me the warrant to arrest the man with whom i d been closer than a thousand brothers for many a year i did it and then i said to bob pointing there s my house and here s my office and up there s maine and out that way is california and over there is florida and that s your range til court meets you re in my charge and i take the responsibility you be here when you re wanted thanks tom he said kind of carelessly i was sort of hoping you wouldn t lock me up court meets next monday so if you don t object i ll just loaf around the office until then i ve got one favour to ask if it isn t too much if you d let the kids come out in the yard once in a while and have a romp i d like it why not i answered him they re welcome and so are you and come to my house the same as ever you see mr nettlewick you can t make a friend of a thief but neither can you make a thief of a friend all at once the examiner made no answer at that moment was heard the shrill whistle of a locomotive pulling into the depot that was the train on the little narrow gauge road that struck into san rosario from the south the major cocked his ear and listened for a moment and looked at his watch the narrow gauge was in on time the major continued so bob hung around the office reading the papers and smoking i put another deputy to work in his place and after a while the first excitement of the case wore off one day when we were alone in the office bob came over to where i was sitting he looked sort of grim and blue the same look he used to get when he d been up watching for indians all night or herd riding tom says he it s harder than standing off redskins it s harder than lying in the lava desert forty miles from water but i m going to stick it out to the end you know that s been my style but if you d tip me the smallest kind of a sign if you d just say bob i understand why it would make it lots easier i was surprised i don t know what you mean bob i said of course you know that i d do anything under the sun to help you that i could but you ve got me guessing all right tom was all he said and he went back to his newspaper and lit another cigar it was the night before court met when i found out what he meant i went to bed that night with that same old light headed nervous feeling come back upon me i dropped off to sleep about midnight when i awoke i was standing half dressed in one of the court house corridors bob was holding one of my arms our family doctor the other and alice was shaking me and half crying she had sent for the doctor without my knowing it and when he came they had found me out of bed and missing and had begun a search sleep walking said the doctor all of us went back to the house and the doctor told us some remarkable stories about the strange things people had done while in that condition i was feeling rather chilly after my trip out and as my wife was out of the room at the time i pulled open the door of an old wardrobe that stood in the room and dragged out a big quilt i had seen in there with it tumbled out the bag of money for stealing which bob was to be tried and convicted in the morning how the jumping rattlesnakes did that get there i yelled and all hands must have seen how surprised i was bob knew in a flash you darned old snoozer he said with the old time look on his face i saw you put it there i watched you open the safe and take it out and i followed you i looked through the window and saw you hide it in that wardrobe then you blankety blank flop eared sheep headed coyote what did you say you took it for because said bob simply i didn t know you were asleep i saw him glance toward the door of the room where jack and zilla were and i knew then what it meant to be a man s friend from bob s point of view major tom paused and again directed his glance out of the window he saw some one in the stockmen s national bank reach and draw a yellow shade down the whole length of its plate glass big front window although the position of the sun did not seem to warrant such a defensive movement against its rays nettlewick sat up straight in his chair he had listened patiently but without consuming interest to the major s story it had impressed him as irrelevant to the situation and it could certainly have no effect upon the consequences those western people he thought had an exaggerated sentimentality they were not business like they needed to be protected from their friends evidently the major had concluded and what he had said amounted to nothing may i ask said the examiner if you have anything further to say that bears directly upon the question of those abstracted securities abstracted securities sir major tom turned suddenly in his chair his blue eyes flashing upon the examiner what do you mean sir he drew from his coat pocket a batch of folded papers held together by a rubber band tossed them into nettlewick s hands and rose to his feet you ll find those securities there sir every stock bond and share of em i took them from the notes while you were counting the cash examine and compare them for yourself the major led the way back into the banking room the examiner astounded perplexed nettled at sea followed he felt that he had been made the victim of something that was not exactly a hoax but that left him in the shoes of one who had been played upon used and then discarded without even an inkling of the game perhaps also his official position had been irreverently juggled with but there was nothing he could take hold of an official report of the matter would be an absurdity and somehow he felt that he would never know anything more about the matter than he did then frigidly mechanically nettlewick examined the securities found them to tally with the notes gathered his black wallet and rose to depart i will say he protested turning the indignant glare of his glasses upon major kingman that your statements your misleading statements which you have not condescended to explain do not appear to be quite the thing regarded either as business or humour i do not understand such motives or actions major tom looked down at him serenely and not unkindly son he said there are plenty of things in the chaparral and on the prairies and up the canyons that you don t understand but i want to thank you for listening to a garrulous old man s prosy story we old texans love to talk about our adventures and our old comrades and the home folks have long ago learned to run when we begin with once upon a time so we have to spin our yarns to the stranger within our gates the major smiled but the examiner only bowed coldly and abruptly quitted the bank they saw him travel diagonally across the street in a straight line and enter the stockmen s national bank major tom sat down at his desk and drew from his vest pocket the note roy had given him he had read it once but hurriedly and now with something like a twinkle in his eyes he read it again these were the words he read dear tom i hear there s one of uncle sam s grayhounds going through you and that means that we ll catch him inside of a couple of hours maybe now i want you to do something for me we ve got just in the bank and the law requires that we have i let ross and fisher have late yesterday afternoon to buy up that gibson bunch of cattle they ll realise in less than thirty days on the transaction but that won t make my cash on hand look any prettier to that bank examiner now i can t show him those notes for they re just plain notes of hand without any security in sight but you know very well that pink ross and jim fisher are two of the finest white men god ever made and they ll do the square thing you remember jim fisher he was the one who shot that faro dealer in el paso i wired sam bradshaw s bank to send me and it will get in on the narrow gauge at you can t let a bank examiner in to count and close your doors tom you hold that examiner hold him hold him if you have to rope him and sit on his head watch our front window after the narrow gauge gets in and when we ve got the cash inside we ll pull down the shade for a signal don t turn him loose till then i m counting on you tom your old pard bob buckly prest stockmen s national the major began to tear the note into small pieces and throw them into his waste basket he gave a satisfied chuckle as he did so confounded old reckless cowpuncher he growled contentedly that pays him some on account for what he tried to do for me in the sheriff s office twenty years ago the fourth in salvador on a summer s day while the city was rocking with the din and red uproar of patriotism billy casparis told me this story in his way billy is ulysses jr like satan he comes from going to and fro upon the earth and walking up and down in it to morrow morning while you are cracking your breakfast egg he may be off with his little alligator grip to boom a town site in the middle of lake okeechobee or to trade horses with the patagonians we sat at a little round table and between us were glasses holding big lumps of ice and above us leaned an artificial palm and because our scene was set with the properties of the one they recalled to his mind billy was stirred to narrative it reminds me said he of a fourth i helped to celebrate down in salvador twas while i was running an ice factory down there after i unloaded that silver mine i had in colorado i had what they called a conditional concession they made me put up a thousand dollars cash forfeit that i would make ice continuously for six months if i did that i could draw down my ante if i failed to do so the government took the pot so the inspectors kept dropping in trying to catch me without the goods one day when the thermometer was at the clock at half past one and the calendar at july third two of the little brown oily nosers in red trousers slid in to make an inspection now the factory hadn t turned out a pound of ice in three weeks for a couple of reasons the salvador heathen wouldn t buy it they said it make things cold they put it in and i couldn t make any more because i was broke all i was holding on for was to get down my thousand so i could leave the country the six months would be up on the sixth of july well i showed em all the ice i had i raised the lid of a darkish vat and there was an elegant pound block of ice beautiful and convincing to the eye i was about to close down the lid again when one of those brunette sleuths flops down on his red knees and lays a slanderous and violent hand on my guarantee of good faith and in two minutes more they had dragged out on the floor that fine chunk of molded glass that had cost me fifty dollars to have shipped down from frisco ice y says the fellow that played me the dishonourable trick verree warm ice y yes the day is that hot senor yes maybeso it is of desirableness to leave him out to get the cool yes yes says i yes for i knew they had me touching s believing ain t it boys yes now there s some might say the seats of your trousers are sky blue but tis my opinion they are red let s apply the tests of the laying on of hands and feet and so i hoisted both those inspectors out the door on the toe of my shoe and sat down to cool off on my block of disreputable glass and as i live without oats while i sat there homesick for money and without a cent to my ambition there came on the breeze the most beautiful smell my nose had entered for a year god knows where it came from in that backyard of a country it was a bouquet of soaked lemon peel cigar stumps and stale beer exactly the smell of goldbrick charley s place on fourteenth street where i used to play pinochle of afternoons with the third rate actors and that smell drove my troubles through me and clinched em at the back i began to long for my country and feel sentiments about it and i said words about salvador that you wouldn t think could come legitimate out of an ice factory and while i was sitting there down through the blazing sunshine in his clean white clothes comes maximilian jones an american interested in rubber and rosewood great carrambos says i when he stepped in for i was in a bad temper didn t i have catastrophes enough i know what you want you want to tell me that story again about johnny ammiger and the widow on the train you ve told it nine times already this month it must be the heat says jones stopping in at the door amazed poor billy he s got bugs sitting on ice and calling his best friends pseudonyms hi muchacho jones called my force of employees who was sitting in the sun playing with his toes and told him to put on his trousers and run for the doctor come back says i sit down maxy and forget it tis not ice you see nor a lunatic upon it tis only an exile full of homesickness sitting on a lump of glass that s just cost him a thousand dollars now what was it johnny said to the widow first i d like to hear it again maxy honest don t mind what i said maximilian jones and i sat down and talked he was about as sick of the country as i was for the grafters were squeezing him for half the profits of his rosewood and rubber down in the bottom of a tank of water i had a dozen bottles of sticky frisco beer and i fished these up and we fell to talking about home and the flag and hail columbia and home fried potatoes and the drivel we contributed would have sickened any man enjoying those blessings but at that time we were out of em you can t appreciate home till you ve left it money till it s spent your wife till she s joined a woman s club nor old glory till you see it hanging on a broomstick on the shanty of a consul in a foreign town and sitting there me and maximilian jones scratching at our prickly heat and kicking at the lizards on the floor became afflicted with a dose of patriotism and affection for our country there was me billy casparis reduced from a capitalist to a pauper by over addiction to my glass in the lump declares my troubles off for the present and myself to be an uncrowned sovereign of the greatest country on earth and maximilian jones pours out whole drug stores of his wrath on oligarchies and potentates in red trousers and calico shoes and we issues a declaration of interference in which we guarantee that the fourth day of july shall be celebrated in salvador with all the kinds of salutes explosions honours of war oratory and liquids known to tradition yes neither me nor jones breathed with soul so dead there shall be rucuses in salvador we say and the monkeys had better climb the tallest cocoanut trees and the fire department get out its red sashes and two tin buckets about this time into the factory steps a native man incriminated by the name of general mary esperanza dingo he was some pumpkin both in politics and colour and the friend of me and jones he was full of politeness and a kind of intelligence having picked up the latter and managed to preserve the former during a two years residence in philadelphia studying medicine for a salvadorian he was not such a calamitous little man though he always would play jack queen king ace deuce for a straight general mary sits with us and has a bottle while he was in the states he had acquired a synopsis of the english language and the art of admiring our institutions by and by the general gets up and tiptoes to the doors and windows and other stage entrances remarking hist at each one they all do that in salvador before they ask for a drink of water or the time of day being conspirators from the cradle and matinee idols by proclamation hist says general dingo again and then he lays his chest on the table quite like gaspard the miser good friends senores to morrow will be the great day of liberty and independence the hearts of americans and salvadorians should beat together of your history and your great washington i know is it not so now me and jones thought that nice of the general to remember when the fourth came it made us feel good he must have heard the news going round in philadelphia about that disturbance we had with england yes says me and maxy together we knew it we were talking about it when you came in and you can bet your bottom concession that there ll be fuss and feathers in the air to morrow we are few in numbers but the welkin may as well reach out to push the button for it s got to ring i too shall assist says the general thumping his collar bone i too am on the side of liberty noble americans we will make the day one to be never forgotten for us american whisky says jones none of your scotch smoke or anisada or three star hennessey to morrow we ll borrow the consul s flag old man billfinger shall make orations and we ll have a barbecue on the plaza fireworks says i will be scarce but we ll have all the cartridges in the shops for our guns i ve got two navy sixes i brought from denver there is one cannon said the general one big cannon that will go boom and three hundred men with rifles to shoot oh say says jones generalissimo you re the real silk elastic we ll make it a joint international celebration please general get a white horse and a blue sash and be grand marshal with my sword says the general rolling his eyes i shall ride at the head of the brave men who gather in the name of liberty and you might we suggest see the commandante and advise him that we are going to prize things up a bit we americans you know are accustomed to using municipal regulations for gun wadding when we line up to help the eagle scream he might suspend the rules for one day we don t want to get in the calaboose for spanking his soldiers if they get in our way do you see hist says general mary the commandant is with us heart and soul he will aid us he is one of us we made all the arrangements that afternoon there was a buck coon from georgia in salvador who had drifted down there from a busted up coloured colony that had been started on some possumless land in mexico as soon as he heard us say barbecue he wept for joy and groveled on the ground he dug his trench on the plaza and got half a beef on the coals for an all night roast me and maxy went to see the rest of the americans in the town and they all sizzled like a seidlitz with joy at the idea of solemnizing an old time fourth there were six of us all together martin dillard a coffee planter henry barnes a railroad man old man billfinger an educated tintype taker me and jonesy and jerry the boss of the barbecue there was also an englishman in town named sterrett who was there to write a book on domestic architecture of the insect world we felt some bashfulness about inviting a britisher to help crow over his own country but we decided to risk it out of our personal regard for him we found sterrett in pajamas working at his manuscript with a bottle of brandy for a paper weight englishman says jones let us interrupt your disquisition on bug houses for a moment to morrow is the fourth of july we don t want to hurt your feelings but we re going to commemorate the day when we licked you by a little refined debauchery and nonsense something that can be heard above five miles off if you are broad gauged enough to taste whisky at your own wake we d be pleased to have you join us do you know says sterrett setting his glasses on his nose i like your cheek in asking me if i ll join you blast me if i don t you might have known i would without asking not as a traitor to my own country but for the intrinsic joy of a blooming row on the morning of the fourth i woke up in that old shanty of an ice factory feeling sore i looked around at the wreck of all i possessed and my heart was full of bile from where i lay on my cot i could look through the window and see the consul s old ragged stars and stripes hanging over his shack you re all kinds of a fool billy casparis i said to myself and of all your crimes against sense it does look like this idea of celebrating the fourth should receive the award of demerit your business is busted up your thousand dollars is gone into the kitty of this corrupt country on that last bluff you made you ve got just fifteen chili dollars left worth forty six cents each at bedtime last night and steadily going down to day you ll blow in your last cent hurrahing for that flag and to morrow you ll be living on bananas from the stalk and screwing your drinks out of your friends what s the flag done for you while you were under it you worked for what you got you wore your finger nails down skinning suckers and salting mines and driving bears and alligators off your town lot additions how much does patriotism count for on deposit with the little man with the green eye shade in the savings bank adds up your book suppose you were to get pinched over here in this irreligious country for some little crime or other and appealed to your country for protection what would it do for you turn your appeal over to a committee of one railroad man an army officer a member of each labour union and a coloured man to investigate whether any of your ancestors were ever related to a cousin of mark hanna and then file the papers in the smithsonian institution until after the next election that s the kind of a sidetrack the stars and stripes would switch you onto you can see that i was feeling like an indigo plant but after i washed my face in some cool water and got out my navys and ammunition and started up to the saloon of the immaculate saints where we were to meet i felt better and when i saw those other american boys come swaggering into the trysting place cool easy conspicuous fellows ready to risk any kind of a one card draw or to fight grizzlies fire or extradition i began to feel glad i was one of em so i says to myself again billy you ve got fifteen dollars and a country left this morning blow in the dollars and blow up the town as an american gentleman should on independence day it is my recollection that we began the day along conventional lines the six of us for sterrett was along made progress among the cantinas divesting the bars as we went of all strong drink bearing american labels we kept informing the atmosphere as to the glory and preeminence of the united states and its ability to subdue outjump and eradicate the other nations of the earth and as the findings of american labels grew more plentiful we became more contaminated with patriotism maximilian jones hopes that our late foe mr sterrett will not take offense at our enthusiasm he sets down his bottle and shakes sterrett s hand as white man to white man says he denude our uproar of the slightest taint of personality excuse us for bunker hill patrick henry and waldorf astor and such grievances as might lie between us as nations fellow hoodlums says sterrett on behalf of the queen i ask you to cheese it it is an honour to be a guest at disturbing the peace under the american flag let us chant the passionate strains of yankee doodle while the senor behind the bar mitigates the occasion with another round of cochineal and aqua fortis old man billfinger being charged with a kind of rhetoric makes speeches every time we stop we explained to such citizens as we happened to step on that we were celebrating the dawn of our own private brand of liberty and to please enter such inhumanities as we might commit on the list of unavoidable casualties about eleven o clock our bulletins read a considerable rise in temperature accompanied by thirst and other alarming symptoms we hooked arms and stretched our line across the narrow streets all of us armed with winchesters and navys for purposes of noise and without malice we stopped on a street corner and fired a dozen or so rounds and began a serial assortment of united states whoops and yells probably the first ever heard in that town when we made that noise things began to liven up we heard a pattering up a side street and here came general mary esperanza dingo on a white horse with a couple of hundred brown boys following him in red undershirts and bare feet dragging guns ten feet long jones and me had forgot all about general mary and his promise to help us celebrate we fired another salute and gave another yell while the general shook hands with us and waved his sword oh general shouts jones this is great this will be a real pleasure to the eagle get down and have a drink drink says the general no there is no time to drink vive la libertad don t forget e pluribus unum says henry barnes viva it good and strong says i likewise viva george washington god save the union and i says bowing to sterrett don t discard the queen thanks says sterrett the next round s mine all in to the bar army too but we were deprived of sterrett s treat by a lot of gunshots several square sway which general dingo seemed to think he ought to look after he spurred his old white plug up that way and the soldiers scuttled along after him mary is a real tropical bird says jones he s turned out the infantry to help us to honour to the fourth we ll get that cannon he spoke of after a while and fire some window breakers with it but just now i want some of that barbecued beef let us on to the plaza there we found the meat gloriously done and jerry waiting anxious we sat around on the grass and got hunks of it on our tin plates maximilian jones always made tender hearted by drink cried some because george washington couldn t be there to enjoy the day there was a man i love billy he says weeping on my shoulder poor george to think he s gone and missed the fireworks a little more salt please jerry from what we could hear general dingo seemed to be kindly contributing some noise while we feasted there were guns going off around town and pretty soon we heard that cannon go boom just as he said it would and then men began to skin along the edge of the plaza dodging in among the orange trees and houses we certainly had things stirred up in salvador we felt proud of the occasion and grateful to general dingo sterrett was about to take a bite off a juicy piece of rib when a bullet took it away from his mouth somebody s celebrating with ball cartridges says he reaching for another piece little over zealous for a non resident patriot isn t it don t mind it i says to him twas an accident they happen you know on the fourth after one reading of the declaration of independence in new york i ve known the s r o sign to be hung out at all the hospitals and police stations but then jerry gives a howl and jumps up with one hand clapped to the back of his leg where another bullet has acted over zealous and then comes a quantity of yells and round a corner and across the plaza gallops general mary esperanza dingo embracing the neck of his horse with his men running behind him mostly dropping their guns by way of discharging ballast and chasing em all is a company of feverish little warriors wearing blue trousers and caps assistance amigos the general shouts trying to stop his horse assistance in the name of liberty that s the campania azul the president s bodyguard says jones what a shame they ve jumped on poor old mary just because he was helping us to celebrate come on boys it s our fourth do we let that little squad of a d t s break it up i vote no says martin dillard gathering his winchester it s the privilege of an american citizen to drink drill dress up and be dreadful on the fourth of july no matter whose country he s in fellow citizens says old man billfinger in the darkest hour of freedom s birth when our brave forefathers promulgated the principles of undying liberty they never expected that a bunch of blue jays like that should be allowed to bust up an anniversary let us preserve and protect the constitution we made it unanimous and then we gathered our guns and assaulted the blue troops in force we fired over their heads and then charged em with a yell and they broke and ran we were irritated at having our barbecue disturbed and we chased em a quarter of a mile some of em we caught and kicked hard the general rallied his troops and joined in the chase finally they scattered in a thick banana grove and we couldn t flush a single one so we sat down and rested if i were to be put severe through the third degree i wouldn t be able to tell much about the rest of the day i mind that we pervaded the town considerable calling upon the people to bring out more armies for us to destroy i remember seeing a crowd somewhere and a tall man that wasn t billfinger making a fourth of july speech from a balcony and that was about all somebody must have hauled the old ice factory up to where i was and put it around me for there s where i was when i woke up the next morning as soon as i could recollect by name and address i got up and held an inquest my last cent was gone i was all in and then a neat black carriage drives to the door and out steps general dingo and a bay man in a silk hat and tan shoes yes says i to myself i see it now you re the chief de policeos and high lord chamberlain of the calaboosum and you want billy casparis for excess of patriotism and assault with intent all right might as well be in jail anyhow but it seems that general mary is smiling and the bay man shakes my hand and speaks in the american dialect general dingo has informed me senor casparis of your gallant service in our cause i desire to thank you with my person the bravery of you and the other senores americanos turned the struggle for liberty in our favour our party triumphed the terrible battle will live forever in history battle says i what battle and i ran my mind back along history trying to think senor casparis is modest says general dingo he led his brave compadres into the thickest of the fearful conflict yes without their aid the revolution would have failed why now says i don t tell me there was a revolution yesterday that was only a fourth of but right there i abbreviated it seemed to me it might be best after the terrible struggle says the bay man president bolano was forced to fly to day caballo is president by proclamation ah yes beneath the new administration i am the head of the department of mercantile concessions on my file i find one report senor casparis that you have not made ice in accord with your contract and here the bay man smiles at me cute oh well says i i guess the report s straight i know they caught me that s all there is to it do not say so says the bay man he pulls off a glove and goes over and lays his hand on that chunk of glass ice says he nodding his head solemn general dingo also steps over and feels of it ice says the general i ll swear to it if senor casparis says the bay man will present himself to the treasury on the sixth day of this month he will receive back the thousand dollars he did deposit as a forfeit adios senor the general and the bay man bowed themselves out and i bowed as often as they did and when the carriage rolls away through the sand i bows once more deeper than ever till my hat touches the ground but this time twas not intended for them for over their heads i saw the old flag fluttering in the breeze above the consul s roof and twas to it i made my profoundest salute the emancipation of billy in the old old square porticoed mansion with the wry window shutters and the paint peeling off in discoloured flakes lived one of the last war governors the south has forgotten the enmity of the great conflict but it refuses to abandon its old traditions and idols in governor pemberton as he was still fondly called the inhabitants of elmville saw the relic of their state s ancient greatness and glory in his day he had been a man large in the eye of his country his state had pressed upon him every honour within its gift and now when he was old and enjoying a richly merited repose outside the swift current of public affairs his townsmen loved to do him reverence for the sake of the past the governor s decaying mansion stood upon the main street of elmville within a few feet of its rickety paling fence every morning the governor would descend the steps with extreme care and deliberation on account of his rheumatism and then the click of his gold headed cane would be heard as he slowly proceeded up the rugged brick sidewalk he was now nearly seventy eight but he had grown old gracefully and beautifully his rather long smooth hair and flowing parted whiskers were snow white his full skirted frock croak was always buttoned snugly about his tall spare figure he wore a high well kept silk hat known as a plug in elmville and nearly always gloves his manners were punctilious and somewhat overcharged with courtesy the governor s walks up lee avenue the principal street developed in their course into a sort of memorial triumphant procession everyone he met saluted him with profound respect many would remove their hats those who were honoured with his personal friendship would pause to shake hands and then you would see exemplified the genuine beau ideal southern courtesy upon reaching the corner of the second square from the mansion the governor would pause another street crossed the venue there and traffic to the extent of several farmers wagons and a peddler s cart or two would rage about the junction then the falcon eye of general deffenbaugh would perceive the situation and the general would hasten with ponderous solicitude from his office in the first national bank building to the assistance of his old friend when the two exchanged greetings the decay of modern manners would become accusingly apparent the general s bulky and commanding figure would bend lissomely at a point where you would have regarded its ability to do so with incredulity the governor would take the general s arm and be piloted safely between the hay wagons and the sprinkling cart to the other side of the street proceeding to the post office in the care of his friend the esteemed statesmen would there hold an informal levee among the citizens who were come for their morning mail here gathering two or three prominent in law politics or family the pageant would make a stately progress along the avenue stopping at the palace hotel where perhaps would be found upon the register the name of some guest deemed worthy of an introduction to the state s venerable and illustrious son if any such were found an hour or two would be spent in recalling the faded glories of the governor s long vanished administration on the return march the general would invariably suggest that his excellency being no doubt fatigued it would be wise to recuperate for a few minutes at the drug emporium of mr appleby r fentress an elegant gentleman sir one of the chatham county fentresses so many of our best blooded families have had to go into trade sir since the war mr appleby r fentress was a connoisseur in fatigue indeed if he had not been his memory alone should have enabled him to prescribe for the majestic invasion of his pharmacy was a casual happening that had surprised him almost daily for years mr fentress knew the formula of and possessed the skill to compound a certain potion antagonistic to fatigue the salient ingredient of which he described no doubt in pharmaceutical terms as genuine old hand made clover leaf private stock nor did the ceremony of administering the potion ever vary mr fentress would first compound two of the celebrated mixtures one for the governor and the other for the general to sample then the governor would make this little speech in his high piping quavering voice no sir not one drop until you have prepared one for yourself and join us mr fentress your father sir was one of my most valued supporters and friends during my administration and any mark of esteem i can confer upon his son is not only a pleasure but a duty sir blushing with delight at the royal condescension the druggist would obey and all would drink to the general s toast the prosperity of our grand old state gentlemen the memory of her glorious past the health of her favourite son some one of the old guard was always at hand to escort the governor home sometimes the general s business duties denied him the privilege and then judge broomfield or colonel titus or one of the ashford county slaughters would be on hand to perform the rite such were the observances attendant upon the governor s morning stroll to the post office how much more magnificent impressive and spectacular then was the scene at public functions when the general would lead forth the silver haired relic of former greatness like some rare and fragile waxwork figure and trumpet his pristine eminence to his fellow citizens general deffenbaugh was the voice of elmville some said he was elmville at any rate he had no competitor as the mouthpiece he owned enough stock in the daily banner to dictate its utterance enough shares in the first national bank to be the referee of its loans and a war record that left him without a rival for first place at barbecues school commencements and decoration days besides these acquirements he was possessed with endowments his personality was inspiring and triumphant undisputed sway had moulded him to the likeness of a fatted roman emperor the tones of his voice were not otherwise than clarion to say that the general was public spirited would fall short of doing him justice he had spirit enough for a dozen publics and as a sure foundation for it all he had a heart that was big and stanch yes general deffenbaugh was elmville one little incident that usually occurred during the governor s morning walk has had its chronicling delayed by more important matters the procession was accustomed to halt before a small brick office on the avenue fronted by a short flight of steep wooden steps a modest tin sign over the door bore the words wm b pemberton attorney at law looking inside the general would roar hello billy my boy the less distinguished members of the escort would call morning billy the governor would pipe good morning william then a patient looking little man with hair turning gray along the temples would come down the steps and shake hands with each one of the party all elmville shook hands when it met the formalities concluded the little man would go back to his table heaped with law books and papers while the procession would proceed billy pemberton was as his sign declared a lawyer by profession by occupation and common consent he was the son of his father this was the shadow in which billy lived the pit out of which he had unsuccessfully striven for years to climb and he had come to believe the grave in which his ambitions were destined to be buried filial respect and duty he paid beyond the habit of most sons but he aspired to be known and appraised by his own deeds and worth after many years of tireless labour he had become known in certain quarters far from elmville as a master of the principles of the law twice he had gone to washington and argued cases before the highest tribunal with such acute logic and learning that the silken gowns on the bench had rustled from the force of it his income from his practice had grown until he was able to support his father in the old family mansion which neither of them would have thought of abandoning rickety as it was in the comfort and almost the luxury of the old extravagant days yet he remained to elmville as only billy pemberton the son of our distinguished and honoured fellow townsman ex governor pemberton thus was he introduced at public gatherings where he sometimes spoke haltingly and prosily for his talents were too serious and deep for extempore brilliancy thus was he presented to strangers and to the lawyers who made the circuit of the courts and so the daily banner referred to him in print to be the son of was his doom what ever he should accomplish would have to be sacrificed upon the altar of this magnificent but fatal parental precedence the peculiarity and the saddest thing about billy s ambition was that the only world he thirsted to conquer was elmville his nature was diffident and unassuming national or state honours might have oppressed him but above all things he hungered for the appreciation of the friends among whom he had been born and raised he would not have plucked one leaf from the garlands that were so lavishly bestowed upon his father he merely rebelled against having his own wreathes woven from those dried and self same branches but elmville billied and sonned him to his concealed but lasting chagrin until at length he grew more reserved and formal and studious than ever there came a morning when billy found among his mail a letter from a very high source tendering him the appointment to an important judicial position in the new island possessions of our country the honour was a distinguished one for the entire nation had discussed the probable recipients of these positions and had agreed that the situation demanded only men of the highest character ripe learning and evenly balanced mind billy could not subdue a certain exultation at this token of the success of his long and arduous labours but at the same time a whimsical smile lingered around his mouth for he foresaw in which column elmville would place the credit we congratulate governor pemberton upon the mark of appreciation conferred upon his son elmville rejoices with our honoured citizen governor pemberton at his son s success put her there billy judge billy pemberton sir son of our state s war hero and the people s pride these were the phrases printed and oral conjured up by billy s prophetic fancy grandson of his state and stepchild to elmville thus had fate fixed his kinship to the body politic billy lived with his father in the old mansion the two and an elderly lady a distant relative comprised the family perhaps though old jeff the governor s ancient coloured body servant should be included without doubt he could have claimed the honour there were other servants but thomas jefferson pemberton sah was a member of de fambly jeff was the one elmvillian who gave to billy the gold of approval unmixed with the alloy of paternalism to him mars william was the greatest man in talbot county beaten upon though he was by the shining light that emanates from an ex war governor and loyal as he remained to the old regime his faith and admiration were billy s as valet to a hero and a member of the family he may have had superior opportunities for judging jeff was the first one to whom bill revealed the news when he reached home for supper jeff took his plug hat and smoothed it before hanging it upon the hall rack dar now said the old man i knowed it was er comin i knowed it was gwine ter happen er judge you says mars william dem yankees done made you er judge it s high time sah dey was doin somep n to make up for

judge em from here i d have to live there most of the time of course said billy i wonder what de gubnor gwine say bout dat speculated jeff billy wondered too after supper when the two sat in the library according to their habit the governor smoking his clay pipe and billy his cigar the son dutifully confessed to having been tendered the appointment for a long time the governor sat smoking without making any comment billy reclined in his favourite rocker waiting perhaps still flushed with satisfaction over the tender that had come to him unsolicited in his dingy little office above the heads of the intriguing time serving clamorous multitude at last the governor spoke and though his words were seemingly irrelevant they were to the point his voice had a note of martyrdom running through its senile quaver my rheumatism has been growing steadily worse these past months william i am sorry father said billy gently and i am nearly seventy eight i am getting to be an old man i can recall the names of but two or three who were in public life during my administration what did you say is the nature of this position that is offered you william a federal judgeship father i believe it is considered to be a somewhat flattering tender it is outside of politics and wire pulling you know no doubt no doubt few of the pembertons have engaged in professional life for nearly a century none of them have ever held federal positions they have been land holders slave owners and planters on a large scale one of two of the derwents your mother s family were in the law have you decided to accept this appointment william i am thinking it over said billy slowly regarding the ash of his cigar you have been a good son to me continued the governor stirring his pipe with the handle of a penholder i ve been your son all my life said billy darkly i am often gratified piped the governor betraying a touch of complacency by being congratulated upon having a son with such sound and sterling qualities especially in this our native town is your name linked with mine in the talk of our citizens i never knew anyone to forget the vindculum murmured billy unintelligibly whatever prestige pursued the parent i may be possessed of by virtue of my name and services to the state has been yours to draw upon freely i have not hesitated to exert it in your behalf whenever opportunity offered and you have deserved it william you ve been the best of sons and now this appointment comes to take you away from me i have but a few years left to live i am almost dependent upon others now even in walking and dressing what would i do without you my son the governor s pipe dropped to the floor a tear trickled from his eye his voice had risen and crumbled to a weakling falsetto and ceased he was an old old man about to be bereft of a son that cherished him billy rose and laid his hand upon the governor s shoulder don t worry father he said cheerfully i m not going to accept elmville is good enough for me i ll write to night and decline it at the next interchange of devoirs between the governor and general deffenbaugh on lee avenue his excellency with a comfortable air of self satisfaction spoke of the appointment that had been tendered to billy the general whistled that s a plum for billy he shouted who d have thought that billy but confound it it s been in him all the time it s a boost for elmville it ll send real estate up it s an honour to our state it s a compliment to the south we ve all been blind about billy when does he leave we must have a reception great gatlings that job s eight thousand a year there s been a car load of lead pencils worn to stubs figuring on those appointments think of it our little wood sawing mealy mouthed billy angel unawares doesn t begin to express it elmville is disgraced forever until she lines up in a hurry for ratification and apology the venerable moloch smiled fatuously he carried the fire with which to consume all these tributes to billy the smoke of which would ascend as an incense to himself william said the governor with modest pride has declined the appointment he refuses to leave me in my old age he is a good son the general swung round and laid a large forefinger upon the bosom of his friend much of the general s success had been due to his dexterity in establishing swift lines of communication between cause and effect governor he said with a keen look in his big ox like eyes you ve been complaining to billy about your rheumatism my dear general replied the governor stiffly my son is forty two he is quite capable of deciding such questions for himself and i as his parent feel it my duty to state that your remark about er rheumatism is a mighty poor shot from a very small bore sir aimed at a purely personal and private affliction if you will allow me retorted the general you ve afflicted the public with it for some time and twas no small bore at that this first tiff between the two old comrades might have grown into something more serious but for the fortunate interruption caused by the ostentatious approach of colonel titus and another one of the court retinue from the right county to whom the general confided the coddled statesman and went his way after billy had so effectually entombed his ambitions and taken the veil so to speak in a sonnery he was surprised to discover how much lighter of heart and happier he felt he realized what a long restless struggle he had maintained and how much he had lost by failing to cull the simple but wholesome pleasures by the way his heart warmed now to elmville and the friends who had refused to set him upon a pedestal it was better he began to think to be billy and his father s son and to be hailed familiarly by cheery neighbours and grown up playmates than to be your honour and sit among strangers hearing maybe through the arguments of learned counsel that old man s feeble voice crying what would i do without you my son billy began to surprise his acquaintances by whistling as he walked up the street others he astounded by slapping them disrespectfully upon their backs and raking up old anecdotes he had not had the time to recollect for years though he hammered away at his law cases as thoroughly as ever he found more time for relaxation and the company of his friends some of the younger set were actually after him to join the golf club a striking proof of his abandonment to obscurity was his adoption of a most undignified rakish little soft hat reserving the plug for sundays and state occasions billy was beginning to enjoy elmville though that irreverent burgh had neglected to crown him with bay and myrtle all the while uneventful peace pervaded elmville the governor continued to make his triumphal parades to the post office with the general as chief marshal for the slight squall that had rippled their friendship had to all indications been forgotten by both but one day elmville woke to sudden excitement the news had come that a touring presidential party would honour elmville by a twenty minute stop the executive had promised a five minute address from the balcony of the palace hotel elmville rose as one man that man being of course general deffenbaugh to receive becomingly the chieftain of all the clans the train with the tiny stars and stripes fluttering from the engine pilot arrived elmville had done her best there were bands flowers carriages uniforms banners and committees without end high school girls in white frocks impeded the steps of the party with roses strewn nervously in bunches the chieftain had seen it all before scores of times he could have pictured it exactly in advance from the blue and gray speech down to the smallest rosebud yet his kindly smile of interest greeted elmville s display as if it had been the only and original in the upper rotunda of the palace hotel the town s most illustrious were assembled for the honour of being presented to the distinguished guests previous to the expected address outside elmville s inglorious but patriotic masses filled the streets here in the hotel general deffenbaugh was holding in reserve elmville s trump card elmville knew for the trump was a fixed one and its lead consecrated by archaic custom at the proper moment governor pemberton beautifully venerable magnificently antique tall paramount stepped forward upon the arm of the general elmville watched and harked with bated breath never until now when a northern president of the united states should clasp hands with ex war governor pemberton would the breach be entirely closed would the country be made one and indivisible no north not much south very little east and no west to speak of so elmville excitedly scraped kalsomine from the walls of the palace hotel with its sunday best and waited for the voice to speak and billy we had nearly forgotten billy he was cast for son and he waited patiently for his cue he carried his plug in his hand and felt serene he admired his father s striking air and pose after all it was a great deal to be a son of a man who could so gallantly hold the position of a cynosure for three generations general deffenbaugh cleared his throat elmville opened its mouth and squirmed the chieftain with the kindly fateful face was holding out his hand smiling ex war governor pemberton extended his own across the chasm but what was this the general was saying mr president allow me to present to you one who has the honour to be the father of our foremost distinguished citizen learned and honoured jurist beloved townsman and model southern gentleman the honourable william b pemberton the enchanted kiss but a clerk in the cut rate drug store was samuel tansey yet his slender frame was a pad that enfolded the passion of romeo the gloom of laura the romance of d artagnan and the desperate inspiration of melnotte pity then that he had been denied expression that he was doomed to the burden of utter timidity and diffidence that fate had set him tongue tied and scarlet before the muslin clad angels whom he adored and vainly longed to rescue clasp comfort and subdue the clock s hands were pointing close upon the hour of ten while tansey was playing billiards with a number of his friends on alternate evenings he was released from duty at the store after seven o clock even among his fellow men tansey was timorous and constrained in his imagination he had done valiant deeds and performed acts of distinguished gallantry but in fact he was a sallow youth of twenty three with an over modest demeanour and scant vocabulary when the clock struck ten tansey hastily laid down his cue and struck sharply upon the show case with a coin for the attendant to come and receive the pay for his score what s your hurry tansey called one got another engagement tansey got an engagement echoed another not on your life tansey s got to get home at motten by her peek s orders it s no such thing chimed in a pale youth taking a large cigar from his mouth tansey s afraid to be late because miss katie might come down stairs to unlock the door and kiss him in the hall this last delicate piece of raillery sent a fiery tingle into tansey s blood for the indictment was true barring the kiss that was a thing to dream of to wildly hope for but too remote and sacred a thing to think of lightly casting a cold and contemptuous look at the speaker a punishment commensurate with his own diffident spirit tansey left the room descending the stairs into the street for two years he had silently adored miss peek worshipping her from a spiritual distance through which her attractions took on stellar brightness and mystery mrs peek kept a few choice boarders among whom was tansey the other young men romped with katie chased her with crickets in their fingers and jollied her with an irreverent freedom that turned tansey s heart into cold lead in his bosom the signs of his adoration were few a tremulous good morning stealthy glances at her during meals and occasionally oh rapture a blushing delirious game of cribbage with her in the parlour on some rare evening when a miraculous lack of engagement kept her at home kiss him in the hall aye he feared it but it was an ecstatic fear such as elijah must have felt when the chariot lifted him into the unknown but to night the gibes of his associates had stung him to a feeling of forward lawless mutiny a defiant challenging atavistic recklessness spirit of corsair adventurer lover poet bohemian possessed him the stars he saw above him seemed no more unattainable no less high than the favour of miss peek or the fearsome sweetness of her delectable lips his fate seemed to him strangely dramatic and pathetic and to call for a solace consonant with its extremity a saloon was near by and to this he flitted calling for absinthe beyond doubt the drink most adequate to his mood the tipple of the roue the abandoned the vainly sighing lover once he drank of it and again and then again until he felt a strange exalted sense of non participation in worldly affairs pervade him tansey was no drinker his consumption of three absinthe anisettes within almost as few minutes proclaimed his unproficiency in the art tansey was merely flooding with unproven liquor his sorrows which record and tradition alleged to be drownable coming out upon the sidewalk he snapped his fingers defiantly in the direction of the peek homestead turned the other way and voyaged columbus like into the wilds of an enchanted street nor is the figure exorbitant for beyond his store the foot of tansey had scarcely been set for years store and boarding house between these ports he was charted to run and contrary currents had rarely deflected his prow tansey aimlessly protracted his walk and whether it was his unfamiliarity with the district his recent accession of audacious errantry or the sophistical whisper of a certain green eyed fairy he came at last to tread a shuttered blank and echoing thoroughfare dark and unpeopled and suddenly this way came to an end as many streets do in the spanish built archaic town of san antone butting its head against an imminent high brick wall no the street still lived to the right and to the left it breathed through slender tubes of exit narrow somnolent ravines cobble paved and unlighted accommodating a rise in the street to the right was reared a phantom flight of five luminous steps of limestone flanked by a wall of the same height and of the same material upon one of these steps tansey seated himself and bethought him of his love and how she might never know she was his love and of mother peek fat vigilant and kind not unpleased tansey thought that he and katie should play cribbage in the parlour together for the cut rate had not cut his salary which sordidly speaking ranked him star boarder at the peek s and he thought of captain peek katie s father a man he dreaded and abhorred a genteel loafer and spendthrift battening upon the labour of his women folk a very queer fish and according to repute not of the freshest the night had turned chill and foggy the heart of the town with its noises was left behind reflected from the high vapours its distant lights were manifest in quivering cone shaped streamers in questionable blushes of unnamed colours in unstable ghostly waves of far electric flashes now that the darkness was become more friendly the wall against which the street splintered developed a stone coping topped with an armature of spikes beyond it loomed what appeared to be the acute angles of mountain peaks pierced here and there by little lambent parallelograms considering this vista tansey at length persuaded himself that the seeming mountains were in fact the convent of santa mercedes with which ancient and bulky pile he was better familiar from different coigns of view a pleasant note of singing in his ears reinforced his opinion high sweet holy carolling far and harmonious and uprising as of sanctified nuns at their responses at what hour did the sisters sing he tried to think was it six eight twelve tansey leaned his back against the limestone wall and wondered strange things followed the air was full of white fluttering pigeons that circled about and settled upon the convent wall the wall blossomed with a quantity of shining green eyes that blinked and peered at him from the solid masonry a pink classic nymph came from an excavation in the cavernous road and danced barefoot and airy upon the ragged flints the sky was traversed by a company of beribboned cats marching in stupendous aerial procession the noise of singing grew louder an illumination of unseasonable fireflies danced past and strange whispers came out of the dark without meaning or excuse without amazement tansey took note of these phenomena he was on some new plane of understanding though his mind seemed to him clear and indeed happily tranquil a desire for movement and exploration seized him he rose and turned into the black gash of street to his right for a time the high wall formed one of its boundaries but further on two rows of black windowed houses closed it in here was the city s quarter once given over to the spaniard here were still his forbidding abodes of concrete and adobe standing cold and indomitable against the century from the murky fissure the eye saw flung against the sky the tangled filigree of his moorish balconies through stone archways breaths of dead vault chilled air coughed upon him his feet struck jingling iron rings in staples stone buried for half a cycle along these paltry avenues had swaggered the arrogant don had caracoled and serenaded and blustered while the tomahawk and the pioneer s rifle were already uplifted to expel him from a continent and tansey stumbling through this old world dust looked up dark as it was and saw andalusian beauties glimmering on the balconies some of them were laughing and listening to the goblin music that still followed others harked fearfully through the night trying to catch the hoof beats of caballeros whose last echoes from those stones had died away a century ago those women were silent but tansey heard the jangle of horseless bridle bits the whirr of riderless rowels and now and then a muttered malediction in a foreign tongue but he was not frightened shadows nor shadows of sounds could daunt him afraid no afraid of mother peek afraid to face the girl of his heart afraid of tipsy captain peek nay nor of these apparitions nor of that spectral singing that always pursued him singing he would show them he lifted up a strong and untuneful voice when you hear them bells go tingalingling serving notice upon those mysterious agencies that if it should come to a face to face encounter there ll be a hot time in the old town to night how long tansey consumed in treading this haunted byway was not clear to him but in time he emerged into a more commodious avenue when within a few yards of the corner he perceived through a window that a small confectionary of mean appearance was set in the angle his same glance that estimated its meagre equipment its cheap soda water fountain and stock of tobacco and sweets took cognizance of captain peek within lighting a cigar at a swinging gaslight as tansey rounded the corner captain peek came out and they met vis a vis an exultant joy filled tansey when he found himself sustaining the encounter with implicit courage peek indeed he raised his hand and snapped his fingers loudly it was peek himself who quailed guiltily before the valiant mien of the drug clerk sharp surprise and a palpable fear bourgeoned upon the captain s face and verily that face was one to rather call up such expressions on the faces of others the face of a libidinous heathen idol small eyed with carven folds in the heavy jowls and a consuming pagan license in its expression in the gutter just beyond the store tansey saw a closed carriage standing with its back toward him and a motionless driver perched in his place why it s tansey exclaimed captain peek how are you tansey h have a cigar tansey why it s peek cried tansey jubilant at his own temerity what deviltry are you up to now peek back streets and a closed carriage fie peek there s no one in the carriage said the captain smoothly everybody out of it is in luck continued tansey aggressively i d love for you to know peek that i m not stuck on you you re a bottle nosed scoundrel why the little rat s drunk cried the captain joyfully only drunk and i thought he was on go home tansey and quit bothering grown persons on the street but just then a white clad figure sprang out of the carriage and a shrill voice katie s voice sliced the air sam sam help me sam tansey sprung toward her but captain peek interposed his bulky form wonder of wonders the whilom spiritless youth struck out with his right and the hulking captain went over in a swearing heap tansey flew to katie and took her in his arms like a conquering knight she raised her face and he kissed her violets electricity caramels champagne here was the attainment of a dream that brought no disenchantment oh sam cried katie when she could i knew you would come to rescue me what do you suppose the mean things were going to do with me have your picture taken said tansey wondering at the foolishness of his remark no they were going to eat me i heard them talking about it eat you said tansey after pondering a moment that can t be there s no plates but a sudden noise warned him to turn down upon him were bearing the captain and a monstrous long bearded dwarf in a spangled cloak and red trunk hose the dwarf leaped twenty feet and clutched them the captain seized katie and hurled her shrieking back into the carriage himself followed and the vehicle dashed away the dwarf lifted tansey high above his head and ran with him into the store holding him with one hand he raised the lid of an enormous chest half filled with cakes of ice flung tansey inside and closed down the cover the force of the fall must have been great for tansey lost consciousness when his faculties revived his first sensation was one of severe cold along his back and limbs opening his eyes he found himself to be seated upon the limestone steps still facing the wall and convent of santa mercedes his first thought was of the ecstatic kiss from katie the outrageous villainy of captain peek the unnatural mystery of the situation his preposterous conflict with the improbable dwarf these things roused and angered him but left no impression of the unreal i ll go back there to morrow he grumbled aloud and knock the head off that comic opera squab running out and picking up perfect strangers and shoving them into cold storage but the kiss remained uppermost in his mind i might have done that long ago he mused she liked it too she called me sam four times i ll not go up that street again too much scrapping guess i ll move down the other way wonder what she meant by saying they were going to eat her tansey began to feel sleepy but after a while he decided to move along again this time he ventured into the street to his left it ran level for a distance and then dipped gently downward opening into a vast dim barren space the old military plaza to his left some hundred yards distant he saw a cluster of flickering lights along the plaza s border he knew the locality at once huddled within narrow confines were the remnants of the once famous purveyors of the celebrated mexican national cookery a few years before their nightly encampments upon the historic alamo plaza in the heart of the city had been a carnival a saturnalia that was renowned throughout the land then the caterers numbered hundreds the patrons thousands drawn by the coquettish senoritas the music of the weird spanish minstrels and the strange piquant mexican dishes served at a hundred competing tables crowds thronged the alamo plaza all night travellers rancheros family parties gay gasconading rounders sightseers and prowlers of polyglot owlish san antone mingled there at the centre of the city s fun and frolic the popping of corks pistols and questions the glitter of eyes jewels and daggers the ring of laughter and coin these were the order of the night but now no longer to some half dozen tents fires and tables had dwindled the picturesque festival and these had been relegated to an ancient disused plaza often had tansey strolled down to these stands at night to partake of the delectable chili con carne a dish evolved by the genius of mexico composed of delicate meats minced with aromatic herbs and the poignant chili colorado a compound full of singular flavour and a fiery zest delightful to the southron s palate the titillating odour of this concoction came now on the breeze to the nostrils of tansey awakening in him hunger for it as he turned in that direction he saw a carriage dash up to the mexicans tents out of the gloom of the plaza some figures moved back and forward in the uncertain light of the lanterns and then the carriage was driven swiftly away tansey approached and sat at one of the tables covered with gaudy oil cloth traffic was dull at the moment a few half grown boys noisily fared at another table the mexicans hung listless and phlegmatic about their wares and it was still the night hum of the city crowded to the wall of dark buildings surrounding the plaza and subsided to an indefinite buzz through which sharply perforated the crackle of the languid fires and the rattle of fork and spoon a sedative wind blew from the southeast the starless firmament pressed down upon the earth like a leaden cover in all that quiet tansey turned his head suddenly and saw without disquietude a troop of spectral horsemen deploy into the plaza and charge a luminous line of infantry that advanced to sustain the shock he saw the fierce flame of cannon and small arms but heard no sound the careless victuallers lounged vacantly not deigning to view the conflict tansey mildly wondered to what nations these mute combatants might belong turned his back to them and ordered his chili and coffee from the mexican woman who advanced to serve him this woman was old and careworn her face was lined like the rind of a cantaloupe she fetched the viands from a vessel set by the smouldering fire and then retired to a tent dark within that stood near by presently tansey heard a turmoil in the tent a wailing broken hearted pleading in the harmonious spanish tongue and then two figures tumbled out into the light of the lanterns one was the old woman the other was a man clothed with a sumptuous and flashing splendour the woman seemed to clutch and beseech from him something against his will the man broke from her and struck her brutally back into the tent where she lay whimpering and invisible observing tansey he walked rapidly to the table where he sat tansey recognized him to be ramon torres a mexican the proprietor of the stand he was patronizing torres was a handsome nearly full blooded descendant of the spanish seemingly about thirty years of age and of a haughty but extremely courteous demeanour to night he was dressed with signal magnificence his costume was that of a triumphant matador made of purple velvet almost hidden by jeweled embroidery diamonds of enormous size flashed upon his garb and his hands he reached for a chair and seating himself at the opposite side of the table began to roll a finical cigarette ah meester tanse he said with a sultry fire in his silky black eyes i give myself pleasure to see you this evening meester tansee you have many times come to eat at my table i theenk you a safe man a verree good friend how much would it please you to leeve forever not come back any more inquired tansey no not leave leeve the not to die i

tansee oh twenty eight or thirty thees day said the mexican ees my birthday i am four hundred and three years of old to day another proof said tansey airily of the healthfulness of our climate eet is

woman try to scr r ratch my face ha ha meester tansee same way they do entre los americanos and this health food you spoke of said tansey hear me said torres leaning over the table until he lay flat upon it eet is the chili con carne made not from the beef or the chicken but from the flesh of the senorita young and tender that ees the secret everee month you must eat of it having care to do so before the moon is full and you will not die any times see how i trust you friend tansee to night i have bought one young ladee verree pretty so fina gorda blandita to morrow the chili will be ready ahora si one thousand dollars i pay for thees young ladee from an americano i have bought a verree tip top man el capitan peek que es senor for tansey had sprung to his feet upsetting the chair the words of katie reverberated in his ears they re going to eat me sam this then was the monstrous fate to which she had been delivered by her unnatural parent the carriage he had seen drive up from the plaza was captain peek s where was katie perhaps already before he could decide what to do a loud scream came from the tent the old mexican woman ran out a flashing knife in her hand i have released her she cried you shall kill no more they will hang you ingrato encatador torres with a hissing exclamation sprang at her ramoncito she shrieked once you loved me the mexican s arm raised and descended you are old he cried and she fell and lay motionless another scream the flaps of the tent were flung aside and there stood katie white with fear her wrists still bound with a cruel cord sam she cried save me again tansey rounded the table and flung himself with superb nerve upon the mexican just then a clangour began the clocks of the city were tolling the midnight hour tansey clutched at torres and for a moment felt in his grasp the crunch of velvet and the cold facets of the glittering gems the next instant the bedecked caballero turned in his hands to a shrunken leather visaged white bearded old old screaming mummy sandalled ragged and four hundred and three the mexican woman was crawling to her feet and laughing she shook her brown hand in the face of the whining viejo go now she cried and seek your senorita it was i ramoncito who brought you to this within each moon you eat of the life giving chili it was i that kept the wrong time for you you should have eaten yesterday instead of to morrow it is too late off with you hombre you are too old for me this decided tansey releasing his hold of the gray beard is a private family matter concerning age and no business of mine with one of the table knives he hastened to saw asunder the fetters of the fair captive and then for the second time that night he kissed katie peek tasted again the sweetness the wonder the thrill of it attained once more the maximum of his incessant dreams the next instant an icy blade was driven deep between his shoulders he felt his blood slowly congeal heard the senile cackle of the perennial spaniard saw the plaza rise and reel till the zenith crashed into the horizon and knew no more when tansey opened his eyes again he was sitting upon those self same steps gazing upon the dark bulk of the sleeping convent in the middle of his back was still the acute chilling pain how had he been conveyed back there again he got stiffly to his feet and stretched his cramped limbs supporting himself against the stonework he revolved in his mind the extravagant adventures that had befallen him each time he had strayed from the steps that night in reviewing them certain features strained his credulity had he really met captain peek or katie or the unparalleled mexican in his wanders had he really encountered them under commonplace conditions and his over stimulated brain had supplied the incongruities however that might be a sudden elating thought caused him an intense joy nearly all of us have at some point in our lives either to excuse our own stupidity or to placate our consciences promulgated some theory of fatalism we have set up an intelligent fate that works by codes and signals tansey had done likewise and now he read through the night s incidents the finger prints of destiny each excursion that he had made had led to the one paramount finale to katie and that kiss which survived and grew strong and intoxicating in his memory clearly fate was holding up to him the mirror that night calling him to observe what awaited him at the end of whichever road he might take he immediately turned and hurried homeward clothed in an elaborate pale blue wrapper cut to fit miss katie peek reclined in an armchair before a waning fire in her room her little bare feet were thrust into house shoes rimmed with swan s down by the light of a small lamp she was attacking the society news of the latest sunday paper some happy substance seemingly indestructible was being rhythmically crushed between her small white teeth miss katie read of functions and furbelows but she kept a vigilant ear for outside sounds and a frequent eye upon the clock over the mantel at every footstep upon the asphalt sidewalk her smooth round chin would cease for a moment its regular rise and fall and a frown of listening would pucker her pretty brows at last she heard the latch of the iron gate click she sprang up tripped softly to the mirror where she made a few of those feminine flickering passes at her front hair and throat which are warranted to hypnotize the approaching guest the door bell rang miss katie in her haste turned the blaze of the lamp lower instead of higher and hastened noiselessly down stairs into the hall she turned the key the door opened and mr tansey side stepped in why the i de a exclaimed miss katie is this you mr tansey it s after midnight aren t you ashamed to wake me up at such an hour to let you in you re just awful i was late said tansey brilliantly i should think you were ma was awfully worried about you when you weren t in by ten that hateful tom mcgill said you were out calling on another said you were out calling on some young lady i just despise mr mcgill well i m not going to scold you any more mr tansey if it is a little late oh i turned it the wrong way miss katie gave a little scream absent mindedly she had turned the blaze of the lamp entirely out instead of higher it was very dark tansey heard a musical soft giggle and breathed an entrancing odour of heliotrope a groping light hand touched his arm how awkward i was can you find your way sam i i think i have a match miss k katie a scratching sound a flame a glow of light held at arm s length by the recreant follower of destiny illuminating a tableau which shall end the ignominious chronicle a maid with unkissed curling contemptuous lips slowly lifting the lamp chimney and allowing the wick to ignite then waving a scornful and abjuring hand toward the staircase the unhappy tansey erstwhile champion in the prophetic lists of fortune ingloriously ascending to his just and certain doom while let us imagine half within the wings stands the imminent figure of fate jerking wildly at the wrong strings and mixing things up in her usual able manner a departmental case in texas you may travel a thousand miles in a straight line if your course is a crooked one it is likely that both the distance and your rate of speed

accepted the honour with some doubt as to the nature of the office he was to fill and his capacity for filling it but he accepted and by wire he immediately set out from the little country town where he maintained and was scarcely maintained by a somnolent and unfruitful office of surveying and map drawing before departing he had looked up under the i s s s and h s in the encyclopaedia britannica what information and preparation toward his official duties that those weighty volumes afforded a few weeks of incumbency diminished the new commissioner s awe of the great and important office he had been called upon to conduct an increasing familiarity with its workings soon restored him to his accustomed placid course of life in his office was an old spectacled clerk a consecrated informed able machine who held his desk regardless of changes of administrative heads old kauffman instructed his new chief gradually in the knowledge of the department without seeming to do so and kept the wheels revolving without the slip of a cog indeed the department of insurance statistics and history carried no great heft of the burden of state its main work was the regulating of the business done in the state by foreign insurance companies and the letter of the law was its guide as for statistics well you wrote letters to county officers and scissored other people s reports and each year you got out a report of your own about the corn crop and the cotton crop and pecans and pigs and black and white population and a great many columns of figures headed bushels and acres and square miles etc and there you were history the branch was purely a receptive one old ladies interested in the science bothered you some with long reports of proceedings of their historical societies some twenty or thirty people would write you each year that they had secured sam houston s pocket knife or santa ana s whisky flask or davy crockett s rifle all absolutely authenticated and demanded legislative appropriation to purchase most of the work in the history branch went into pigeon holes one sizzling august afternoon the commissioner reclined in his office chair with his feet upon the long official table covered with green billiard cloth the commissioner was smoking a cigar and dreamily regarding the quivering landscape framed by the window that looked upon the treeless capitol grounds perhaps he was thinking of the rough and ready life he had led of the old days of breathless adventure and movement of the comrades who now trod other paths or had ceased to tread any of the changes civilization and peace had brought and maybe complacently of the snug and comfortable camp pitched for him under the dome of the capitol of the state that had not forgotten his services the business of the department was lax insurance was easy statistics were not in demand history was dead old kauffman the efficient and perpetual clerk had requested an infrequent half holiday incited to the unusual dissipation by the joy of having successfully twisted the tail of a connecticut insurance company that was trying to do business contrary to the edicts of the great lone star state the office was very still a few subdued noises trickled in through the open door from the other departments a dull tinkling crash from the treasurer s office adjoining as a clerk tossed a bag of silver to the floor of the vault the vague intermittent clatter of a dilatory typewriter a dull tapping from the state geologist s quarters as if some woodpecker had flown in to bore for his prey in the cool of the massive building and then a faint rustle and the light shuffling of the well worn shoes along the hall the sounds ceasing at the door toward which the commissioner s lethargic back was presented following this the sound of a gentle voice speaking words unintelligible to the commissioner s somewhat dormant comprehension but giving evidence of bewilderment and hesitation the voice was feminine the commissioner was of the race of cavaliers who make salaam before the trail of a skirt without considering the quality of its cloth there stood in the door a faded woman one of the numerous sisterhood of the unhappy she was dressed all in black poverty s perpetual mourning for lost joys her face had the contours of twenty and the lines of forty she may have lived that intervening score of years in a twelve month there was about her yet an aurum of indignant unappeased protesting youth that shone faintly through the premature veil of unearned decline i beg your pardon ma am said the commissioner gaining his feet to the accompaniment of a great creaking and sliding of his chair are you the governor sir asked the vision of melancholy the commissioner hesitated at the end of his best bow with his hand in the bosom of his double breasted frock truth at last conquered well no ma am i am not the governor i have the honour to be commissioner of insurance statistics and history is there anything ma am i can do for you won t you have a chair ma am the lady subsided into the chair handed her probably from purely physical reasons she wielded a cheap fan last token of gentility to be abandoned her clothing seemed to indicate a reduction almost to extreme poverty she looked at the man who was not the governor and saw kindliness and simplicity and a rugged unadorned courtliness emanating from a countenance tanned and toughened by forty years of outdoor life also she saw that his eyes were clear and strong and blue just so they had been when he used them to skim the horizon for raiding kiowas and sioux his mouth was as set and firm as it had been on that day when he bearded the old lion sam houston himself and defied him during that season when secession was the theme now in bearing and dress luke coonrod sandifer endeavoured to do credit to the important arts and sciences of insurance statistics and history he had abandoned the careless dress of his country home now his broad brimmed black slouch hat and his long tailed frock made him not the least imposing of the official family even if his office was reckoned to stand at the tail of the list you wanted to see the governor ma am asked the commissioner with a deferential manner he always used toward the fair sex i hardly know said the lady hesitatingly i suppose so and then suddenly drawn by the sympathetic look of the other she poured forth the story of her need it was a story so common that the public has come to look at its monotony instead of its pity the old tale of an unhappy married life made so by a brutal conscienceless husband a robber a spendthrift a moral coward and a bully who failed to provide even the means of the barest existence yes he had come down in the scale so low as to strike her it happened only the day before there was the bruise on one temple she had offended his highness by asking for a little money to live on and yet she must needs woman like append a plea for her tyrant he was drinking he had rarely abused her thus when sober i thought mourned this pale sister of sorrow that maybe the state might be willing to give me some relief i ve heard of such things being done for the families of old settlers i ve heard tell that the state used to give land to the men who fought for it against mexico and settled up the country and helped drive out the indians my father did all of that and he never received anything he never would take it i thought the governor would be the one to see and that s why i came if father was entitled to anything they might let it come to me it s possible ma am said standifer that such might be the case but most all the veterans and settlers got their land certificates issued and located long ago still we can look that up in the land office and be sure your father s name now was amos colvin sir good lord exclaimed standifer rising and unbuttoning his tight coat excitedly are you amos colvin s daughter why ma am amos colvin and me were thicker than two hoss thieves for more than ten years we fought kiowas drove cattle and rangered side by side nearly all over texas i remember seeing you once before now you were a kid about seven a riding a little yellow pony up and down amos and me stopped at your home for a little grub when we were trailing that band of mexican cattle thieves down through karnes and bee great tarantulas and you re amos colvin s little girl did you ever hear your father mention luke standifer just kind of casually as if he d met me once or twice a little pale smile flitted across the lady s white face it seems to me she said that i don t remember hearing him talk about much else every day there was some story he had to tell about what he and you had done mighty near the last thing i heard him tell was about the time when the indians wounded him and you crawled out to him through the grass with a canteen of water while they yes yes well oh that wasn t anything said standifer hemming loudly and buttoning his coat again briskly and now ma am who was the infernal skunk i beg your pardon ma am who was the gentleman you married benton sharp the commissioner plumped down again into his chair with a groan this gentle sad little woman in the rusty black gown the daughter of his oldest friend the wife of benton sharp benton sharp one of the most noted bad men in that part of the state a man who had been a cattle thief an outlaw a desperado and was now a gambler a swaggering bully who plied his trade in the larger frontier towns relying upon his record and the quickness of his gun play to maintain his supremacy seldom did any one take the risk of going up against benton sharp even the law officers were content to let him make his own terms of peace sharp was a ready and an accurate shot and as lucky as a brand new penny at coming clear from his scrapes standifer wondered how this pillaging eagle ever came to be mated with amos colvin s little dove and expressed his wonder mrs sharp sighed you see mr standifer we didn t know anything about him and he can be very pleasant and kind when he wants to we lived down in the little town of goliad benton came riding down that way and stopped there a while i reckon i was some better looking then than i am now he was good to me for a whole year after we were married he insured his life for me for five thousand dollars but for the last six months he has done everything but kill me i often wish he had done that too he got out of money for a while and abused me shamefully for not having anything he could spend then father died and left me the little home in goliad my husband made me sell that and turned me out into the world i ve barely been able to live for i m not strong enough to work lately i heard he was making money in san antonio so i went there and found him and asked for a little help this touching the livid bruise on her temple is what he gave me so i came on to austin to see the governor i once heard father say that there was some land or a pension coming to him from the state that he never would ask for luke standifer rose to his feet and pushed his chair back he looked rather perplexedly around the big office with its handsome furniture it s a long trail to follow he said slowly trying to get back dues from the government there s red tape and lawyers and rulings and evidence and courts to keep you waiting i m not certain continued the commissioner with a profoundly meditative frown whether this department that i m the boss of has any jurisdiction or not it s only insurance statistics and history ma am and it don t sound as if it would cover the case but sometimes a saddle blanket can be made to stretch you keep your seat just for a few minutes ma am till i step into the next room and see about it the state treasurer was seated within his massive complicated railings reading a newspaper business for the day was about over the clerks lolled at their desks awaiting the closing hour the commissioner of insurance statistics and history entered and leaned in at the window the treasurer a little brisk old man with snow white moustache and beard jumped up youthfully and came forward to greet standifer they were friends of old uncle frank said the commissioner using the familiar name by which the historic treasurer was addressed by every texan how much money have you got on hand the treasurer named the sum of the last balance down to the odd cents something more than a million dollars the commissioner whistled lowly and his eyes grew hopefully bright you know or else you ve heard of amos colvin uncle frank knew him well said the treasurer promptly a good man a valuable citizen one of the first settlers in the southwest his daughter said standifer is sitting in my office she s penniless she s married to benton sharp a coyote and a murderer he s reduced her to want and broken her heart her father helped build up this state and it s the state s turn to help his child a couple of thousand dollars will buy back her home and let her live in peace the state of texas can t afford to refuse it give me the money uncle frank and i ll give it to her right away we ll fix up the red tape business afterward the treasurer looked a little bewildered why standifer he said you know i can t pay a cent out of the treasury without a warrant from the comptroller i can t disburse a dollar without a voucher to show for it the commissioner betrayed a slight impatience i ll give you a voucher he declared what s this job they ve given me for am i just a knot on a mesquite stump can t my office stand for it charge it up to insurance and the other two sideshows don t statistics show that amos colvin came to this state when it was in the hands of greasers and rattlesnakes and comanches and fought day and night to make a white man s country of it don t they show that amos colvin s daughter is brought to ruin by a villain who s trying to pull down what you and i and old texans shed our blood to build up don t history show that the lone star state never yet failed to grant relief to the suffering and oppressed children of the men who made her the grandest commonwealth in the union if statistics and history don t bear out the claim of amos colvin s child i ll ask the next legislature to abolish my office come now uncle frank let her have the money i ll sign the papers officially if you say so and then if the governor or the comptroller or the janitor or anybody else makes a kick by the lord i ll refer the matter to the people and see if they won t endorse the act the treasurer looked sympathetic but shocked the commissioner s voice had grown louder as he rounded off the sentences that however praiseworthy they might be in sentiment reflected somewhat upon the capacity of the head of a more or less important department of state the clerks were beginning to listen now standifer said the treasurer soothingly you know i d like to help in this matter but stop and think a moment please every cent in the treasury is expended only by appropriation made by the legislature and drawn out by checks issued by the comptroller i can t control the use of a cent of it neither can you your department isn t disbursive it isn t even administrative it s purely clerical the only way for the lady to obtain relief is to petition the legislature and to the devil with the legislature said standifer turning away the treasurer called him back i d be glad standifer to contribute a hundred dollars personally toward the immediate expenses of colvin s daughter he reached for his pocketbook never mind uncle frank said the commissioner in a softer tone there s no need of that she hasn t asked for anything of that sort yet besides her case is in my hands i see now what a little rag tag bob tail gotch eared department i ve been put in charge of it seems to be about as important as an almanac or a hotel register but while i m running it it won t turn away any daughters of amos colvin without stretching its jurisdiction to cover if possible you want to keep your eye on the department of insurance statistics and history the commissioner returned to his office looking thoughtful he opened and closed an inkstand on his desk many times with extreme and undue attention why don t you get a divorce he asked suddenly i haven t the money to pay for it answered the lady just at present announced the commissioner in a formal tone the powers of my department appear to be considerably string halted statistics seem to be overdrawn at the bank and history isn t good for a square meal but you ve come to the right place ma am the department will see you through where did you say your husband is ma am he was in san antonio yesterday he is living there now suddenly the commissioner abandoned his official air he took the faded little woman s hands in his and spoke in the old voice he used on the trail and around campfires your name s amanda isn t it yes sir i thought so i ve heard your dad say it often enough well amanda here s your father s best friend the head of a big office in the state government that s going to help you out of your troubles and here s the old bushwhacker and cowpuncher that your father has helped out of scrapes time and time again wants to ask you a question amanda have you got money enough to run you for the next two or three days mrs sharp s white face flushed the least bit plenty sir for a few days all right then ma am now you go back where you are stopping here and you come to the office again the day after to morrow at four o clock in the afternoon very likely by that time there will be something definite to report to you the commissioner hesitated and looked a trifle embarrassed you said your husband had insured his life for do you know whether the premiums have been kept paid upon it or not he paid for a whole year in advance about five months ago said mrs sharp i have the policy and receipts in my trunk oh that s all right then said standifer it s best to look after things of that sort some day they may come in handy mrs sharp departed and soon afterward luke standifer went down to the little hotel where he boarded and looked up the railroad time table in the daily paper half an hour later he removed his coat and vest and strapped a peculiarly constructed pistol holster across his shoulders leaving the receptacle close under his left armpit into the holster he shoved a short barrelled calibre revolver putting on his clothes again he strolled to the station and caught the five twenty afternoon train for san antonio the san antonio express of the following morning contained this sensational piece of news benton sharp meets his match the most noted desperado in southwest texas shot to death in the gold front restaurant prominent state official successfully defends himself against the noted bully magnificent exhibition of quick gun play last night about eleven o clock benton sharp with two other men entered the gold front restaurant and seated themselves at a table sharp had been drinking and was loud and boisterous as he always was when under the influence of liquor five minutes after the party was seated a tall well dressed elderly gentleman entered the restaurant few present recognized the honourable luke standifer the recently appointed commissioner of insurance statistics and history going over to the same side where sharp was mr standifer prepared to take a seat at the next table in hanging his hat upon one of the hooks along the wall he let it fall upon sharp s head sharp turned being in an especially ugly humour and cursed the other roundly mr standifer apologized calmly for the accident but sharp continued his vituperations mr standifer was observed to draw near and speak a few sentences to the desperado in so low a tone that no one else caught the words sharp sprang up wild with rage in the meantime standifer had stepped some yards away and was standing quietly with his arms folded across the breast of his loosely hanging coat with that impetuous and deadly rapidity that made sharp so dreaded he reached for the gun he always carried in his hip pocket a movement that has preceded the death of at least a dozen men at his hands quick as the motion was the bystanders assert that it was met by the most beautiful exhibition of lightning gun pulling ever witnessed in the southwest as sharp s pistol was being raised and the act was really quicker than the eye could follow a glittering appeared as if by some conjuring trick in the right hand of mr standifer who without a perceptible movement of his arm shot benton sharp through the heart it seems that the new commissioner of insurance statistics and history has been an old time indian fighter and ranger for many years which accounts for the happy knack he has of handling a it is not believed that mr standifer will be put to any inconvenience beyond a necessary formal hearing to day as all the witnesses who were present unite in declaring that the deed was done in self defence when mrs sharp appeared at the office of the commissioner according to appointment she found that gentleman calmly eating a golden russet apple he greeted her without embarrassment and without hesitation at approaching the subject that was the topic of the day i had to do it ma am he said simply or get it myself mr kauffman he added turning to the old clerk please look up the records of the security life insurance company and see if they are all right no need to look grunted kauffman who had everything in his head it s all o k they pay all losses within ten days mrs sharp soon rose to depart she had arranged to remain in town until the policy was paid the commissioner did not detain her she was a woman and he did not know just what to say to her at present rest and time would bring her what she needed but as she was leaving luke standifer indulged himself in an official remark the department of insurance statistics and history ma am has done the best it could with your case twas a case hard to cover according to red tape statistics failed and history missed fire but if i may be permitted to say it we came out particularly strong on insurance the renaissance at charleroi grandemont charles was a little creole gentleman aged thirty four with a bald spot on the top of his head and the manners of a prince by day he was a clerk in a cotton broker s office in one of those cold rancid mountains of oozy brick down near the levee in new orleans by night in his three story high chambre garnier in the old french quarter he was again the last male descendant of the charles family that noble house that had lorded it in france and had pushed its way smiling rapiered and courtly into louisiana s early and brilliant days of late years the charleses had subsided into the more republican but scarcely less royally carried magnificence and ease of plantation life along the mississippi perhaps grandemont was even marquis de brasse there was that title in the family but a marquis on seventy five dollars per month vraiment still it has been done on less grandemont had saved out of his salary the sum of six hundred dollars enough you would say for any man to marry on so after a silence of two years on that subject he reopened that most hazardous question to mlle adele fauquier riding down to meade d or her father s plantation her answer was the same that it had been any time during the last ten years first find my brother monsieur charles this time he had stood before her perhaps discouraged by a love so long and hopeless being dependent upon a contingency so unreasonable and demanded to be told in simple words whether she loved him or no adele looked at him steadily out of her gray eyes that betrayed no secrets and answered a little more softly grandemont you have no right to ask that question unless you can do what i ask of you either bring back brother victor to us or the proof that he died somehow though five times thus rejected his heart was not so heavy when he left she had not denied that she loved upon what shallow waters can the bark of passion remain afloat or shall we play the doctrinaire and hint that at thirty four the tides of life are calmer and cognizant of many sources instead of but one as at four and twenty victor fauquier would never be found in those early days of his disappearance there was money to the charles name and grandemont had spent the dollars as if they were picayunes in trying to find the lost youth even then he had had small hope of success for the mississippi gives up a victim from its oily tangles only at the whim of its malign will a thousand times had grandemont conned in his mind the scene of victor s disappearance and at each time that adele had set her stubborn but pitiful alternative against his suit still clearer it repeated itself in his brain the boy had been the family favourite daring winning reckless his unwise fancy had been captured by a girl on the plantation the daughter of an overseer victor s family was in ignorance of the intrigue as far as it had gone to save them the inevitable pain that his course promised grandemont strove to prevent it omnipotent money smoothed the way the overseer and his daughter left between a sunset and dawn for an undesignated bourne grandemont was confident that this stroke would bring the boy to reason he rode over to meade d or to talk with him the two strolled out of the house and grounds crossed the road and mounting the levee walked its broad path while they conversed a thunder cloud was hanging imminent above but as yet no rain fell at grandemont s disclosure of his interference in the clandestine romance victor attacked him in a wild and sudden fury grandemont though of slight frame possessed muscles of iron he caught the wrists amid a shower of blows descending upon him bent the lad backward and stretched him upon the levee path in a little while the gust of passion was spent and he was allowed to rise calm now but a powder mine where he had been but a whiff of the tantrums victor extended his hand toward the dwelling house of meade d or you and they he cried have conspired to destroy my happiness none of you shall ever look upon my face again turning he ran swiftly down the levee disappearing in the darkness grandemont followed as well as he could calling to him but in vain for longer than an hour he pursued the search descending the side of the levee he penetrated the rank density of weeds and willows that undergrew the trees until the river s edge shouting victor s name there was never an answer though once he thought he heard a bubbling scream from the dun waters sliding past then the storm broke and he returned to the house drenched and dejected there he explained the boy s absence sufficiently he thought not speaking of the tangle that had led to it for he hoped that victor would return as soon as his anger had cooled afterward when the threat was made good and they saw his face no more he found it difficult to alter his explanations of that night and there clung a certain mystery to the boy s reasons for vanishing as well as to the manner of it it was on that night that grandemont first perceived a new and singular expression in adele s eyes whenever she looked at him and through the years following that expression was always there he could not read it for it was born of a thought she would never otherwise reveal perhaps if he had known that adele had stood at the gate on that unlucky night where she had followed lingering to await the return of her brother and lover wondering why they had chosen so tempestuous an hour and so black a spot to hold converse if he had known that a sudden flash of lightning had revealed to her sight that short sharp struggle as victor was sinking under his hands he might have explained everything and she i know what she would have done but one thing is clear there was something besides her brother s disappearance between grandemont s pleadings for her hand and adele s yes ten years had passed and what she had seen during the space of that lightning flash remained an indelible picture she had loved her brother but was she holding out for the solution of that mystery or for the truth women have been known to reverence it even as an abstract principle it is said there have been a few who in the matter of their affections have considered a life to be a small thing as compared with a lie that i do not know but i wonder had grandemont cast himself at her feet crying that his hand had sent victor to the bottom of that inscrutable river and that he could no longer sully his love with a lie i wonder if i wonder what she would have done but grandemont charles arcadian little gentleman never guessed the meaning of that look in adele s eyes and from this last bootless payment of his devoirs he rode away as rich as ever in honour and love but poor in hope that was in september it was during the first winter month that grandemont conceived his idea of the renaissance since adele would never be his and wealth without her were useless trumpery why need he add to that hoard of slowly harvested dollars why should he even retain that hoard hundreds were the cigarettes he consumed over his claret sitting at the little polished tables in the royal street cafes while thinking over his plan by and by he had it perfect it would cost beyond doubt all the money he had but le jeu vaut la chandelle for some hours he would be once more a charles of charleroi once again should the nineteenth of january that most significant day in the fortunes of the house of charles be fittingly observed on that date the french king had seated a charles by his side at table on that date armand charles marquis de brasse landed like a brilliant meteor in new orleans it was the date of his mother s wedding of grandemont s birth since grandemont could remember until the breaking up of the family that anniversary had been the synonym for feasting hospitality and proud commemoration charleroi was the old family plantation lying some twenty miles down the river years ago the estate had been sold to discharge the debts of its too bountiful owners once again it had changed hands and now the must and mildew of litigation had settled upon it a question of heirship was in the courts and the dwelling house of charleroi unless the tales told of ghostly powdered and laced charleses haunting its unechoing chambers were true stood uninhabited grandemont found the solicitor in chancery who held the keys pending the decision he proved to be an old friend of the family grandemont explained briefly that he desired to rent the house for two or three days he wanted to give a dinner at his old home to a few friends that was all take it for a week a month if you will said the solicitor but do not speak to me of rental with a sigh he concluded the dinners i have eaten under that roof mon fils there came to many of the old established dealers in furniture china silverware decorations and household fittings at their stores on canal chartres st charles and royal streets a quiet young man with a little bald spot on the top of his head distinguished manners and the eye of a connoisseur who explained what he wanted to hire the complete and elegant equipment of a dining room hall reception room and cloak rooms the goods were to be packed and sent by boat to the charleroi landing and would be returned within three or four days all damage or loss to be promptly paid for many of those old merchants knew grandemont by sight and the charleses of old by association some of them were of creole stock and felt a thrill of responsive sympathy with the magnificently indiscreet design of this impoverished clerk who would revive but for a moment the ancient flame of glory with the fuel of his savings choose what you want they said to him handle everything carefully see that the damage bill is kept low and the charges for the loan will not oppress you to the wine merchants next and here a doleful slice was lopped from the six hundred it was an exquisite pleasure to grandemont once more to pick among the precious vintages the champagne bins lured him like the abodes of sirens but these he was forced to pass with his six hundred he stood before them as a child with a penny stands before a french doll but he bought with taste and discretion of other wines chablis moselle chateau d or hochheimer and port of right age and pedigree the matter of the cuisine gave him some studious hours until he suddenly recollected andre andre their old chef the most sublime master of french creole cookery in the mississippi valley perhaps he was yet somewhere about the plantation the solicitor had told him that the place was still being cultivated in accordance with a compromise agreement between the litigants on the next sunday after the thought grandemont rode horseback down to charleroi the big square house with its two long ells looked blank and cheerless with its closed shutters and doors the shrubbery in the yard was ragged and riotous fallen leaves from the grove littered the walks and porches turning down the lane at the side of the house grandemont rode on to the quarters of the plantation hands he found the workers just streaming back from church careless happy and bedecked in gay yellows reds and blues yes andre was still there his wool a little grayer his mouth as wide his laughter as ready as ever grandemont told him of his plan and the old chef swayed with pride and delight with a sigh of relief knowing that he need have no further concern until the serving of that dinner was announced he placed in andre s hands a liberal sum for the cost of it giving carte blanche for its creation among the blacks were also a number of the old house servants absalom the former major domo and a half dozen of the younger men once waiters and attaches of the kitchen pantry and other domestic departments crowded around to greet m shi grande absalom guaranteed to marshal of these a corps of assistants that would perform with credit the serving of the dinner after distributing a liberal largesse among the faithful grandemont rode back to town well pleased there were many other smaller details to think of and provide for but eventually the scheme was complete and now there remained only the issuance of the invitations to his guests along the river within the scope of a score of miles dwelt some half dozen families with whose princely hospitality that of the charleses had been contemporaneous they were the proudest and most august of the old regime their small circle had been a brilliant one their social relations close and warm their houses full of rare welcome and discriminating bounty those friends said grandemont should once more if never again sit at charleroi on a nineteenth of january to celebrate the festal day of his house grandemont had his cards of invitation engraved they were expensive but beautiful in one particular their good taste might have been disputed but the creole allowed himself that one feather in the cap of his fugacious splendour might he not be allowed for the one day of the renaissance to be grandemont du puy charles of charleroi he sent the invitations out early in january so that the guests might not fail to receive due notice at eight o clock on the morning of the nineteenth the lower coast steamboat river belle gingerly approached the long unused landing at charleroi the bridge was lowered and a swarm of the plantation hands streamed along the rotting pier bearing ashore a strange assortment of freight great shapeless bundles and bales and packets swathed in cloth and bound with ropes tubs and urns of palms evergreens and tropical flowers tables mirrors chairs couches carpets and pictures all carefully bound and padded against the dangers of transit grandemont was among them the busiest there to the safe conveyance of certain large hampers eloquent with printed cautions to delicate handling he gave his superintendence for they contained the fragile china and glassware the dropping of one of those hampers would have cost him more than he could have saved in a year the last article unloaded the river belle backed off and continued her course down stream in less than an hour everything had been conveyed to the house and came then absalom s task directing the placing of the furniture and wares there was plenty of help for that day was always a holiday at charleroi and the negroes did not suffer the old traditions to lapse almost the entire population of the quarters volunteered their aid a score of piccaninnies were sweeping at the leaves in the yard in the big kitchen at the rear andre was lording it with his old time magnificence over his numerous sub cooks and scullions shutters were flung wide dust spun in clouds the house echoed to voices and the tread of busy feet the prince had come again and charleroi woke from its long sleep the full moon as she rose across the river that night and peeped above the levee saw a sight that had long been missing from her orbit the old plantation house shed a soft and alluring radiance from every window of its two score rooms only four had been refurnished the larger reception chamber the dining hall and two smaller rooms for the convenience of the expected guests but lighted wax candles were set in the windows of every room the dining hall was the chef d oeuvre the long table set with twenty five covers sparkled like a winter landscape with its snowy napery and china and the icy gleam of crystal the chaste beauty of the room had required small adornment the polished floor burned to a glowing ruby with the reflection of candle light the rich wainscoting reached half way to the ceiling along and above this had been set the relieving lightness of a few water colour sketches of fruit and flower the reception chamber was fitted in a simple but elegant style its arrangement suggested nothing of the fact that on the morrow the room would again be cleared and abandoned to the dust and the spider the entrance hall was imposing with palms and ferns and the light of an immense candelabrum at seven o clock grandemont in evening dress with pearls a family passion in his spotless linen emerged from somewhere the invitations had specified eight as the dining hour he drew an armchair upon the porch and sat there smoking cigarettes and half dreaming the moon was an hour high fifty years back from the gate stood the house under its noble grove the road ran in front and then came the grass grown levee and the insatiate river beyond just above the levee top a tiny red light was creeping down and a tiny green one was creeping up then the passing steamers saluted and the hoarse din startled the drowsy silence of the melancholy lowlands the stillness returned save for the little voices of the night the owl s recitative the capriccio of the crickets the concerto of the frogs in the grass the piccaninnies and the dawdlers from the quarters had been dismissed to their confines and the melee of the day was reduced to an orderly and intelligent silence the six coloured waiters in their white jackets paced cat footed about the table pretending to arrange where all was beyond betterment absalom in black and shining pumps posed superior here and there where the lights set off his grandeur and grandemont rested in his chair waiting for his guests he must have drifted into a dream and an extravagant one for he was master of charleroi and adele was his wife she was coming out to him now he could hear her steps he could feel her hand upon his shoulder pardon moi m shi grande it was absalom s hand touching him it was absalom s voice speaking the patois of the blacks but it is eight o clock eight o clock grandemont sprang up in the moonlight he could see the row of hitching posts outside the gate long ago the horses of the guests should have stood there they were vacant a chanted roar of indignation a just waxing bellow of affront and dishonoured genius came from andre s kitchen filling the house with rhythmic protest the beautiful dinner the pearl of a dinner the little excellent superb jewel of a dinner but one moment more of waiting and not even the thousand thunders of black pigs of the quarter would touch it they are a little late said grandemont calmly they will come soon tell andre to hold back dinner and ask him if by some chance a bull from the pastures has broken roaring into the house he seated himself again to his cigarettes though he had said it he scarcely believed charleroi would entertain company that night for the first time in history the invitation of a charles had been ignored so simple in courtesy and honour was grandemont and perhaps so serenely confident in the prestige of his name that the most likely reasons for the vacant board did not occur to him charleroi stood by a road travelled daily by people from those plantations whither his invitations had gone no doubt even on the day before the sudden reanimation of the old house they had driven past and observed the evidences of long desertion and decay they had looked at the corpse of charleroi and then at grandemont s invitations and though the puzzle or tasteless hoax or whatever the thing meant left them perplexed they would not seek its solution by the folly of a visit to that deserted house the moon was now above the grove and the yard was pied with deep shadows save where they lightened in the tender glow of outpouring candle light a crisp breeze from the river hinted at the possibility of frost when the night should have become older the grass at one side of the steps was specked with the white stubs of grandemont s cigarettes the cotton broker s clerk sat in his chair with the smoke spiralling above him i doubt that he once thought of the little fortune he had so impotently squandered perhaps it was compensation enough for him to sit thus at charleroi for a few retrieved hours idly his mind wandered in and out many fanciful paths of memory he smiled to himself as a paraphrased line of scripture strayed into his mind a certain poor man made a feast he heard the sound of absalom coughing a note of summons grandemont stirred this time he had not been asleep only drowsing nine o clock m shi grande said absalom in the uninflected voice of a good servant who states a fact unqualified by personal opinion grandemont rose to his feet in their time all the charleses had been proven and they were gallant losers serve dinner he said calmly and then he checked absalom s movement to obey for something clicked the gate latch and was coming down the walk toward the house something that shuffled its feet and muttered to itself as it came it stopped in the current of light at the foot of the steps and spake in the universal whine of the gadding mendicant kind sir could you spare a poor hungry man out of luck a little to eat and to sleep in the corner of a shed for the thing concluded irrelevantly i can sleep now there are no mountains to dance reels in the night and the copper kettles are all scoured bright the iron band is still round my ankle and a link if it is your desire i should be chained it set a foot upon the step and drew up the rags that hung upon the limb above the distorted shoe caked with the dust of a hundred leagues they saw the link and the iron band the clothes of the tramp were wreaked to piebald tatters by sun and rain and wear a mat of brown tangled hair and beard covered his head and face out of which his eyes stared distractedly grandemont noticed that he carried in one hand a white square card what is that he asked i picked it up sir at the side of the road the vagabond handed the card to grandemont just a little to eat sir a little parched corn a tortilla or a handful of beans goat s meat i cannot eat when i cut their throats they cry like children grandemont held up the card it was one of his own invitations to dinner no doubt some one had cast it away from a passing carriage after comparing it with the tenantless house of charleroi from the hedges and highways bid them come he said to himself softly smiling and then to absalom send louis to me louis once his own body servant came promptly in his white jacket this gentleman said grandemont will dine with me furnish him with bath and clothes in twenty minutes have him ready and dinner served louis approached the disreputable guest with the suavity due to a visitor to charleroi and spirited him away to inner regions promptly in twenty minutes absalom announced dinner and a moment later the guest was ushered into the dining hall where grandemont waited standing at the head of the table the attentions of louis had transformed the stranger into something resembling the polite animal clean linen and an old evening suit that had been sent down from town to clothe a waiter had worked a miracle with his exterior brush and comb had partially subdued the wild disorder of his hair now he might have passed for no more extravagant a thing than one of those poseurs in art and music who affect such oddity of guise the man s countenance and demeanour as he approached the table exhibited nothing of the awkwardness or confusion to be expected from his arabian nights change he allowed absalom to seat him at grandemont s right hand with the manner of one thus accustomed to be waited upon it grieves me said grandemont to be obliged to exchange names with a guest my own name is charles in the mountains said the wayfarer they call me gringo along the roads they call me jack i prefer the latter said grandemont a glass of wine with you mr jack course after course was served by the supernumerous waiters grandemont inspired by the results of andre s exquisite skill in cookery and his own in the selection of wines became the model host talkative witty and genial the guest was fitful in conversation his mind seemed to be sustaining a seccession of waves of dementia followed by intervals of comparative lucidity there was the glassy brightness of recent fever in his eyes a long course of it must have been the cause of his emaciation and weakness his distracted mind and the dull pallor that showed even through the tan of wind and sun charles he said to grandemont for thus he seemed to interpret his name you never saw the mountains dance did you no mr jack answered grandemont gravely the spectacle has been denied me but i assure you i can understand it must be a diverting sight the big ones you know white with snow on the tops waltzing decollete we may say you first scour the kettles said mr jack leaning toward him excitedly to cook the beans in the morning and you lie down on a blanket and keep quite still then they come out and dance for you you would go out and dance with them but you are chained every night to the centre pole of the hut you believe the mountains dance don t you charlie i contradict no traveller s tales said grandemont with a smile mr jack laughed loudly he dropped his voice to a confidential whisper you are a fool to believe it he went on they don t really advance it s the fever in your head it s the hard work and the bad water that does it you are sick for weeks and there is no medicine the fever comes on every evening and then you are as strong as two men one night the compania are lying drunk with mescal they have brought back sacks of silver dollars from a ride and they drink to celebrate in the night you file the chain in two and go down the mountain you walk for miles hundreds of them by and by the mountains are all gone and you come to the prairies they do not dance at night they are merciful and you sleep then you come to the river and it says things to you you follow it down down but you can t find what you are looking for mr jack leaned back in his chair and his eyes slowly closed the food and wine had steeped him in a deep calm the tense strain had been smoothed from his face the languor of repletion was claiming him drowsily he spoke again it s bad manners i know to go to sleep at table but that was such a good dinner grande old fellow grande the owner of the name started and set down his glass how should this wretched tatterdemalion whom he had invited caliph like to sit at his feet know his name not at first but soon little by little the suspicion wild and unreasonable as it was stole into his brain he drew out his watch with hands that almost balked him by their trembling and opened the back case there was a picture there a photograph fixed to the inner side rising grandemont shook mr jack by the shoulder the weary guest opened his eyes grandemont held the watch look at this picture mr jack have you ever my sister adele the vagrant s voice rang loud and sudden through the room he started to his feet but grandemont s arms were about him and grandemont was calling him victor victor fauquier merci merci mon dieu too far overcome by sleep and fatigue was the lost one to talk that night days afterward when the tropic calentura had cooled in his veins the disordered fragments he had spoken were completed in shape and sequence he told the story of his angry flight of toils and calamities on sea and shore of his ebbing and flowing fortune in southern lands and of his latest peril when held a captive he served menially in a stronghold of bandits in the sonora mountains of mexico and of the fever that seized him there and his escape and delirium during which he strayed perhaps led by some marvellous instinct back to the river on whose bank he had been born and of the proud and stubborn thing in his blood that had kept him silent through all those years clouding the honour of one though he knew it not and keeping apart two loving hearts what a thing is love you may say and if i grant it you shall say with me what a thing is pride on a couch in the reception chamber victor lay with a dawning understanding in his heavy eyes and peace in his softened countenance absalom was preparing a lounge for the transient master of charleroi who to morrow would be again the clerk of a cotton broker but also to morrow grandemont was saying as he stood by the couch of his guest speaking the words with his face shining as must have shone the face of elijah s charioteer when he announced the glories of that heavenly journey to morrow i will take you to her on behalf of the management this is the story of the man manager and how he held his own until the very last paragraph i had it from sully magoon viva voce the words are indeed his and if they do not constitute truthful fiction my memory should be taxed with the blame it is not deemed amiss to point out in the beginning the stress that is laid upon the masculinity of the manager for according to sully the term when applied to the feminine division of mankind has precisely an opposite meaning the woman manager he says economizes saves oppresses her household with bargains and contrivances and looks sourly upon any pence that are cast to the fiddler for even a single jig step on life s arid march wherefore her men folk call her blessed and praise her and then sneak out the backdoor to see the gilhooly sisters to a buck and wing dance now the man manager i still quote sully is a caesar without a brutus he is an autocrat without responsibility a player who imperils no stake of his own his office is to enact to reverberate to boom to expand to out coruscate profitably if he can bill paying and growing gray hairs over results belong to his principals it is his to guide the risk to be the apotheosis of front the three tailed bashaw of bluff the essential oil of razzle dazzle we sat at luncheon and sully magoon told me i asked for particulars my old friend denver galloway was a born manager said sully he first saw the light of day in new york at three years of age he was born in pittsburg but his parents moved east the third summer afterward when denver grew up he went into the managing business at the age of eight he managed a news stand for the dago that owned it after that he was manager at different times of a skating rink a livery stable a policy game a restaurant a dancing academy a walking match a burlesque company a dry goods store a dozen hotels and summer resorts an insurance company and a district leader s campaign that campaign when coughlin was elected on the east side gave denver a boost it got him a job as manager of a broadway hotel and for a while he managed senator o grady s campaign in the nineteenth denver was a new yorker all over i think he was out of the city just twice before the time i m going to tell you about once he went rabbit shooting in yonkers the other time i met him just landing from a north river ferry been out west on a big trip sully old boy says he gad sully i had no idea we had such a big country it s immense never conceived of the magnificence of the west before it s gorgeous and glorious and infinite makes the east seemed cramped and little it s a grand thing to travel and get an idea of the extent and resources of our country i d made several little runs out to california and down to mexico and up through alaska so i sits down with denver for a chat about the things he saw took in the yosemite out there of course i asks well no says denver i don t think so at least i don t recollect it you see i only had three days and i didn t get any farther west than youngstown ohio about two years ago i dropped into new york with a little fly paper proposition about a tennessee mica mine that i wanted to spread out in a nice sunny window in the hopes of catching a few i was coming out of a printing shop one afternoon with a batch of fine sticky prospectuses when i ran against denver coming round a corner i never saw him looking so much like a tiger lily he was as beautiful and new as a trellis of sweet peas and as rollicking as a clarinet solo we shook hands and he asked me what i was doing and i gave him the outlines of the scandal i was trying to create in mica pooh pooh for your mica says denver don t you know better sully than to bump up against the coffers of little old new york with anything as transparent as mica now you come with me over to the hotel brunswick you re just the man i was hoping for i ve got something there in sepia and curled hair that i want you to look at you putting up at the brunswick i asks not a cent says denver cheerful the syndicate that owns the hotel puts up i m manager the brunswick wasn t one of them broadway pot houses all full of palms and hyphens and flowers and costumes kind of a mixture of lawns and laundries it was on one of the east side avenues but it was a solid old time caravansary such as the mayor of skaneatelese or the governor of missouri might stop at eight stories high it stalked up with new striped awnings and the electrics had it as light as day i ve been manager here for a year says denver as we drew nigh when i took charge says he nobody nor nothing ever stopped at the brunswick the clock over the clerks desk used to run for weeks without winding a man fell dead with heart disease on the sidewalk in front of it one day and when they went to pick him up he was two blocks away i figured out a scheme to catch the west indies and south american trade i persuaded the owners to invest a few more thousands and i put every cent of it in electric lights cayenne papre gold leaf and garlic i got a spanish speaking force of employees and a string band and there was talk going round of a cockfight in the basement every sunday maybe i didn t catch the nut brown gang from havana to patagonia the don senors knew about the brunswick we get the highfliers from cuba and mexico and the couple of americas farther south and they ve simply got the boodle to bombard every bulfinch in the bush with when we got to the hotel denver stops me at the door there s a little liver coloured man says he sitting in a big leather chair to your right inside you sit down and watch him for a few minutes and then tell me what you think i took a chair while denver circulates around in the big rotunda the room was about full of curly headed cubans and south american brunettes of different shades and the atmosphere was international with cigarette smoke lit up by diamond rings and edged off with a whisper of garlic that denver galloway was sure a relief to the eye six feet two he was red headed and pink gilled as a sun perch and the air he had court of saint james chauncy olcott kentucky colonels count of monte cristo grand opera all these things he reminded you of when he was doing the honours when he raised his finger the hotel porters and bell boys skated across the floor like cockroaches and even the clerk behind the desk looked as meek and unimportant as andy carnegie denver passed around shaking hands with his guests and saying over the two or three spanish words he knew until it was like a coronation rehearsal or a bryan barbecue in texas i watched the little man he told me to twas a little foreign person in a double breasted frock coat trying to touch the floor with his toes he was the colour of vici kid and his whiskers was like excelsior made out of mahogany wood he breathed hard and he never once took his eyes off of denver there was a look of admiration and respect on his face like you see on a boy that s following a champion base ball team or the kaiser william looking at himself in a glass after denver goes his rounds he takes me into his private office what s your report on the dingy i told you to watch he asks well says i if you was as big a man as he takes you to be nine rooms and bath in the hall of fame rent free till october st would be about your size you ve caught the idea says denver i ve given him the wizard grip and the cabalistic eye the glamour that emanates from yours truly has enveloped him like a north river fog he seems to think that senor galloway is the man who i guess they don t raise inch sorrel tops with romping ways down in his precinct now sully goes on denver if you was asked what would you take the little man to be why says i the barber around the corner or if he s royal the king of the boot blacks never judge by looks says denver he s the dark horse candidate for president of a south american republic well says i he didn t look quite that bad to me then denver draws his chair up close and gives out his scheme sully says he with seriousness and levity i ve been a manager of one thing and another for over twenty years that s what i was cut out for to have somebody else to put up the money and look after the repairs and the police and taxes while i run the business i never had a dollar of my own invested in my life i wouldn t know how it felt to have the dealer rake in a coin of mine but i can handle other people s stuff and manage other people s enterprises i ve had an ambition to get hold of something big something higher than hotels and lumber yards and local politics i want to be manager of something way up like a railroad or a diamond trust or an automobile factory now here comes this little man from the tropics with just what i want and he s offered me the job what job i asks is he going to revive the georgia minstrels or open a cigar store he s no coon says denver he s general rompiro general josey alfonso sapolio jew ann rompiro he has his cards printed by a news ticker he s the real thing sully and he wants me to manage his campaign he wants denver c galloway for a president maker think of that sully old denver romping down to the tropics plucking lotus flowers and pineapples with one hand and making presidents with the other won t it make uncle mark hanna mad and i want you to go too sully you can help me more than any man i know i ve been herding that brown man for a month in the hotel so he wouldn t stray down fourteenth street and get roped in by that crowd of refugee tamale eaters down there and he s landed and d c g is manager of general j a s j rompiro s presidential campaign in the great republic of what s its name denver gets down an atlas from a shelf and we have a look at the afflicted country twas a dark blue one on the west coast about the size of a special delivery stamp from what the general tells me says denver and from what i can gather from the encyclopaedia and by conversing with the janitor of the astor library it ll be as easy to handle the vote of that country as it would be for tammany to get a man named geoghan appointed on the white wings force why don t general rumptyro stay at home says i and manage his own canvass you don t understand south american politics says denver getting out the cigars it s this way general rompiro had the misfortune of becoming a popular idol he distinguished himself by leading the army in pursuit of a couple of sailors who had stolen the plaza or the carramba or something belonging to the government the people called him a hero and the government got jealous the president sends for the chief of the department of public edifices find me a nice clean adobe wall says he and send senor rompiro up against it then call out a file of soldiers and then let him be up against it something goes on denver like the way they ve treated hobson and carrie nation in our country so the general had to flee but he was thoughtful enough to bring along his roll he s got sinews of war enough to buy a battleship and float her off in the christening fluid what chance has he got to be president wasn t i just giving you his rating says denver his country is one of the few in south america where the presidents are elected by popular ballot the general can t go there just now it hurts to be shot against a wall he needs a campaign manager to go down and whoop things up for him to get the boys in line and the new two dollar bills afloat and the babies kissed and the machine in running order sully i don t want to brag but you remember how i brought coughlin under the wire for leader of the nineteenth ours was the banner district don t you suppose i know how to manage a little monkey cage of a country like that why with the dough the general s willing to turn loose i could put two more coats of japan varnish on him and have him elected governor of georgia new york has got the finest lot of campaign managers in the world sully and you give me a feeling of hauteur when you cast doubts on my ability to handle the political situation in a country so small that they have to print the names of the towns in the appendix and footnotes i argued with denver some i told him that politics down in that tropical atmosphere was bound to be different from the nineteenth district but i might just as well have been a congressman from north dakota trying to get an appropriation for a lighthouse and a coast survey denver galloway had ambitions in the manager line and what i said didn t amount to as much as a fig leaf at the national dressmakers convention i ll give you three days to cogitate about going says denver and i ll introduce you to general rompiro to morrow so you can get his ideas drawn right from the rosewood i put on my best reception to booker washington manner the next day and tapped the distinguished rubber plant for what he knew general rompiro wasn t so gloomy inside as he appeared on the surface he was polite enough and he exuded a number of sounds that made a fair stagger at arranging themselves into language it was english he aimed at and when his system of syntax reached your mind it wasn t past you to understand it if you took a college professor s magazine essay and a chinese laundryman s explanation of a lost shirt and jumbled em together you d have about what the general handed you out for conversation he told me all about his bleeding country and what they were trying to do for it before the doctor came but he mostly talked of denver c galloway ah senor says he that is the most fine of mans never i have seen one man so magnifico so gr r rand so conformable to make done things so swiftly by other mans he shall make other mans do the acts and himself to order and regulate until we arrive at seeing accomplishments of a suddenly oh yes senor in my countree there is not such mans of so beegness so good talk so compliments so strongness of sense and such ah that senor galloway yes says i old denver is the boy you want he s managed every kind of business here except filibustering and he might as well complete the list before the three days was up i decided to join denver in his campaign denver got three months vacation from his hotel owners for a week we lived in a room with the general and got all the pointers about his country that we could interpret from the noises he made when we got ready to start denver had a pocket full of memorandums and letters from the general to his friends and a list of names and addresses of loyal politicians who would help along the boom of the exiled popular idol besides these liabilities we carried assets to the amount of in assorted united states currency general rompiro looked like a burnt effigy but he was br er fox himself when it came to the real science of politics here is moneys says the general of a small amount there is more with me moocho more plentee moneys shall you be supplied senor galloway more i shall send you at all times that you need i shall desire to pay feefty one hundred thousand pesos if necessario to be elect how no sacramento if that i am president and do not make one meelion dolla in the one year you shall keek me on that side valgame dios denver got a cuban cigar maker to fix up a little cipher code with english and spanish words and gave the general a copy so we could cable him bulletins about the election or for more money and then we were ready to start general rompiro escorted us to the steamer on the pier he hugged denver around the waist and sobbed noble mans says he general rompiro propels you into his confidence and trust go in the hands of the saints to do the work for your friend viva la libertad sure says denver and viva la liberality an la soaperino and hoch der land of the lotus and the vote us don t worry general we ll have you elected as sure as bananas grow upside down make pictures on me pleads the general make pictures on me for money as it is needful does he want to be tattooed would you think asks denver wrinkling up his eyes stupid says i he wants you to draw on him for election expenses it ll be worse than tattooing more like an autopsy me and denver steamed down to panama and then hiked across the isthmus and then by steamer again down to the town of espiritu on the coast of the general s country that was a town to send j howard payne to the growler i ll tell you how you could make one like it take a lot of filipino huts and a couple of hundred brick kilns and arrange em in squares in a cemetery cart down all the conservatory plants in the astor and vanderbilt greenhouses and stick em about wherever there s room turn all the bellevue patients and the barbers convention and the tuskegee school loose in the streets and run the thermometer up to in the shade set a fringe of the rocky mountains around the rear let it rain and set the whole business on rockaway beach in the middle of january and you d have a good imitation of espiritu it took me and denver about a week to get acclimated denver sent out the letters the general had given him and notified the rest of the gang that there was something doing at the captain s office we set up headquarters in an old dobe house on a side street where the grass was waist high the election was only four weeks off but there wasn t any excitement the home candidate for president was named roadrickeys this town of esperitu wasn t the capital any more than cleveland ohio is the capital of the united states but it was the political centre where they cooked up revolutions and made up the slates at the end of the week denver says the machine is started running sully says he we ve got a walkover just because general rompiro ain t don juan on the spot the other crowd ain t at work they re as full of apathy as a territorial delegate during the chaplain s prayer now we want to introduce a little hot stuff in the way of campaigning and we ll surprise em at the polls how are you going to go about it i asks why the usual way says denver surprised we ll get the orators on our side out every night to make speeches in the native lingo and have torch light parades under the shade of the palms and free drinks and buy up all the brass bands of course and well i ll turn the baby kissing over to you sully i ve seen a lot of em what else says i why you know says denver we get the heelers out with the crackly two spots and coal tickets and orders for groceries and have a couple of picnics out under the banyan trees and dances in the firemen s hall and the usual things but first of all sully i m going to have the biggest clam bake down on the beach that was ever seen south of the tropic of capricorn i figured that out from the start we ll stuff the whole town and the jungle folk for miles around with clams that s the first thing on the programme suppose you go out now and make the arrangements for that i want to look over the estimates the general made of the vote in the coast districts i had learned some spanish in mexico so i goes out as denver says and in fifteen minutes i come back to headquarters if there ever was a clam in this country nobody ever saw it i says great sky rockets says denver with his mouth and eyes open no clams how in the who ever saw a country without clams what kind of a how s an election to be pulled off without a clam bake i d like to know are you sure there s no clams sully not even a can says i then for god s sake go out and try to find what the people here do eat we ve got to fill em up with grub of some kind i went out again denver was manager in half an hour i gets back they eat says i tortillas cassava carne de chivo arroz con pollo aquacates zapates yucca and huevos fritos a man that would eat them things says denver getting a little mad ought to have his vote challenged in a few more days the campaign managers from the other towns came sliding into esperitu our headquarters was a busy place we had an interpreter and ice water and drinks and cigars and denver flashed the general s roll so often that it got so small you couldn t have bought a republican vote in ohio with it and then denver cabled to general rompiro for ten thousand dollars more and got it there were a number of americans in esperitu but they were all in business or grafts of some kind and wouldn t take any hand in politics which was sensible enough but they showed me and denver a fine time and fixed us up so we could get decent things to eat and drink there was one american named hicks used to come and loaf at the headquarters hicks had had fourteen years of esperitu he was six feet four and weighed in at cocoa was his line and coast fever and the climate had taken all the life out of him they said he hadn t smiled in eight years his face was three feet long and it never moved except when he opened it to take quinine he used to sit in our headquarters and kill fleas and talk sarcastic i don t take much interest in politics says hicks one day but i d like you to tell me what you re trying to do down here galloway we re boosting general rompiro of course says denver we re going to put him in the presidential chair i m his manager well says hicks if i was you i d be a little slower about it you ve got a long time ahead of you you know not any longer than i need says denver denver went ahead and worked things smooth he dealt out money on the quiet to his lieutenants and they were always coming after it there was free drinks for everybody in town and bands playing every night and fireworks and there was a lot of heelers going around buying up votes day and night for the new style of politics in espiritu and everybody liked it the day set for the election was november th on the night before denver and me were smoking our pipes in headquarters and in comes hicks and unjoints himself and sits in a chair mournful denver is cheerful and confident rompiro will win in a romp says he we ll carry the country by it s all over but the vivas to morrow will tell the tale what s going to happen to morrow asks hicks why the presidential election of course says denver say says hicks looking kind of funny didn t anybody tell you fellows that the election was held a week before you came congress changed the date to july th roadrickeys was elected by i thought you was booming old rompiro for next term two years from now wondered if you was going to keep up such a hot lick that long i dropped my pipe on the floor denver bit the stem off of his neither of us said anything and then i heard a sound like somebody ripping a clap board off of a barn roof twas hicks laughing for the first time in eight years sully magoon paused while the waiter poured us a black coffee your friend was indeed something of a manager i said wait a minute said sully i haven t given you any idea of what he could do yet that s all to come when we got back to new york there was general rompiro waiting for us on the pier he was dancing like a cinnamon bear all impatient for the news for denver had just cabled him when we would arrive and nothing more am i elect he shouts am i elect friend of mine is that mine country have demanded general rompiro for the president the last dollar of mine have i sent you that last time it is necessario that i am elect i have not more money am i elect senor galloway denver turns to me leave me with old rompey sully he says i ve got to break it to him gently twould be indecent for other eyes to witness the operation this is the time sully says he when old denver has got to make good as a jollier and a silver tongued sorcerer or else give up all the medals he s earned a couple of days later i went around to the hotel there was denver in his old place looking like the hero of two historical novels and telling em what a fine time he d had down on his orange plantation in florida did you fix things up with the general i asks him did i says denver come and see he takes me by the arm and walks me to the dining room door there was a little chocolate brown fat man in a dress suit with his face shining with joy as he swelled himself and skipped about the floor danged if denver hadn t made general rompiro head waiter of the hotel brunswick is mr galloway still in the managing business i asked as mr magoon ceased sully shook his head denver married an auburn haired widow that owns a big hotel in harlem he just helps around the place whistling dick s christmas stocking it was with much caution that whistling dick slid back the door of the box car for article city ordinances authorized perhaps unconstitutionally arrest on suspicion and he was familiar of old with this ordinance so before climbing out he surveyed the field with all the care of a good general he saw no change since his last visit to this big alms giving long suffering city of the south the cold weather paradise of the tramps the levee where his freight car stood was pimpled with dark bulks of merchandise the breeze reeked with the well remembered sickening smell of the old tarpaulins that covered bales and barrels the dun river slipped along among the shipping with an oily gurgle far down toward chalmette he could see the great bend in the stream outlined by the row of electric lights across the river algiers lay a long irregular blot made darker by the dawn which lightened the sky beyond an industrious tug or two coming for some early sailing ship gave a few appalling toots that seemed to be the signal for breaking day the italian luggers were creeping nearer their landing laden with early vegetables and shellfish a vague roar subterranean in quality from dray wheels and street cars began to make itself heard and felt and the ferryboats the mary anns of water craft stirred sullenly to their menial morning tasks whistling dick s red head popped suddenly back into the car a sight too imposing and magnificent for his gaze had been added to the scene a vast incomparable policeman rounded a pile of rice sacks and stood within twenty yards of the car the daily miracle of the dawn now being performed above algiers received the flattering attention of this specimen of municipal official splendour he gazed with unbiased dignity at the faintly glowing colours until at last he turned to them his broad back as if convinced that legal interference was not needed and the sunrise might proceed unchecked so he turned his face to the rice bags and drawing a flat flask from an inside pocket he placed it to his lips and regarded the firmament whistling dick professional tramp possessed a half friendly acquaintance with this officer they had met several times before on the levee at night for the officer himself a lover of music had been attracted by the exquisite whistling of the shiftless vagabond still he did not care under the present circumstances to renew the acquaintance there is a difference between meeting a policeman on a lonely wharf and whistling a few operatic airs with him and being caught by him crawling out of a freight car so dick waited as even a new orleans policeman must move on some time perhaps it is a retributive law of nature and before long big fritz majestically disappeared between the trains of cars whistling dick waited as long as his judgment advised and then slid swiftly to the ground assuming as far as possible the air of an honest labourer who seeks his daily toil he moved across the network of railway lines with the intention of making his way by quiet girod street to a certain bench in lafayette square where according to appointment he hoped to rejoin a pal known as slick this adventurous pilgrim having preceded him by one day in a cattle car into which a loose slat had enticed him as whistling dick picked his way where night still lingered among the big reeking musty warehouses he gave way to the habit that had won for him his title subdued yet clear with each note as true and liquid as a bobolink s his whistle tinkled about the dim cold mountains of brick like drops of rain falling into a hidden pool he followed an air but it swam mistily into a swirling current of improvisation you could cull out the trill of mountain brooks the staccato of green rushes shivering above chilly lagoons the pipe of sleepy birds rounding a corner the whistler collided with a mountain of blue and brass so observed the mountain calmly you are already pack und dere vill not pe frost before two veeks yet und you haf forgotten how to vistle dere was a valse note in dot last bar watcher know about it said whistling dick with tentative familiarity you wit yer little gherman band nixcumrous chunes watcher know about music pick yer ears and listen agin here s de way i whistled it see he puckered his lips but the big policeman held up his hand shtop he said und learn der right way und learn also dot a rolling shtone can t vistle for a cent big fritz s heavy moustache rounded into a circle and from its depths came a sound deep and mellow as that from a flute he repeated a few bars of the air the tramp had been whistling the rendition was cold but correct and he emphasized the note he had taken exception to dot p is p natural und not p vlat py der vay you petter pe glad i meet you von hour later und i vould half to put you in a gage to vistle mit der chail pirds der orders are to bull all der pums after sunrise to which to bull der pums eferybody mitout fisible means dirty days is der price or fifteen tollars is dat

run against any more bolicemans aroundt der corners but go away from town a few tays good pye so madame orleans had at last grown weary of the strange and ruffled brood that came yearly to nestle beneath her charitable pinions after the big policeman had departed whistling dick stood for an irresolute minute feeling all the outraged indignation of a delinquent tenant who is ordered to vacate his premises he had pictured to himself a day of dreamful ease when he should have joined his pal a day of lounging on the wharf munching the bananas and cocoanuts scattered in unloading the fruit steamers and then a feast along the free lunch counters from which the easy going owners were too good natured or too generous to drive him away and afterward a pipe in one of the little flowery parks and a snooze in some shady corner of the wharf but here was a stern order to exile and one that he knew must be obeyed so with a wary eye open from the gleam of brass buttons he began his retreat toward a rural refuge a few days in the country need not necessarily prove disastrous beyond the possibility of a slight nip of frost there was no formidable evil to be looked for however it was with a depressed spirit that whistling dick passed the old french market on his chosen route down the river for safety s sake he still presented to the world his portrayal of the part of the worthy artisan on his way to labour a stall keeper in the market undeceived hailed him by the generic name of his ilk and jack halted taken by surprise the vender melted by this proof of his own acuteness bestowed a foot of frankfurter and half a loaf and thus the problem of breakfast was solved when the streets from topographical reasons began to shun the river bank the exile mounted to the top of the levee and on its well trodden path pursued his way the suburban eye regarded him with cold suspicion individuals reflected the stern spirit of the city s heartless edict he missed the seclusion of the crowded town and the safety he could always find in the multitude at chalmette six miles upon his desultory way there suddenly menaced him a vast and bewildering industry a new port was being established the dock was being built compresses were going up picks and shovels and barrows struck at him like serpents from every side an arrogant foreman bore down upon him estimating his muscles with the eye of a recruiting sergeant brown men and black men all about him were toiling away he fled in terror by noon he had reached the country of the plantations the great sad silent levels bordering the mighty river he overlooked fields of sugar cane so vast that their farthest limits melted into the sky the sugar making season was well advanced and the cutters were at work the waggons creaked drearily after them the negro teamsters inspired the mules to greater speed with mellow and sonorous imprecations dark green groves blurred by the blue of distance showed where the plantation houses stood the tall chimneys of the sugar mills caught the eye miles distant like lighthouses at sea at a certain point whistling dick s unerring nose caught the scent of frying fish like a pointer to a quail he made his way down the levee side straight to the camp of a credulous and ancient fisherman whom he charmed with song and story so that he dined like an admiral and then like a philosopher annihilated the worst three hours of the day by a nap under the trees when he awoke and again continued his hegira a frosty sparkle in the air had succeeded the drowsy warmth of the day and as this portent of a chilly night translated itself to the brain of sir peregrine he lengthened his stride and bethought him of shelter he travelled a road that faithfully followed the convolutions of the levee running along its base but whither he knew not bushes and rank grass crowded it to the wheel ruts and out of this ambuscade the pests of the lowlands swarmed after him humming a keen vicious soprano and as the night grew nearer although colder the whine of the mosquitoes became a greedy petulant snarl that shut out all other sounds to his right against the heavens he saw a green light moving and accompanying it the masts and funnels of a big incoming steamer moving as upon a screen at a magic lantern show and there were mysterious marshes at his left out of which came queer gurgling cries and a choked croaking the whistling vagrant struck up a merry warble to offset these melancholy influences and it is likely that never before since pan himself jigged it on his reeds had such sounds been heard in those depressing solitudes a distant clatter in the rear quickly developed into the swift beat of horses hoofs and whistling dick stepped aside into the dew wet grass to clear the track turning his head he saw approaching a fine team of stylish grays drawing a double surrey a stout man with a white moustache occupied the front seat giving all his attention to the rigid lines in his hands behind him sat a placid middle aged lady and a brilliant looking girl hardly arrived at young ladyhood the lap robe had slipped partly from the knees of the gentleman driving and whistling dick saw two stout canvas bags between his feet bags such as while loafing in cities he had seen warily transferred between express waggons and bank doors the remaining space in the vehicle was filled with parcels of various sizes and shapes as the surrey swept even with the sidetracked tramp the bright eyed girl seized by some merry madcap impulse leaned out toward him with a sweet dazzling smile and cried mer ry christ mas in a shrill plaintive treble such a thing had not often happened to whistling dick and he felt handicapped in devising the correct response but lacking time for reflection he let his instinct decide and snatching off his battered derby he rapidly extended it at arm s length and drew it back with a continuous motion and shouted a loud but ceremonious ah there after the flying surrey the sudden movement of the girl had caused one of the parcels to become unwrapped and something limp and black fell from it into the road the tramp picked it up and found it to be a new black silk stocking long and fine and slender it crunched crisply and yet with a luxurious softness between his fingers ther bloomin little skeezicks said whistling dick with a broad grin bisecting his freckled face w t d yer think of dat now mer ry chris mus sounded like a cuckoo clock da ts what she did dem guys is swells too bet yer life an der old un stacks dem sacks of dough down under his trotters like dey was common as dried apples been shoppin for chrismus and de kid s lost one of her new socks w ot she was goin to hold up santy wid de bloomin little skeezicks wit her mer ry chris mus w ot d yer t ink same as to say hello jack how goes it and as swell as fift av noo and as easy as a blowout in cincinnat whistling dick folded the stocking carefully and stuffed it into his pocket it was nearly two hours later when he came upon signs of habitation the buildings of an extensive plantation were brought into view by a turn in the road he easily selected the planter s residence in a large square building with two wings with numerous good sized well lighted windows and broad verandas running around its full extent it was set upon a smooth lawn which was faintly lit by the far reaching rays of the lamps within a noble grove surrounded it and old fashioned shrubbery grew thickly about the walks and fences the quarters of the hands and the mill buildings were situated at a distance in the rear the road was now enclosed on each side by a fence and presently as whistling dick drew nearer the house he suddenly stopped and sniffed the air if dere ain t a hobo stew cookin somewhere in dis immediate precint he said to himself me nose as quit tellin de trut without hesitation he climbed the fence to windward he found himself in an apparently disused lot where piles of old bricks were stacked and rejected decaying lumber in a corner he saw the faint glow of a fire that had become little more than a bed of living coals and he thought he could see some dim human forms sitting or lying about it he drew nearer and by the light of a little blaze that suddenly flared up he saw plainly the fat figure of a ragged man in an old brown sweater and cap dat man said whistling dick to himself softly is a dead ringer for boston harry i ll try him wit de high sign he whistled one or two bars of a rag time melody and the air was immediately taken up and then quickly ended with a peculiar run the first whistler walked confidently up to the fire the fat man looked up and spake in a loud asthmatic wheeze gents the unexpected but welcome addition to our circle is mr whistling dick an old friend of mine for whom i fully vouches the waiter will lay another cover at once mr w d will join us at supper during which function he will enlighten us in regard to the circumstances that gave us the pleasure of his company chewin de stuffin out n de dictionary as usual boston said whistling dick but t anks all de same for de invitashun i guess i finds meself here about de same way as yous guys a cop gimme de tip dis mornin yous workin on dis farm a guest said boston sternly shouldn t never insult his entertainers until he s filled up wid grub tain t good business sense workin but i will restrain myself we five me deaf pete blinky goggles and indiana tom got put on to this scheme of noo orleans to work visiting gentlemen upon her dirty streets and we hit the road last evening just as the tender hues of twilight had flopped down upon the daisies and things blinky pass the empty oyster can at your left to the empty gentleman at your right for the next ten minutes the gang of roadsters paid their undivided attention to the supper in an old five gallon kerosene can they had cooked a stew of potatoes meat and onions which they partook of from smaller cans they had found scattered about the vacant lot whistling dick had known boston harry of old and knew him to be one of the shrewdest and most successful of his brotherhood he looked like a prosperous stock drover or solid merchant from some country village he was stout and hale with a ruddy always smoothly shaven face his clothes were strong and neat and he gave special attention to his decent appearing shoes during the past ten years he had acquired a reputation for working a larger number of successfully managed confidence games than any of his acquaintances and he had not a day s work to be counted against him it was rumoured among his associates that he had saved a considerable amount of money the four other men were fair specimens of the slinking ill clad noisome genus who carried their labels of suspicious in plain view after the bottom of the large can had been scraped and pipes lit at the coals two of the men called boston aside and spake with him lowly and mysteriously he nodded decisively and then said aloud to whistling dick listen sonny to some plain talky talk we five are on a lay i ve guaranteed you to be square and you re to come in on the profits equal with the boys and you ve got to help two hundred hands on this plantation are expecting to be paid a week s wages to morrow morning to morrow s christmas and they want to lay off says the boss work from five to nine in the morning to get a train load of sugar off and i ll pay every man cash down for the week and a day extra they say hooray for the boss it goes he drives to noo orleans to day and fetches back the cold dollars two thousand and seventy four fifty is the amount i got the figures from a man who talks too much who got em from the bookkeeper the boss of this plantation thinks he s going to pay this wealth to the hands he s got it down wrong he s going to pay it to us it s going to stay in the leisure class where it belongs now half of this haul goes to me and the other half the rest of you may divide why the difference i represent the brains it s my scheme here s the way we re going to get it there s some company at supper in the house but they ll leave about nine they ve just happened in for an hour or so if they don t go pretty soon we ll work the scheme anyhow we want all night to get away good with the dollars they re heavy about nine o clock deaf pete and blinky ll go down the road about a quarter beyond the house and set fire to a big cane field there that the cutters haven t touched yet the wind s just right to have it roaring in two minutes the alarm ll be given and every man jack about the place will be down there in ten minutes fighting fire that ll leave the money sacks and the women alone in the house for us to handle you ve heard cane burn well there s mighty few women can screech loud enough to be heard above its crackling the thing s dead safe the only danger is in being caught before we can get far enough away with the money now if you boston interrupted whistling dick rising to his feet t anks for the grub yous fellers has given me but i ll be movin on now what do you mean asked boston also rising w y you can count me outer dis deal you oughter know that i m on de bum all right enough but dat other t ing don t go wit me burglary is no good i ll say good night and many t anks fer whistling dick had moved away a few steps as he spoke but he stopped very suddenly boston had covered him with a short revolver of roomy calibre take your seat said the tramp leader i d feel mighty proud of myself if i let you go and spoil the game you ll stick right in this camp until we finish the job the end of that brick pile is your limit you go two inches beyond that and i ll have to shoot better take it easy now it s my way of doin said whistling dick easy goes you can depress de muzzle of dat twelve incher and run er back on de trucks i remains as de newspapers says in yer midst all right said boston lowering his piece as the other returned and took his seat again on a projecting plank in a pile of timber don t try to leave that s all i wouldn t miss this chance even if i had to shoot an old acquaintance to make it go i don t want to hurt anybody specially but this thousand dollars i m going to get will fix me for fair i m going to drop the road and start a saloon in a little town i know about i m tired of being kicked around boston harry took from his pocket a cheap silver watch and held it near the fire it s a quarter to nine he said pete you and blinky start go down the road past the house and fire the cane in a dozen places then strike for the levee and come back on it instead of the road so you won t meet anybody by the time you get back the men will all be striking out for the fire and we ll break for the house and collar the dollars everybody cough up what matches he s got the two surly tramps made a collection of all the matches in the party whistling dick contributing his quota with propitiatory alacrity and then they departed in the dim starlight in the direction of the road of the three remaining vagrants two goggles and indiana tom reclined lazily upon convenient lumber and regarded whistling dick with undisguised disfavour boston observing that the dissenting recruit was disposed to remain peaceably relaxed a little of his vigilance whistling dick arose presently and strolled leisurely up and down keeping carefully within the territory assigned him dis planter chap he said pausing before boston harry w ot makes yer t ink he s got de tin in de house wit im i m advised of the facts in the case said boston he drove to noo orleans and got it i say to day want to change your mind now and come in naw i was just askin wot kind o team did de boss drive pair of grays double surrey yep women folks along wife and kid say what morning paper are you trying to pump news for i was just conversin to pass de time away i guess dat team passed me in de road dis evenin dat s all as whistling dick put his hands in his pockets and continued his curtailed beat up and down by the fire he felt the silk stocking he had picked up in the road ther bloomin little skeezicks he muttered with a grin as he walked up and down he could see through a sort of natural opening or lane among the trees the planter s residence some seventy five yards distant the side of the house toward him exhibited spacious well lighted windows through which a soft radiance streamed illuminating the broad veranda and some extent of the lawn beneath what s that you said asked boston sharply oh nuttin t all said whistling dick lounging carelessly and kicking meditatively at a little stone on the ground just as easy continued the warbling vagrant softly to himself an sociable an swell an sassy wit her mer ry chris mus wot d yer t ink now dinner two hours late was being served in the bellemeade plantation dining room the dining room and all its appurtenances spoke of an old regime that was here continued rather than suggested to the memory the plate was rich to the extent that its age and quaintness alone saved it from being showy there were interesting names signed in the corners of the pictures on the walls the viands were of the kind that bring a shine into the eyes of gourmets the service was swift silent lavish as in the days when the waiters were assets like the plate the names by which the planter s family and their visitors addressed one another were historic in the annals of two nations their manners and conversation had that most difficult kind of ease the kind that still preserves punctilio the planter himself seemed to be the dynamo that generated the larger portion of the gaiety and wit the younger ones at the board found it more than difficult to turn back on him his guns of raillery and banter it is true the young men attempted to storm his works repeatedly incited by the hope of gaining the approbation of their fair companions but even when they sped a well aimed shaft the planter forced them to feel defeat by the tremendous discomfiting thunder of the laughter with which he accompanied his retorts at the head of the table serene matronly benevolent reigned the mistress of the house placing here and there the right smile the right word the encouraging glance the talk of the party was too desultory too evanescent to follow but at last they came to the subject of the tramp nuisance one that had of late vexed the plantations for many miles around the planter seized the occasion to direct his good natured fire of raillery at the mistress accusing her of encouraging the plague they swarm up and down the river every winter he said they overrun new orleans and we catch the surplus which is generally the worst part and a day or two ago madame new orleans suddenly discovering that she can t go shopping without brushing her skirts against great rows of the vagabonds sunning themselves on the banquettes says to the police catch em all and the police catch a dozen or two and the remaining three or four thousand overflow up and down the levee and madame there pointing tragically with the carving knife at her feeds them they won t work they defy my overseers and they make friends with my dogs and you madame feed them before my eyes and intimidate me when i would interfere tell us please how many to day did you thus incite to future laziness and depredation six i think said madame with a reflective smile but you know two of them offered to work for you heard them yourself the planter s disconcerting laugh rang out again yes at their own trades and one was an artificial flower maker and the other a glass blower oh they were looking for work not a hand would they consent to lift to labour of any other kind and another one continued the soft hearted mistress used quite good language it was really extraordinary for one of his class and he carried a watch and had lived in boston i don t believe they are all bad they have always seemed to me to rather lack development i always look upon them as children with whom wisdom has remained at a standstill while whiskers have continued to grow we passed one this evening as we were driving home who had a face as good as it was incompetent he was whistling the intermezzo from cavalleria and blowing the spirit of mascagni himself into it a bright eyed young girl who sat at the left of the mistress leaned over and said in a confidential undertone i wonder mamma if that tramp we passed on the road found my stocking and do you think he will hang it up to night now i can hang up but one do you know why i wanted a new pair of silk stockings when i have plenty well old aunt judy says if you hang up two that have never been worn santa claus will fill one with good things and monsieur pambe will place in the other payment for all the words you have spoken good or bad on the day before christmas that s why i ve been unusually nice and polite to everyone to day monsieur pambe you know is a witch gentleman he the words of the young girl were interrupted by a startling thing like the wraith of some burned out shooting star a black streak came crashing through the window pane and upon the table where it shivered into fragments a dozen pieces of crystal and china ware and then glanced between the heads of the guests to the wall imprinting therein a deep round indentation at which to day the visitor to bellemeade marvels as he gazes upon it and listens to this tale as it is told the women screamed in many keys and the men sprang to their feet and would have laid their hands upon their swords had not the verities of chronology forbidden the planter was the first to act he sprang to the intruding missile and held it up to view by jupiter he cried a meteoric shower of hosiery has communication at last been established with mars i should say ahem venus ventured a young gentleman visitor looking hopefully for approbation toward the unresponsive young lady visitors the planter held at arm s length the unceremonious visitor a long dangling black stocking it s loaded he announced as he spoke he reversed the stocking holding it by the toe and down from it dropped a roundish stone wrapped about by a piece of yellowish paper now for the first interstellar message of the century he cried and nodding to the company who had crowded about him he adjusted his glasses with provoking deliberation and examined it closely when he finished he had changed from the jolly host to the practical decisive man of business he immediately struck a bell and said to the silent footed mulatto man who responded go and tell mr wesley to get reeves and maurice and about ten stout hands they can rely upon and come to the hall door at once tell him to have the men arm themselves and bring plenty of ropes and plough lines tell him to hurry and then he read aloud from the paper these words to the gent of de hous dere is five tuff hoboes xcept meself in the vaken lot near de road war de old brick piles is dey got me stuck up wid a gun see and i taken dis means of communication of der lads is gone down to set fire to de cain field below de hous and when yous fellers goes to turn de hoes on it de hole gang is goin to rob de hous of de money yoo gotto pay off wit say git a move on ye say de kid dropt dis sock on der rode tel her mery crismus de same as she told me ketch de bums down de rode first and den sen a relefe core to get me out of soke youres truly whistlen dick there was some quiet but rapid mavoeuvring at bellemeade during the ensuring half hour which ended in five disgusted and sullen tramps being captured and locked securely in an outhouse pending the coming of the morning and retribution for another result the visiting young gentlemen had secured the unqualified worship of the visiting young ladies by their distinguished and heroic conduct for still another behold whistling dick the hero seated at the planter s table feasting upon viands his experience had never before included and waited upon by admiring femininity in shapes of such beauty and swellness that even his ever full mouth could scarcely prevent him from whistling he was made to disclose in detail his adventure with the evil gang of boston harry and how he cunningly wrote the note and wrapped it around the stone and placed it at the toe of the stocking and watching his chance sent it silently with a wonderful centrifugal momentum like a comet at one of the big lighted windows of the dining room the planter vowed that the wanderer should wander no more that his was a goodness and an honesty that should be rewarded and that a debt of gratitude had been made that must be paid for had he not saved them from a doubtless imminent loss and maybe a greater calamity he assured whistling dick that he might consider himself a charge upon the honour of bellemeade that a position suited to his powers would be found for him at once and hinted that the way would be heartily smoothed for him to rise to as high places of emolument and trust as the plantation afforded but now they said he must be weary and the immediate thing to consider was rest and sleep so the mistress spoke to a servant and whistling dick was conducted to a room in the wing of the house occupied by the servants to this room in a few minutes was brought a portable tin bathtub filled with water which was placed on a piece of oiled cloth upon the floor there the vagrant was left to pass the night by the light of a candle he examined the room a bed with the covers neatly turned back revealed snowy pillows and sheets a worn but clean red carpet covered the floor there was a dresser with a beveled mirror a washstand with a flowered bowl and pitcher the two or three chairs were softly upholstered a little table held books papers and a day old cluster of roses in a jar there were towels on a rack and soap in a white dish whistling dick set his candle on a chair and placed his hat carefully under the table after satisfying what we must suppose to have been his curiosity by a sober scrutiny he removed his coat folded it and laid it upon the floor near the wall as far as possible from the unused bathtub taking his coat for a pillow he stretched himself luxuriously upon the carpet when on christmas morning the first streaks of dawn broke above the marshes whistling dick awoke and reached instinctively for his hat then he remembered that the skirts of fortune had swept him into their folds on the night previous and he went to the window and raised it to let the fresh breath of the morning cool his brow and fix the yet dream like memory of his good luck within his brain as he stood there certain dread and ominous sounds pierced the fearful hollow of his ear the force of plantation workers eager to complete the shortened task allotted to them were all astir the mighty din of the ogre labour shook the earth and the poor tattered and forever disguised prince in search of his fortune held tight to the window sill even in the enchanted castle and trembled already from the bosom of the mill came the thunder of rolling barrels of sugar and prison like sounds there was a great rattling of chains as the mules were harried with stimulant imprecations to their places by the waggon tongues a little vicious dummy engine with a train of flat cars in tow stewed and fumed on the plantation tap of the narrow gauge railroad and a toiling hurrying hallooing stream of workers were dimly seen in the half darkness loading the train with the weekly output of sugar here was a poem an epic nay a tragedy with work the curse of the world for its theme the december air was frosty but the sweat broke out upon whistling dick s face he thrust his head out of the window and looked down fifteen feet below him against the wall of the house he could make out that a border of flowers grew and by that token he overhung a bed of soft earth softly as a burglar goes he clambered out upon the sill lowered himself until he hung by his hands alone and then dropped safely no one seemed to be about upon this side of the house he dodged low and skimmed swiftly across the yard to the low fence it was an easy matter to vault this for a terror urged him such as lifts the gazelle over the thorn bush when the lion pursues a crash through the dew drenched weeds on the roadside a clutching slippery rush up the grassy side of the levee to the footpath at the summit and he was free the east was blushing and brightening the wind himself a vagrant rover saluted his brother upon the cheek some wild geese high above gave cry a rabbit skipped along the path before him free to turn to the right or to the left as his mood should send him the river slid past and certainly no one could tell the ultimate abiding place of its waters a small ruffled brown breasted bird sitting upon a dog wood sapling began a soft throaty tender little piping in praise of the dew which entices foolish worms from their holes but suddenly he stopped and sat with his head turned sidewise listening from the path along the levee there burst forth a jubilant stirring buoyant thrilling whistle loud and keen and clear as the cleanest notes of the piccolo the soaring sound rippled and trilled and arpeggioed as the songs of wild birds do not but it had a wild free grace that in a way reminded the small brown bird of something familiar but exactly what he could not tell there was in it the bird call or reveille that all birds know but a great waste of lavish unmeaning things that art had added and arranged besides and that were quite puzzling and strange and the little brown bird sat with his head on one side until the sound died away in the distance the little bird did not know that the part of that strange warbling that he understood was just what kept the warbler without his breakfast but he knew very well that the part he did not understand did not concern him so he gave a little flutter of his wings and swooped down like a brown bullet upon a big fat worm that was wriggling along the levee path the halberdier of the little rheinschloss i go sometimes into the bierhalle and restaurant called old munich not long ago it was a resort of interesting bohemians but now only artists and musicians and literary folk frequent it but the pilsner is yet good and i take some diversion from the conversation of waiter no for many years the customers of old munich have accepted the place as a faithful copy from the ancient german town the big hall with its smoky rafters rows of imported steins portrait of goethe and verses painted on the walls translated into german from the original of the cincinnati poets seems atmospherically correct when viewed through the bottom of a glass but not long ago the proprietors added the room above called it the little rheinschloss and built in a stairway up there was an imitation stone parapet ivy covered and the walls were painted to represent depth and distance with the rhine winding at the base of the vineyarded slopes and the castle of ehrenbreitstein looming directly opposite the entrance of course there were tables and chairs and you could have beer and food brought you as you naturally would on the top of a castle on the rhine i went into old munich one afternoon when there were few customers and sat at my usual table near the stairway i was shocked and almost displeased to perceive that the glass cigar case by the orchestra stand had been smashed to smithereens i did not like things to happen in old munich nothing had ever happened there before waiter no came and breathed on my neck i was his by right of discovery eighteen s brain was built like a corral it was full of ideas which when he opened the gate came huddling out like a flock of sheep that might get together afterward or might not i did not shine as a shepherd as a type eighteen fitted nowhere i did not find out if he had a nationality family creed grievance hobby soul preference home or vote he only came always to my table and as long as his leisure would permit let words flutter from him like swallows leaving a barn at daylight how did the cigar case come to be broken eighteen i asked with a certain feeling of personal grievance i can tell you about that sir said he resting his foot on the chair next to mine did you ever have anybody hand you a double handful of good luck while both your hands were full of bad luck and stop to notice how your fingers behaved no riddles eighteen said i leave out palmistry and manicuring you remember said eighteen the guy in the hammered brass prince albert and the oroide gold pants and the amalgamated copper hat that carried the combination meat axe ice pick and liberty pole and used to stand on the first landing as you go up to the little rindslosh why yes said i the halberdier i never noticed him particularly i remember he thought he was only a suit of armour he had a perfect poise he had more than that said eighteen he was me friend he was an advertisement the boss hired him to stand on the stairs for a kind of scenery to show there was something doing in the has been line upstairs what did you call him a what kind of beer a halberdier said i that was an ancient man at arms of many hundred years ago some mistake said eighteen this one wasn t that old he wasn t over twenty three or four it was the boss s idea rigging a man up in an ante bellum suit of tinware and standing him on the landing of the slosh he bought the goods at a fourth avenue antique store and hung a sign out able bodied hal halberdier wanted costume furnished the same morning a young man with wrecked good clothes and a hungry look comes in bringing the sign with him i was filling the mustard pots at my station i m it says he whatever it is but i never halberdiered in a restaurant put me on is it a masquerade i hear talk in the kitchen of a fishball says i bully for you eighteen says he you and i ll get on show me the boss s desk well the boss tries the harveyized pajamas on him and they fitted him like the scales on a baked redsnapper and he gets the job you ve seen what it is he stood straight up in the corner of the first landing with his halberd to his shoulder looking right ahead and guarding the portugals of the castle the boss is nutty about having the true old world flavour to his joint halberdiers goes with rindsloshes says he just as rats goes with rathskellers and white cotton stockings with tyrolean villages the boss is a kind of a antiologist and is all posted up on data and such information from p m to two in the morning was the halberdier s hours he got two meals with us help and a dollar an night i eat with him at the table he liked me he never told his name he was travelling impromptu like kings i guess the first time at supper i says to him have some more of the spuds mr frelinghuysen oh don t be so formal and offish eighteen says he call me hal that s short for halberdier oh don t think i wanted to pry for names says i i know all about the dizzy fall from wealth and greatness we ve got a count washing dishes in the kitchen and the third bartender used to be a pullman conductor and they work sir percival says i sarcastic eighteen says he as a friendly devil in a cabbage scented hell would you mind cutting up this piece of steak for me i don t say that it s got more muscle than i have but and then he shows me the insides of his hands they was blistered and cut and corned and swelled up till they looked like a couple of flank steaks criss crossed with a knife the kind the butchers hide and take home knowing what is the best shoveling coal says he and piling bricks and loading drays but they gave out and i had to resign i was born for a halberdier and i ve been educated for twenty four years to fill the position now quit knocking my profession and pass along a lot more of that ham i m holding the closing exercises says he of a forty eight hour fast the second night he was on the job he walks down from his corner to the cigar case and calls for cigarettes the customers at the tables all snicker out loud to show their acquaintance with history the boss is on an let s see oh yes an anachronism says the boss cigarettes was not made at the time when halberdiers was invented the ones you sell was says sir percival caporal wins from chronology by the length of a cork tip so he gets em and lights one and puts the box in his brass helmet and goes back to patroling the rindslosh he made a big hit specially with the ladies some of em would poke him with their fingers to see if he was real or only a kind of a stuffed figure like they burn in elegy and when he d move they d squeak and make eyes at him as they went up to the slosh he looked fine in his halberdashery he slept at a week in a hall room on third avenue he invited me up there one night he had a little book on the washstand that he read instead of shopping in the saloons after hours i m on to that says i from reading about it in novels all the heroes on the bum carry the little book it s either tantalus or liver or horace and its printed in latin and you re a college man and i wouldn t be surprised says i if you wasn t educated too but it was only the batting averages of the league for the last ten years one night about half past eleven there comes in a party of these high rollers that are always hunting up new places to eat in and poke fun at there was a swell girl in a h p auto tan coat and veil and a fat old man with white side whiskers and a young chap that couldn t keep his feet off the tail of the girl s coat and an oldish lady that looked upon life as immoral and unnecessary how perfectly delightful they says to sup in a slosh up the stairs they go and in half a minute back down comes the girl her skirts swishing like the waves on the beach she stops on the landing and looks our halberdier in the eye you she says with a smile that reminded me of lemon sherbet i was waiting up stairs in the slosh then and i was right down here by the door putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle of tabasco and i heard all they said it says sir percival without moving i m only local colour are my hauberk helmet and halberd on straight is there an explanation to this says she is it a practical joke such as men play in those griddle cake and lamb clubs i m afraid i don t see the point i heard vaguely that you were away for three months i we have not seen you or heard from you i m halberdiering for my living says the stature i m working says he i don t suppose you know what work means have you have you lost your money she asks sir percival studies a minute i am poorer says he than the poorest sandwich man on the streets if i don t earn my living you call this work says she i thought a man worked with his hands or his head instead of becoming a mountebank the calling of a halberdier says he is an ancient and honourable one sometimes says he the man at arms at the door has saved the castle while the plumed knights were cake walking in the banquet halls above i see you re not ashamed says she of your peculiar tastes i wonder though that the manhood i used to think i saw in you didn t prompt you to draw water or hew wood instead of publicly flaunting your ignominy in this disgraceful masquerade sir percival kind of rattles his armour and says helen will you suspend sentence in this matter for just a little while you don t understand says he i ve got to hold this job down a little longer you like being a harlequin or halberdier as you call it says she i wouldn t get thrown of the job just now says he with a grin to be appointed minister to the court of st james s and then the h p girl s eyes sparked as hard as diamonds very well says she you shall have full run of your serving man s tastes this night and she swims over to the boss s desk and gives him a smile that knocks the specks off his nose i think your rindslosh says she is as beautiful as a dream it is a little slice of the old world set down in new york we shall have a nice supper up there but if you will grant us one favour the illusion will be perfect give us your halberdier to wait on our table that hits the boss s antiology hobby just right sure says he dot vill be fine und der orchestra shall blay die wacht am rhein all der time and he goes over and tells the halberdier to go upstairs and hustle the grub at the swells table i m on the job says sir percival taking off his helmet and hanging it on his halberd and leaning em in the corner the girl goes up and takes her seat and i see her jaw squared tight under her smile we re going to be waited on by a real halberdier says she one who is proud of his profession isn t it sweet ripping says the swell young man much prefer a waiter says the fat old gent i hope he doesn t come from a cheap museum says the old lady he might have microbes in his costume before he goes to the table sir percival takes me by the arm eighteen he says i ve got to pull off this job without a blunder you coach me straight or i ll take that halberd and make hash out of you and then he goes up to the table with his coat of mail on and a napkin over his arm and waits for the order why it s deering says the young swell hello old man what the beg pardon sir interrupts the halberdier i m waiting on the table the old man looks at him grim like a boston bull so deering he says you re at work yet yes sir says sir percival quiet and gentlemanly as i could have been myself for almost three months now you haven t been discharged during the time asks the old man not once sir says he though i ve had to change my work several times waiter orders the girl short and sharp another napkin he brings her one respectful i never saw more devil if i may say it stirred up in a lady there was two bright red spots on her cheeks and her eyes looked exactly like a wildcat s i d seen in the zoo her foot kept slapping the floor all the time waiter she orders bring me filtered water without ice bring me a footstool take away this empty salt cellar she kept him on the jump she was sure giving the halberdier his there wasn t but a few customers up in the slosh at that time so i hung out near the door so i could help sir percival serve he got along fine with the olives and celery and the bluepoints they was easy and then the consomme came up the dumb waiter all in one big silver tureen instead of serving it from the side table he picks it up between his hands and starts to the dining table with it when nearly there he drops the tureen smash on the floor and the soup soaks all the lower part of that girl s swell silk dress stupid incompetent says she giving him a look standing in a corner with a halberd seems to be your mission in life pardon me lady says he it was just a little bit hotter than blazes i couldn t help it the old man pulls out a memorandum book and hunts in it the th of april deering says he i know it says sir percival and ten minutes to twelve o clock says the old man by jupiter you haven t won yet and he pounds the table with his fist and yells to me waiter call the manager at once tell him to hurry here as fast as he can i go after the boss and old brockmann hikes up to the slosh on the jump i want this man discharged at once roads the old guy look what he s done ruined my daughter s dress it cost at least discharge this awkward lout at once or i ll sue you for the price of it dis is bad pizness says the boss six hundred dollars is much i reckon i vill haf to wait a minute herr brockmann says sir percival easy and smiling but he was worked up under his tin suitings i could see that and then he made the finest neatest little speech i ever listened to i can t give you the words of course he give the millionaires a lovely roast in a sarcastic way describing their automobiles and opera boxes and diamonds and then he got around to the working classes and the kind of grub they eat and the long hours they work and all that sort of stuff bunkum of course the restless rich says he never content with their luxuries always prowling among the haunts of the poor and humble amusing themselves with the imperfections and misfortunes of their fellow men and women and even here herr brockmann he says in this beautiful rindslosh a grand and enlightening reproduction of old world history and architecture they come to disturb its symmetry and picturesqueness by demanding in their arrogance that the halberdier of the castle wait upon their table i have faithfuly and conscientiously says he performed my duties as a halberdier i know nothing of a waiter s duties it was the insolent whim of these transient pampered aristocrats that i should be detailed to serve them food must i be blamed must i be deprived of the means of a livelihood he goes on on account of an accident that was the result of their own presumption and haughtiness but what hurts me more than all says sir percival is the desecration that has been done to this splendid rindslosh the confiscation of its halberdier to serve menially at the banquet board even i could see that this stuff was piffle but it caught the boss mein gott says he you vas right ein halberdier have not got der right to dish up soup him i vill not discharge have anoder waiter if you like und let mein halberdier go back und stand mit his halberd but gentlemen he says pointing to the old man you go ahead and sue mit der dress sue me for or i stand der suit and the boss puffs off down stairs old brockmann was an all right dutchman just then the clock strikes twelve and the old guy laughs loud you win deering says he and let me explain to all he goes on some time ago mr deering asked me for something that i did not want to give him i looks at the girl and she turns as red as a pickled beet i told him says the old guy if he would earn his own living for three months without being discharged for incompetence i would give him what he wanted it seems that the time was up at twelve o clock to night i came near fetching you though deering on that soup question says the old boy standing up and grabbing sir percival s hand the halberdier lets out a yell and jumps three feet high look out for those hands says he and he holds em up you never saw such hands except on a labourer in a limestone quarry heavens boy says old side whiskers what have you been doing to em oh says sir percival little chores like hauling coal and excavating rock till they went back on me and when i couldn t hold a pick or a whip i took up halberdiering to give em a rest tureens full of hot soup don t seem to be a particularly soothing treatment i would have bet on that girl that high tempered kind always go as far the other way according to my experience she whizzes round the table like a cyclone and catches both his hands in hers poor hands dear hands she sings out and sheds tears on em and holds em close to her bosom well sir with all that rindslosh scenery it was just like a play and the halberdier sits down at the table at the girl s side and i served the rest of the supper and that was about all except that when they left he shed his hardware store and went with em i dislike to be side tracked from an original proposition but you haven t told me eighteen said i how the cigar case came to be broken oh that was last night said eighteen sir percival and the girl drove up in a cream coloured motor car and had dinner in the rindslosh the same table billy i heard her say as they went up i waited on em we ve got a new halberdier now a bow legged guy with a face like a sheep as they came down stairs sir percival passes him a ten case note the new halberdier drops his halberd and it falls on the cigar case that s how that happened two renegades in the gate city of the south the confederate veterans were reuniting and i stood to see them march beneath the tangled flags of the great conflict to the hall of their oratory and commemoration while the irregular and halting line was passing i made onslaught upon it and dragged from the ranks my friend barnard o keefe who had no right to be there for he was a northerner born and bred and what should he be doing halloing for the stars and bars among those gray and moribund veterans and why should he be trudging with his shining martial humorous broad face among those warriors of a previous and alien generation i say i dragged him forth and held him till the last hickory leg and waving goatee had stumbled past and then i hustled him out of the crowd into a cool interior for the gate city was stirred that day and the hand organs wisely eliminated marching through georgia from their repertories now what deviltry are you up to i asked of o keefe when there were a table and things in glasses between us o keefe wiped his heated face and instigated a commotion among the floating ice in his glass before he chose to answer i am assisting at the wake said he of the only nation on earth that ever did me a good turn as one gentleman to another i am ratifying and celebrating the foreign policy of the late jefferson davis as fine a statesman as ever settled the financial question of a country equal ratio that was his platform a barrel of money for a barrel of flour a pair of bills for a pair of boots a hatful of currency for a new hat say ain t that simple compared with w j b s little old oxidized plank what talk is this i asked your financial digression is merely a subterfuge why were you marching in the ranks of the confederate veterans because my lad answered o keefe the confederate government in its might and power interposed to protect and defend barnard o keefe against immediate and dangerous assassination at the hands of a blood thirsty foreign country after the unites states of america had overruled his appeal for protection and had instructed private secretary cortelyou to reduce his estimate of the republican majority for by one vote come barney said i the confederate states of america has been out of existence nearly forty years you do not look older yourself when was it that the deceased government exerted its foreign policy in your behalf four months ago said o keefe promptly the infamous foreign power i alluded to is still staggering from the official blow dealt it by mr davis s contraband aggregation of states that s why you see me cake walking with the ex rebs to the illegitimate tune about simmon seeds and cotton i vote for the great father in washington but i am not going back on mars jeff you say the confederacy has been dead forty years well if it hadn t been for it i d have been breathing to day with soul so dead i couldn t have whispered a single cuss word about my native land the o keefes are not overburdened with ingratitude i must have looked bewildered the war was over i said vacantly in o keefe laughed loudly scattering my thoughts ask old doc millikin if the war is over he shouted hugely diverted oh no doc hasn t surrendered yet and the confederate states well i just told you they bucked officially and solidly and nationally against a foreign government four months ago and kept me from being shot old jeff s country stepped in and brought me off under its wing while roosevelt was having a gunboat repainted and waiting for the national campaign committee to look up whether i had ever scratched the ticket isn t there a story in this barney i asked no said o keefe but i ll give you the facts you know i went down to panama when this irritation about a canal began i thought i d get in on the ground floor i did and had to sleep on it and drink water with little zoos in it so of course i got the chagres fever that was in a little town called san juan on the coast after i got the fever hard enough to kill a port au prince nigger i had a relapse in the shape of doc millikin there was a doctor to attend a sick man if doc millikin had your case he made the terrors of death seem like an invitation to a donkey party he had the bedside manners of a piute medicine man and the soothing presence of a dray loaded with iron bridge girders when he laid his hand on your fevered brow you felt like cap john smith just before pocahontas went his bail well this old medical outrage floated down to my shack when i sent for him he was build like a shad and his eyebrows was black and his white whiskers trickled down from his chin like milk coming out of a sprinkling pot he had a nigger boy along carrying an old tomato can full of calomel and a saw doc felt my pulse and then he began to mess up some calomel with an agricultural implement that belonged to the trowel class i don t want any death mask made yet doc i says nor my liver put in a plaster of paris cast i m sick and it s medicine i need not frescoing you re a blame yankee ain t you asked doc going on mixing up his portland cement i m from the north says i but i m a plain man and don t care for mural decorations when you get the isthmus all asphalted over with that boll weevil prescription would you mind giving me a dose of pain killer or a little strychnine on toast to ease up this feeling of unhealthiness that i have got they was all sassy just like you says old doc but we lowered their temperature considerable yes sir i reckon we sent a good many of ye over to old mortuis nisi bonum look at antietam and bull run and seven pines and around nashville there never was a battle where we didn t lick ye unless you was ten to our one i knew you were a blame yankee the minute i laid eyes on you don t reopen the chasm doc i begs him any yankeeness i may have is geographical and as far as i am concerned a southerner is as good as a filipino any day i m feeling to bad too argue let s have secession without misrepresentation if you say so but what i need is more laudanum and less lundy s lane if you re mixing that compound gefloxide of gefloxicum for me please fill my ears with it before you get around to the battle of gettysburg for there is a subject full of talk by this time doc millikin had thrown up a line of fortifications on square pieces of paper and he says to me yank take one of these powders every two hours they won t kill you i ll be around again about sundown to see if you re alive old doc s powders knocked the chagres i stayed in san juan and got to knowing him better he was from mississippi and the red hottest southerner that ever smelled mint he made stonewall jackson and r e lee look like abolitionists he had a family somewhere down near yazoo city but he stayed away from the states on account of an uncontrollable liking he had for the absence of a yankee government him and me got as thick personally as the emperor of russia and the dove of peace but sectionally we didn t amalgamate twas a beautiful system of medical practice introduced by old doc into that isthmus of land he d take that bracket saw and the mild chloride and his hypodermic and treat anything from yellow fever to a personal friend besides his other liabilities doc could play a flute for a minute or two he was guilty of two tunes dixie and another one that was mighty close to the suwanee river you might say one of its tributaries he used to come down and sit with me while i was getting well and aggrieve his flute and say unreconstructed things about the north you d have thought that the smoke from the first gun at fort sumter was still floating around in the air you know that was about the time they staged them property revolutions down there that wound up in the fifth act with the thrilling canal scene where uncle sam has nine curtain calls holding miss panama by the hand while the bloodhounds keep senator morgan treed up in a cocoanut palm that s the way it wound up but at first it seemed as if colombia was going to make panama look like one of the kind with dents made in it in the factory like they wear at north beach fish fries for mine i played the straw hat crowd to win and they gave me a colonel s commission over a brigade of twenty seven men in the left wing and second joint of the insurgent army the colombian troops were awfully rude to us one day when i had my brigade in a sandy spot with its shoes off doing a battalion drill by squads the government army rushed from behind a bush at us acting as noisy and disagreeable as they could my troops enfiladed left faced and left the spot after enticing the enemy for three miles or so we struck a brier patch and had to sit down when we were ordered to throw up our toes and surrender we obeyed five of my best staff officers fell suffering extremely with stone bruised heels then and there those colombians took your friend barney sir stripped him of the insignia of his rank consisting of a pair of brass knuckles and a canteen of rum and dragged him before a military court the presiding general went through the usual legal formalities that sometimes cause a case to hang on the calendar of a south american military court as long as ten minutes he asked me my age and then sentenced me to be shot they woke up the court interpreter an american named jenks who was in the rum business and vice versa and told him to translate the verdict jenks stretched himself and took a morphine tablet you ve got to back up against th dobe old man says he to me three weeks i believe you get haven t got a chew of fine cut on you have you translate that again with foot notes and a glossary says i i don t know whether i m discharged condemned or handed over to the gerry society oh says jenks don t you understand you re to be stood up against a dobe wall and shot in two or three weeks three i think they said would you mind asking em which says i a week don t amount to much after you re dead but it seems a real nice long spell while you are alive it s two weeks says the interpreter after inquiring in spanish of the court shall i ask em again let be says i let s have a stationary verdict if i keep on appealing this way they ll have me shot about ten days before i was captured no i haven t got any fine cut they sends me over to the calaboza with a detachment of coloured postal telegraph boys carrying enfield rifles and i am locked up in a kind of brick bakery the temperature in there was just about the kind mentioned in the cooking recipes that call for a quick oven then i gives a silver dollar to one of the guards to send for the united states consul he comes around in pajamas with a pair of glasses on his nose and a dozen or two inside of him i m to be shot in two weeks says i and although i ve made a memorandum of it i don t seem to get it off my mind you want to call up uncle sam on the cable as quick as you can and get him all worked up about it have em send the kentucky and the kearsage and the oregon down right away that ll be about enough battleships but it wouldn t hurt to have a couple of cruisers and a torpedo boat destroyer too and say if dewey isn t busy better have him come along on the fastest one of the fleet now see here o keefe says the consul getting the best of a hiccup what do you want to bother the state department about this matter for didn t you hear me says i i m to be shot in two weeks did you think i said i was going to a lawn party and it wouldn t hurt of roosevelt could get the japs to send down the yellowyamtiskookum or the ogotosingsing or some other first class cruisers to help it would make me feel safer now what you want says the consul is not to get excited i ll send you over some chewing tobacco and some banana fritters when i go back the united states can t interfere in this you know you were caught insurging against the government and you re subject to the laws of this country to tell the truth i ve had an intimation from the state department unofficially of course that whenever a soldier of fortune demands a fleet of gunboats in a case of revolutionary katzenjammer i should cut the cable give him all the tobacco he wants and after he s shot take his clothes if they fit me for part payment of my salary consul says i to him this is a serious question you are representing uncle sam this ain t any little international tomfoolery like a universal peace congress or the christening of the shamrock iv i m an american citizen and i demand protection i demand the mosquito fleet and schley and the atlantic squadron and bob evans and general e byrd grubb and two or three protocols what are you going to do about it nothing doing says the consul be off with you then says i out of patience with him and send me doc millikin ask doc to come and see me doc comes and looks through the bars at me surrounded by dirty soldiers with even my shoes and canteen confiscated and he looks mightily pleased hello yank says he getting a little taste of johnson s island now ain t ye doc says i i ve just had an interview with the u s consul i gather from his remarks that i might just as well have been caught selling suspenders in kishineff under the name of rosenstein as to be in my present condition it seems that the only maritime aid i am to receive from the united states is some navy plug to chew doc says i can t you suspend hostility on the slavery question long enough to do something for me it ain t been my habit doc millikin answers to do any painless dentistry when i find a yank cutting an eye tooth so the stars and stripes ain t lending any marines to shell the huts of the colombian cannibals hey oh say can you see by the dawn s early light the star spangled banner has fluked in the fight what s the matter with the war department hey it s a great thing to be a citizen of a gold standard nation ain t it rub it in doc all you want says i i guess we re weak on foreign policy for a yank says doc putting on his specs and talking more mild you ain t so bad if you had come from below the line i reckon i would have liked you right smart now since your country has gone back on you you have to come to the old doctor whose cotton you burned and whose mules who stole and whose niggers you freed to help you ain t that so yank it is says i heartily and let s have a diagnosis of the case right away for in two weeks time all you can do is to hold an autopsy and i don t want to be amputated if i can help it now says doc business like it s easy enough for you to get out of this scrape money ll do it you ve got to pay a long string of em from general pomposo down to this anthropoid ape guarding your door about will do the trick have you got the money me says i i ve got one chili dollar two real pieces and a medio then if you ve any last words utter em says that old reb the roster of your financial budget sounds quite much to be like the noise of a requiem change the treatment says i i admit that i m short call a consultation or use radium or smuggle me in some saws or something yank says doc millikin i ve a good notion to help you there s only one government in the world that can get you out of this difficulty and that s the confederate states of america the grandest nation that ever existed just as you said to me i says to doc why the confederacy ain t a nation it s been absolved forty years ago that s a campaign lie says doc she s running along as solid as the roman empire she s the only hope you ve got now you being a yank have got to go through with some preliminary obsequies before you can get official aid you ve got to take the oath of allegiance to the confederate government then i ll guarantee she does all she can for you what do you say yank it s your last chance if you re fooling with me doc i answers you re no better than the united states but as you say it s the last chance hurry up and swear me i always did like the corn whisky and possum anyhow i believe i m half southerner by nature i m willing to try the klu klux in place of the khaki get brisk doc millikin thinks awhile and then he offers me this oath of allegiance to take without any kind of a chaser i barnard o keefe yank being of sound body but a republican mind hereby swear to transfer my fealty respect and allegiance to the confederate states of america and the government thereof in consideration of said government through its official acts and powers obtaining my freedom and release from confinement and sentence of death brought about by the exuberance of my irish proclivities and my general pizenness as a yank i repeated these words after doc but they seemed to me a kind of hocus pocus and i don t believe any life insurance company in the world would have issued me a policy on the strength of em doc went away saying he would communicate with his government immediately say you can imagine how i felt me to be shot in two weeks and my only hope for help being in a government that s been dead so long that it isn t even remembered except on decoration day and when joe wheeler signs the voucher for his pay check but it was all there was in sight and somehow i thought doc millikin had something up his old alpaca sleeve that wasn t all foolishness around to the jail comes old doc again in about a week i was flea bitten a mite sarcastic and fundamentally hungry any confederate ironclads in the offing i asks do you notice any sounds resembling the approach of jeb stewart s cavalry overland or stonewall jackson sneaking up in the rear if you do i wish you d say so it s too soon yet for help to come says doc the sooner the better says i i don t care if it gets in fully fifteen minutes before i am shot and if you happen to lay eyes on beauregard or albert sidney johnston or any of the relief corps wig wag em to hike along there s been no answer received yet says doc don t forget says i that there s only four days more i don t know how you propose to work this thing doc i says to him but it seems to me i d sleep better if you had got a government that was alive and on the map like afghanistan or great britain or old man kruger s kingdom to take this matter up i don t mean any disrespect to your confederate states but i can t help feeling that my chances of being pulled out of this scrape was decidedly weakened when general lee surrendered it s your only chance said doc don t quarrel with it what did your own country do for you it was only two days before the morning i was to be shot when doc millikin came around again all right yank says he help s come the confederate states of america is going to apply for your release the representatives of the government arrived on a fruit steamer last night bully says i bully for you doc i suppose it s marines with a gatling i m going to love your country all i can for this negotiations says old doc will be opened between the two governments at once you will know later to day if they are successful about four in the afternoon a soldier in red trousers brings a paper round to the jail and they unlocks the door and i walks out the guard at the door bows and i bows and i steps into the grass and wades around to doc millikin s shack doc was sitting in his hammock playing dixie soft and low and out of tune on his flute i interrupted him at look away look away and shook his hand for five minutes i never thought says doc taking a chew fretfully that i d ever try to save any blame yank s life but mr o keefe i don t see but what you are entitled to be considered part human anyhow i never thought yanks had any of the rudiments of decorum and laudability about them i reckon i might have been too aggregative in my tabulation but it ain t me you want to thank it s the confederate states of america and i m much obliged to em says i it s a poor man that wouldn t be patriotic with a country that s saved his life i ll drink to the stars and bars whenever there s a flagstaff and a glass convenient but where says i are the rescuing troops if there was a gun fired or a shell burst i didn t hear it doc millikin raises up and points out the window with his flute at the banana steamer loading with fruit yank says he there s a steamer that s going to sail in the morning if i was you i d sail on it the confederate government s done all it can for you there wasn t a gun fired the negotiations were carried on secretly between the two nations by the purser of that steamer i got him to do it because i didn t want to appear in it twelve thousand dollars was paid to the officials in bribes to let you go man says i sitting down hard twelve thousand how will i ever who could have where did the money come from yazoo city says doc millikin i ve got a little saved up there two barrels full it looks good to these colombians twas confederate money every dollar of it now do you see why you d better leave before they try to pass some of it on an expert i do says i now let s hear you give the password says doc millikin hurrah for jeff davis says i correct says doc and let me tell you something the next tune i learn on my flute is going to be yankee doodle i reckon there s some yanks that are not so pizen or if you was me would you try the red white and blue the lonesome road brown as a coffee berry rugged pistoled spurred wary indefeasible i saw my old friend deputy marshal buck caperton stumble with jingling rowels into a chair in the marshal s outer office and because the court house was almost deserted at that hour and because buck would sometimes relate to me things that were out of print i followed him in and tricked him into talk through knowledge of a weakness he had for cigarettes rolled with sweet corn husk were as honey to buck s palate and though he could finger the trigger of a forty five with skill and suddenness he never could learn to roll a cigarette it was through no fault of mine for i rolled the cigarettes tight and smooth but the upshot of some whim of his own that instead of to an odyssey of the chaparral i listened to a dissertation upon matrimony this from buck caperton but i maintain that the cigarettes were impeccable and crave absolution for myself we just brought in jim and bud granberry said buck train robbing you know held up the aransas pass last month we caught em in the twenty mile pear flat south of the nueces have much trouble corralling them i asked for here was the meat that my hunger for epics craved some said buck and then during a little pause his thoughts stampeded off the trail it s kind of queer about women he went on and the place they re supposed to occupy in botany if i was asked to classify them i d say they was a human loco weed ever see a bronc that had been chewing loco ride him up to a puddle of water two feet wide and he ll give a snort and fall back on you it looks as big as the mississippi river to him next trip he d walk into a canon a thousand feet deep thinking it was a prairie dog hole same way with a married man i was thinking of perry rountree that used to be my sidekicker before he committed matrimony in them days me and perry hated indisturbances of any kind we roamed around considerable stirring up the echoes and making em attend to business why when me and perry wanted to have some fun in a town it was a picnic for the census takers they just counted the marshal s posse that it took to subdue us and there was your population but then there came along this mariana goodnight girl and looked at perry sideways and he was all bridle wise and saddle broke before you could skin a yearling i wasn t even asked to the wedding i reckon the bride had my pedigree and the front elevation of my habits all mapped out and she decided that perry would trot better in double harness without any unconverted mustang like buck caperton whickering around on the matrimonial range so it was six months before i saw perry again one day i was passing on the edge of town and i see something like a man in a little yard by a little house with a sprinkling pot squirting water on a rose bush seemed to me i d seen something like it before and i stopped at the gate trying to figure out its brands twas not perry rountree but twas the kind of a curdled jellyfish matrimony had made out of him homicide was what that mariana had perpetrated he was looking well enough but he had on a white collar and shoes and you could tell in a minute that he d speak polite and pay taxes and stick his little finger out while drinking just like a sheep man or a citizen great skyrockets but i hated to see perry all corrupted and willie ized like that he came out to the gate and shook hands and i says with scorn and speaking like a paroquet with the pip beg pardon mr rountree i believe seems to me i sagatiated in your associations once if i am not mistaken oh go to the devil buck says perry polite as i was afraid he d be well then says i you poor contaminated adjunct of a sprinkling pot and degraded household pet what did you go and do it for look at you all decent and unriotous and only fit to sit on juries and mend the wood house door you was a man once i have hostility for all such acts why don t you go in the house and count the tidies or set the clock and not stand out here in the atmosphere a jack rabbit might come along and bite you now buck says perry speaking mild and some sorrowful you don t understand a married man has got to be different he feels different from a tough old cloudburst like you it s sinful to waste time pulling up towns just to look at their roots and playing faro and looking upon red liquor and such restless policies as them there was a time i says and i expect i sighed when i mentioned it when a certain domesticated little mary s lamb i could name was some instructed himself in the line of pernicious sprightliness i never expected perry to see you reduced down from a full grown pestilence to such a frivolous fraction of a man why says i you ve got a necktie on and you speak a senseless kind of indoor drivel that reminds me of a storekeeper or a lady you look to me like you might tote an umbrella and wear suspenders and go home of nights the little woman says perry has made some improvements i believe you can t understand buck i haven t been away from the house at night since we was married we talked on a while me and perry and as sure as i live that man interrupted me in the middle of my talk to tell me about six tomato plants he had growing in his garden shoved his agricultural degradation right up under my nose while i was telling him about the fun we had tarring and feathering that faro dealer at california pete s layout but by and by perry shows a flicker of sense buck says he i ll have to admit that it is a little dull at times not that i m not perfectly happy with the little woman but a man seems to require some excitement now and then now i ll tell you mariana s gone visiting this afternoon and she won t be home till seven o clock neither of us ever stays out a minute after that time unless we are together now i m glad you came along buck says perry for i m feeling just like having one more rip roaring razoo with you for the sake of old times what you say to us putting in the afternoon having fun i d like it fine says perry i slapped that old captive range rider half across his little garden get your hat you old dried up alligator i shouts you ain t dead yet you re part human anyhow if you did get all bogged up in matrimony we ll take this town to pieces and see what makes it tick we ll make all kinds of profligate demands upon the science of cork pulling you ll grow horns yet old muley cow says i punching perry in the ribs if you trot around on the trail of vice with your uncle buck i ll have to be home by seven you know says perry again oh yes says i winking to myself for i knew the kind of seven o clocks perry rountree got back by after he once got to passing repartee with the bartenders we goes down to the gray mule saloon that old dobe building by the depot give it a name says i as soon as we got one hoof on the foot rest sarsaparilla says perry you could have knocked me down with a lemon peeling insult me as much as you want to i says to perry but don t startle the bartender he may have heart disease come on now your tongue got twisted the tall glasses i orders and the bottle in the left hand corner of the ice chest sarsaparilla repeats perry and then his eyes get animated and i see he s got some great scheme in his mind he wants to emit buck says he all interested i ll tell you what i want to make this a red letter day i ve been keeping close at home and i want to turn myself a loose we ll have the highest old time you ever saw we ll go in the back room here and play checkers till half past six i leaned against the bar and i says to gotch eared mike who was on watch for god s sake don t mention this you know what perry used to be he s had the fever and the doctor says we must humour him give us the checker board and the men mike says perry come on buck i m just wild to have some excitement i went in the back room with perry before we closed the door i says to mike don t ever let it straggle out from under your hat that you seen buck caperton fraternal with sarsaparilla or persona grata with a checker board or i ll make a swallow fork in your other ear i locked the door and me and perry played checkers to see that poor old humiliated piece of household bric a brac sitting there and sniggering out loud whenever he jumped a man and all obnoxious with animation when he got into my king row would have made a sheep dog sick with mortification him that was once satisfied only when he was pegging six boards at keno or giving the faro dealers nervous prostration to see him pushing them checkers about like sally louisa at a school children s party why i was all smothered up with mortification and i sits there playing the black men all sweating for fear somebody i knew would find it out and i thinks to myself some about this marrying business and how it seems to be the same kind of a game as that mrs delilah played she give her old man a hair cut and everybody knows what a man s head looks like after a woman cuts his hair and then when the pharisees came around to guy him he was so shamed that he went to work and kicked the whole house down on top of the whole outfit them married men thinks i lose all their spirit and instinct for riot and foolishness they won t drink they won t buck the tiger they won t even fight what do they want to go and stay married for i asks myself but perry seems to be having hilarity in considerable quantities buck old hoss says he isn t this just the hell roaringest time we ever had in our lives i don t know when i ve been stirred up so you see i ve been sticking pretty close to home since i married and i haven t been on a spree in a long time spree yes that s what he called it playing checkers in the back room of the gray mule i suppose it did seem to him a little more immoral and nearer to a prolonged debauch than standing over six tomato plants with a sprinkling pot every little bit perry looks at his watch and says i got to be home you know buck at seven all right i d say romp along and move this here excitement s killing me if i don t reform some and loosen up the strain of this checkered dissipation i won t have a nerve left it might have been half past six when commotions began to go on outside in the street we heard a yelling and a six shootering and a lot of galloping and manoeuvres what s that i wonders oh some nonsense outside says perry it s your move we just got time to play this game i ll just take a peep through the window says i and see you can t expect a mere mortal to stand the excitement of having a king jumped and listen to an unidentified conflict going on at the same time the gray mule saloon was one of them old spanish dobe buildings and the back room only had two little windows a foot wide with iron bars in em i looked out one and i see the cause of the rucus there was the trimble gang ten of em the worst outfit of desperadoes and horse thieves in texas coming up the street shooting right and left they was coming right straight for the gray mule then they got past the range of my sight but we heard em ride up to the front door and then they socked the place full of lead we heard the big looking glass behind the bar knocked all to pieces and the bottles crashing we could see gotch eared mike in his apron running across the plaza like a coyote with the bullets puffing up dust all around him then the gang went to work in the saloon drinking what they wanted and smashing what they didn t me and petty both knew that gang and they knew us the year before perry married him and me was in the same ranger company and we fought that outfit down on the san miguel and brought back ben trimble and two others for murder we can t get out says i we ll have to stay in here till they leave perry looked at his watch twenty five to seven says he we can finish that game i got two men on you it s your move buck i got to be home at seven you know we sat down and went on playing the trimble gang had a roughhouse for sure they were getting good and drunk they d drink a while and holler a while and then they d shoot up a few bottles and glasses two or three times they came and tried to open our door then there was some more shooting outside and i looked out the window again ham gossett the town marshal had a posse in the houses and stores across the street and was trying to bag a trimble or two through the windows i lost that game of checkers i m free in saying that i lost three kings that i might have saved if i had been corralled in a more peaceful pasture but that drivelling married man sat there and cackled when he won a man like an unintelligent hen picking up a grain of corn when the game was over perry gets up and looks at his watch i ve had a glorious time buck says he but i ll have to be going now it s a quarter to seven and i got to be home by seven you know i thought he was joking they ll clear out or be dead drunk in half an hour or an hour says i you ain t that tired of being married that you want to commit any more sudden suicide are you says i giving him the laugh one time says perry i was half an hour late getting home i met mariana on the street looking for me if you could have seen her buck but you don t understand she knows what a wild kind of a snoozer i ve been and she s afraid something will happen i ll never be late getting home again i ll say good bye to you now buck i got between him and the door married man says i i know you was christened a fool the minute the preacher tangled you up but don t you never sometimes think one little think on a human basis there s ten of that gang in there and they re pizen with whisky and desire for murder they ll drink you up like a bottle of booze before you get half way to the door be intelligent now and use at least wild hog sense sit down and wait till we have some chance to get out without being carried in baskets i got to be home by seven buck repeats this hen pecked thing of little wisdom like an unthinking poll parrot mariana says he will be out looking for me and he reaches down and pulls a leg out of the checker table i ll go through this trimble outfit says he like a cottontail through a brush corral i m not pestered any more with a desire to engage in rucuses but i got to be home by seven you lock the door after me buck and don t you forget i won three out of them five games i d play longer but mariana hush up you old locoed road runner i interrupts did you ever notice your uncle buck locking doors against trouble i m not married says i but i m as big a d n fool as any mormon one from four leaves three says i and i gathers out another leg of the table we ll get home by seven says i whether it s the heavenly one or the other may i see you home says i you sarsaparilla drinking checker playing glutton for death and destruction we opened the door easy and then stampeded for the front part of the gang was lined up at the bar part of em was passing over the drinks and two or three was peeping out the door and window and taking shots at the marshal s crowd the room was so full of smoke we got half way to the front door before they noticed us then i heard berry trimble s voice somewhere yell out how d that buck caperton get in here and he skinned the side of my neck with a bullet i reckon he felt bad over that miss for berry s the best shot south of the southern pacific railroad but the smoke in the saloon was some too thick for good shooting me and perry smashed over two of the gang with our table legs which didn t miss like the guns did and as we run out the door i grabbed a winchester from a fellow who was watching the outside and i turned and regulated the account of mr berry me and perry got out and around the corner all right i never much expected to get out but i wasn t going to be intimidated by that married man according to perry s idea checkers was the event of the day but if i am any judge of gentle recreations that little table leg parade through the gray mule saloon deserved the head lines in the bill of particulars walk fast says perry it s two minutes to seven and i got to be home by oh shut up says i i had an appointment as chief performer at an inquest at seven and i m not kicking about not keeping it i had to pass by perry s little house his mariana was standing at the gate we got there at five minutes past seven she had on a blue wrapper and her hair was pulled back smooth like little girls do when they want to look grown folksy she didn t see us till we got close for she was gazing up the other way then she backed around and saw perry and a kind of a look scooted around over her face danged if i can describe it i heard her breathe long just like a cow when you turn her calf in the lot and she says you re late perry five minutes says perry cheerful me and old buck was having a game of checkers perry introduces me to mariana and they ask me to come in no sir ee i d had enough truck with married folks for that day i says i ll be going along and that i ve spent a very pleasant afternoon with my old partner especially says i just to jostle perry during that game when the table legs came all loose but i d promised him not to let her know anything i ve been worrying over that business ever since it happened continued buck there s one thing about it that s got me all twisted up and i can t figure it out what was that i asked as i rolled and handed buck the last cigarette why i ll tell you when i saw the look that little woman gave perry when she turned round and saw him coming back to the ranch safe why was it i got the idea all in a minute that that look of hers was worth more than the whole caboodle of us sarsaparilla checkers and all and that the d n fool in the game wasn t named perry rountree at all rolling stones introduction this the twelfth and final volume of o henry s work gets its title from an early newspaper venture of which he was the head and front on april there appeared in austin texas volume number of the rolling stone with a circulation greatly in excess of that of the only two numbers that had gone before apparently the business office was encouraged the first two issues of one thousand copies each had been bought up of the third an edition of six thousand was published and distributed free so that the business men of austin texas might know what a good medium was at hand for their advertising the editor and proprietor and illustrator of the rolling stone was will porter incidentally paying and receiving teller in major brackenridge s bank perhaps the most characteristic feature of the paper was the plunkville patriot a page each week or at least with the regularity of the somewhat uncertain paper itself purporting to be reprinted from a contemporary journal the editor of the plunkville patriot was colonel aristotle jordan unrelenting enemy of his enemies when the colonel s application for the postmastership in plunkville is ignored his columns carry a bitter attack on the administration at washington with the public weal at heart the patriot announces that there is a dangerous hole in the front steps of the elite saloon here too appears the delightful literary item that mark twain and charles egbert craddock are spending the summer together in their adirondacks camp free runs its advertising column a clergyman who cured himself of fits will send one book containing popular songs one repeating rifle two decks easywinner cards and liver pad free of charge for address sucker chump augusta me the office moves nearly every week probably in accordance with the time honored principle involving the comparative ease of moving and paying rent when the colonel publishes his own candidacy for mayor he further declares that the patriot will accept no announcements for municipal offices until after our the editor s canvass adams co grocers order their ad discontinued and find later in the patriot this estimate of their product no less than three children have been poisoned by eating their canned vegetables and j o adams the senior member of the firm was run out of kansas city for adulterating codfish balls it pays to advertise here is the editorial in which the editor first announces his campaign our worthy mayor colonel henry stutty died this morning after an illness of about five minutes brought on by carrying a bouquet to mrs eli watts just as eli got in from a fishing trip ten minutes later we had dodgers out announcing our candidacy for the office we have lived in plunkville going on five years and have never been elected anything yet we understand the mayor business thoroughly and if elected some people will wish wolves had stolen them from their cradles the page from the patriot is presented with an array of perfectly confused type of artistic errors in setting up and when an occasional line gets shifted intentionally of course the effect is alarming anybody who knows the advertising of a small country weekly can as he reads pick out in the following the advertisement from the personal miss hattie green of paris ill is steel riveted seam or water power automatic oiling thoroughly tested visiting her sister mrs g w grubes little giant engines at adams co also sachet powders mc cormick reapers and oysters all of this was a part of the rolling stone which flourished or at least wavered in austin during the years and years before porter s strong instinct to write had been gratified in letters he wrote in his twenties long imaginative letters occasionally stuffed with execrable puns but more than often buoyant truly humorous keenly incisive into the unreal especially in fiction i have included a number of these letters to doctor beall of greensboro n c and to his early friend in texas mr david harrell in porter went to houston texas to work on the houston post there he conducted a column which he called postscripts some of the contents of the pages that follow have been taken from these old files in the fair hope that admirers of the matured o henry will find in them pleasurable marks of the later genius before the days of the rolling stone there are eleven years in texas over which with the exception of the letters mentioned there are few traces of literary performance but there are some very interesting drawings some of which are reproduced in this volume a story is back of them they were the illustrations to a book joe dixon prospector and inveterate fortune seeker came to austin from the rockies in at the constant urging of his old pal mr john maddox joe kept writing mr maddox your fortune s in your pen not your pick come to austin and write an account of your adventures it was hard to woo dixon from the gold that wasn t there but finally maddox wrote him he must come and try the scheme there s a boy here from north carolina wrote maddox his name is will porter and he can make the pictures he s all right dixon came the plan was that after author and artist had done their work patron would step in carry the manuscript to new york bestow it on a deserving publisher and then return to await with the other two the avalanche of royalties this version of the story comes from mr maddox there were forty pictures in all and they were very true to the life of the rockies in the seventies of course the young artist had no technique no anything except what was native but wait as the months went by dixon worked hard but he began to have doubts perhaps the book was no good perhaps john would only lose his money he was a miner not a writer and he ought not to let john go to any expense the result of this line of thought was the colorado river for the manuscript and the high road for the author the pictures fortunately were saved most of them porter gave later to mrs hagelstein of san angelo texas mr maddox by the way finding a note from joe that explained all hastened to the river and recovered a few scraps of the great book that had lodged against a sandbar but there was no putting them together again so much for the title it is a real o henry title contents of this last volume are drawn not only from letters old newspaper files and the rolling stone but from magazines and unpublished manuscripts of the short stories several were written at the very height of his powers and popularity and were lost inexplicably but lost of the poems there are a few whose authorship might have been in doubt if the compiler of this collection had not secured external evidence that made them certainly the work of o henry without this very strong evidence they might have been rejected because they were not entirely the kind of poems the readers of o henry would expect from him most of them however were found in his own indubitable manuscript or over his own signature there is extant a mass of o henry correspondence that has not been included in this collection during the better part of a decade in new york city he wrote constantly to editors and in many instances intimately this is very important material and permission has been secured to use nearly all of it in a biographical volume that will be issued within the next two or three years the letters in this volume have been chosen as an exihibit as early specimens of his writing and for their particularly characteristic turns of thought and phrase the collection is not complete in any historical sense h p s this record of births and deaths is copied from the porter family bible just lately discovered births algernon sidney porter son of sidney and

was the last work of o henry the cosmopolitan magazine had ordered it from him and after his death the unfinished manuscript was found in his room on his dusty desk the story as it here appears was published in the cosmopolitan for september murray dreamed a dream both psychology and science grope when they would explain to us the strange adventures of our immaterial selves when wandering in the realm of death s twin brother sleep this story will not attempt to be illuminative it is no more than a record of murray s dream one of the most puzzling phases of that strange waking sleep is that dreams which seem to cover months or even years may take place within a few seconds or minutes murray was waiting in his cell in the ward of the condemned an electric arc light in the ceiling of the corridor shone brightly upon his table on a sheet of white paper an ant crawled wildly here and there as murray blocked its way with an envelope the electrocution was set for eight o clock in the evening murray smiled at the antics of the wisest of insects there were seven other condemned men in the chamber since he had been there murray had seen three taken out to their fate one gone mad and fighting like a wolf caught in a trap one no less mad offering up a sanctimonious lip service to heaven the third a weakling collapsed and strapped to a board he wondered with what credit to himself his own heart foot and face would meet his punishment for this was his evening he thought it must be nearly eight o clock opposite his own in the two rows of cells was the cage of bonifacio the sicilian slayer of his betrothed and of two officers who came to arrest him with him murray had played checkers many a long hour each calling his move to his unseen opponent across the corridor bonifacio s great booming voice with its indestructible singing quality called out eh meestro murray how you feel all a right yes all right bonifacio said murray steadily as he allowed the ant to crawl upon the envelope and then dumped it gently on the stone floor dat s good a meestro murray men like us we must a die like a men my time come nex a week all a right remember meestro murray i beat a you dat las game of de check maybe we play again some a time i don a know maybe we have to call a de move damn a loud to play de check where dey goin send us bonifacio s hardened philosophy followed closely by his deafening musical peal of laughter warmed rather than chilled murray s numbed heart yet bonifacio had until next week to live the cell dwellers heard the familiar loud click of the steel bolts as the door at the end of the corridor was opened three men came to murray s cell and unlocked it two were prison guards the other was len no that was in the old days now the reverend leonard winston a friend and neighbor from their barefoot days i got them to let me take the prison chaplain s place he said as he gave murray s hand one short strong grip in his left hand he held a small bible with his forefinger marking a page murray smiled slightly and arranged two or three books and some penholders orderly on his small table he would have spoken but no appropriate words seemed to present themselves to his mind the prisoners had christened this cellhouse eighty feet long twenty eight feet wide limbo lane the regular guard of limbo lane an immense rough kindly man drew a pint bottle of whiskey from his pocket and offered it to murray saying it s the regular thing you know all has it who feel like they need a bracer no danger of it becoming a habit with em you see murray drank deep into the bottle that s the boy said the guard just a little nerve tonic and everything goes smooth as silk they stepped into the corridor and each one of the doomed seven knew limbo lane is a world on the outside of the world but it had learned when deprived of one or more of the five senses to make another sense supply the deficiency each one knew that it was nearly eight and that murray was to go to the chair at eight there is also in the many limbo lanes an aristocracy of crime the man who kills in the open who beats his enemy or pursuer down flushed by the primitive emotions and the ardor of combat holds in contempt the human rat the spider and the snake so of the seven condemned only three called their farewells to murray as he marched down the corridor between the two guards bonifacio marvin who had killed a guard while trying to escape from the prison and bassett the train robber who was driven to it because the express messenger wouldn t raise his hands when ordered to do so the remaining four smoldered silent in their cells no doubt feeling their social ostracism in limbo lane society more keenly than they did the memory of their less picturesque offences against the law murray wondered at his own calmness and nearly indifference in the execution room were about twenty men a congregation made up of prison officers newspaper reporters and lookers on who had succeeded here in the very middle of a sentence the hand of death interrupted the telling of o henry s last story he had planned to make this story different from his others the beginning of a new series in a style he had not previously attempted i want to show the public he said that i can write something new new for me i mean a story without slang a straightforward dramatic plot treated in a way that will come nearer my idea of real story writing before starting to write the present story he outlined briefly how he intended to develop it murray the criminal accused and convicted of the brutal murder of his sweetheart a murder prompted by jealous rage at first faces the death penalty calm and to all outward appearances indifferent to his fate as he nears the electric chair he is overcome by a revulsion of feeling he is left dazed stupefied stunned the entire scene in the death chamber the witnesses the spectators the preparations for execution become unreal to him the thought flashes through his brain that a terrible mistake is being made why is he being strapped to the chair what has he done what crime has he committed in the few moments while the straps are being adjusted a vision comes to him he dreams a dream he sees a little country cottage bright sun lit nestling in a bower of flowers a woman is there and a little child he speaks with them and finds that they are his wife his child and the cottage their home so after all it is a mistake some one has frightfully irretrievably blundered the accusation the trial the conviction the sentence to death in the electric chair all a dream he takes his wife in his arms and kisses the child yes here is happiness it was a dream then at a sign from the prison warden the fatal current is turned on murray had dreamed the wrong dream a ruler of men written at the prime of his popularity and power this characteristic and amusing story was published in everybody s magazine in august i walked the streets of the city of insolence thirsting for the sight of a stranger face for the city is a desert of familiar types as thick and alike as the grains in a sand storm and you grow to hate them as you do a friend who is always by you or one of your own kin and my desire was granted for i saw near a corner of broadway and twenty ninth street a little flaxen haired man with a face like a scaly bark hickory nut selling to a fast gathering crowd a tool that omnigeneously proclaimed itself a can opener a screw driver a button hook a nail file a shoe horn a watch guard a potato peeler and an ornament to any gentleman s key ring and then a stall fed cop shoved himself through the congregation of customers the vender plainly used to having his seasons of trade thus abruptly curtailed closed his satchel and slipped like a weasel through the opposite segment of the circle the crowd scurried aimlessly away like ants from a disturbed crumb the cop suddenly becoming oblivious of the earth and its inhabitants stood still swelling his bulk and putting his club through an intricate drill of twirls i hurried after kansas bill bowers and caught him by an arm without his looking at me or slowing his pace i found a five dollar bill crumpled neatly into my hand i wouldn t have thought kansas bill i said that you d hold an old friend that cheap then he turned his head and the hickory nut cracked into a wide smile give back the money said he or i ll have the cop after you for false pretenses i thought you was the cop i want to talk to you bill i said when did you leave oklahoma where is reddy mcgill now why are you selling those impossible contraptions on the street how did your big horn gold mine pan out how did you get so badly sunburned what will you drink a year ago answered kansas bill systematically putting up windmills in arizona for pin money to buy etceteras with salted been down in the tropics beer we foregathered in a propitious place and became elijahs while a waiter of dark plumage played the raven to perfection reminiscence needs must be had before i could steer bill into his epic mood yes said he i mind the time timoteo s rope broke on that cow s horns while the calf was chasing you you and that cow i d never forget it the tropics said i are a broad territory what part of cancer of capricorn have you been honoring with a visit down along china or peru or maybe the argentine confederacy said kansas bill anyway twas among a great race of people off colored but progressive i was there three months no doubt you are glad to be back among the truly great race i surmised especially among new yorkers the most progressive and independent citizens of any country in the world i continued with the fatuity of the provincial who has eaten the broadway lotus do you want to start an argument asked bill can there be one i answered has an irishman humor do you think asked he i have an hour or two to spare said i looking at the cafe clock not that the americans aren t a great commercial nation conceded bill but the fault laid with the people who wrote lies for fiction what was this irishman s name i asked was that last beer cold enough said he i see there is talk of further outbreaks among the russian peasants i remarked his name was barney o connor said bill thus because of our ancient prescience of each other s trail of thought we travelled ambiguously to the point where kansas bill s story began i met o connor in a boarding house on the west side he invited me to his hall room to have a drink and we became like a dog and a cat that had been raised together there he sat a tall fine handsome man with his feet against one wall and his back against the other looking over a map on the bed and sticking three feet out of it was a beautiful gold sword with tassels on it and rhinestones in the handle what s this says i for by that time we were well acquainted the annual parade in vilification of the ex snakes of ireland and what s the line of march up broadway to forty second thence east to mccarty s cafe thence sit down on the wash stand says o connor and listen and cast no perversions on the sword twas me father s in old munster and this map bowers is no diagram of a holiday procession if ye look again ye ll see that it s the continent known as south america comprising fourteen green blue red and yellow countries all crying out from time to time to be liberated from the yoke of the oppressor i know says i to o connor the idea is a literary one the ten cent magazine stole it from ridpath s history of the world from the sand stone period to the equator you ll find it in every one of em it s a continued story of a soldier of fortune generally named o keefe who gets to be dictator while the spanish american populace cries cospetto and other italian maledictions i misdoubt if it s ever been done you re not thinking of trying that are you barney i asks bowers says he you re a man of education and courage how can i deny it says i education runs in my family and i have acquired courage by a hard struggle with life the o connors says he are a warlike race there is me father s sword and here is the map a life of inaction is not for me the o connors were born to rule tis a ruler of men i must be barney i says to him why don t you get on the force and settle down to a quiet life of carnage and corruption instead of roaming off to foreign parts in what better way can you indulge your desire to subdue and maltreat the oppressed look again at the map says he at the country i have the point of me knife on tis that one i have selected to aid and overthrow with me father s sword i see says i it s the green one and that does credit to your patriotism and it s the smallest one and that does credit to your judgment do ye accuse me of cowardice says barney turning pink no man says i who attacks and confiscates a country single handed could be called a coward the worst you can be charged with is plagiarism or imitation if anthony hope and roosevelt let you get away with it nobody else will have any right to kick i m not joking says o connor and i ve got cash to work the scheme with i ve taken a liking to you do you want it or not i m not working i told him but how is it to be do i eat during the fomentation of the insurrection or am i only to be secretary of war after the country is conquered is it to be a pay envelope or only a portfolio i ll pay all expenses says o connor i want a man i can trust if we succeed you may pick out any appointment you want in the gift of the government all right then says i you can get me a bunch of draying contracts and then a quick action consignment to a seat on the supreme court bench so i won t be in line for the presidency the kind of cannon they chasten their presidents with in that country hurt too much you can consider me on the pay roll two weeks afterward o connor and me took a steamer for the small green doomed country we were three weeks on the trip o connor said he had his plans all figured out in advance but being the commanding general it consorted with his dignity to keep the details concealed from his army and cabinet commonly known as william t bowers three dollars a day was the price for which i joined the cause of liberating an undiscovered country from the ills that threatened or sustained it every saturday night on the steamer i stood in line at parade rest and o connor handed ever the twenty one dollars the town we landed at was named guayaquerita so they told me not for me says i it ll be little old hilldale or tompkinsville or cherry tree corners when i speak of it it s a clear case where spelling reform ought to butt in and disenvowel it but the town looked fine from the bay when we sailed in it was white with green ruching and lace ruffles on the skirt when the surf slashed up on the sand it looked as tropical and dolce far ultra as the pictures of lake ronkonkoma in the brochure of the passenger department of the long island railroad we went through the quarantine and custom house indignities and then o connor leads me to a dobe house on a street called the avenue of the dolorous butterflies of the individual and collective saints ten feet wide it was and knee deep in alfalfa and cigar stumps hooligan alley says i rechristening it twill be our headquarters says o connor my agent here don fernando pacheco secured it for us so in that house o connor and me established the revolutionary centre in the front room we had ostensible things such as fruit a guitar and a table with a conch shell on it in the back room o connor had his desk and a large looking glass and his sword hid in a roll of straw matting we slept on hammocks that we hung to hooks in the wall and took our meals at the hotel ingles a beanery run on the american plan by a german proprietor with chinese cooking served a la kansas city lunch counter it seems that o connor really did have some sort of system planned out beforehand he wrote plenty of letters and every day or two some native gent would stroll round to headquarters and be shut up in the back room for half an hour with o connor and the interpreter i noticed that when they went in they were always smoking eight inch cigars and at peace with the world but when they came out they would be folding up a ten or twenty dollar bill and cursing the government horribly one evening after we had been in guaya in this town of smellville by the sea about a month and me and o connor were sitting outside the door helping along old tempus fugit with rum and ice and limes i says to him if you ll excuse a patriot that don t exactly know what he s patronizing for the question what is your scheme for subjugating this country do you intend to plunge it into bloodshed or do you mean to buy its votes peacefully and honorably at the polls bowers says he ye re a fine little man and i intend to make great use of ye after the conflict but ye do not understand statecraft already by now we have a network of strategy clutching with invisible fingers at the throat of the tyrant calderas we have agents at work in every town in the republic the liberal party is bound to win on our secret lists we have the names of enough sympathizers to crush the administration forces at a single blow a straw vote says i only shows which way the hot air blows who has accomplished this goes on o connor i have i have directed everything the time was ripe when we came so my agents inform me the people are groaning under burdens of taxes and levies who will be their natural leader when they rise could it be any one but meself twas only yesterday that zaldas our representative in the province of durasnas tells me that the people in secret already call me el library door which is the spanish manner of saying the liberator was zaldas that maroon colored old aztec with a paper collar on and unbleached domestic shoes i asked he was says o connor i saw him tucking a yellow back into his vest pocket as he came out says i it may be says i that they call you a library door but they treat you more like the side door of a bank but let us hope for the worst it has cost money of course says o connor but we ll have the country in our hands inside of a month in the evenings we walked about in the plaza and listened to the band playing and mingled with the populace at its distressing and obnoxious pleasures there were thirteen vehicles belonging to the upper classes mostly rockaways and old style barouches such as the mayor rides in at the unveiling of the new poorhouse at milledgeville alabama round and round the desiccated fountain in the middle of the plaza they drove and lifted their high silk hats to their friends the common people walked around in barefooted bunches puffing stogies that a pittsburg millionaire wouldn t have chewed for a dry smoke on ladies day at his club and the grandest figure in the whole turnout was barney o connor six foot two he stood in his fifth avenue clothes with his eagle eye and his black moustache that tickled his ears he was a born dictator and czar and hero and harrier of the human race it looked to me that all eyes were turned upon o connor and that every woman there loved him and every man feared him once or twice i looked at him and thought of funnier things that had happened than his winning out in his game and i began to feel like a hidalgo de officio de grafto de south america myself and then i would come down again to solid bottom and let my imagination gloat as usual upon the twenty one american dollars due me on saturday night take note says o connor to me as thus we walked of the mass of the people observe their oppressed and melancholy air can ye not see that they are ripe for revolt do ye not perceive that they are disaffected i do not says i nor disinfected either i m beginning to understand these people when they look unhappy they re enjoying themselves when they feel unhappy they go to sleep they re not the kind of people to take an interest in revolutions they ll flock to our standard says o connor three thousand men in this town alone will spring to arms when the signal is given i am assured of that but everything is in secret there is no chance for us to fail on hooligan alley as i prefer to call the street our headquarters was on there was a row of flat dobe houses with red tile roofs some straw shacks full of indians and dogs and one two story wooden house with balconies a little farther down that was where general tumbalo the comandante and commander of the military forces lived right across the street was a private residence built like a combination bake oven and folding bed one day o connor and me were passing it single file on the flange they called a sidewalk when out of the window flies a big red rose o connor who is ahead picks it up presses it to his fifth rib and bows to the ground by carrambos that man certainly had the irish drama chaunceyized i looked around expecting to see the little boy and girl in white sateen ready to jump on his shoulder while he jolted their spinal columns and ribs together through a breakdown and sang sleep little one sleep as i passed the window i glanced inside and caught a glimpse of a white dress and a pair of big flashing black eyes and gleaming teeth under a dark lace mantilla when we got back to our house o connor began to walk up and down the floor and twist his moustaches did ye see her eyes bowers he asks me i did says i and i can see more than that it s all coming out according to the story books i knew there was something missing twas the love interest what is it that comes in chapter vii to cheer the gallant irish adventurer why love of course love that makes the hat go around at last we have the eyes of midnight hue and the rose flung from the barred window now what comes next the underground passage the intercepted letter the traitor in camp the hero thrown into a dungeon the mysterious message from the senorita then the outburst the fighting on the plaza the don t be a fool says o connor interrupting but that s the only woman in the world for me bowers the o connors are as quick to love as they are to fight i shall wear that rose over me heart when i lead me men into action for a good battle to be fought there must be some woman to give it power every time i agreed if you want to have a good lively scrap there s only one thing bothering me in the novels the light haired friend of the hero always gets killed think em all over that you ve read and you ll see that i m right i think i ll step down to the botica espanola and lay in a bottle of walnut stain before war is declared how will i find out her name says o connor layin his chin in his hand why don t you go across the street and ask her says i will ye never regard anything in life seriously says o connor looking down at me like a schoolmaster maybe she meant the rose for me i said whistling the spanish fandango for the first time since i d known o connor he laughed he got up and roared and clapped his knees and leaned against the wall till the tiles on the roof clattered to the noise of his lungs he went into the back room and looked at himself in the glass and began and laughed all over from the beginning again then he looked at me and repeated himself that s why i asked you if you thought an irishman had any humor he d been doing farce comedy from the day i saw him without knowing it and the first time he had an idea advanced to him with any intelligence in it he acted like two twelfths of the sextet in a floradora road company the next afternoon he comes in with a triumphant smile and begins to pull something like ticker tape out of his pocket great says i this is something like home how is amalgamated copper to day i ve got her name says o connor and he reads off something like this dona isabel antonia inez lolita carreras y buencaminos y monteleon she lives with her mother explains o connor her father was killed in the last revolution she is sure to be in sympathy with our cause and sure enough the next day she flung a little bunch of roses clear across the street into our door o connor dived for it and found a piece of paper curled around a stem with a line in spanish on it he dragged the interpreter out of his corner and got him busy the interpreter scratched his head and gave us as a translation three best bets fortune had got a face like the man fighting fortune looks like a brave man and fortune favors the brave we put our money on the last one do ye see says o connor she intends to encourage me sword to save her country it looks to me like an invitation to supper says i so every day this senorita sits behind the barred windows and exhausts a conservatory or two one posy at a time and o connor walks like a dominecker rooster and swells his chest and swears to me he will win her by feats of arms and big deeds on the gory field of battle by and by the revolution began to get ripe one day o connor takes me into the back room and tells me all bowers says he at twelve o clock one week from to day the struggle will take place it has pleased ye to find amusement and diversion in this project because ye have not sense enough to perceive that it is easily accomplished by a man of courage intelligence and historical superiority such as meself the whole world over says he the o connors have ruled men women and nations to subdue a small and indifferent country like this is a trifle ye see what little barefooted manikins the men of it are i could lick four of em single handed no doubt says i but could you lick six and suppose they hurled an army of seventeen against you listen says o connor to what will occur at noon next tuesday patriots will rise up in the towns of the republic the government will be absolutely unprepared the public buildings will be taken the regular army made prisoners and the new administration set up in the capital it will not be so easy on account of most of the army being stationed there they will occupy the president s palace and the strongly fortified government buildings and stand a siege but on the very day of the outbreak a body of our troops will begin a march to the capital from every town as soon as the local victory has been won the thing is so well planned that it is an impossibility for us to fail i meself will lead the troops from here the new president will be senor espadas now minister of finance in the present cabinet what do you get i asked twill be strange said o connor smiling if i don t have all the jobs handed to me on a silver salver to pick what i choose i ve been the brains of the scheme and when the fighting opens i guess i won t be in the rear rank who managed it so our troops could get arms smuggled into this country didn t i arrange it with a new york firm before i left there our financial agents inform me that stands of winchester rifles have been delivered a month ago at a secret place up coast and distributed among the towns i tell you bowers the game is already won well that kind of talk kind of shook my disbelief in the infallibility of the serious irish gentleman soldier of fortune it certainly seemed that the patriotic grafters had gone about the thing in a business way i looked upon o connor with more respect and began to figure on what kind of uniform i might wear as secretary of war tuesday the day set for the revolution came around according to schedule o connor said that a signal had been agreed upon for the uprising there was an old cannon on the beach near the national warehouse that had been secretly loaded and promptly at twelve o clock was to be fired off immediately the revolutionists would seize their concealed arms attack the comandante s troops in the cuartel and capture the custom house and all government property and supplies i was nervous all the morning and about eleven o clock o connor became infused with the excitement and martial spirit of murder he geared his father s sword around him and walked up and down in the back room like a lion in the zoo suffering from corns i smoked a couple of dozen cigars and decided on yellow stripes down the trouser legs of my uniform at half past eleven o connor asks me to take a short stroll through the streets to see if i could notice any signs of the uprising i was back in fifteen minutes did you hear anything he asks i did says i at first i thought it was drums but it wasn t it was snoring everybody in town s asleep o connor tears out his watch fools says he they ve set the time right at the siesta hour when everybody takes a nap but the cannon will wake em up everything will be all right depend upon it just at twelve o clock we heard the sound of a cannon boom shaking the whole town o connor loosens his sword in its scabbard and jumps for the door i went as far as the door and stood in it people were sticking their heads out of doors and windows but there was one grand sight that made the landscape look tame general tumbalo the comandante was rolling down the steps of his residential dugout waving a five foot sabre in his hand he wore his cocked and plumed hat and his dress parade coat covered with gold braid and buttons sky blue pajamas one rubber boot and one red plush slipper completed his make up the general had heard the cannon and he puffed down the sidewalk toward the soldiers barracks as fast as his rudely awakened two hundred pounds could travel o connor sees him and lets out a battle cry and draws his father s sword and rushes across the street and tackle s the enemy right there in the street he and the general gave an exhibition of blacksmithing and butchery sparks flew from their blades the general roared and o connor gave the slogan of his race and proclivities then the general s sabre broke in two and he took to his ginger colored heels crying out policios at every jump o connor chased him a block imbued with the sentiment of manslaughter and slicing buttons off the general s coat tails with the paternal weapon at the corner five barefooted policemen in cotton undershirts and straw fiats climbed over o connor and subjugated him according to the municipal statutes they brought him past the late revolutionary headquarters on the way to jail i stood in the door a policeman had him by each hand and foot and they dragged him on his back through the grass like a turtle twice they stopped and the odd policeman took another s place while he rolled a cigarette the great soldier of fortune turned his head and looked at me as they passed i blushed and lit another cigar the procession passed on and at ten minutes past twelve everybody had gone back to sleep again in the afternoon the interpreter came around and smiled as he laid his hand on the big red jar we usually kept ice water in the ice man didn t call to day says i what s the matter with everything sancho ah yes says the liver colored linguist they just tell me in the town verree bad act that senor o connor make fight with general tumbalo yes general tumbalo great soldier and big mans what ll they do to mr o connor i asks i talk little while presently with the juez de la paz what you call justice with the peace says sancho he tell me it verree bad crime that one senor americano try kill general tumbalo he say they keep senor o connor in jail six months then have trial and shoot him with guns verree sorree how about this revolution that was to be pulled off i asks oh says this sancho i think too hot weather for revolution revolution better in winter time maybe so next winter quien sabe but the cannon went off says i the signal was given that big sound says sancho grinning the boiler in ice factory he blow up boom wake everybody up from siesta verree sorree no ice mucho hot day about sunset i went over to the jail and they let me talk to o connor through the bars what s the news bowers says he have we taken the town i ve been expecting a rescue party all the afternoon i haven t heard any firing has any word been received from the capital take it easy barney says i i think there s been a change of plans there s something more important to talk about have you any money i have not says o connor the last dollar went to pay our hotel bill yesterday did our troops capture the custom house there ought be plenty of government money there segregate your mind from battles says i i ve been making inquiries you re to be shot six months from date for assault and battery i m expecting to receive fifty years at hard labor for vagrancy all they furnish you while you re a prisoner is water you depend on your friends for food i ll see what i can do i went away and found a silver chile dollar in an old vest of o connor s i took him some fried fish and rice for his supper in the morning i went down to a lagoon and had a drink of water and then went back to the jail o connor had a porterhouse steak look in his eye barney says i i ve found a pond full of the finest kind of water it s the grandest sweetest purest water in the world say the word and i ll go fetch you a bucket of it and you can throw this vile government stuff out the window i ll do anything i can for a friend has it come to this says o connor raging up and down his cell am i to be starved to death and then shot i ll make those traitors feel the weight of an o connor s hand when i get out of this and then he comes to the bars and speaks softer has nothing been heard from dona isabel he asks though every one else in the world fail says he i trust those eyes of hers she will find a way to effect my release do ye think ye could communicate with her one word from her even a rose would make me sorrow light but don t let her know except with the utmost delicacy bowers these high bred castilians are sensitive and proud well said barney says i you ve given me an idea i ll report later something s got to be pulled off quick or we ll both starve i walked out and down to hooligan alley and then on the other side of the street as i went past the window of dona isabel antonia concha regalia out flies the rose as usual and hits me on the ear the door was open and i took off my hat and walked in it wasn t very light inside but there she sat in a rocking chair by the window smoking a black cheroot and when i got closer i saw that she was about thirty nine and had never seen a straight front in her life i sat down on the arm of her chair and took the cheroot out of her mouth and stole a kiss hullo izzy i says excuse my unconventionality but i feel like i have known you for a month whose izzy is oo the lady ducked her head under her mantilla and drew in a long breath i thought she was going to scream but with all that intake of air she only came out with me likee americanos as soon as she said that i knew that o connor and me would be doing things with a knife and fork before the day was over i drew a chair beside her and inside of half an hour we were engaged then i took my hat and said i must go out for a while you come back says izzy in alarm me go bring preacher says i come back twenty minutes we marry now how you likee marry to day says izzy good i went down on the beach to the united states consul s shack he was a grizzly man eighty two pounds smoked glasses five foot eleven pickled he was playing chess with an india rubber man in white clothes excuse me for interrupting says i but can you tell me how a man could get married quick the consul gets up and fingers in a pigeonhole i believe i had a license to perform the ceremony myself a year or two ago he said i ll look and i caught hold of his arm don t look it up says i marriage is a lottery anyway i m willing to take the risk about the license if you are the consul went back to hooligan alley with me izzy called her ma to come in but the old lady was picking a chicken in the patio and begged to be excused so we stood up and the consul performed the ceremony that evening mrs bowers cooked a great supper of stewed goat tamales baked bananas fricasseed red peppers and coffee afterward i sat in the rocking chair by the front window and she sat on the floor plunking at a guitar and happy as she should be as mrs william t b all at once i sprang up in a hurry i d forgotten all about o connor i asked izzy to fix up a lot of truck for him to eat that big oogly man said izzy but all right he your friend i pulled a rose out of a bunch in a jar and took the grub basket around to the jail o connor ate like a wolf then he wiped his face with a banana peel and said have you heard nothing from dona isabel yet hist says i slipping the rose between the bars she sends you this she bids you take courage at nightfall two masked men brought it to the ruined chateau in the orange grove how did you like that goat hash barney o connor pressed the rose to his lips this is more to me than all the food in the world says he but the supper was fine where did you raise it i ve negotiated a stand off at a delicatessen but downtown i tells him rest easy if there s anything to be done i ll do it so things went along that way for some weeks izzy was a great cook and if she had had a little more poise of character and smoked a little better brand of tobacco we might have drifted into some sense of responsibility for the honor i had conferred on her but as time went on i began to hunger for the sight of a real lady standing before me in a street car all i was staying in that land of bilk and money for was because i couldn t get away and i thought it no more than decent to stay and see o connor shot one day our old interpreter drops around and after smoking an hour says that the judge of the peace sent him to request me to call on him i went to his office in a lemon grove on a hill at the edge of the town and there i had a surprise i expected to see one of the usual cinnamon colored natives in congress gaiters and one of pizzaro s cast off hats what i saw was an elegant gentleman of a slightly claybank complexion sitting in an upholstered leather chair sipping a highball and reading mrs humphry ward i had smuggled into my brain a few words of spanish by the help of izzy and i began to remark in a rich andalusian brogue buenas dias senor yo tengo yo tengo oh sit down mr bowers says he i spent eight years in your country in colleges and law schools let me mix you a highball lemon peel or not thus we got along in about half an hour i was beginning to tell him about the scandal in our family when aunt elvira ran away with a cumberland presbyterian preacher then he says to me i sent for you mr bowers to let you know that you can have your friend mr o connor now of course we had to make a show of punishing him on account of his attack on general tumbalo it is arranged that he shall be released to morrow night you and he will be conveyed on board the fruit steamer voyager bound for new york which lies in the harbor your passage will be arranged for one moment judge says i that revolution the judge lays back in his chair and howls why says he presently that was all a little joke fixed up by the boys around the court room and one or two of our cut ups and a few clerks in the stores the town is bursting its sides with laughing the boys made themselves up to be conspirators and they what you call it stick senor o connor for his money it is very funny it was says i i saw the joke all along i ll take another highball if your honor don t mind the next evening just at dark a couple of soldiers brought o connor down to the beach where i was waiting under a cocoanut tree hist says i in his ear dona isabel has arranged our escape not a word they rowed us in a boat out to a little steamer that smelled of table d hote salad oil and bone phosphate the great mellow tropical moon was rising as we steamed away o connor leaned on the taffrail or rear balcony of the ship and gazed silently at guaya at buncoville on the beach he had the red rose in his hand she will wait i heard him say eyes like hers never deceive but i shall see her again traitors cannot keep an o connor down forever you talk like a sequel says i but in volume ii please omit the light haired friend who totes the grub to the hero in his dungeon cell and thus reminiscing we came back to new york there was a little silence broken only by the familiar roar of the streets after kansas bill bowers ceased talking did o connor ever go back i asked he attained his heart s desire said bill can you walk two blocks i ll show you he led me eastward and down a flight of stairs that was covered by a curious shaped glowing pagoda like structure signs and figures on the tiled walls and supporting columns attested that we were in the grand central station of the subway hundreds of people were on the midway platform an uptown express dashed up and halted it was crowded there was a rush for it by a still larger crowd towering above every one there a magnificent broad shouldered athletic man leaped into the centre of the struggle men and women he seized in either hand and hurled them like manikins toward the open gates of the train now and then some passenger with a shred of soul and self respect left to him turned to offer remonstrance but the blue uniform on the towering figure the fierce and conquering glare of his eye and the ready impact of his ham like hands glued together the lips that would have spoken complaint when the train was full then he exhibited to all who might observe and admire his irresistible genius as a ruler of men with his knees with his elbows with his shoulders with his resistless feet he shoved crushed slammed heaved kicked flung pounded the overplus of passengers aboard then with the sounds of its wheels drowned by the moans shrieks prayers and curses of its unfortunate crew the express dashed away that s him ain t he a wonder said kansas bill admiringly that tropical country wasn t the place for him i wish the distinguished traveller writer war correspondent and playright richmond hobson davis could see him now o connor ought to be dramatized the atavism of john tom little bear o henry thought this the best of the jeff peters stories all the rest of which are included in the gentle grafter except cupid a la carte in the heart of the west the atavism of john tom little bear appeared in everybody s magazine for july i saw a light in jeff peters s room over the red front drug store i hastened toward it for i had not known that jeff was in town he is a man of the hadji breed of a hundred occupations with a story to tell when he will of each one i found jeff repacking his grip for a run down to florida to look at an orange grove for which he had traded a month before his mining claim on the yukon he kicked me a chair with the same old humorous profound smile on his seasoned countenance it had been eight months since we had met but his greeting was such as men pass from day to day time is jeff s servant and the continent is a big lot across which he cuts to his many roads for a while we skirmished along the edges of unprofitable talk which culminated in that unquiet problem of the philippines all them tropical races said jeff could be run out better with their own jockeys up the tropical man knows what he wants all he wants is a season ticket to the cock fights and a pair of western union climbers to go up the bread fruit tree the anglo saxon man wants him to learn to conjugate and wear suspenders he ll be happiest in his own way i was shocked education man i said is the watchword in time they will rise to our standard of civilization look at what education has done for the indian o ho sang jeff lighting his pipe which was a good sign yes the indian i m looking i hasten to contemplate the redman as a standard bearer of progress he s the same as the other brown boys you can t make an anglo saxon of him did i ever tell you about the time my friend john tom little bear bit off the right ear of the arts of culture and education and spun the teetotum back round to where it was when columbus was a little boy i did not john tom little bear was an educated cherokee indian and an old friend of mine when i was in the territories he was a graduate of one of them eastern football colleges that have been so successful in teaching the indian to use the gridiron instead of burning his victims at the stake as an anglo saxon john tom was copper colored in spots as an indian he was one of the whitest men i ever knew as a cherokee he was a gentleman on the first ballot as a ward of the nation he was mighty hard to carry at the primaries john tom and me got together and began to make medicine how to get up some lawful genteel swindle which we might work in a quiet way so as not to excite the stupidity of the police or the cupidity of the larger corporations we had close upon between us and we pined to make it grow as all respectable capitalists do so we figured out a proposition which seems to be as honorable as a gold mine prospectus and as profitable as a church raffle and inside of thirty days you find us swarming into kansas with a pair of fluent horses and a red camping wagon on the european plan john tom is chief wish heap dough the famous indian medicine man and samaritan sachem of the seven tribes mr peters is business manager and half owner we needed a third man so we looked around and found j conyngham binkly leaning against the want column of a newspaper this binkly has a disease for shakespearian roles and an hallucination about a nights run on the new york stage but he confesses that he never could earn the butter to spread on his william s roles so he is willing to drop to the ordinary baker s kind and be satisfied with a mile run behind the medicine ponies besides richard iii he could do twenty seven coon songs and banjo specialties and was willing to cook and curry the horses we carried a fine line of excuses for taking money one was a magic soap for removing grease spots and quarters from clothes one was a sum wah tah the great indian remedy made from a prairie herb revealed by the great spirit in a dream to his favorite medicine men the great chiefs mcgarrity and siberstein bottlers chicago and the other was a frivolous system of pick pocketing the kansasters that had the department stores reduced to a decimal fraction look ye a pair of silk garters a dream book one dozen clothespins a gold tooth and when knighthood was in flower all wrapped up in a genuine japanese silkarina handkerchief and handed to the handsome lady by mr peters for the trivial sum of fifty cents while professor binkly entertains us in a three minute round with the banjo twas an eminent graft we had we ravaged peacefully through the state determined to remove all doubt as to why twas called bleeding kansas john tom little bear in full indian chief s costume drew crowds away from the parchesi sociables and government ownership conversaziones while at the football college in the east he had acquired quantities of rhetoric and the art of calisthenics and sophistry in his classes and when he stood up in the red wagon and explained to the farmers eloquent about chilblains and hyperaesthesia of the cranium jeff couldn t hand out the indian remedy fast enough for em one night we was camped on the edge of a little town out west of salina we always camped near a stream and put up a little tent sometimes we sold out of the remedy unexpected and then chief wish heap dough would have a dream in which the manitou commanded him to fill up a few bottles of sum wah tah at the most convenient place twas about ten o clock and we d just got in from a street performance i was in the tent with the lantern figuring up the day s profits john tom hadn t taken off his indian make up and was sitting by the campfire minding a fine sirloin steak in the pan for the professor till he finished his hair raising scene with the trained horses all at once out of dark bushes comes a pop like a firecracker and john tom gives a grunt and digs out of his bosom a little bullet that has dented itself against his collar bone john tom makes a dive in the direction of the fireworks and comes back dragging by the collar a kid about nine or ten years young in a velveteen suit with a little nickel mounted rifle in his hand about as big as a fountain pen here you pappoose says john tom what are you gunning for with that howitzer you might hit somebody in the eye come out jeff and mind the steak don t let it burn while i investigate this demon with the pea shooter cowardly redskin says the kid like he was quoting from a favorite author dare to burn me at the stake and the paleface will sweep you from the prairies like like everything now you lemme go or i ll tell mamma john tom plants the kid on a camp stool and sits down by him now tell the big chief he says why you try to shoot pellets into your uncle john s system didn t you know it was loaded are you a indian asks the kid looking up cute as you please at john tom s buckskin and eagle feathers i am says john tom well then that s why answers the boy swinging his feet i nearly let the steak burn watching the nerve of that youngster o ho says john tom i see you re the boy avenger and you ve sworn to rid the continent of the savage redman is that about the way of it son the kid halfway nodded his head and then he looked glum twas indecent to wring his secret from his bosom before a single brave had fallen before his parlor rifle now tell us where your wigwam is pappoose says john tom where you live your mamma will be worrying about you being out so late tell me and i ll take you home the kid grins i guess not he says i live thousands and thousands of miles over there he gyrated his hand toward the horizon i come on the train he says by myself i got off here because the conductor said my ticket had ex pirated he looks at john tom with sudden suspicion i bet you ain t a indian he says you don t talk like a indian you look like one but all a indian can say is heap good and paleface die say i bet you are one of them make believe indians that sell medicine on the streets i saw one once in quincy you never mind says john tom whether i m a cigar sign or a tammany cartoon the question before the council is what s to be done with you you ve run away from home you ve been reading howells you ve disgraced the profession of boy avengers by trying to shoot a tame indian and never saying die dog of a redskin you have crossed the path of the boy avenger nineteen times too often what do you mean by it the kid thought for a minute i guess i made a mistake he says i ought to have gone farther west they find em wild out there in the canyons he holds out his hand to john tom the little rascal please excuse me sir says he for shooting at you i hope it didn t hurt you but you ought to be more careful when a scout sees a indian in his war dress his rifle must speak little bear give a big laugh with a whoop at the end of it and swings the kid ten feet high and sets him on his shoulder and the runaway fingers the fringe and the eagle feathers and is full of the joy the white man knows when he dangles his heels against an inferior race it is plain that little bear and that kid are chums from that on the little renegade has already smoked the pipe of peace with the savage and you can see in his eye that he is figuring on a tomahawk and a pair of moccasins children s size we have supper in the tent the youngster looks upon me and the professor as ordinary braves only intended as a background to the camp scene when he is seated on a box of sum wah tah with the edge of the table sawing his neck and his mouth full of beefsteak little bear calls for his name roy says the kid with a sirloiny sound to it but when the rest of it and his post office address is referred to he shakes his head i guess not he says you ll send me back i want to stay with you i like this camping out at home we fellows had a camp in our back yard they called me roy the red wolf i guess that ll do for a name gimme another piece of beefsteak please we had to keep that kid we knew there was a hullabaloo about him somewheres and that mamma and uncle harry and aunt jane and the chief of police were hot after finding his trail but not another word would he tell us in two days he was the mascot of the big medicine outfit and all of us had a sneaking hope that his owners wouldn t turn up when the red wagon was doing business he was in it and passed up the bottles to mr peters as proud and satisfied as a prince that s abjured a two hundred dollar crown for a million dollar parvenuess once john tom asked him something about his papa i ain t got any papa he says he runned away and left us he made my mamma cry aunt lucy says he s a shape a what somebody asks him a shape says the kid some kind of a shape lemme see oh yes a feendenuman shape i don t know what it means john tom was for putting our brand on him and dressing him up like a little chief with wampum and beads but i vetoes it somebody s lost that kid is my view of it and they may want him you let me try him with a few stratagems and see if i can t get a look at his visiting card so that night i goes up to mr roy blank by the camp fire and looks at him contemptuous and scornful snickenwitzel says i like the word made me sick snickenwitzel bah before i d be named snickenwitzel what s the matter with you jeff says the kid opening his eyes wide snickenwitzel i repeats and i spat the word out i saw a man to day from your town and he told me your name i m not surprised you was ashamed to tell it snickenwitzel whew ah here now says the boy indignant and wriggling all over what s the matter with you that ain t my name it s conyers what s the matter with you and that s not the worst of it i went on quick keeping him hot and not giving him time to think we thought you was from a nice well to do family here s mr little bear a chief of the cherokees entitled to wear nine otter tails on his sunday blanket and professor binkly who plays shakespeare and the banjo and me that s got hundreds of dollars in that black tin box in the wagon and we ve got to be careful about the company we keep that man tells me your folks live way down in little old hencoop alley where there are no sidewalks and the goats eat off the table with you that kid was almost crying now taint so he splutters he he don t know what he s talking about we live on poplar av noo i don t sociate with goats what s the matter with you poplar avenue says i sarcastic poplar avenue that s a street to live on it only runs two blocks and then falls off a bluff you can throw a keg of nails the whole length of it don t talk to me about poplar avenue it s it s miles long says the kid our number s and there s lots of houses after that what s the matter with aw you make me tired jeff well well now says i i guess that man made a mistake maybe it was some other boy he was talking about if i catch him i ll teach him to go around slandering people and after supper i goes up town and telegraphs to mrs conyers poplar avenue quincy ill that the kid is safe and sassy with us and will be held for further orders in two hours an answer comes to hold him tight and she ll start for him by next train the next train was due at p m the next day and me and john tom was at the depot with the kid you might scour the plains in vain for the big chief wish heap dough in his place is mr little bear in the human habiliments of the anglo saxon sect and the leather of his shoes is patented and the loop of his necktie is copyrighted for these things john tom had grafted on him at college along with metaphysics and the knockout guard for the low tackle but for his complexion which is some yellowish and the black mop of his straight hair you might have thought here was an ordinary man out of the city directory that subscribes for magazines and pushes the lawn mower in his shirt sleeves of evenings then the train rolled in and a little woman in a gray dress with sort of illuminating hair slides off and looks around quick and the boy avenger sees her and yells mamma and she cries o and they meet in a clinch and now the pesky redskins can come forth from their caves on the plains without fear any more of the rifle of roy the red wolf mrs conyers comes up and thanks me an john tom without the usual extremities you always look for in a woman she says just enough in a way to convince and there is no incidental music by the orchestra i made a few illiterate requisitions upon the art of conversation at which the lady smiles friendly as if she had known me a week and then mr little bear adorns the atmosphere with the various idioms into which education can fracture the wind of speech i could see the kid s mother didn t quite place john tom but it seemed she was apprised in his dialects and she played up to his lead in the science of making three words do the work of one that kid introduced us with some footnotes and explanations that made things plainer than a week of rhetoric he danced around and punched us in the back and tried to climb john tom s leg this is john tom mamma says he he s a indian he sells medicine in a red wagon i shot him but he wasn t wild the other one s jeff he s a fakir too come on and see the camp where we live won t you mamma it is plain to see that the life of the woman is in that boy she has got him again where her arms can gather him and that s enough she s ready to do anything to please him she hesitates the eighth of a second and takes another look at these men i imagine she says to herself about john tom seems to be a gentleman if his hair don t curl and mr peters she disposes of as follows no ladies man but a man who knows a lady so we all rambled down to the camp as neighborly as coming from a wake and there she inspects the wagon and pats the place with her hand where the kid used to sleep and dabs around her eyewinkers with her handkerchief and professor binkly gives us trovatore on one strong of the banjo and is about to slide off into hamlet s monologue when one of the horses gets tangled in his rope and he must go look after him and says something about foiled again when it got dark me and john tom walked back up to the corn exchange hotel and the four of us had supper there i think the trouble started at that supper for then was when mr little bear made an intellectual balloon ascension i held on to the tablecloth and listened to him soar that redman if i could judge had the gift of information he took language and did with it all a roman can do with macaroni his vocal remarks was all embroidered over with the most scholarly verbs and prefixes and his syllables was smooth and fitted nicely to the joints of his idea i thought i d heard him talk before but i hadn t and it wasn t the size of his words but the way they come and twasn t his subjects for he spoke of common things like cathedrals and football and poems and catarrh and souls and freight rates and sculpture mrs conyers understood his accents and the elegant sounds went back and forth between em and now and then jefferson d peters would intervene a few shop worn senseless words to have the butter passed or another leg of the chicken yes john tom little bear appeared to be inveigled some in his bosom about that mrs conyers she was of the kind that pleases she had the good looks and more i ll tell you you take one of these cloak models in a big store they strike you as being on the impersonal system they are adapted for the eye what they run to is inches around and complexion and the art of fanning the delusion that the sealskin would look just as well on the lady with the warts and the pocket book now if one of them models was off duty and you took it and it would say charlie when you pressed it and sit up at the table why then you would have something similar to mrs conyers i could see how john tom could resist any inclination to hate that white squaw the lady and the kid stayed at the hotel in the morning they say they will start for home me and little bear left at eight o clock and sold indian remedy on the courthouse square till nine he leaves me and the professor to drive down to camp while he stays up town i am not enamored with that plan for it shows john tom is uneasy in his composures and that leads to firewater and sometimes to the green corn dance and costs not often does chief wish heap dough get busy with the firewater but whenever he does there is heap much doing in the lodges of the palefaces who wear blue and carry the club at half past nine professor binkly is rolled in his quilt snoring in blank verse and i am sitting by the fire listening to the frogs mr little bear slides into camp and sits down against a tree there is no symptoms of firewater jeff says he after a long time a little boy came west to hunt indians well then says i for i wasn t thinking as he was and he bagged one says john tom and twas not with a gun and he never had on a velveteen suit of clothes in his life and then i began to catch his smoke i know it says i and i ll bet you his pictures are on valentines and fool men are his game red and white you win on the red says john tom calm jeff for how many ponies do you think i could buy mrs conyers scandalous talk i replies tis not a paleface custom john tom laughs loud and bites into a cigar no he answers tis the savage equivalent for the dollars of the white man s marriage settlement oh i know there s an eternal wall between the races if i could do it jeff i d put a torch to every white college that a redman has ever set foot inside why don t you leave us alone he says to our own ghost dances and dog feasts and our dingy squaws to cook our grasshopper soup and darn our moccasins now you sure don t mean disrespect to the perennial blossom entitled education says i scandalized because i wear it in the bosom of my own intellectual shirt waist i ve had education says i and never took any harm from it you lasso us goes on little bear not noticing my prose insertions and teach us what is beautiful in literature and in life and how to appreciate what is fine in men and women what have you done to me says he you ve made me a cherokee moses you ve taught me to hate the wigwams and love the white man s ways i can look over into the promised land and see mrs conyers but my place is on the reservation little bear stands up in his chief s dress and laughs again but white man jeff he goes on the paleface provides a recourse tis a temporary one but it gives a respite and the name of it is whiskey and straight off he walks up the path to town again now says i in my mind may the manitou move him to do only bailable things this night for i perceive that john tom is about to avail himself of the white man s solace maybe it was as i sat smoking when i hear pit a pats on the path and here comes mrs conyers running her hair twisted up any way and a look on her face that says burglars and mice and the flour s all out rolled in one oh mr peters she calls out as they will oh oh i made a quick think and i spoke the gist of it out loud now says i we ve been brothers me and that indian but i ll make a good one of him in two minutes if no no she says wild and cracking her knuckles i haven t seen mr little bear tis my husband he s stolen my boy oh she says just when i had him back in my arms again that heartless villain every bitterness life knows she says he s made me drink my poor little lamb that ought to be warm in his bed carried of by that fiend how did all this happen i ask let s have the facts i was fixing his bed she explains and roy was playing on the hotel porch and he drives up to the steps i heard roy scream and ran out my husband had him in the buggy then i begged him for my child this is what he gave me she turns her face to the light there is a crimson streak running across her cheek and mouth he did that with his whip she says come back to the hotel says i and we ll see what can be done on the way she tells me some of the wherefores when he slashed her with the whip he told her he found out she was coming for the kid and he was on the same train mrs conyers had been living with her brother and they d watched the boy always as her husband had tried to steal him before i judge that man was worse than a street railway promoter it seems he had spent her money and slugged her and killed her canary bird and told it around that she had cold feet at the hotel we found a mass meeting of five infuriated citizens chewing tobacco and denouncing the outrage most of the town was asleep by ten o clock i talks the lady some quiet and tells her i will take the one o clock train for the next town forty miles east for it is likely that the esteemed mr conyers will drive there to take the cars i don t know i tells her but what he has legal rights but if i find him i can give him an illegal left in the eye and tie him up for a day or two anyhow on a disturbal of the peace proposition mrs conyers goes inside and cries with the landlord s wife who is fixing some catnip tea that will make everything all right for the poor dear the landlord comes out on the porch thumbing his one suspender and says to me ain t had so much excitements in town since bedford steegall s wife swallered a spring lizard i seen him through the winder hit her with the buggy whip and everything what s that suit of clothes cost you you got on pears like we d have some rain don t it say doc that indian of yorn s on a kind of a whizz to night ain t he he comes along just before you did and i told him about this here occurrence he gives a cur us kind of a hoot and trotted off i guess our constable ll have him in the lock up fore morning i thought i d sit on the porch and wait for the one o clock train i wasn t feeling saturated with mirth here was john tom on one of his sprees and this kidnapping business losing sleep for me but then i m always having trouble with other people s troubles every few minutes mrs conyers would come out on the porch and look down the road the way the buggy went like she expected to see that kid coming back on a white pony with a red apple in his hand now wasn t that like a woman and that brings up cats i saw a mouse go in this hole says mrs cat you can go prize up a plank over there if you like i ll watch this hole about a quarter to one o clock the lady comes out again restless crying easy as females do for their own amusement and she looks down that road again and listens now ma am says i there s no use watching cold wheel tracks by this time they re halfway to hush she says holding up her hand and i do hear something coming flip flap in the dark and then there is the awfulest war whoop ever heard outside of madison square garden at a buffalo bill matinee and up the steps and on to the porch jumps the disrespectable indian the lamp in the hall shines on him and i fail to recognize mr j t little bear alumnus of the class of what i see is a cherokee brave and the warpath is what he has been travelling firewater and other things have got him going his buckskin is hanging in strings and his feathers are mixed up like a frizzly hen s the dust of miles is on his moccasins and the light in his eye is the kind the aborigines wear but in his arms he brings that kid his eyes half closed with his little shoes dangling and one hand fast around the indian s collar pappoose says john tom and i notice that the flowers of the white man s syntax have left his tongue he is the original proposition in bear s claws and copper color me bring says he and he lays the kid in his mother s arms run fifteen mile says john tom ugh catch white man bring pappoose the little woman is in extremities of gladness she must wake up that stir up trouble youngster and hug him and make proclamation that he is his mamma s own precious treasure i was about to ask questions but i looked at mr little bear and my eye caught the sight of something in his belt now go to bed ma am says i and this gadabout youngster likewise for there s no more danger and the kidnapping business is not what it was earlier in the night i inveigled john tom down to camp quick and when he tumbled over asleep i got that thing out of his belt and disposed of it where the eye of education can t see it for even the football colleges disapprove of the art of scalp taking in their curriculums it is ten o clock next day when john tom wakes up and looks around i am glad to see the nineteenth century in his eyes again what was it jeff he asks heap firewater says i john tom frowns and thinks a little combined says he directly with the interesting little physiological shake up known as reversion to type i remember now have they gone yet on the train i answers ugh says john tom better so paleface bring big chief wish heap dough a little bromo seltzer and then he ll take up the redman s burden again helping the other fellow originally published in munsey s magazine december but can thim that helps others help thimselves mulvaney this is the story that william trotter told me on the beach at aguas frescas while i waited for the gig of the captain of the fruit steamer andador which was to take me abroad reluctantly i was leaving the land of always afternoon william was remaining and he favored me with a condensed oral autobiography as we sat on the sands in the shade cast by the bodega nacional as usual i became aware that the man from bombay had already written the story but as he had compressed it to an eight word sentence i have become an expansionist and have quoted his phrase above with apologies to him and best regards to terence ii don t you ever have a desire to go back to the land of derby hats and starched collars i asked him you seem to be a handy man and a man of action i continued and i am sure i could find you a comfortable job somewhere in the states ragged shiftless barefooted a confirmed eater of the lotos william trotter had pleased me much and i hated to see him gobbled up by the tropics i ve no doubt you could he said idly splitting the bark from a section of sugar cane i ve no doubt you could do much for me if every man could do as much for himself as he can for others every country in the world would be holding millenniums instead of centennials there seemed to be pabulum in w t s words and then another idea came to me i had a brother in chicopee falls who owned manufactories cotton or sugar or a a sheetings or something in the commercial line lie was vulgarly rich and therefore reverenced art the artistic temperament of the family was monopolized at my birth i knew that brother james would honor my slightest wish i would demand from him a position in cotton sugar or sheetings for william trotter something say at two hundred a month or thereabouts i confided my beliefs and made my large propositions to william he had pleased me much and he was ragged while we were talking there was a sound of firing guns four or five rattlingly as if by a squad the cheerful noise came from the direction of the cuartel which is a kind of makeshift barracks for the soldiers of the republic hear that said william trotter let me tell you about it a year ago i landed on this coast with one solitary dollar i have the same sum in my pocket to day i was second cook on a tramp fruiter and they marooned me here early one morning without benefit of clergy just because i poulticed the face of the first mate with cheese omelette at dinner the fellow had kicked because i d put horseradish in it instead of cheese when they threw me out of the yawl into three feet of surf i waded ashore and sat down under a palm tree by and by a fine looking white man with a red face and white clothes genteel as possible but somewhat under the influence came and sat down beside me i had noticed there was a kind of a village back of the beach and enough scenery to outfit a dozen moving picture shows but i thought of course it was a cannibal suburb and i was wondering whether i was to be served with carrots or mushrooms and as i say this dressed up man sits beside me and we become friends in the space of a minute or two for an hour we talked and he told me all about it it seems that he was a man of parts conscientiousness and plausibility besides being educated and a wreck to his appetites he told me all about it colleges had turned him out and distilleries had taken him in did i tell you his name it was clifford wainwright i didn t exactly catch the cause of his being cast away on that particular stretch of south america but i reckon it was his own business i asked him if he d ever been second cook on a tramp fruiter and he said no so that concluded my line of surmises but he talked like the encyclopedia from a berlin to trilo zyria and he carried a watch a silver arrangement with works and up to date within twenty four hours anyhow i m pleased to have met you says wainwright i m a devotee to the great joss booze but my ruminating facilities are unrepaired says he or words to that effect and i hate says he to see fools trying to run the world i never touch a drop says i and there are many kinds of fools and the world runs on its own apex according to science with no meddling from me i was referring says he to the president of this republic his country is in a desperate condition its treasury is empty it s on the verge of war with nicamala and if it wasn t for the hot weather the people would be starting revolutions in every town here is a nation goes on wainwright on the brink of destruction a man of intelligence could rescue it from its impending doom in one day by issuing the necessary edicts and orders president gomez knows nothing of statesmanship or policy do you know adam smith lemme see says i there was a one eared man named smith in fort worth texas but i think his first name was i am referring to the political economist says wainwright s mother smith then says i the one i speak of never was arrested so wainwright boils some more with indignation at the insensibility of people who are not corpulent to fill public positions and then he tells me he is going out to the president s summer palace which is four miles from aguas frescas to instruct him in the art of running steam heated republics come along with me trotter says he and i ll show you what brains can do anything in it i asks the satisfaction says he of redeeming a country of two hundred thousand population from ruin back to prosperity and peace great says i i ll go with you i d prefer to eat a live broiled lobster just now but give me liberty as second choice if i can t be in at the death wainwright and me permeates through the town and he halts at a rum dispensary have you any money he asks i have says i fishing out my silver dollar i always go about with adequate sums of money then we ll drink says wainwright not me says i not any demon ruin or any of its ramifications for mine it s one of my non weaknesses it s my failing says he what s your particular soft point industry says i promptly i m hard working diligent industrious and energetic my dear mr trotter says he surely i ve known you long enough to tell you you are a liar every man must have his own particular weakness and his own particular strength in other things now you will buy me a drink of rum and we will call on president gomez iii well sir trotter went on we walks the four miles out through a virgin conservatory of palms and ferns and other roof garden products to the president s summer white house it was blue and reminded you of what you see on the stage in the third act which they describe as same as the first on the programs there was more than fifty people waiting outside the iron fence that surrounded the house and grounds there was generals and agitators and epergnes in gold laced uniforms and citizens in diamonds and panama hats all waiting to get an audience with the royal five card draw and in a kind of a summer house in front of the mansion we could see a burnt sienna man eating breakfast out of gold dishes and taking his time i judged that the crowd outside had come out for their morning orders and requests and was afraid to intrude but c wainwright wasn t the gate was open and he walked inside and up to the president s table as confident as a man who knows the head waiter in a fifteen cent restaurant and i went with him because i had only seventy five cents and there was nothing else to do the gomez man rises from his chair and looks colored man as he was like he was about to call out for corporal of the guard post number one but wainwright says some phrases to him in a peculiarly lubricating manner and the first thing you know we was all three of us seated at the table with coffee and rolls and iguana cutlets coming as fast as about ninety peons could rustle em and then wainwright begins to talk but the president interrupts him you yankees says he polite assuredly take the cake for assurance i assure you or words to that effect he spoke english better than you or me you ve had a long walk says he but it s nicer in the cool morning to walk than to ride may i suggest some refreshments says he rum says wainwright gimme a cigar says i well sir the two talked an hour keeping the generals and equities all in their good uniforms waiting outside the fence and while i smoked silent i listened to clifford wainwright making a solid republic out of the wreck of one i didn t follow his arguments with any special collocation of international intelligibility but he had mr gomez s attention glued and riveted he takes out a pencil and marks the white linen tablecloth all over with figures and estimates and deductions he speaks more or less disrespectfully of import and export duties and custom house receipts and taxes and treaties and budgets and concessions and such truck that politics and government require and when he gets through the gomez man hops up and shakes his hand and says he s saved the country and the people you shall be rewarded says the president might i suggest another rum says wainwright cigar for me darker brand says i well sir the president sent me and wainwright back to the town in a victoria hitched to two flea bitten selling platers but the best the country afforded i found out afterward that wainwright was a regular beachcomber the smartest man on the whole coast but kept down by rum i liked him one day i inveigled him into a walk out a couple of miles from the village where there was an old grass hut on the bank of a little river while he was sitting on the grass talking beautiful of the wisdom of the world that he had learned in books i took hold of him easy and tied his hands and feet together with leather thongs that i had in my pocket lie still says i and meditate on the exigencies and irregularities of life till i get back i went to a shack in aguas frescas where a mighty wise girl named timotea carrizo lived with her mother the girl was just about as nice as you ever saw in the states she would have been called a brunette but she was better than a brunette i should say she was what you might term an ecru shade i knew her pretty well i told her about my friend wainwright she gave me a double handful of bark calisaya i think it was and some more herbs that i was to mix with it and told me what to do i was to make tea of it and give it to him and keep him from rum for a certain time and for two weeks i did it you know i liked wainwright both of us was broke but timotea sent us goat meat and plantains and tortillas every day and at last i got the curse of drink lifted from clifford wainwright he lost his taste for it and in the cool of the evening him and me would sit on the roof of timotea s mother s hut eating harmless truck like coffee and rice and stewed crabs and playing the accordion about that time president gomez found out that the advice of c wainwright was the stuff he had been looking for the country was pulling out of debt and the treasury bad enough boodle in it for him to amuse himself occasionally with the night latch the people were beginning to take their two hour siestas again every day which was the surest sign of prosperity so down from the regular capital he sends for clifford wainwright and makes him his private secretary at twenty thousand peru dollars a year yes sir so much wainwright was on the water wagon thanks to me and timotea and he was soon in clover with the government gang don t forget what done it calisaya bark with them other herbs mixed make a tea of it and give a cupful every two hours try it yourself it takes away the desire as i said a man can do a lot more for another party than he can for himself wainwright with his brains got a whole country out of trouble and on its feet but what could he do for himself and without any special brains but with some nerve and common sense i put him on his feet because i never had the weakness that he did nothing but a cigar for mine thanks and trotter paused i looked at his tattered clothes and at his deeply sunburnt hard thoughtful face didn t cartright ever offer to do anything for you i asked wainwright corrected trotter yes he offered me some pretty good jobs but i d have bad to leave aguas frescas so i didn t take any of em up say i didn t tell you much about that girl timotea we rather hit it off together she was as good as you find em anywhere spanish mostly with just a twist of lemon peel on top what if they did live in a grass hut and went bare armed a month ago went on trotter she went away i don t know where to but you d better come back to the states i insisted i can promise you positively that my brother will give you a position in cotton sugar or sheetings i am not certain which i think she went back with her mother said trotter to the village in the mountains that they come from tell me what would this job you speak of pay why said i hesitating over commerce i should say fifty or a hundred dollars a month maybe two hundred ain t it funny said trotter digging his toes in the sand what a chump a man is when it comes to paddling his own canoe i don t know of course i m not making a living here i m on the bum but well i wish you could have seen that timotea every man has his own weak spot the gig from the andador was coming ashore to take out the captain purser and myself the lone passenger i ll guarantee said i confidently that my brother will pay you seventy five dollars a month all right then said william trotter i ll but a soft voice called across the blazing sands a girl faintly lemon tinted stood in the calle real and called she was bare armed but what of that it s her said william trotter looking she s come back i m obliged but i can t take the job thanks just the same ain t it funny how we can t do nothing for ourselves but we can do wonders for the other fellow you was about to get me with your financial proposition but we ve all got our weak points timotea s mine and say trotter had turned to leave but he retraced the step or two that he had taken i like to have left you without saying good bye said he it kind of rattles you when they go away unexpected for a month and come back the same way shake hands so long say do you remember them gunshots we heard a while ago up at the cuartel well i knew what they was but i didn t mention it it was clifford wainwright being shot by a squad of soldiers against a stone wall for giving away secrets of state to that nicamala republic oh yes it was rum that did it he backslided and got his i guess we all have our weak points and can t do much toward helping ourselves mine s waiting for me i d have liked to have that job with your brother but we ve all got our weak points so long iv a big black carib carried me on his back through the surf to the ship s boat on the way the purser handed me a letter that he had brought for me at the last moment from the post office in aguas frescas it was from my brother he requested me to meet him at the st charles hotel in new orleans and accept a position with his house in either cotton sugar or sheetings and with five thousand dollars a year as my salary when i arrived at the crescent city i hurried away far away from the st charles to a dim chambre garnie in bienville street and there looking down from my attic window from time to time at the old yellow absinthe house across the street i wrote this story to buy my bread and butter can thim that helps others help thimselves the marionettes originally published in the black cat for april the short story publishing co the policeman was standing at the corner of twenty fourth street and a prodigiously dark alley near where the elevated railroad crosses the street the time was two o clock in the morning the outlook a stretch of cold drizzling unsociable blackness until the dawn a man wearing a long overcoat with his hat tilted down in front and carrying something in one hand walked softly but rapidly out of the black alley the policeman accosted him civilly but with the assured air that is linked with conscious authority the hour the alley s musty reputation the pedestrian s haste the burden he carried these easily combined into the suspicious circumstances that required illumination at the officer s hands the suspect halted readily and tilted back his hat exposing in the flicker of the electric lights an emotionless smooth countenance with a rather long nose and steady dark eyes thrusting his gloved hand into a side pocket of his overcoat he drew out a card and handed it to the policeman holding it to catch the uncertain light the officer read the name charles spencer james m d the street and number of the address were of a neighborhood so solid and respectable as to subdue even curiosity the policeman s downward glance at the article carried in the doctor s hand a handsome medicine case of black leather with small silver mountings further endorsed the guarantee of the card all right doctor said the officer stepping aside with an air of bulky affability orders are to be extra careful good many burglars and hold ups lately bad night to be out not so cold but clammy with a formal inclination of his head and a word or two corroborative of the officer s estimate of the weather doctor james continued his somewhat rapid progress three times that night had a patrolman accepted his professional card and the sight of his paragon of a medicine case as vouchers for his honesty of person and purpose had any one of those officers seen fit on the morrow to test the evidence of that card he would have found it borne out by the doctor s name on a handsome doorplate his presence calm and well dressed in his well equipped office provided it were not too early doctor james being a late riser and the testimony of the neighborhood to his good citizenship his devotion to his family and his success as a practitioner the two years he had lived among them therefore it would have much surprised any one of those zealous guardians of the peace could they have taken a peep into that immaculate medicine case upon opening it the first article to be seen would have been an elegant set of the latest conceived tools used by the box man as the ingenious safe burglar now denominates himself specially designed and constructed were the implements the short but powerful jimmy the collection of curiously fashioned keys the blued drills and punches of the finest temper capable of eating their way into chilled steel as a mouse eats into a cheese and the clamps that fasten like a leech to the polished door of a safe and pull out the combination knob as a dentist extracts a tooth in a little pouch in the inner side of the medicine case was a four ounce vial of nitroglycerine now half empty underneath the tools was a mass of crumpled banknotes and a few handfuls of gold coin the money altogether amounting to eight hundred and thirty dollars to a very limited circle of friends doctor james was known as the swell greek half of the mysterious term was a tribute to his cool and gentlemanlike manners the other half denoted in the argot of the brotherhood the leader the planner the one who by the power and prestige of his address and position secured the information upon which they based their plans and desperate enterprises of this elect circle the other members were skitsie morgan and gum decker expert box men and leopold pretzfelder a jeweller downtown who manipulated the sparklers and other ornaments collected by the working trio all good and loyal men as loose tongued as memnon and as fickle as the north star that night s work had not been considered by the firm to have yielded more than a moderate repayal for their pains an old style two story side bolt safe in the dingy office of a very wealthy old style dry goods firm on a saturday night should have excreted more than twenty five hundred dollars but that was all they found and they had divided it the three of them into equal shares upon the spot as was their custom ten or twelve thousand was what they expected but one of the proprietors had proved to be just a trifle too old style just after dark he had carried home in a shirt box most of the funds on hand doctor james proceeded up twenty fourth street which was to all appearance depopulated even the theatrical folk who affect this district as a place of residence were long since abed the drizzle had accumulated upon the street puddles of it among the stones received the fire of the arc lights and returned it shattered into a myriad liquid spangles a captious wind shower soaked and chilling coughed from the laryngeal flues between the houses as the practitioner s foot struck even with the corner of a tall brick residence of more pretension than its fellows the front door popped open and a bawling negress clattered down the steps to the pavement some medley of words came from her mouth addressed like as not to herself the recourse of her race when alone and beset by evil she looked to be one of that old vassal class of the south voluble familiar loyal irrepressible her person pictured it fat neat aproned kerchiefed this sudden apparition spewed from the silent house reached the bottom of the steps as doctor james came opposite her brain transferring its energies from sound to sight she ceased her clamor and fixed her pop eyes upon the case the doctor carried bress de lawd was the benison the sight drew from her is you a doctor suh yes i am a physician said doctor james pausing den fo god s sake come and see mister chandler suh he done had a fit or sump n he layin jist like he wuz dead miss amy sont me to

feet marked off on de ground and ev ybody a duellin and dat po lamb miss amy lead the way said doctor james setting his foot upon the step if you want me as a doctor as an auditor i m not open to engagements the negress preceded him into the house and up a flight of thickly carpeted stairs twice they came to dimly lighted branching hallways at the second one the now panting conductress turned down a hall stopping at a door and opening it i done brought de doctor miss amy doctor james entered the room and bowed slightly to a young lady standing by the side of a bed he set his medicine case upon a chair removed his overcoat throwing it over the case and the back of the chair an advanced with quiet self possession to the bedside there lay a man sprawling as he had fallen a man dressed richly in the prevailing mode with only his shoe removed lying relaxed and as still as the dead there emanated from doctor james an aura of calm force and reserve strength that was as manna in the desert to the weak and desolate among his patrons always had women especially been attracted by something in his sick room manner it was not the indulgent suavity of the fashionable healer but a manner of poise of sureness of ability to overcome fate of deference and protection and devotion there was an exploring magnetism in his steadfast luminous brown eves a latent authority in the impassive even priestly tranquillity of his smooth countenance that outwardly fitted him for the part of confidant and consoler sometimes at his first professional visit women would tell him where they hid their diamonds at night from the burglars with the ease of much practice doctor james s unroving eyes estimated the order and quality of the room s furnishings the appointments were rich and costly the same glance had secured cognizance of the lady s appearance she was small and scarcely past twenty her face possessed the title to a winsome prettiness now obscured by you would say rather a fixed melancholy than the more violent imprint of a sudden sorrow upon her forehead above one eyebrow was a livid bruise suffered the physician s eye told him within the past six hours doctor james s fingers went to the man s wrist his almost vocal eyes questioned the lady i am mrs chandler she responded speaking with the plaintive southern slur and intonation my husband was taken suddenly ill about ten minutes before you came he has had attacks of heart trouble before some of them were very bad his clothed state and the late hour seemed to prompt her to further explanation he had been out late to a supper i believe doctor james now turned his attention to his patient in whichever of his professions he happened to be engaged he was wont to honor the case or the job with his whole interest the sick man appeared to be about thirty his countenance bore a look of boldness and dissipation but was not without a symmetry of feature and the fine lines drawn by a taste and indulgence in humor that gave the redeeming touch there was an odor of spilled wine about his clothes the physician laid back his outer garments and then with a penknife slit the shirt front from collar to waist the obstacles cleared he laid his ear to the heart and listened intently mitral regurgitation he said softly when he rose the words ended with the rising inflection of uncertainty again he listened long and this time he said mitral insufficiency with the accent of an assured diagnosis madam he began in the reassuring tones that had so often allayed anxiety there is a probability as he slowly turned his head to face the lady he saw her fall white and swooning into the arms of the old negress po lamb po lamb has dey done killed aunt cindy s own blessed child may de lawd stroy wid his wrath dem what stole her away what break dat angel heart what left lift her feet said doctor james assisting to support the drooping form where is her room she must be put to bed in here suh the woman nodded her kerchiefed head toward a door dat s miss amy s room they carried her in there and laid her on the bed her pulse was faint but regular she passed from the swoon without recovering consciousness into a profound slumber she is quite exhausted said the physician sleep is a good remedy when she wakes give her a toddy with an egg in it if she can take it how did she get that bruise upon her forehead she done got a lick there suh de po lamb fell no suh the old woman s racial mutability swept her into a sudden flare of indignation old cindy ain t gwineter lie for dat debble he done it suh may de lawd wither de hand what dar now cindy promise her sweet lamb she ain t gwine tell miss amy got hurt suh on de head doctor james stepped to a stand where a handsome lamp burned and turned the flame low stay here with your mistress he ordered and keep quiet so she will sleep if she wakes give her the toddy if she grows any weaker let me know there is something strange about it dar s mo strange t ings dan dat round here began the negress but the physician hushed her in a seldom employed peremptory concentrated voice with which he had often allayed hysteria itself he returned to the other room closing the door softly behind him the man on the bed had not moved but his eyes were open his lips seemed to form words doctor james bent his head to listen the money the money was what they were whispering can you understand what i say asked the doctor speaking low but distinctly the head nodded slightly i am a physician sent for by your wife you are mr chandler i am told you are quite ill you must not excite or distress yourself at all the patient s eyes seemed to beckon to him the doctor stooped to catch the same faint words the money the twenty thousand dollars where is this money in the bank the eyes expressed a negative tell her the whisper was growing fainter the twenty thousand dollars her money his eyes wandered about the room you have placed this money somewhere doctor james s voice was toiling like a siren s to conjure the secret from the man s failing intelligence is it in this room he thought he saw a fluttering assent in the dimming eyes the pulse under his fingers was as fine and small as a silk thread there arose in doctor james s brain and heart the instincts of his other profession promptly as he acted in everything he decided to learn the whereabouts of this money and at the calculated and certain cost of a human life drawing from his pocket a little pad of prescription blanks he scribbled upon one of them a formula suited according to the best practice to the needs of the sufferer going to the door of the inner room he softly called the old woman gave her the prescription and bade her take it to some drug store and fetch the medicine when she had gone muttering to herself the doctor stepped to the bedside of the lady she still slept soundly her pulse was a little stronger her forehead was cool save where the inflammation of the bruise extended and a slight moisture covered it unless disturbed she would yet sleep for hours he found the key in the door and locked it after him when he returned doctor james looked at his watch he could call half an hour his own since before that time the old woman could scarcely return from her mission then he sought and found water in a pitcher and a glass tumbler opening his medicine case he took out the vial containing the nitroglycerine the oil as his brethren of the brace and bit term it one drop of the faint yellow thickish liquid he let fall in the tumbler he took out his silver hypodermic syringe case and screwed the needle into its place carefully measuring each modicum of water in the graduated glass barrel of the syringe he diluted the one drop with nearly half a tumbler of water two hours earlier that night doctor james had with that syringe injected the undiluted liquid into a hole drilled in the lock of a safe and had destroyed with one dull explosion the machinery that controlled the movement of the bolts he now purposed with the same means to shiver the prime machinery of a human being to rend its heart and each shock was for the sake of the money to follow the same means but in a different guise whereas that was the giant in its rude primary dynamic strength this was the courtier whose no less deadly arms were concealed by velvet and lace for the liquid in the tumbler and in the syringe that the physician carefully filled was now a solution of glonoin the most powerful heart stimulant known to medical science two ounces had riven the solid door of the iron safe with one fiftieth part of a minim he was now about to still forever the intricate mechanism of a human life but not immediately it was not so intended first there would be a quick increase of vitality a powerful impetus given to every organ and faculty the heart would respond bravely to the fatal spur the blood in the veins return more rapidly to its source but as doctor james well knew over stimulation in this form of heart disease means death as sure as by a rifle shot when the clogged arteries should suffer congestion from the increased flow of blood pumped into them by the power of the burglar s oil they would rapidly become no thoroughfare and the fountain of life would cease to flow the physician bared the chest of the unconscious chandler easily and skilfully he injected subcutaneously the contents of the syringe into the muscles of the region over the heart true to his neat habits in both professions he next carefully dried his needle and re inserted the fine wire that threaded it when not in use in three minutes chandler opened his eyes and spoke in a voice faint but audible inquiring who attended upon him doctor james again explained his presence there where is my wife asked the patient she is asleep from exhaustion and worry said the doctor i would not awaken her unless it isn t necessary chandler spoke with spaces between his words caused by his short breath that some demon was driving too fast she wouldn t thank you to disturb her on my account doctor james drew a chair to the bedside conversation must not be squandered a few minutes ago he began in the grave candid tones of his other profession you were trying to tell me something regarding some money i do not seek your confidence but it is my duty to advise you that anxiety and worry will work against your recovery if you have any communication to make about this to relieve your mind about this twenty thousand dollars i think was the amount you mentioned you would better do so chandler could not turn his head but he rolled his eyes in the direction of the speaker did i say where this money is no answered the physician i only inferred from your scarcely intelligible words that you felt a solicitude concerning its safety if it is in this room doctor james paused did he only seem to perceive a flicker of understanding a gleam of suspicion upon the ironical features of his patient had he seemed too eager had he said too much chandler s next words restored his confidence where should it be he gasped but in the safe there with his eyes he indicated a corner of the room where now for the first time the doctor perceived a small iron safe half concealed by the trailing end of a window curtain rising he took the sick man s wrist his pulse was beating in great throbs with ominous intervals between lift your arm said doctor james you know i can t move doctor the physician stepped swiftly to the hall door opened it and listened all was still without further circumvention he went to the safe and examined it of a primitive make and simple design it afforded little more security than protection against light fingered servants to his skill it was a mere toy a thing of straw and paste board the money was as good as in his hands with his clamps he could draw the knob punch the tumblers and open the door in two minutes perhaps in another way he might open it in one kneeling upon the floor he laid his ear to the combination plate and slowly turned the knob as he had surmised it was locked at only a day com upon one number his keen ear caught the faint warning click as the tumbler was disturbed he used the clue the handle turned he swung the door wide open the interior of the safe was bare not even a scrap of paper rested within the hollow iron cube doctor james rose to his feet and walked back to the bed a thick dew had formed upon the dying man s brow but there was a mocking grim smile on his lips and in his eyes i never saw it before he said painfully medicine and burglary wedded do you make the combination pay dear doctor than that situation afforded there was never a more rigorous test of doctor james s greatness trapped by the diabolic humor of his victim into a position both ridiculous and unsafe he maintained his dignity as well as his presence of mind taking out his watch he waited for the man to die you were just a shade too anxious about that money but it never was in any danger from you dear doctor it s safe perfectly safe it s all in the hands of the bookmakers twenty thousand amy s money i played it at the races lost every cent of it i ve been a pretty bad boy burglar excuse me doctor but i ve been a square sport i don t think i ever met such an eighteen carat rascal as you are doctor excuse me burglar in all my rounds is it contrary to the ethics of your gang burglar to give a victim excuse me patient a drink of water doctor james brought him a drink he could scarcely swallow it the reaction from the powerful drug was coming in regular intensifying waves but his moribund fancy must have one more grating fling gambler drunkard spendthrift i ve been those but a doctor burglar the physician indulged himself to but one reply to the other s caustic taunts bending low to catch chandler s fast crystallizing gaze he pointed to the sleeping lady s door with a gesture so stern and significant that the prostrate man half lifted his head with his remaining strength to see he saw nothing but he caught the cold words of the doctor the last sounds hie was to hear i never yet struck a woman it were vain to attempt to con such men there is no curriculum that can reckon with them in its ken thev are offshoots from the types whereof men say he will do this or he will do that we only know that they exist and that we can observe them and tell one another of their bare performances as children watch and speak of the marionettes yet it were a droll study in egoism to consider these two one an assassin and a robber standing above his victim the other baser in his offences if a lesser law breaker lying abhorred in the house of the wife he had persecuted spoiled and smitten one a tiger the other a dog wolf to consider each of them sickening at the foulness of the other and each flourishing out of the mire of his manifest guilt his own immaculate standard of conduct if not of honor the one retort of doctor james must have struck home to the other s remaining shreds of shame and manhood for it proved the coup de grace a deep blush suffused his face an ignominous rosa mortis the respiration ceased and with scarcely a tremor chandler expired close following upon his last breath came the negress bringing the medicine with a hand gently pressing upon the closed eyelids doctor james told her of the end not grief but a hereditary rapprochement with death in the abstract moved her to a dismal watery snuffling accompanied by her usual jeremiad dar now it s in de lawd s hands he am de jedge ob de transgressor and de suppo t of dem in distress he gwine hab suppo t us now cindy done paid out de last quarter fer dis bottle of physic and it nebber come to no use do i understand asked doctor james that mrs chandler has no money money suh you know what make miss amy fall down and so weak stahvation sub nothin to eat in dis house but some crumbly crackers in three days dat angel sell her finger rings and watch mont s ago dis fine house suh wid de red cyarpets and shiny bureaus it s all hired and de man talkin scan lous about de rent dat debble scuse me lawd he done in yo hands fer jedgment now he made way wid everything the physician s silence encouraged her to continue the history that he gleaned from cindy s disordered monologue was an old one of illusion wilfulness disaster cruelty and pride standing out from the blurred panorama of her gabble were little clear pictures an ideal home in the far south a quickly repented marriage an unhappy season full of wrongs and abuse and of late an inheritance of money that promised deliverance its seizure and waste by the dog wolf during a two months absence and his return in the midst of a scandalous carouse unobtruded but visible between every line ran a pure white thread through the smudged warp of the story the simple all enduring sublime love of the old negress following her mistress unswervingly through everything to the end when at last she paused the physician spoke asking if the house contained whiskey or liquor of any sort there was the old woman informed him half a bottle of brandy left in the sideboard by the dog wolf prepare a toddy as i told you said doctor james wake your mistress have her drink it and tell her what has happened some ten minutes afterward mrs chandler entered supported by old cindy s arm she appeared to be a little stronger since her sleep and the stimulant she had taken doctor james had covered with a sheet the form upon the bed the lady turned her mournful eyes once with a half frightened look toward it and pressed closer to her loyal protector her eyes were dry and bright sorrow seemed to have done its utmost with her the fount of tears was dried feeling itself paralyzed doctor james was standing near the table his overcoat donned his hat and medicine case in his hand his face was calm and impassive practice had inured him to the sight of human suffering his lambent brown eyes alone expressed a discreet professional sympathy he spoke kindly and briefly stating that as the hour was late and assistance no doubt difficult to procure he would himself send the proper persons to attend to the necessary finalities one matter in conclusion said the doctor pointing to the safe with its still wide open door your husband mrs chandler toward the end felt that he could not live and directed me to open that safe giving me the number upon which the combination is set in case you may need to use it you will remember that the number is forty one turn several times to the right then to the left once stop at forty one he would not permit me to waken you though he knew the end was near in that safe he said he had placed a sum of money not large but enough to enable you to carry out his last request that was that you should return to your old home and in after days when time shall have made it easier forgive his many sins against you he pointed to the table where lay an orderly pile of banknotes surmounted by two stacks of gold coins the money is there as he described it eight hundred and thirty dollars i beg to leave my card with you in case i can be of any service later on so he had thought of her and kindly at the last so late and yet the lie fanned into life one last spark of tenderness where she had thought all was turned to ashes and dust she cried aloud rob rob she turned and upon the ready bosom of her true servitor diluted her grief in relieving tears it is well to think also that in the years to follow the murderer s falsehood shone like a little star above the grave of love comforting her and gaining the forgiveness that is good in itself whether asked for or no hushed and soothed upon the dark bosom like a child by a crooning babbling sympathy at last she raised her head but the doctor was gone the marquis and miss sally originally published in everybody s magazine june without knowing it old bill bascom had the honor of being overtaken by fate the same day with the marquis of borodale the marquis lived in regent square london old bill lived on limping doe creek hardeman county texas the cataclysm that engulfed the marquis took the form of a bursting bubble known as the central and south american mahogany and caoutchouc monopoly old bill s nemesis was in the no less perilous shape of a band of civilized indian cattle thieves from the territory who ran off his entire herd of four hundred head and shot old bill dead as he trailed after them to even up the consequences of the two catastrophes the marquis as soon as he found that all he possessed would pay only fifteen shillings on the pound of his indebtedness shot himself old bill left a family of six motherless sons and daughters who found themselves without even a red steer left to eat or a red cent to buy one with the marquis left one son a young man who had come to the states and established a large and well stocked ranch in the panhandle of texas when this young man learned the news he mounted his pony and rode to town there he placed everything he owned except his horse saddle winchester and fifteen dollars in his pockets in the hands of his lawyers with instructions to sell and forward the proceeds to london to be applied upon the payment of his father s debts then he mounted his pony and rode southward one day arriving about the same time but by different trails two young chaps rode up to the diamond cross ranch on the little piedra and asked for work both were dressed neatly and sprucely in cowboy costume one was a straight set fellow with delicate handsome features short brown hair and smooth face sunburned to a golden brown the other applicant was stouter and broad shouldered with fresh red complexion somewhat freckled reddish curling hair and a rather plain face made attractive by laughing eyes and a pleasant mouth the superintendent of the diamond cross was of the opinion that he could give them work in fact word had reached him that morning that the camp cook a most important member of the outfit had straddled his broncho and departed being unable to withstand the fire of fun and practical jokes of which he was ex officio the legitimate target can either of you cook asked the superintendent i can said the reddish haired fellow promptly i ve cooked in camp quite a lot i m willing to take the job until you ve got something else to offer now that s the way i like to hear a man talk said the superintendent approvingly i ll give you a note to saunders and he ll put you to work thus the names of john bascom and charles norwood were added to the pay roll of the diamond cross the two left for the round up camp immediately after dinner their directions were simple but sufficient keep down the arroyo for fifteen miles till you get there both being strangers from afar young spirited and thus thrown together by chance for a long ride it is likely that the comradeship that afterward existed so strongly between them began that afternoon as they meandered along the little valley of the canada verda they reached their destination just after sunset the main camp of the round up was comfortably located on the bank of a long water hole under a fine mott of timber a number of small a tents pitched upon grassy spots and the big wall tent for provisions showed that the camp was intended to be occupied for a considerable length of time the round up had ridden in but a few moments before hungry and tired to a supperless camp the boys were engaged in an emulous display of anathemas supposed to fit the case of the absconding cook while they were unsaddling and hobbling their ponies the newcomer rode in and inquired for pink saunders the boss ol the round up came forth and was given the superintendent s note pink saunders though a boss during working hours was a humorist in camp where everybody from cook to superintendent is equal after reading the note he waved his hand toward the camp and shouted ceremoniously at the top of his voice gentlemen allow me to present to you the marquis and miss sally at the words both the new arrivals betray confusion the newly employed cook started with a surprised look on his face but immediately recollecting that miss sally is the generic name for the male cook in every west texas cow camp he recovered his composure with a grin at his own expense his companion showed little less discomposure even turning angrily with a bitten lip and reaching for his saddle pommel as if to remount his pony but miss sally touched his arm and said laughingly come now marquis that was quite a compliment from saunders it s that distinguished air of yours and aristocratic nose that made him call you that he began to unsaddle and the marquis restored to equanimity followed his example rolling up his sleeves miss sally sprang for the grub wagon shouting i m the new cook b thunder some of you chaps rustle a little wood for a fire and i ll guarantee you a hot square meal inside of thirty minutes miss sally s energy and good humor as he ransacked the grub wagon for coffee flour and bacon won the good opinion of the camp instantly and also in days following the marquis after becoming better acquainted proved to be a cheerful pleasant fellow always a little reserved and taking no part in the rough camp frolics but the boys gradually came to respect this reserve which fitted the title saunders had given him and even to like him for it saunders had assigned him to a place holding the herd during the cuttings he proved to be a skilful rider and as good with the lariat or in the branding pen as most of them the marquis and miss sally grew to be quite close comrades after supper was over and everything cleaned up you would generally find them together miss sally smoking his brier root pipe and the marquis plaiting a quirt or scraping rawhide for a new pair of hobbles the superintendent did not forget his promise to keep an eye on the cook several times when visiting the camp he held long talks with him he seemed to have taken a fancy to miss sally one afternoon he rode up on his way back to the ranch from a tour of the camps and said to him there ll be a man here in the morning to take your place as soon as he shows up you come to the ranch i want you to take charge of the ranch accounts and correspondence i want somebody that i can depend upon to keep things straight when i m away the wages ll be all right the diamond cross ll hold its end up with a man who ll look after its interests all right said miss sally as quietly as if he had expected the notice all along any objections to my bringing my wife down to the ranch you married said the superintendent frowning a little you didn t mention it when we were talking because i m not said the cook but i d like to be thought i d wait till i got a job under roof i couldn t ask her to live in a cow camp right agreed the superintendent a camp isn t quite the place for a married man but well there s plenty of room at the house and if you suit us as well as i think you will you can afford it you write to her to come on all right said miss sally again i ll ride in as soon as i am relieved to morrow it was a rather chilly night and after supper the cow punchers were lounging about a big fire of dried mesquite chunks their usual exchange of jokes and repartee had dwindled almost to silence but silence in a cow camp generally betokens the brewing of mischief miss sally and the marquis were seated upon a log discussing the relative merits of the lengthened or shortened stirrup in long distance riding the marquis arose presently and went to a tree near by to examine some strips of rawhide he was seasoning for making a lariat just as he left a little puff of wind blew some scraps of tobacco from a cigarette that dry creek smithers was rolling into miss sally s eyes while the cook was rubbing at them with tears flowing phonograph davis so called on account of his strident voice arose and began a speech fellers and citizens i desire to perpound a interrogatory what is the most grievous spectacle what the human mind can contemplate a volley of answers responded to his question a busted flush a maverick when you ain t got your branding iron yourself the hole in the end of some other feller s gun shet up you ignoramuses said old taller the fat cow puncher phony knows what it is he s waitin for to tell us no fellers and citizens continued phonograph them spectacles you ve e numerated air shore grievious and way up yonder close to the so lution but they ain t it the most grievious spectacle air that he pointed to miss sally who was still rubbing his streaming eyes a trustin and a in veegled female a weepin tears on account of her heart bein busted by a false deceiver air we men or air we catamounts to gaze upon the blightin of our miss sally s affections by a a risto crat which has come among us with his superior beauty and his glitterin title to give the weeps to the lovely critter we air bound to pertect air we goin to act like men or air we goin to keep on eaten soggy chuck from her cryin so plentiful over the bread pan it s a gallopin shame said dry creek with a sniffle it ain t human i ve noticed the varmint a palaverin round her frequent and him a marquis ain t that a title phony it s somethin like a king the brushy creek kid hastened to explain only lower in the deck guess it comes in between the jack and the ten spot don t miscontruct me went on phonograph as undervaluatin the a ristocrats some of em air proper people and can travel right along with the watson boys i ve herded some with em myself i ve viewed the elephant with the mayor of fort worth and i ve listened to the owl with the gen ral passenger agent of the katy and they can keep up with the percession from where you laid the chunk but when a marquis monkeys with the innocent affections of a cook lady may i inquire what the case seems to call for the leathers shouted dry creek smithers you hearn er charity was the kid s form of corroboration we ve got your company assented the cow punchers in chorus before the marquis realized their intention two of them seized him by each arm and led him up to the log phonograph davis self appointed to carry out the sentence stood ready with a pair of stout leather leggings in his hands it was the first time they had ever laid hands on the marquis during their somewhat rude sports what are you up to he asked indignantly with flashing eyes go easy marquis whispered rube fellows one of the boys that held him it s all in fun take it good natured and they ll let you off light they re only goin to stretch you over the log and tan you eight or ten times with the leggin s twon t hurt much the marquis with an exclamation of anger his white teeth gleaming suddenly exhibited a surprising strength he wrenched with his arms so violently that the four men were swayed and dragged many yards from the log a cry of anger escaped him and then miss sally his eyes cleared of the tobacco saw and he immediately mixed with the struggling group but at that moment a loud hallo rang in their ears and a buckboard drawn by a team of galloping mustangs spun into the campfire s circle of light every man turned to look and what they saw drove from their minds all thoughts of carrying out phonograph davis s rather time worn contribution to the evening s amusement bigger game than the marquis was at hand and his captors released him and stood staring at the approaching victim the buckboard and team belonged to sam holly a cattleman from the big muddy sam was driving and with him was a stout smooth faced man wearing a frock coat and a high silk hat that was the county judge mr dave hackett candidate for reelection sam was escorting him about the county among the camps to shake up the sovereign voters the men got out hitched the team to a mesquite and walked toward the fire instantly every man in camp except the marquis miss sally and pink saunders who had to play host uttered a frightful yell of assumed terror and fled on all sides into the darkness heavens alive exclaimed hackett are we as ugly as that how do you do mr saunders glad to see you again what are you doing to my hat holly i was afraid of this hat said sam holly meditatively he had taken the hat from hackett s head and was holding it in his hand looking dubiously around at the shadows beyond the firelight where now absolute stillness reigned what do you think saunders pink grinned better elevate it some he said in the tone of one giving disinterested advice the light ain t none too good i wouldn t want it on my head holly stepped upon the hub of a hind wheel of the grub wagon and hung the hat upon a limb of a live oak scarcely had his foot touched the ground when the crash of a dozen six shooters split the air and the hat fell to the ground riddled with bullets a hissing noise was heard as if from a score of rattlesnakes and now the cow punchers emerged on all sides from the darkness stepping high with ludicrously exaggerated caution and hist ing to one another to observe the utmost prudence in approaching they formed a solemn wide circle about the hat gazing at it in manifest alarm and seized every few moments by little stampedes of panicky flight it s the varmint said one in awed tones that flits up and down in the low grounds at night saying willie wallo it s the venomous kypootum proclaimed another it stings after it s dead and hollers after it s buried it s the chief of the hairy tribe said phonograph davis but it s stone dead now boys don t you believe it demurred dry creek it s only possumin it s the dreaded highgollacum fantod from the forest there s only one way to destroy its life he led forward old taller the pound cow puncher old taller placed the hat upright on the ground and solemnly sat upon it crushing it as flat as a pancake hackett had viewed these proceedings with wide open eyes sam holly saw that his anger was rising and said to him here s where you win or lose judge there are sixty votes on the diamond cross the boys are trying your mettle take it as a joke and i don t think you ll regret it and hackett saw the point and rose to the occasion advancing to where the slayers of the wild beast were standing above its remains and declaring it to be at last defunct he said with deep earnestness boys i must thank you for this gallant rescue while driving through the arroyo that cruel monster that you have so fearlessly and repeatedly slaughtered sprang upon us from the tree tops to you i shall consider that i owe my life and also i hope reelection to the office for which i am again a candidate allow me to hand you my card the cow punchers always so sober faced while engaged in their monkey shines relaxed into a grin of approval but phonograph davis his appetite for fun not yet appeased had something more up his sleeve pardner he said addressing hackett with grave severity many a camp would be down on you for turnin loose a pernicious varmint like that in it but bein

always let you off pretty light in their frolics i don t mind it but you don t understand persisted the marquis pleadingly that man is county judge and his acts are binding i can t oh you don t know

cheeks were flushed and his eyes were shining go on with the rat killin said be a little while after a procession approached the tree under which hackett holly and saunders were sitting smoking limpy walker was in the lead extracting a doleful tune from his concertina next came the bride and groom the cook wore the gorgeous navajo blanket tied around his waist and carried in one band the waxen white spanish dagger blossom as large as a peck measure and weighing fifteen pounds his hat was ornamented with mesquite branches and yellow ratama blooms a resurrected mosquito bar served as a veil after them stumbled phonograph davis in the character of the bride s father weeping into a saddle blanket with sobs that could be heard a mile away the cow punchers followed by twos loudly commenting upon the bride s appearance in a supposed imitation of the audiences at fashionable weddings hackett rose as the procession halted before him and after a little lecture upon matrimony asked what are your names sally and charles answered the cook join hands charles and sally perhaps there never was a stranger wedding for wedding it was though only two of those present knew it when the ceremony was over the cow punchers gave one yell of congratulation and immediately abandoned their foolery for the night blankets were unrolled and sleep became the paramount question the cook divested of his decorations and the marquis lingered for a moment in the shadow of the grub wagon the marquis leaned her head against his shoulder i didn t know what else to do she was saying father was gone and we kids had to rustle i had helped him so much with the cattle that i thought i d turn cowboy there wasn t anything else i could make a living at i wasn t much stuck on it though after i got here and i d

marquis of borodale but you ll excuse that won t you sally it really isn t my fault you know a fog in santone published in the cosmopolitan october probably written in or shortly after o henry s first

tablets less than an hour ago the customer smiles wanly the fault is in your crooked streets i didn t intend to call upon you twice but i guess i got tangled up excuse me he draws his collar higher and moves out slowly he stops under an electric light at the corner and juggles absorbedly with three or four little pasteboard boxes thirty six he announces to himself more than plenty for a gray mist had swept upon santone that night an opaque terror that laid a hand to the throat of each of the city s guests it was computed that three thousand invalids were hibernating in the town they had come from far and wide for here among these contracted river sliced streets the goddess ozone has elected to linger purest atmosphere sir on earth you might think from the river winding through our town that we are malarial but no sir repeated experiments made both by the government and local experts show that our air contains nothing deleterious nothing but ozone sir pure ozone litmus paper tests made all along the river show but you can read it all in the prospectuses or the santonian will recite it for you word by word we may achieve climate but weather is thrust upon us santone then cannot be blamed for this cold gray fog that came and kissed the lips of the three thousand and then delivered them to the cross that night the tubercles whose ravages hope holds in check multiplied the writhing fingers of the pale mist did not go thence bloodless many of the wooers of ozone capitulated with the enemy that night turning their faces to the wall in that dumb isolated apathy that so terrifies their watchers on the red stream of hemorrhagia a few souls drifted away leaving behind pathetic heaps white and chill as the fog itself two or three came to view this atmospheric wraith as the ghost of impossible joys sent to whisper to them of the egregious folly it is to inhale breath into the lungs only to exhale it again and these used whatever came handy to their relief pistols gas or the beneficent muriate the purchaser of the morphia wanders into the fog and at length finds himself upon a little iron bridge one of the score or more in the heart of the city under which the small tortuous river flows he leans on the rail and gasps for here the mist has concentrated lying like a foot pad to garrote such of the three thousand as creep that way the iron bridge guys rattle

arm rest the bartender blond heavy well groomed sets out their drinks instantly perceiving that he serves two of the three thousand he observes that one is a middle aged man well dressed with a lined and sunken face the other a mere boy who is chiefly eyes and overcoat disguising well the tedium begotten by many repetitions the server of drinks begins to chant the sanitary saga of santone rather a

let em turn red white and blue what we want is a repeated test of that whiskey come again i paid for the last round goodall of memphis the bottle oscillates from one to the other continues to do so and is not removed from the counter the bartender sees two emaciated invalids dispose of enough kentucky belle to floor a dozen cowboys without displaying any emotion save a sad and contemplative interest in the peregrinations of the bottle so he is moved to manifest a solicitude as to the consequences not on your uncle mark hanna responds toledo will we get drunk we ve been vaccinated with whiskey and cod liver oil what would send you to the police station only gives us a thirst s s set out another bottle it is slow work trying to meet death by that route some quicker way must be found they leave the saloon and plunge again into the mist the sidewalks are mere flanges at the base of the houses the street a cold ravine the fog filling it like a freshet not far away is the mexican quarter conducted as if by wires along the heavy air comes a guitar s tinkle and the demoralizing voice of some senorita singing en las tardes sombrillos del invierro en el prado a marar me reclino y maldigo mi fausto destino una vida la mas infeliz the words of it they do not understand neither toledo nor memphis but words are the least important things in life the music tears the breasts of the seekers after nepenthe inciting toledo to remark those kids of mine i wonder by god mr goodall of memphis we had too little of that whiskey no slow music in mine if you please it makes you disremember

you ain t going along good by goodall of memphis he rounds the corner and shuffles away casting off thus easily the ties of acquaintanceship as the moribund do the season of dissolution being man s supreme hour of egoism and selfishness but he turns and calls back through the fog to the other i say goodall of memphis if you get there before i do tell em hurd s a comin too hurd of t leder ah hia thus goodall s tempter deserts him that youth un complaining and uncaring takes a spell at coughing and recovered wanders desultorily on down the street the name of which he neither knows nor recks at a certain point he perceives swinging doors and hears filtering between them a noise of wind and string instruments two men enter from the street as he arrives and he follows them in there is a kind of ante chamber plentifully set with palms and cactuses and oleanders at little marble topped tables some people sit while soft shod attendants bring the beer all is orderly clean melancholy gay of the german method of pleasure at his right is the foot of a stairway a man there holds out his hand goodall extends his full of silver the man selects therefrom a coin goodall goes upstairs and sees there two galleries extending along the sides of a concert hall which he now perceives to lie below and beyond the anteroom he first entered these galleries are divided into boxes or stalls which bestow with the aid of hanging lace curtains a certain privacy upon their occupants passing with aimless feet down the aisle contiguous to these saucy and discreet compartments he is half checked by the sight in one of them of a young woman alone and seated in an attitude of reflection this young woman becomes aware of his approach a smile from her brings him to a standstill and her subsequent invitation draws him though hesitating to the other chair in the box a little table between them goodall is only nineteen there are some whom when the terrible god phthisis wishes to destroy be first makes beautiful and the boy is one of these his face is wax and an awful pulchritude is born of the menacing flame in his cheeks his eyes reflect an unearthly vista engendered by the certainty of his doom as it is forbidden man to guess accurately concerning his fate it is inevitable that he shall tremble at the slightest lifting of the veil the young woman is well dressed and exhibits a beauty of distinctly feminine and tender sort an eve like comeliness that scarcely seems predestined to fade it is immaterial the steps by which the two mount to a certain plane of good understanding they are short and few as befits the occasion a button against the wall of the partition is frequently disturbed and a waiter comes and goes at signal pensive beauty would nothing of wine two thick plaits of her blond hair hang almost to the floor she is a lineal descendant of the lorelei so the waiter brings the brew effervescent icy greenish golden the orchestra on the stage is playing oh rachel the youngsters have exchanged a good bit of information she calls him walter and he calls her miss rosa goodall s tongue is loosened and he has told her everything about himself about his home in tennessee the old pillared mansion under the oaks the stables the hunting the friends he has down to the chickens and the box bushes bordering the walks about his coming south for the climate hoping to escape the hereditary foe of his family all about his three months on a ranch the deer hunts the rattlers and the rollicking in the cow camps then of his advent to santone where he had indirectly learned from a great specialist that his life s calendar probably contains but two more leaves and then of this death white choking night which has come and strangled his fortitude and sent him out to seek a port amid its depressing billows my weekly letter from home failed to come he told her and i was pretty blue i knew i had to go before long and i was tired of waiting i went out and bought morphine at every drug store where they would sell me a few tablets i got thirty six quarter grains and was going back to my room and take them but i met a queer fellow on a bridge who had a new idea goodall fillips a little pasteboard box upon the table i put em all together in there miss rosa being a woman must raise the lid and gave a slight shiver at the innocent looking triturates horrid things but those little white bits they could never kill one indeed they could walter knew better nine grains of morphia why half the amount might miss rosa demands to know about mr hurd of toledo and is told she laughs like a delighted child what a funny fellow but tell me more about your home and your sisters walter i know enough about texas and tarantulas and cowboys the theme is dear just now to his mood and he lays before her the simple details of a true home the little ties and endearments that so fill the exile s heart of his sisters one alice furnishes him a theme he loves to dwell upon she is like you miss rosa he says maybe not quite so pretty but just as nice and good and there walter says miss rosa sharply now talk about something else but a shadow falls upon the wall outside preceding a big softly treading man finely dressed who pauses a second before the curtains and then passes on presently comes the waiter with a message mr rolfe says tell rolfe i m engaged i don t know why it is says goodall of memphis but i don t feel as bad as i did an hour ago i wanted to die but since i ve met you miss rosa i d like so much to live the young woman whirls around the table lays an arm behind his neck and kisses him on the cheek you must dear boy she says i know what was the matter it was the miserable foggy weather that has lowered your spirit and mine too a little but look now with a little spring she has drawn back the curtains a window is in the wall opposite and lo the mist is cleared away the indulgent moon is out again revoyaging the plumbless sky roof and parapet and spire are softly pearl enamelled twice thrice the retrieved river flashes back between the houses the light of the firmament a tonic day will dawn sweet and prosperous talk of death when the world is so beautiful says miss rosa laying her hand on his shoulder do something to please me walter go home to your rest and say i mean to get better and do it if you ask it says the boy with a smile i will the waiter brings full glasses did they ring no but it is well he may leave them a farewell glass miss rosa says to your better health walter he says to our next meeting his eyes look no longer into the void but gaze upon the antithesis of death his foot is set in an undiscovered country to night he is obedient ready to go good night she says i never kissed a girl before he confesses except my sisters you didn t this time she laughs i kissed you good night when shall i see you again he persists you promised me to go home she frowns and get well perhaps we shall meet again soon good night he hesitates his hat in hand she smiles broadly and kisses him once more upon the forehead she watches him far down the aisle then sits again at the table the shadow falls once more against the wall this time the big softly stepping man parts the curtains and looks in miss rosa s eyes meet his and for half a minute they remain thus silent fighting a battle with that king of weapons presently the big man drops the curtains and passes on the orchestra ceases playing suddenly and an important voice can be heard loudly talking in one of the boxes farther down the aisle no doubt some citizen entertains there some visitor to the town and miss rosa leans back in her chair and smiles at some of the words she catches purest atmosphere in the world litmus paper all long nothing hurtful our city nothing but pure ozone the waiter returns for the tray and glasses as he enters the girl crushes a little empty pasteboard box in her hand and throws it in a corner she is stirring something in her glass with her hatpin why miss rosa says the waiter with the civil familiarity he uses putting salt in your beer this early in the night the friendly call published in monthly magazine section july when i used to sell hardware in the west i often made a little town called saltillo in colorado i was always certain of securing a small or a large order from simon bell who kept a general store there bell was one of those six foot low voiced products formed from a union of the west and the south i liked him to look at him you would think he should be robbing stage coaches or juggling gold mines with both hands but he would sell you a paper of tacks or a spool of thread with ten times more patience and courtesy than any saleslady in a city department store i had a twofold object in my last visit to saltillo one was to sell a bill of goods the other to advise bell of a chance that i knew of by which i was certain he could make a small fortune in mountain city a town on the union pacific five times larger than saltillo a mercantile firm was about to go to the wall it had a lively and growing custom but was on the edge of dissolution and ruin mismanagement and the gambling habits of one of the partners explained it the condition of the firm was not yet public property i had my knowledge of it from a private source i knew that if the ready cash were offered the stock and good will could be bought for about one fourth their value on arriving in saltillo i went to bell s store he nodded to me smiled his broad lingering smile went on leisurely selling some candy to a little girl then came around the counter and shook hands well he said his invariably preliminary jocosity fit every call i made i suppose you are out here making kodak pictures of the mountains it s the wrong time of the year to buy any hardware of course i told bell about the bargain in mountain city if he wanted to take advantage of it i would rather have missed a sale than have him overstocked in saltillo it sounds good he said with enthusiasm i d like to branch out and do a bigger business and i m obliged to you for mentioning it but well you come and stay at my house to night and i ll think about it it was then after sundown and time for the larger stores in saltillo to close the clerks in bell s put away their books whirled the combination of the safe put on their coats and hats and left for their homes bell padlocked the big double wooden front doors and we stood for a moment breathing the keen fresh mountain air coming across the foothills a big man walked down the street and stopped in front of the high porch of the store his long black moustache black eyebrows and curly black hair contrasted queerly with his light pink complexion which belonged by rights to a blonde he was about forty and wore a white vest a white hat a watch chain made of five dollar gold pieces linked together and a rather well fitting two piece gray suit of the cut that college boys of eighteen are wont to affect he glanced at me distrustfully and then at bell with coldness and i thought something of enmity in his expression well asked bell as if he were addressing a stranger did you fix up that matter did i the man answered in a resentful tone what do you suppose i ve been here two weeks for the business is to be settled to night does that suit you or have you got something to kick about it s all right said bell i knew you d do it of course you did said the magnificent stranger haven t i done it before you have admitted bell and so have i how do you find it at the hotel rocky grub but i ain t kicking say can you give me any pointers about managing that affair it s my first deal in that line of business you know no i can t answered bell after some thought i ve tried all kinds of ways you ll have to try some of your own tried soft soap barrels of it tried a saddle girth with a buckle on the end of it never none started to once and here s what i got bill held out his right hand even in the deepening twilight i could see on the back of it a long white scar that might have been made by a claw or a knife or some sharp edged tool oh well said the florid man carelessly i ll know what to do later on he walked away without another word when he had gone ten steps he turned and called to bell you keep well out of the way when the goods are delivered so there won t be any hitch in the business all right answered bell i ll attend to my end of the line this talk was scarcely clear in its meaning to me but as it did not concern me i did not let it weigh upon my mind but the singularity of the other man s appearance lingered with me for a while and as we walked toward bell s house i remarked to him your customer seems to be a surly kind of fellow not one that you d like to be snowed in with in a camp on a hunting trip he is that assented bell heartily he reminds me of a rattlesnake that s been poisoned by the bite of a tarantula he doesn t look like a citizen of saltillo i went on no said bell he lives in sacramento he s down here on a little business trip his name is george ringo and he s been my best friend in fact the only friend i ever had for twenty years i was too surprised to make any further comment bell lived in a comfortable plain square two story white house on the edge of the little town i waited in the parlor a room depressingly genteel furnished with red plush straw matting looped up lace curtains and a glass case large enough to contain a mummy full of mineral specimens while i waited i heard upstairs that unmistakable sound instantly recognized the world over a bickering woman s voice rising as her anger and fury grew i could hear between the gusts the temperate rumble of bell s tones striving to oil the troubled waters the storm subsided soon but not before i had heard the woman say in a lower concentrated tone rather more carrying than her high pitched railings this is the last time i tell you the last time oh you will understand the household seemed to consist of only bell and his wife and a servant or two i was introduced to mrs bell at supper at first sight she seemed to be a handsome woman but i soon perceived that her charm had been spoiled an uncontrolled petulance i thought and emotional egotism an absence of poise and a habitual dissatisfaction had marred her womanhood during the meal she showed that false gayety spurious kindliness and reactionary softness that mark the woman addicted to tantrums withal she was a woman who might be attractive to many men after supper bell and i took our chairs outside set them on the grass in the moonlight and smoked the full moon is a witch in her light truthful men dig up for you nuggets of purer gold while liars squeeze out brighter colors from the tubes of their invention i saw bell s broad slow smile come out upon his face and linger there i reckon you think george and me are a funny kind of friends he said the fact is we never did take much interest in each other s company but his idea and mine of what a friend should be was always synonymous and we lived up to it strict all these years now i ll give you an idea of what our idea is a man don t need but one friend the fellow who drinks your liquor and hangs around you slapping you on the back and taking up your time telling you how much he likes you ain t a friend even if you did play marbles at school and fish in the same creek with him as long as you don t need a friend one of that kind may answer but a friend to my mind is one you can deal with on a strict reciprocity basis like me and george have always done a good many years ago him and me was connected in a number of ways we put our capital together and run a line of freight wagons in new mexico and we mined some and gambled a few and then we got into trouble of one or two kinds and i reckon that got us on a better understandable basis than anything else did unless it was the fact that we never had much personal use for each other s ways george is the vainest man i ever see and the biggest brag he could blow the biggest geyser in the yosemite valley back into its hole with one whisper i am a quiet man and fond of studiousness and thought the more we used to see each other personally the less we seemed to like to be together if he ever had slapped me on the back and snivelled over me like i ve seen men do to what they called their friends i know i d have had a rough and tumble with him on the spot same way with george he hated my ways as bad as i did his when we were mining we lived in separate tents so as not to intrude our obnoxiousness on each other but after a long time we begun to know each of us could depend on the other when we were in a pinch up to his last dollar word of honor or perjury bullet or drop of blood we had in the world we never even spoke of it to each other because that would have spoiled it but we tried it out time after time until we came to know i ve grabbed my hat and jumped a freight and rode miles to identify him when he was about to be hung by mistake in idaho for a train robber once i laid sick of typhoid in a tent in texas without a dollar or a change of clothes and sent for george in boise city he came on the next train the first thing he did before speaking to me was to hang up a little looking glass on the side of the tent and curl his moustache and rub some hair dye on his head his hair is naturally a light reddish then he gave me the most scientific cussing i ever had and took off his coat if you wasn t a moses meek little mary s lamb you wouldn t have been took down this way says he haven t you got gumption enough not to drink swamp water or fall down and scream whenever you have a little colic or feel a mosquito bite you he made me a little mad you ve got the bedside manners of a piute medicine man says i and i wish you d go away and let me die a natural death i m sorry i sent for you i ve a mind to says george for nobody cares whether you live or die but now i ve been tricked into coming i might as well stay until this little attack of indigestion or nettle rash or whatever it is passes away two weeks afterward when i was beginning to get around again the doctor laughed and said he was sure that my friend s keeping me mad all the time did more than his drugs to cure me so that s the way george and me was friends there wasn t any sentiment about it it was just give and take and each of us knew that the other was ready for the call at any time i remember once i played a sort of joke on george just to try him i felt a little mean about it afterward because i never ought to have doubted he d do it we was both living in a little town in the san luis valley running some flocks of sheep and a few cattle we were partners but as usual we didn t live together i had an old aunt out from the east visiting for the summer so i rented a little cottage she soon had a couple of cows and some pigs and chickens to make the place look like home george lived alone in a little cabin half a mile out of town one day a calf that we had died that night i broke its bones dumped it into a coarse sack and tied it up with wire i put on an old shirt tore a sleeve most out of it and the collar half off tangled up my hair put some red ink on my hands and spashed some of it over my shirt and face i must have looked like i d been having the fight of my life i put the sack in a wagon and drove out to george s cabin when i halloed he came out in a yellow dressing gown a turkish cap and patent leather shoes george always was a great dresser i dumped the bundle to the ground sh sh says i kind of wild in my way take that and bury it george out somewhere behind your house bury it just like it is and don don t get excited says george and for the lord s sake go and wash your hands and face and put on a clean shirt and he lights his pipe while i drive away at a gallop the next morning he drops around to our cottage where my aunt was fiddling with her flowers and truck in the front yard he bends himself and bows and makes compliments as be could do when so disposed and begs a rose bush from her saying he had turned up a little land back of his cabin and wanted to plant something on it by way of usefulness and ornament so my aunt flattered pulls up one of her biggest by the roots and gives it to him afterward i see it growing where he planted it in a place where the grass had been cleared off and the dirt levelled but neither george nor me ever spoke of it to each other again the moon rose higher possibly drawing water from the sea pixies from their dells and certainly more confidences from simms bell the friend of a friend there come a time not long afterward he went on when i was able to do a good turn for george ringo george had made a little pile of money in beeves and he was up in denver and he showed up when i saw him wearing deer skin vests yellow shoes clothes like the awnings in front of drug stores and his hair dyed so blue that it looked black in the dark he wrote me to come up there quick that he needed me and to bring the best outfit of clothes i had i had em on when i got the letter so i left on the next train george was bell stopped for half a minute listening intently i thought i heard a team coming down the road he explained george was at a summer resort on a lake near denver and was putting on as many airs as he knew how he had rented a little two room cottage and had a chihauhau dog and a hammock and eight different kinds of walking sticks simms he says to me there s a widow woman here that s pestering the soul out of me with her intentions i can t get out of her way it ain t that she ain t handsome and agreeable in a sort of style but her attentions is serious and i ain t ready for to marry nobody and settle down i can t go to no festivity nor sit on the hotel piazza or mix in any of the society round ups but what she cuts me out of the herd and puts her daily brand on me i like this here place goes on george and i m making a hit here in the most censorious circles so i don t want to have to run away from it so i sent for you what do you want me to do i asks george why says he i want you to head her off i want you to cut me out i want you to come to the rescue suppose you seen a wildcat about for to eat me what would you do go for it says i correct says george then go for this mrs de clinton the same how am i to do it i asks by force and awfulness or in some gentler and less lurid manner court her george says get her off my trail feed her take her out in boats hang around her and stick to her get her mashed on you if you can some women are pretty big fools who knows but what she might take a fancy to you had you ever thought i asks of repressing your fatal fascinations in her presence of squeezing a harsh note in the melody of your siren voice of veiling your beauty in other words of giving her the bounce yourself george sees no essence of sarcasm in my remark he twists his moustache and looks at the points of his shoes well simms he said you know how i am about the ladies i can t hurt none of their feelings i m by nature polite and esteemful of their intents and purposes this mrs de clinton don t appear to be the suitable sort for me besides i ain t a marrying man by all means all right said i i ll do the best i can in the case so i bought a new outfit of clothes and a book on etiquette and made a dead set for mrs de clinton she was a fine looking woman cheerful and gay at first i almost had to hobble her to keep her from loping around at george s heels but finally i got her so she seemed glad to go riding with me and sailing on the lake and she seemed real hurt on the mornings when i forgot to send her a bunch of flowers still i didn t like the way she looked at george sometimes out of the corner of her eye george was having a fine time now going with the whole bunch just as he pleased yes m continued bell she certainly was a fine looking woman at that time she s changed some since as you might have noticed at the supper table what i exclaimed i married mrs de clinton went on bell one evening while we were up at the lake when i told george about it he opened his mouth and i thought be was going to break our traditions and say something grateful but he swallowed it back all right says he playing with his dog i hope you won t have too much trouble myself i m not never going to marry that was three years ago said bell we came here to live for a year we got along medium fine and then everything changed for two years i ve been having something that rhymes first class with my name you heard the row upstairs this evening that was a merry welcome compared to the usual average she s tired of me and of this little town life and she rages all day like a panther in a cage i stood it until two weeks ago and then i had to send out the call i located george in sacramento he started the day he got my wire mrs bell came out of the house swiftly toward us some strong excitement or anxiety seemed to possess her but she smiled a faint hostess smile and tried to keep her voice calm the dew is falling she said and it s growing rather late wouldn t you gentlemen rather come into the house bell took some cigars from his pocket and answered it s most too fine a night to turn in yet i think mr ames and i will walk out along the road a mile or so and have another smoke i want to talk with him about some goods that i want to buy up the road or down the road asked mrs bell down said bell i thought she breathed a sigh of relief when we had gone a hundred yards and the house became concealed by trees bell guided me into the thick grove that lined the road and back through them toward the house again we stopped within twenty yards of the house concealed by the dark shadows i wondered at this maneuver and then i heard in the distance coming down the road beyond the house the regular hoofbeats of a team of horses bell held his watch in a ray of moonlight on time within a minute he said that s george s way the team slowed up as it drew near the house and stopped in a patch of black shadows we saw the figure of a woman carrying a heavy valise move swiftly from the other side of the house and hurry to the waiting vehicle then it rolled away briskly in the direction from which it had come i looked at bell inquiringly i suppose i certainly asked him no question she s running away with george said bell simply he s kept me posted about the progress of the scheme all along she ll get a divorce in six months and then george will marry her he never helps anybody halfway it s all arranged between them i began to wonder what friendship was after all when we went into the house bell began to talk easily on other subjects and i took his cue by and by the big chance to buy out the business in mountain city came back to my mind and i began to urge it upon him now that he was free it would be easier for him to make the move and he was sure of a splendid bargain bell was silent for some minutes but when i looked at him i fancied that he was thinking of something else that he was not considering the project why no mr ames he said after a while i can t make that deal i m awful thankful to you though for telling me about it but i ve got to stay here i can t go to mountain city why i asked missis bell he replied won t live in mountain city she hates the place and wouldn t go there i ve got to keep right on here in saltillo mrs bell i exclaimed too puzzled to conjecture what he meant i ought to explain said bell i know george and i know mrs bell he s impatient in his ways he can t stand things that fret him long like i can six months i give them six months of married life and there ll be another disunion mrs bell will come back to me there s no other place for her to go i ve got to stay here and wait at the end of six months i ll have to grab a satchel and catch the first train for george will be sending out the call a dinner at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the story referred to in this skit appears in the trimmed lamp under the same title the badge of policeman o roon the adventures of an author with his own hero all that day in fact from the moment of his creation van sweller had conducted himself fairly well in my eyes of course i had had to make many concessions but in return he had been no less considerate once or twice we had had sharp brief contentions over certain points of behavior but prevailingly give and take had been our rule his morning toilet provoked our first tilt van sweller went about it confidently the usual thing i suppose old chap he said with a smile and a yawn i ring for a b and s and then i have my tub i splash a good deal in the water of course you are aware that there are two ways in which i can receive tommy carmichael when he looks in to have a chat about polo i can talk to him through the bathroom door or i can be picking at a grilled bone which my man has brought in which would you prefer i smiled with diabolic satisfaction at his coming discomfiture neither i said you will make your appearance on the scene when a gentleman should after you are fully dressed which indubitably private function shall take place behind closed doors and i will feel indebted to you if after you do appear your deportment and manners are such that it will not be necessary to inform the public in order to appease its apprehension that you have taken a bath van sweller slightly elevated his brows oh very well he said a trifle piqued i rather imagine it concerns you more than it does me cut the tub by all means if you think best but it has been the usual thing you know this was my victory but after van sweller emerged from his apartments in the beaujolie i was vanquished in a dozen small but well contested skirmishes i allowed him a cigar but routed him on the question of naming its brand but he worsted me when i objected to giving him a coat unmistakably english in its cut i allowed him to stroll down broadway and even permitted passers by god knows there s nowhere to pass but by to turn their heads and gaze with evident admiration at his erect figure i demeaned myself and as a barber gave him a smooth dark face with its keen frank eye and firm jaw later on he looked in at the club and saw freddy vavasour polo team captain dawdling over grilled bone no dear old boy began van sweller but in an instant i had seized him by the collar and dragged him aside with the scantiest courtesy for heaven s sake talk like a man i said sternly do you think it is manly to use those mushy and inane forms of address that man is neither dear nor old nor a boy to my surprise van sweller turned upon me a look of frank pleasure i am glad to hear you say that he said heartily i used those words because i have been forced to say them so often they really are contemptible thanks for correcting me dear old boy still i must admit that van sweller s conduct in the park that morning was almost without flaw the courage the dash the modesty the skill and fidelity that he displayed atoned for everything this is the way the story runs van sweller has been a gentleman member of the rugged riders the company that made a war with a foreign country famous among his comrades was lawrence o roon a man whom van sweller liked a strange thing and a hazardous one in fiction was that van sweller and o roon resembled each other mightily in face form and general appearance after the war van sweller pulled wires and o roon was made a mounted policeman now one night in new york there are commemorations and libations by old comrades and in the morning mounted policeman o roon unused to potent liquids another premise hazardous in fiction finds the earth bucking and bounding like a bronco with no stirrup into which he may insert foot and save his honor and his badge noblesse oblige surely so out along the driveways and bridle paths trots hudson van sweller in the uniform of his incapacitated comrade as like unto him as one french pea is unto a petit pois it is of course jolly larks for van sweller who has wealth and social position enough for him to masquerade safely even as a police commissioner doing his duty if he wished to do so but society not given to scanning the countenances of mounted policemen sees nothing unusual in the officer on the beat and then comes the runaway that is a fine scene the swaying victoria the impetuous daft horses plunging through the line of scattering vehicles the driver stupidly holding his broken reins and the ivory white face of amy ffolliott as she clings desperately with each slender hand fear has come and gone it has left her expression pensive and just a little pleading for life is not so bitter and then the clatter and swoop of mounted policeman van sweller oh it was but the story has not yet been printed when it is you shall learn bow he sent his bay like a bullet after the imperilled victoria a crichton a croesus and a centaur in one he hurls the invincible combination into the chase when the story is printed you will admire the breathless scene where van sweller checks the headlong team and then he looks into amy ffolliott s eyes and sees two things the possibilities of a happiness he has long sought and a nascent promise of it he is unknown to her but he stands in her sight illuminated by the hero s potent glory she his and he hers by all the golden fond unreasonable laws of love and light literature ay that is a rich moment and it will stir you to find van sweller in that fruitful nick of time thinking of his comrade o roon who is cursing his gyrating bed and incapable legs in an unsteady room in a west side hotel while van sweller holds his badge and his honor van sweller hears miss ffolliott s voice thrillingly asking the name of her preserver if hudson van sweller in policeman s uniform has saved the life of palpitating beauty in the park where is mounted policeman o roon in whose territory the deed is done how quickly by a word can the hero reveal himself thus discarding his masquerade of ineligibility and doubling the romance but there is his friend van sweller touches his cap it s nothing miss he says sturdily that s what we are paid for to do our duty and away he rides but the story does not end there as i have said van sweller carried off the park scene to my decided satisfaction even to me he was a hero when he foreswore for the sake of his friend the romantic promise of his adventure it was later in the day amongst the more exacting conventions that encompass the society hero when we had our liveliest disagreement at noon he went to o roon s room and found him far enough recovered to return to his post which he at once did at about six o clock in the afternoon van sweller fingered his watch and flashed at me a brief look full of such shrewd cunning that i suspected him at once time to dress for dinner old man he said with exaggerated carelessness very well i answered without giving him a clew to my suspicions i will go with you to your rooms and see that you do the thing properly i suppose that every author must be a valet to his own hero he affected cheerful acceptance of my somewhat officious proposal to accompany him i could see that he was annoyed by it and that fact fastened deeper in my mind the conviction that he was meditating some act of treachery when he had reached his apartments he said to me with a too patronizing air there are as you perhaps know quite a number of little distinguishing touches to be had out of the dressing process some writers rely almost wholly upon them i suppose that i am to ring for my man and that he is to enter noiselessly with an expressionless countenance he may enter i said with decision and only enter valets do not usually enter a room shouting college songs or with st vitus s dance in their faces so the contrary may be assumed without fatuous or gratuitous asseveration i must ask you to pardon me continued van sweller gracefully for annoying you with questions but some of your methods are a little new to me shall i don a full dress suit with an immaculate white tie or is there another tradition to be upset you will wear i replied evening dress such as a gentleman wears if it is full your tailor should be responsible for its bagginess and i will leave it to whatever erudition you are supposed to possess whether a white tie is rendered any whiter by being immaculate and i will leave it to the consciences of you and your man whether a tie that is not white and therefore not immaculate could possibly form any part of a gentleman s evening dress if not then the perfect tie is included and understood in the term dress and its expressed addition predicates either a redundancy of speech or the spectacle of a man wearing two ties at once with this mild but deserved rebuke i left van sweller in his dressing room and waited for him in his library about an hour later his valet came out and i heard him telephone for an electric cab then out came van sweller smiling but with that sly secretive design in his eye that was puzzling me i believe he said easily as he smoothed a glove that i will drop in at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers for dinner i sprang up angrily at his words this then was the paltry trick he had been scheming to play upon me i faced him with a look so grim that even his patrician poise was flustered you will never do so i exclaimed with my permission what kind of a return is this i continued hotly for the favors i have granted you i gave you a van to your name when i might have called you perkins or simpson i have humbled myself so far as to brag of your polo ponies your automobiles and the iron muscles that you acquired when you were stroke oar of your varsity eight or eleven whichever it is i created you for the hero of this story and i will not submit to having you queer it i have tried to make you a typical young new york gentleman of the highest social station and breeding you have no reason to complain of my treatment to you amy ffolliott the girl you are to win is a prize for any man to be thankful for and cannot be equalled for beauty provided the story is illustrated by the right artist i do not understand why you should try to spoil everything i had thought you were a gentleman what it is you are objecting to old man asked van sweller in a surprised tone to your dining at i answered see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the pleasure would be yours no doubt but the responsibility would fall upon me you intend deliberately to make me out a tout for a restaurant where you dine tonight has not the slightest connection with the thread of our story you know very well that the plot requires that you be in front of the alhambra opera house at where you are to rescue miss ffolliott a second time as the fire engine crashes into her cab until that time your movements are immaterial to the reader why can t you dine out of sight somewhere as many a hero does instead of insisting upon an inapposite and vulgar exhibition of yourself my dear fellow said van sweller politely but with a stubborn tightening of his lips i m sorry it doesn t please you but there s no help for it even a character in a story has rights that an author cannot ignore the hero of a story of new york social life must dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers at least once during its action must i echoed disdainfully why must who demands it the magazine editors answered van sweller giving me a glance of significant warning but why i persisted to please subscribers around kankakee ill said van sweller without hesitation how do you know these things i inquired with sudden suspicion you never came into existence until this morning you are only a character in fiction anyway i myself created you how is it possible for you to know anything pardon me for referring to it said van sweller with a sympathetic smile but i have been the hero of hundreds of stories of this kind i felt a slow flush creeping into my face i thought i stammered i was hoping that is oh well of course an absolutely original conception in fiction is impossible in these days metropolitan types continued van sweller kindly do not offer a hold for much originality i ve sauntered through every story in pretty much the same way now and then the women writers have made me cut some rather strange capers for a gentleman but the men generally pass me along from one to another without much change but never yet in any story have i failed to dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers you will fail this time i said emphatically perhaps so admitted van sweller looking out of the window into the street below but if so it will be for the first time the authors all send me there i fancy that many of them would have liked to accompany me but for the little matter of the expense i say i will be touting for no restaurant i repeated loudly you are subject to my will and i declare that you shall not appear of record this evening until the time arrives for you to rescue miss ffolliott again if the reading public cannot conceive that you have dined during that interval at some one of the thousands of establishments provided for that purpose that do not receive literary advertisement it may suppose for aught i care that you have gone fasting thank you said van sweller rather coolly you are hardly courteous but take care it is at your own risk that you attempt to disregard a fundamental principle in metropolitan fiction one that is dear alike to author and reader i shall of course attend to my duty when it comes time to rescue your heroine but i warn you that it will be your loss if you fail to send me to night to dine at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i will take the consequences if there are to be any i replied i am not yet come to be sandwich man for an eating house i walked over to a table where i had left my cane and gloves i heard the whirr of the alarm in the cab below and i turned quickly van sweller was gone i rushed down the stairs and out to the curb an empty hansom was just passing i hailed the driver excitedly see that auto cab halfway down the block i shouted follow it don t lose sight of it for an instant and i will give you two dollars if i only had been one of the characters in my story instead of myself i could easily have offered or or even but was all i felt justified in expending with fiction at its present rates the cab driver instead of lashing his animal into a foam proceeded at a deliberate trot that suggested a by the hour arrangement but i suspected van sweller s design and when we lost sight of his cab i ordered my driver to proceed at once to see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i found van sweller at a table under a palm just glancing over the menu with a hopeful waiter hovering at his elbow come with me i said inexorably you will not give me the slip again under my eye you shall remain until van sweller countermanded the order for his dinner and arose to accompany me he could scarcely do less a fictitious character is but poorly equipped for resisting a hungry but live author who comes to drag him forth from a restaurant all he said was you were just in time but i think you are making a mistake you cannot afford to ignore the wishes of the great reading public i took van sweller to my own rooms to my room he had never seen anything like it before sit on that trunk i said to him while i observe whether the landlady is stalking us if she is not i will get things at a delicatessen store below and cook something for you in a pan over the gas jet it will not be so bad of course nothing of this will appear in the story jove old man said van sweller looking about him with interest this is a jolly little closet you live in where the devil do you sleep oh that pulls down and i say what is this under the corner of the carpet oh a frying pan i see clever idea fancy cooking over the gas what larks it will be think of anything you could eat i asked try a chop or what anything said van sweller enthusiastically except a grilled bone two weeks afterward the postman brought me a large fat envelope i opened it and took out something that i had seen before and this typewritten letter from a magazine that encourages society fiction your short story the badge of policeman o roon is herewith returned we are sorry that it has been unfavorably passed upon but it seems to lack in some of the essential requirements of our publication the story is splendidly constructed its style is strong and inimitable and its action and character drawing deserve the highest praise as a story per se it has merit beyond anything that we have read for some time but as we have said it fails to come up to some of the standards we have set could you not re write the story and inject into it the social atmosphere and return it to us for further consideration it is suggested to you that you have the hero van sweller drop in for luncheon or dinner once or twice at or at the see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers which will be in line with the changes desired

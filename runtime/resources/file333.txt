good graces is like expecting a man to make a square meal on the ringing of a dinner bell but i haven t begun on the story i was going to tell you yet one day i took a long ride in the hot sunshine and then took a bath in the cold waters of a lagoon on the edge of the town before i d cooled off that evening after dark i called at the alcalde s to see anabela i was calling regular every evening then and we were to be married in a month she was looking like a bulbul a gazelle and a tea rose and her eyes were as soft and bright as two quarts of cream skimmed off from the milky way she looked at my rugged features without any expression of fear or repugnance indeed i fancied that i saw a look of deep admiration and affection such as she had cast at fergus on the plaza i sat down and opened my mouth to tell anabela what she loved to hear that she was a trust monopolizing all the loveliness of earth i opened my mouth and instead of the usual vibrating words of love and compliment there came forth a faint wheeze such as a baby with croup might emit not a word not a syllable not an intelligible sound i had caught cold in my laryngeal regions when i took my injudicious bath for two hours i sat trying to entertain anabela she talked a certain amount but it was perfunctory and diluted the nearest approach i made to speech was to formulate a sound like a clam trying to sing a life on the ocean wave at low tide it seemed that anabela s eyes did not rest upon me as often as usual i had nothing with which to charm her ears we looked at pictures and she played the guitar occasionally very badly when i left her parting manner seemed cool or at least thoughtful this happened for five evenings consecutively on the sixth day she ran away with fergus mcmahan it was known that they fled in a sailing yacht bound for belize i was only eight hours behind them in a small steam launch belonging to the revenue department before i sailed i rushed into the botica of old manuel iquito a half breed indian druggist i could not speak but i pointed to my throat and made a sound like escaping steam he began to yawn in an hour according to the customs of the country i would have been waited on i reached across the counter seized him by the throat and pointed again to my own he yawned once more and thrust into my hand a small bottle containing a black liquid take one small spoonful every two hours says he i threw him a dollar and skinned for the steamer i steamed into the harbour at belize thirteen seconds behind the yacht that anabela and fergus were on they started for the shore in a dory just as my skiff was lowered over the side i tried to order my sailormen to row faster but the sounds died in my larynx before they came to the light then i thought of old iquito s medicine and i got out his bottle and took a swallow of it the two boats landed at the same moment i walked straight up to anabela and fergus her eyes rested upon me for an instant then she turned them full of feeling and confidence upon fergus i knew i could not speak but i was desperate in speech lay my only hope i could not stand beside fergus and challenge comparison in the way of beauty purely involuntarily my larynx and epiglottis attempted to reproduce the sounds that my mind was calling upon my vocal organs to send forth to my intense surprise and delight the words rolled forth beautifully clear resonant exquisitely modulated full of power expression and long repressed emotion senorita anabela says i may i speak with you aside for a moment you don t want details about that do you thanks the old eloquence had come back all right i led her under a cocoanut palm and put my old verbal spell on her again judson says she when you are talking to me i can hear nothing else i can see nothing else there is nothing and nobody else in the world for me well that s about all of the story anabela went back to oratama in the steamer with me i never heard what became of fergus i never saw him any more anabela is now mrs judson tate has my story bored you much no said i i am always interested in psychological studies a human heart and especially a woman s is a wonderful thing to contemplate it is said judson tate and so are the trachea and bronchial tubes of man and the larynx too did you ever make a study of the windpipe never said i but i have taken much pleasure in your story may i ask after mrs tate and inquire of her present health and whereabouts oh sure said judson tate we are living in bergen avenue jersey city the climate down in oratama didn t suit mrs t i don t suppose you ever dissected the arytenoid cartilages of the epiglottis did you why no said i i am no surgeon pardon me said judson tate but every man should know enough of anatomy and therapeutics to safeguard his own health a sudden cold may set up capillary bronchitis or inflammation of the pulmonary vesicles which may result in a serious affection of the vocal organs perhaps so said i with some impatience but that is neither here nor there speaking of the strange manifestations of the affection of women i yes yes interrupted judson tate they have peculiar ways

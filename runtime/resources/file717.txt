you need i continued is the official attention of one jesse holmes kerner not being a southerner did not compre hend so he sat sentimental figuring on his flat in his sordid artistic way while i gazed into the green eyes of the sophisticated spirit of wormwood presently i noticed casually that a procession of bacchantes limned on the wall immediately below the ceiling bad begun to move traversing the room from right to left in a gay and spectacular pilgrimage i did not confide my discovery to kerner the artistic temperament is too high strung to view such devia tions from the natural laws of the art of kalsomining i sipped my absinthe drip and sawed wormwood one absinthe drip is not much but i said again to kerner kindly you are a fool and then in the vernacular jesse holmes for yours and then i looked around and saw the fool killer as he had always appeared to my imagination sitting at a nearby table and regarding us with his reddish fatal relentless eyes he was jesse holmes from top to toe he had the long gray ragged beard the gray clothes of ancient cut the executioner s look and the dusty shoes of one who bad been called from afar his eyes were turned fixedly upon kerner i shuddered to think that i bad invoked him from his assiduous southern duties i thought of flying and then i kept my seat reflecting that many men bad es caped his ministrations when it seemed that nothing short of an appointment as ambassador to spain could save them from him i had called my brother kerner a fool and was in danger of hell fire that was nothing but i would try to save him from jesse holmes the fool killer got up from his table and came over to ours he rested his hands upon it and turned his burning vindictive eyes upon kerner ig noring me you are a hopeless fool be said to the artist haven t you had enough of starvation yet i of fer you one more opportunity give up this girl and come back to your home refuse and you must take the consequences the fool killer s threatening face was within a foot of his victim s but to my horror kerner made not the slightest sign of being aware of his presence we will be married next week be muttered ab sent mindedly with my studio furniture and some second hand stuff we can make out you have decided your own fate said the fool killer in a low but terrible voice you may con sider yourself as one dead you have had your last chance in the moonlight went on kerner softly we will sit under the skylight with our guitar and sing away the false delights of pride and money on your own head be it hissed the fool killer and my scalp prickled when i perceived that neither kerner s eyes nor his ears took the slightest cog nizance of jesse holmes and then i knew that for some reason the veil had been lifted for me alone and that i bad been elected to save my friend from de struction at the fool killer s bands something of the fear and wonder of it must have showed itself in my face excuse me said kerner with his wan amiable smile was i talking to myself i think it is getting to be a habit with me the fool killer turned and walked out of far ronils wait here for me said i rising i must speak to that man had you no answer for him because you are a fool must you die like a mouse under his foot could you not utter one squeak in your own defence you are drunk said kerner heartlessly no one addressed me the destroyer of your mind said i stood above you just now and marked you for his victim you are not blind or deaf i recognized no such person said kerner i have seen no one but you at this table sit down hereafter you shall have no more absinthe drips wait here said i furious if you don t care for your own life i will save it for you i hurried out and overtook the man in gray half way down the block he looked as i bad seen him in my fancy a thousand times truculent gray and awful he walked with the white oak staff and but for the street sprinkler the dust would have been fly ing under his tread i caught him by the sleeve and steered him to a dark angle of a building i knew he was a myth and i did not want a cop to see me conversing with va cancy for i might land in bellevue minus my silver matchbox and diamond ring jesse holmes said i facing him with apparent bravery i know you i have heard of you all my life i know now what a scourge you have been to your country instead of killing fools you have been murdering the youth and genius that are necessary to make a people live and grow great you are a fool yourself holmes you began killing off the brightest and best of our countrymen three generations ago when the old and obsolete standards of society and honor and orthodoxy were narrow and bigoted you proved that when you put your murderous mark upon my friend kerner the wisest chap i ever knew in my life the fool killer looked at me grimly and closely you ve a queer jag said he curiously oh yes i see who you are now you were sitting with him at the table well if i m not mistaken i heard you call him a fool too i did said i i delight in doing so it is from envy by

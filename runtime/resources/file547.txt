and treat anything from yellow fever to a personal friend besides his other liabilities doc could play a flute for a minute or two he was guilty of two tunes dixie and another one that was mighty close to the suwanee river you might say one of its tributaries he used to come down and sit with me while i was getting well and aggrieve his flute and say unreconstructed things about the north you d have thought that the smoke from the first gun at fort sumter was still floating around in the air you know that was about the time they staged them property revolutions down there that wound up in the fifth act with the thrilling canal scene where uncle sam has nine curtain calls holding miss panama by the hand while the bloodhounds keep senator morgan treed up in a cocoanut palm that s the way it wound up but at first it seemed as if colombia was going to make panama look like one of the kind with dents made in it in the factory like they wear at north beach fish fries for mine i played the straw hat crowd to win and they gave me a colonel s commission over a brigade of twenty seven men in the left wing and second joint of the insurgent army the colombian troops were awfully rude to us one day when i had my brigade in a sandy spot with its shoes off doing a battalion drill by squads the government army rushed from behind a bush at us acting as noisy and disagreeable as they could my troops enfiladed left faced and left the spot after enticing the enemy for three miles or so we struck a brier patch and had to sit down when we were ordered to throw up our toes and surrender we obeyed five of my best staff officers fell suffering extremely with stone bruised heels then and there those colombians took your friend barney sir stripped him of the insignia of his rank consisting of a pair of brass knuckles and a canteen of rum and dragged him before a military court the presiding general went through the usual legal formalities that sometimes cause a case to hang on the calendar of a south american military court as long as ten minutes he asked me my age and then sentenced me to be shot they woke up the court interpreter an american named jenks who was in the rum business and vice versa and told him to translate the verdict jenks stretched himself and took a morphine tablet you ve got to back up against th dobe old man says he to me three weeks i believe you get haven t got a chew of fine cut on you have you translate that again with foot notes and a glossary says i i don t know whether i m discharged condemned or handed over to the gerry society oh says jenks don t you understand you re to be stood up against a dobe wall and shot in two or three weeks three i think they said would you mind asking em which says i a week don t amount to much after you re dead but it seems a real nice long spell while you are alive it s two weeks says the interpreter after inquiring in spanish of the court shall i ask em again let be says i let s have a stationary verdict if i keep on appealing this way they ll have me shot about ten days before i was captured no i haven t got any fine cut they sends me over to the calaboza with a detachment of coloured postal telegraph boys carrying enfield rifles and i am locked up in a kind of brick bakery the temperature in there was just about the kind mentioned in the cooking recipes that call for a quick oven then i gives a silver dollar to one of the guards to send for the united states consul he comes around in pajamas with a pair of glasses on his nose and a dozen or two inside of him i m to be shot in two weeks says i and although i ve made a memorandum of it i don t seem to get it off my mind you want to call up uncle sam on the cable as quick as you can and get him all worked up about it have em send the kentucky and the kearsage and the oregon down right away that ll be about enough battleships but it wouldn t hurt to have a couple of cruisers and a torpedo boat destroyer too and say if dewey isn t busy better have him come along on the fastest one of the fleet now see here o keefe says the consul getting the best of a hiccup what do you want to bother the state department about this matter for didn t you hear me says i i m to be shot in two weeks did you think i said i was going to a lawn party and it wouldn t hurt of roosevelt could get the japs to send down the yellowyamtiskookum or the ogotosingsing or some other first class cruisers to help it would make me feel safer now what you want says the consul is not to get excited i ll send you over some chewing tobacco and some banana fritters when i go back the united states can t interfere in this you know you were caught insurging against the government and you re subject to the laws of this country to tell the truth i ve had an intimation from the state department unofficially of course that whenever a soldier of fortune demands a fleet of gunboats in a case of revolutionary katzenjammer i should cut the cable give him all the tobacco he wants and after he s shot take his clothes if they fit me for part payment of my salary consul says i to him this is a serious question you are representing uncle sam this ain t any little international tomfoolery like a universal peace congress or the christening of the shamrock iv i m an american citizen and i demand protection i demand the mosquito fleet and schley and the atlantic squadron and bob evans and general e byrd grubb and two or three protocols what are you going to do about it nothing doing says the consul be off with you then says i out of patience with him and send me doc millikin ask doc to come and see me doc comes and looks through the bars at me surrounded by dirty soldiers with even my shoes and canteen confiscated and he looks mightily pleased hello yank says he getting a little taste of johnson s island now ain t ye doc says i i ve just had an interview with the u s consul i gather from his remarks that i might just as well have been caught selling suspenders in kishineff under the name of rosenstein as to be in my present condition it seems that the only maritime aid i am to receive from the united states is some navy plug to chew doc says i can t you suspend hostility on the slavery question long enough to do something for me it ain t been my habit doc millikin answers to do any painless dentistry when i find a yank cutting an eye tooth so the stars and stripes ain t lending any marines to shell the huts of the colombian cannibals hey oh say can you see by the dawn s early light the star spangled banner has fluked in the fight what s the matter with the war department hey it s a great thing to be a citizen of a gold standard nation ain t it rub it in doc all you want says i i guess we re weak on foreign policy for a yank says doc putting on his specs and talking more mild you ain t so bad if you had come from below the line i reckon i would have liked you right smart now since your country has gone back on you you have to come to the old doctor whose cotton you burned and whose mules who stole and whose niggers you freed to help you ain t that so yank it is says i heartily and let s have a diagnosis of the case right away for in two weeks time all you can do is to hold an autopsy and i don t want to be amputated if i can help it now says doc business like it s easy enough for you to get out of this scrape money ll do it you ve got to pay a long string of em from general pomposo down to this anthropoid ape guarding your door about will do the trick have you got the money me says i i ve got one chili dollar two real pieces and a medio then if you ve any last words utter em says that old reb the roster of your financial budget sounds quite much to be like the noise of a requiem change the treatment says i i admit that i m short call a consultation or use radium or smuggle me in some saws or something yank says doc millikin i ve a good notion to help you there s only one government in the world that can get you out of this difficulty and that s the confederate states of america the grandest nation that ever existed just as you said to me i says to doc why the confederacy ain t a nation it s been absolved forty years ago that s a campaign lie says doc she s running along as solid as the roman empire she s the only hope you ve got now you being a yank have got to go through with some preliminary obsequies before you can get official aid you ve got to take the oath of allegiance to the confederate government then i ll guarantee she does all she can for you what do you say yank it s your last chance if you re fooling with me doc i answers you re no better than the united states but as you say it s the last chance hurry up and swear me i always did like the corn whisky and possum anyhow i believe i m half southerner by nature i m willing to try the klu klux in place of the khaki get brisk doc millikin thinks awhile and then he offers me this oath of allegiance to take without any kind of a chaser i barnard o keefe yank being of sound body but a republican mind hereby swear to transfer my fealty respect and allegiance to the confederate states of america and the government thereof in consideration of said government through its official acts and powers obtaining my freedom and release from confinement and sentence of death brought about by the exuberance of my irish proclivities and my general pizenness as a yank i repeated these words after doc but they seemed to me a kind of hocus pocus and i don t believe any life insurance company in the world would have issued me a policy on the strength of em doc went away saying he would communicate with his government immediately say you can imagine how i felt me to be shot in two weeks and my only hope for help being in a government that s been dead so long that it isn t even remembered except on decoration day and when joe wheeler signs the voucher for his pay check but it was all there was in sight and somehow i thought doc millikin had something up his old alpaca sleeve that wasn t all foolishness around to the jail comes old doc again in about a week i was flea bitten a mite sarcastic and fundamentally hungry any confederate ironclads in the offing i asks do you notice any sounds resembling the approach of jeb stewart s cavalry overland or stonewall jackson sneaking up in the rear if you do i wish you d say so it s too soon yet for help to come says doc the sooner the better says i i don t care if it gets in fully fifteen minutes before i am shot and if you happen to lay eyes on beauregard or albert sidney johnston or any of the relief corps wig wag em to hike along there s been no answer received yet says doc don t forget says i that there s only four days more i don t know how you propose to work this thing doc i says to him but it seems to me i d sleep better if you had got a government that was alive and on the map like afghanistan or great britain or old man kruger s kingdom to take this matter up i don t mean any disrespect to your confederate states but i can t help feeling that my chances of being pulled out of this scrape was decidedly weakened when general lee surrendered it s your only chance said doc don t quarrel with it what did your own country do for you it was only two days before the morning i was to be shot when doc millikin came around again all right yank says he help s come the confederate states of america is going to apply for your release the representatives of the government arrived on a fruit steamer last night bully says i bully for you doc i suppose it s marines with a gatling i m going to love your country all i can for this negotiations says old doc will be opened between the two governments at once you will know later to day if they are successful about four in the afternoon a soldier in red trousers brings a paper round to the jail and they unlocks the door and i walks out the guard at the door bows and i bows and i steps into the grass and wades around to doc millikin s shack doc was sitting in his hammock playing dixie soft and low and out of tune on his flute i interrupted him at look away look away and shook his hand for five minutes i never thought says doc taking a chew fretfully that i d ever try to save any blame yank s life but mr o keefe i don t see but what you are entitled to be considered part human anyhow i never thought yanks had any of the rudiments of decorum and laudability about them i reckon i might have been too aggregative in my tabulation but it ain t me you want to thank it s the confederate states of america and i m much obliged to em says i it s a poor man that wouldn t be patriotic with a country that s saved his life i ll drink to the stars and bars whenever there s a flagstaff and a glass convenient but where says i are the rescuing troops if there was a gun fired or a shell burst i didn t hear it doc millikin raises up and points out the window with his flute at the banana steamer loading with fruit yank says he there s a steamer that s going to sail in the morning if i was you i d sail on it the confederate government s done all it can for you there wasn t a gun fired the negotiations were carried on secretly between the two nations by the purser of that steamer i got him to do it because i didn t want to appear in it twelve thousand dollars was paid to the officials in bribes to let you go man says i sitting down hard twelve thousand how will i ever who could have where did the money come from yazoo city says doc millikin i ve got a little saved up there two barrels full it looks good to these colombians twas confederate money every dollar of it now do you see why you d better leave before they try to pass some of it on an expert i do says i now let s hear you give the password says doc millikin hurrah for jeff davis says i correct says doc and let me tell you something the next tune i learn on my flute is going to be yankee doodle i reckon there s some yanks that are not so pizen or if you was me would you try the red white and blue the lonesome road brown as a coffee berry rugged pistoled spurred wary indefeasible i saw my old friend deputy marshal buck caperton stumble with jingling rowels into a chair in the marshal s outer office and because the court house was almost deserted at that hour and because buck would sometimes relate to me things that were out of print i followed him in and tricked him into talk through knowledge of a weakness he had for cigarettes rolled with sweet corn husk were as honey to buck s palate and though he could finger the trigger of a forty five with skill and suddenness he never could learn to roll a cigarette it was through no fault of mine for i rolled the cigarettes tight and smooth but the upshot of some whim of his own that instead of to an odyssey of the chaparral i listened to a dissertation upon matrimony this from buck caperton but i maintain that the cigarettes were impeccable and crave absolution for myself we just brought in jim and bud granberry said buck train robbing you know held up the aransas pass last month we caught em in the twenty mile pear flat south of the nueces have much trouble corralling them i asked for here was the meat that my hunger for epics craved some said buck and then during a little pause his thoughts stampeded off the trail it s kind of queer about women he went on and the place they re supposed to occupy in botany if i was asked to classify them i d say they was a human loco weed ever see a bronc that had been chewing loco ride him up to a puddle of water two feet wide and he ll give a snort and fall back on you it looks as big as the mississippi river to him next trip he d walk into a canon a thousand feet deep thinking it was a prairie dog hole same way with a married man i was thinking of perry rountree that used to be my sidekicker before he committed matrimony in them days me and perry hated indisturbances of any kind we roamed around considerable stirring up the echoes and making em attend to business why when me and perry wanted to have some fun in a town it was a picnic for the census takers they just counted the marshal s posse that it took to subdue us and there was your population but then there came along this mariana goodnight girl and looked at perry sideways and he was all bridle wise and saddle broke before you could skin a yearling i wasn t even asked to the wedding i reckon the bride had my pedigree and the front elevation of my habits all mapped out and she decided that perry would trot better in double harness without any unconverted mustang like buck caperton whickering around on the matrimonial range so it was six months before i saw perry again one day i was passing on the edge of town and i see something like a man in a little yard by a little house with a sprinkling pot squirting water on a rose bush seemed to me i d seen something like it before and i stopped at the gate trying to figure out its brands twas not perry rountree but twas the kind of a curdled jellyfish matrimony had made out of him homicide was what that mariana had perpetrated he was looking well enough but he had on a white collar and shoes and you could tell in a minute that he d speak polite and pay taxes and stick his little finger out while drinking just like a sheep man or a citizen great skyrockets but i hated to see perry all corrupted and willie ized like that he came out to the gate and shook hands and i says with scorn and speaking like a paroquet with the pip beg pardon mr rountree i believe seems to me i sagatiated in your associations once if i am not mistaken oh go to the devil buck says perry polite as i was afraid he d be well then says i you poor contaminated adjunct of a sprinkling pot and degraded household pet what did you go and do it for look at you all decent and unriotous and only fit to sit on juries and mend the wood house door you was a man once i have hostility for all such acts why don t you go in the house and count the tidies or set the clock and not stand out here in the atmosphere a jack rabbit might come along and bite you now buck says perry speaking mild and some sorrowful you don t understand a married man has got to be different he feels different from a tough old cloudburst like you it s sinful to waste time pulling up towns just to look at their roots and playing faro and looking upon red liquor and such restless policies as them there was a time i says and i expect i sighed when i mentioned it when a certain domesticated little mary s lamb i could name was some instructed himself in the line of pernicious sprightliness i never expected perry to see you reduced down from a full grown pestilence to such a frivolous fraction of a man why says i you ve got a necktie on and you speak a senseless kind of indoor drivel that reminds me of a storekeeper or a lady you look to me like you might tote an umbrella and wear suspenders and go home of nights the little woman says perry has made some improvements i believe you can t understand buck i haven t been away from the house at night since we was married we talked on a while me and perry and as sure as i live that man interrupted me in the middle of my talk to tell me about six tomato plants he had growing in his garden shoved his agricultural degradation right up under my nose while i was telling him about the fun we had tarring and feathering that faro dealer at california pete s layout but by and by perry shows a flicker of sense buck says he i ll have to admit that it is a little dull at times not that i m not perfectly happy with the little woman but a man seems to require some excitement now and then now i ll tell you mariana s gone visiting this afternoon and she won t be home till seven o clock neither of us ever stays out a minute after that time unless we are together now i m glad you came along buck says perry for i m feeling just like having one more rip roaring razoo with you for the sake of old times what you say to us putting in the afternoon having fun i d like it fine says perry i slapped that old captive range rider half across his little garden get your hat you old dried up alligator i shouts you ain t dead yet you re part human anyhow if you did get all bogged up in matrimony we ll take this town to pieces and see what makes it tick we ll make all kinds of profligate demands upon the science of cork pulling you ll grow horns yet old muley cow says i punching perry in the ribs if you trot around on the trail of vice with your uncle buck i ll have to be home by seven you know says perry again oh yes says i winking to myself for i knew the kind of seven o clocks perry rountree got back by after he once got to passing repartee with the bartenders we goes down to the gray mule saloon that old dobe building by the depot give it a name says i as soon as we got one hoof on the foot rest sarsaparilla says perry you could have knocked me down with a lemon peeling insult me as much as you want to i says to perry but don t startle the bartender he may have heart disease come on now your tongue got twisted the tall glasses i orders and the bottle in the left hand corner of the ice chest sarsaparilla repeats perry and then his eyes get animated and i see he s got some great scheme in his mind he wants to emit buck says he all interested i ll tell you what i want to make this a red letter day i ve been keeping close at home and i want to turn myself a loose we ll have the highest old time you ever saw we ll go in the back room here and play checkers till half past six i leaned against the bar and i says to gotch eared mike who was on watch for god s sake don t mention this you know what perry used to be he s had the fever and the doctor says we must humour him give us the checker board and the men mike says perry come on buck i m just wild to have some excitement i went in the back room with perry before we closed the door i says to mike don t ever let it straggle out from under your hat that you seen buck caperton fraternal with sarsaparilla or persona grata with a checker board or i ll make a swallow fork in your other ear i locked the door and me and perry played checkers to see that poor old humiliated piece of household bric a brac sitting there and sniggering out loud whenever he jumped a man and all obnoxious with animation when he got into my king row would have made a sheep dog sick with mortification him that was once satisfied only when he was pegging six boards at keno or giving the faro dealers nervous prostration to see him pushing them checkers about like sally louisa at a school children s party why i was all smothered up with mortification and i sits there playing the black men all sweating for fear somebody i knew would find it out and i thinks to myself some about this marrying business and how it seems to be the same kind of a game as that mrs delilah played she give her old man a hair cut and everybody knows what a man s head looks like after a woman cuts his hair and then when the pharisees came around to guy him he was so shamed that he went to work and kicked the whole house down on top of the whole outfit them married men thinks i lose all their spirit and instinct for riot and foolishness they won t drink they won t buck the tiger they won t even fight what do they want to go and stay married for i asks myself but perry seems to be having hilarity in considerable quantities buck old hoss says he isn t this just the hell roaringest time we ever had in our lives i don t know when i ve been stirred up so you see i ve been sticking pretty close to home since i married and i haven t been on a spree in a long time spree yes that s what he called it playing checkers in the back room of the gray mule i suppose it did seem to him a little more immoral and nearer to a prolonged debauch than standing over six tomato plants with a sprinkling pot every little bit perry looks at his watch and says i got to be home you know buck at seven all right i d say romp along and move this here excitement s killing me if i don t reform some and loosen up the strain of this checkered dissipation i won t have a nerve left it might have been half past six when commotions began to go on outside in the street we heard a yelling and a six shootering and a lot of galloping and manoeuvres what s that i wonders oh some nonsense outside says perry it s your move we just got time to play this game i ll just take a peep through the window says i and see you can t expect a mere mortal to stand the excitement of having a king jumped and listen to an unidentified conflict going on at the same time the gray mule saloon was one of them old spanish dobe buildings and the back room only had two little windows a foot wide with iron bars in em i looked out one and i see the cause of the rucus there was the trimble gang ten of em the worst outfit of desperadoes and horse thieves in texas coming up the street shooting right and left they was coming right straight for the gray mule then they got past the range of my sight but we heard em ride up to the front door and then they socked the place full of lead we heard the big looking glass behind the bar knocked all to pieces and the bottles crashing we could see gotch eared mike in his apron running across the plaza like a coyote with the bullets puffing up dust all around him then the gang went to work in the saloon drinking what they wanted and smashing what they didn t me and petty both knew that gang and they knew us the year before perry married him and me was in the same ranger company and we fought that outfit down on the san miguel and brought back ben trimble and two others for murder we can t get out says i we ll have to stay in here till they leave perry looked at his watch twenty five to seven says he we can finish that game i got two men on you it s your move buck i got to be home at seven you know we sat down and went on playing the trimble gang had a roughhouse for sure they were getting good and drunk they d drink a while and holler a while and then they d shoot up a few bottles and glasses two or three times they came and tried to open our door then there was some more shooting outside and i looked out the window again ham gossett the town marshal had a posse in the houses and stores across the street and was trying to bag a trimble or two through the windows i lost that game of checkers i m free in saying that i lost three kings that i might have saved if i had been corralled in a more peaceful pasture but that drivelling married man sat there and cackled when he won a man like an unintelligent hen picking up a grain of corn when the game was over perry gets up and looks at his watch i ve had a glorious time buck says he but i ll have to be going now it s a quarter to seven and i got to be home by seven you know i thought he was joking they ll clear out or be dead drunk in half an hour or an hour says i you ain t that tired of being married that you want to commit any more sudden suicide are you says i giving him the laugh one time says perry i was half an hour late getting home i met mariana on the street looking for me if you could have seen her buck but you don t understand she knows what a wild kind of a snoozer i ve been and she s afraid something will happen i ll never be late getting home again i ll say good bye to you now buck i got between him and the door married man says i i know you was christened a fool the minute the preacher tangled you up but don t you never sometimes think one little think on a human basis there s ten of that gang in there and they re pizen with whisky and desire for murder they ll drink you up like a bottle of booze before you get half way to the door be intelligent now and use at least wild hog sense sit down and wait till we have some chance to get out without being carried in baskets i got to be home by seven buck repeats this hen pecked thing of little wisdom like an unthinking poll parrot mariana says he will be out looking for me and he reaches down and pulls a leg out of the checker table i ll go through this trimble outfit says he like a cottontail through a brush corral i m not pestered any more with a desire to engage in rucuses but i got to be home by seven you lock the door after me buck and don t you forget i won three out of them five games i d play longer but mariana hush up you old locoed road runner i interrupts did you ever notice your uncle buck locking doors against trouble i m not married says i but i m as big a d n fool as any mormon one from four leaves three says i and i gathers out another leg of the table we ll get home by seven says i whether it s the heavenly one or the other may i see you home says i you sarsaparilla drinking checker playing glutton for death and destruction we opened the door easy and then stampeded for the front part of the gang was lined up at the bar part of em was passing over the drinks and two or three was peeping out the door and window and taking shots at the marshal s crowd the room was so full of smoke we got half way to the front door before they noticed us then i heard berry trimble s voice somewhere yell out how d that buck caperton get in here and he skinned the side of my neck with a bullet i reckon he felt bad over that miss for berry s the best shot south of the southern pacific railroad but the smoke in the saloon was some too thick for good shooting me and perry smashed over two of the gang with our table legs which didn t miss like the guns did and as we run out the door i grabbed a winchester from a fellow who was watching the outside and i turned and regulated the account of mr berry me and perry got out and around the corner all right i never much expected to get out but i wasn t going to be intimidated by that married man according to perry s idea checkers was the event of the day but if i am any judge of gentle recreations that little table leg parade through the gray mule saloon deserved the head lines in the bill of particulars walk fast says perry it s two minutes to seven and i got to be home by oh shut up says i i had an appointment as chief performer at an inquest at seven and i m not kicking about not keeping it i had to pass by perry s little house his mariana was standing at the gate we got there at five minutes past seven she had on a blue wrapper and her hair was pulled back smooth like little girls do when they want to look grown folksy she didn t see us till we got close for she was gazing up the other way then she backed around and saw perry and a kind of a look scooted around over her face danged if i can describe it i heard her breathe long just like a cow when you turn her calf in the lot and she says you re late perry five minutes says perry cheerful me and old buck was having a game of checkers perry introduces me to mariana and they ask me to come in no sir ee i d had enough truck with married folks for that day i says i ll be going along and that i ve spent a very pleasant afternoon with my old partner especially says i just to jostle perry during that game when the table legs came all loose but i d promised him not to let her know anything i ve been worrying over that business ever since it happened continued buck there s one thing about it that s got me all twisted up and i can t figure it out what was that i asked as i rolled and handed buck the last cigarette why i ll tell you when i saw the look that little woman gave perry when she turned round and saw him coming back to the ranch safe why was it i got the idea all in a minute that that look of hers was worth more than the whole caboodle of us sarsaparilla checkers and all and that the d n fool in the game wasn t named perry rountree at all rolling stones introduction this the twelfth and final volume of o henry s work gets its title from an early newspaper venture of which he was the head and front on april there appeared in austin texas volume number of the rolling stone with a circulation greatly in excess of that of the only two numbers that had gone before apparently the business office was encouraged the first two issues of one thousand copies each had been bought up of the third an edition of six thousand was published and distributed free so that the business men of austin texas might know what a good medium was at hand for their advertising the editor and proprietor and illustrator of the rolling stone was will porter incidentally paying and receiving teller in major brackenridge s bank perhaps the most characteristic feature of the paper was the plunkville patriot a page each week or at least with the regularity of the somewhat uncertain paper itself purporting to be reprinted from a contemporary journal the editor of the plunkville patriot was colonel aristotle jordan unrelenting enemy of his enemies when the colonel s application for the postmastership in plunkville is ignored his columns carry a bitter attack on the administration at washington with the public weal at heart the patriot announces that there is a dangerous hole in the front steps of the elite saloon here too appears the delightful literary item that mark twain and charles egbert craddock are spending the summer together in their adirondacks camp free runs its advertising column a clergyman who cured himself of fits will send one book containing popular songs one repeating rifle two decks easywinner cards and liver pad free of charge for address sucker chump augusta me the office moves nearly every week probably in accordance with the time honored principle involving the comparative ease of moving and paying rent when the colonel publishes his own candidacy for mayor he further declares that the patriot will accept no announcements for municipal offices until after our the editor s canvass adams co grocers order their ad discontinued and find later in the patriot this estimate of their product no less than three children have been poisoned by eating their canned vegetables and j o adams the senior member of the firm was run out of kansas city for adulterating codfish balls it pays to advertise here is the editorial in which the editor first announces his campaign our worthy mayor colonel henry stutty died this morning after an illness of about five minutes brought on by carrying a bouquet to mrs eli watts just as eli got in from a fishing trip ten minutes later we had dodgers out announcing our candidacy for the office we have lived in plunkville going on five years and have never been elected anything yet we understand the mayor business thoroughly and if elected some people will wish wolves had stolen them from their cradles the page from the patriot is presented with an array of perfectly confused type of artistic errors in setting up and when an occasional line gets shifted intentionally of course the effect is alarming anybody who knows the advertising of a small country weekly can as he reads pick out in the following the advertisement from the personal miss hattie green of paris ill is steel riveted seam or water power automatic oiling thoroughly tested visiting her sister mrs g w grubes little giant engines at adams co also sachet powders mc cormick reapers and oysters all of this was a part of the rolling stone which flourished or at least wavered in austin during the years and years before porter s strong instinct to write had been gratified in letters he wrote in his twenties long imaginative letters occasionally stuffed with execrable puns but more than often buoyant truly humorous keenly incisive into the unreal especially in fiction i have included a number of these letters to doctor beall of greensboro n c and to his early friend in texas mr david harrell in porter went to houston texas to work on the houston post there he conducted a column which he called postscripts some of the contents of the pages that follow have been taken from these old files in the fair hope that admirers of the matured o henry will find in them pleasurable marks of the later genius before the days of the rolling stone there are eleven years in texas over which with the exception of the letters mentioned there are few traces of literary performance but there are some very interesting drawings some of which are reproduced in this volume a story is back of them they were the illustrations to a book joe dixon prospector and inveterate fortune seeker came to austin from the rockies in at the constant urging of his old pal mr john maddox joe kept writing mr maddox your fortune s in your pen not your pick come to austin and write an account of your adventures it was hard to woo dixon from the gold that wasn t there but finally maddox wrote him he must come and try the scheme there s a boy here from north carolina wrote maddox his name is will porter and he can make the pictures he s all right dixon came the plan was that after author and artist had done their work patron would step in carry the manuscript to new york bestow it on a deserving publisher and then return to await with the other two the avalanche of royalties this version of the story comes from mr maddox there were forty pictures in all and they were very true to the life of the rockies in the seventies of course the young artist had no technique no anything except what was native but wait as the months went by dixon worked hard but he began to have doubts perhaps the book was no good perhaps john would only lose his money he was a miner not a writer and he ought not to let john go to any expense the result of this line of thought was the colorado river for the manuscript and the high road for the author the pictures fortunately were saved most of them porter gave later to mrs hagelstein of san angelo texas mr maddox by the way finding a note from joe that explained all hastened to the river and recovered a few scraps of the great book that had lodged against a sandbar but there was no putting them together again so much for the title it is a real o henry title contents of this last volume are drawn not only from letters old newspaper files and the rolling stone but from magazines and unpublished manuscripts of the short stories several were written at the very height of his powers and popularity and were lost inexplicably but lost of the poems there are a few whose authorship might have been in doubt if the compiler of this collection had not secured external evidence that made them certainly the work of o henry without this very strong evidence they might have been rejected because they were not entirely the kind of poems the readers of o henry would expect from him most of them however were found in his own indubitable manuscript or over his own signature there is extant a mass of o henry correspondence that has not been included in this collection during the better part of a decade in new york city he wrote constantly to editors and in many instances intimately this is very important material and permission has been secured to use nearly all of it in a biographical volume that will be issued within the next two or three years the letters in this volume have been chosen as an exihibit as early specimens of his writing and for their particularly characteristic turns of thought and phrase the

was the last work of o henry the cosmopolitan magazine had ordered it from him and after his death the unfinished manuscript was found in his room on his dusty desk the story as it here appears was published in the cosmopolitan for september murray dreamed a dream both psychology and science grope when they would explain to us the strange adventures of our immaterial selves when wandering in the realm of death s twin brother sleep this story will not attempt to be illuminative it is no more than a record of murray s dream one of the most puzzling phases of that strange waking sleep is that dreams which seem to cover months or even years may take place within a few seconds or minutes murray was waiting in his cell in the ward of the condemned an electric arc light in the ceiling of the corridor shone brightly upon his table on a sheet of white paper an ant crawled wildly here and there as murray blocked its way with an envelope the electrocution was set for eight o clock in the evening murray smiled at the antics of the wisest of insects there were seven other condemned men in the chamber since he had been there murray had seen three taken out to their fate one gone mad and fighting like a wolf caught in a trap one no less mad offering up a sanctimonious lip service to heaven the third a weakling collapsed and strapped to a board he wondered with what credit to himself his own heart foot and face would meet his punishment for this was his evening he thought it must be nearly eight o clock opposite his own in the two rows of cells was the cage of bonifacio the sicilian slayer of his betrothed and of two officers who came to arrest him with him murray had played checkers many a long hour each calling his move to his unseen opponent across the corridor bonifacio s great booming voice with its indestructible singing quality called out eh meestro murray how you feel all a right yes all right bonifacio said murray steadily as he allowed the ant to crawl upon the envelope and then dumped it gently on the stone floor dat s good a meestro murray men like us we must a die like a men my time come nex a week all a right remember meestro murray i beat a you dat las game of de check maybe we play again some a time i don a know maybe we have to call a de move damn a loud to play de check where dey goin send us bonifacio s hardened philosophy followed closely by his deafening musical peal of laughter warmed rather than chilled murray s numbed heart yet bonifacio had until next week to live the cell dwellers heard the familiar loud click of the steel bolts as the door at the end of the corridor was opened three men came to murray s cell and unlocked it two were prison guards the other was len no that was in the old days now the reverend leonard winston a friend and neighbor from their barefoot days i got them to let me take the prison chaplain s place he said as he gave murray s hand one short strong grip in his left hand he held a small bible with his forefinger marking a page murray smiled slightly and arranged two or three books and some penholders orderly on his small table he would have spoken but no appropriate words seemed to present themselves to his mind the prisoners had christened this cellhouse eighty feet long twenty eight feet wide limbo lane the regular guard of limbo lane an immense rough kindly man drew a pint bottle of whiskey from his pocket and offered it to murray saying it s the regular thing you know all has it who feel like they need a bracer no danger of it becoming a habit with em you see murray drank deep into the bottle that s the boy said the guard just a little nerve tonic and everything goes smooth as silk they stepped into the corridor and each one of the doomed seven knew limbo lane is a world on the outside of the world but it had learned when deprived of one or more of the five senses to make another sense supply the deficiency each one knew that it was nearly eight and that murray was to go to the chair at eight there is also in the many limbo lanes an aristocracy of crime the man who kills in the open who beats his enemy or pursuer down flushed by the primitive emotions and the ardor of combat holds in contempt the human rat the spider and the snake so of the seven condemned only three called their farewells to murray as he marched down the corridor between the two guards bonifacio marvin who had killed a guard while trying to escape from the prison and bassett the train robber who was driven to it because the express messenger wouldn t raise his hands when ordered to do so the remaining four smoldered silent in their cells no doubt feeling their social ostracism in limbo lane society more keenly than they did the memory of their less picturesque offences against the law murray wondered at his own calmness and nearly indifference in the execution room were about twenty men a congregation made up of prison officers newspaper reporters and lookers on who had succeeded here in the very middle of a sentence the hand of death interrupted the telling of o henry s last story he had planned to make this story different from his others the beginning of a new series in a style he had not previously attempted i want to show the public he said that i can write something new new for me i mean a story without slang a straightforward dramatic plot treated in a way that will come nearer my idea of real story writing before starting to write the present story he outlined briefly how he intended to develop it murray the criminal accused and convicted of the brutal murder of his sweetheart a murder prompted by jealous rage at first faces the death penalty calm and to all outward appearances indifferent to his fate as he nears the electric chair he is overcome by a revulsion of feeling he is left dazed stupefied stunned the entire scene in the death chamber the witnesses the spectators the preparations for execution become unreal to him the thought flashes through his brain that a terrible mistake is being made why is he being strapped to the chair what has he done what crime has he committed in the few moments while the straps are being adjusted a vision comes to him he dreams a dream he sees a little country cottage bright sun lit nestling in a bower of flowers a woman is there and a little child he speaks with them and finds that they are his wife his child and the cottage their home so after all it is a mistake some one has frightfully irretrievably blundered the accusation the trial the conviction the sentence to death in the electric chair all a dream he takes his wife in his arms and kisses the child yes here is happiness it was a dream then at a sign from the prison warden the fatal current is turned on murray had dreamed the wrong dream a ruler of men written at the prime of his popularity and power this characteristic and amusing story was published in everybody s magazine in august i walked the streets of the city of insolence thirsting for the sight of a stranger face for the city is a desert of familiar types as thick and alike as the grains in a sand storm and you grow to hate them as you do a friend who is always by you or one of your own kin and my desire was granted for i saw near a corner of broadway and twenty ninth street a little flaxen haired man with a face like a scaly bark hickory nut selling to a fast gathering crowd a tool that omnigeneously proclaimed itself a can opener a screw driver a button hook a nail file a shoe horn a watch guard a potato peeler and an ornament to any gentleman s key ring and then a stall fed cop shoved himself through the congregation of customers the vender plainly used to having his seasons of trade thus abruptly curtailed closed his satchel and slipped like a weasel through the opposite segment of the circle the crowd scurried aimlessly away like ants from a disturbed crumb the cop suddenly becoming oblivious of the earth and its inhabitants stood still swelling his bulk and putting his club through an intricate drill of twirls i hurried after kansas bill bowers and caught him by an arm without his looking at me or slowing his pace i found a five dollar bill crumpled neatly into my hand i wouldn t have thought kansas bill i said that you d hold an old friend that cheap then he turned his head and the hickory nut cracked into a wide smile give back the money said he or i ll have the cop after you for false pretenses i thought you was the cop i want to talk to you bill i said when did you leave oklahoma where is reddy mcgill now why are you selling those impossible contraptions on the street how did your big horn gold mine pan out how did you get so badly sunburned what will you drink a year ago answered kansas bill systematically putting up windmills in arizona for pin money to buy etceteras with salted been down in the tropics beer we foregathered in a propitious place and became elijahs while a waiter of dark plumage played the raven to perfection reminiscence needs must be had before i could steer bill into his epic mood yes said he i mind the time timoteo s rope broke on that cow s horns while the calf was chasing you you and that cow i d never forget it the tropics said i are a broad territory what part of cancer of capricorn have you been honoring with a visit down along china or peru or maybe the argentine confederacy said kansas bill anyway twas among a great race of people off colored but progressive i was there three months no doubt you are glad to be back among the truly great race i surmised especially among new yorkers the most progressive and independent citizens of any country in the world i continued with the fatuity of the provincial who has eaten the broadway lotus do you want to start an argument asked bill can there be one i answered has an irishman humor do you think asked he i have an hour or two to spare said i looking at the cafe clock not that the americans aren t a great commercial nation conceded bill but the fault laid with the people who wrote lies for fiction what was this irishman s name i asked was that last beer cold enough said he i see there is talk of further outbreaks among the russian peasants i remarked his name was barney o connor said bill thus because of our ancient prescience of each other s trail of thought we travelled ambiguously to the point where kansas bill s story began i met o connor in a boarding house on the west side he invited me to his hall room to have a drink and we became like a dog and a cat that had been raised together there he sat a tall fine handsome man with his feet against one wall and his back against the other looking over a map on the bed and sticking three feet out of it was a beautiful gold sword with tassels on it and rhinestones in the handle what s this says i for by that time we

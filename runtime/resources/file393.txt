is mr galloway still in the managing business i asked as mr magoon ceased sully shook his head denver married an auburn haired widow that owns a big hotel in harlem he just helps around the place whistling dick s christmas stocking it was with much caution that whistling dick slid back the door of the box car for article city ordinances authorized perhaps unconstitutionally arrest on suspicion

always been and never let it master us it has downed you old man you have changed from a maverick into a butterick don t see exactly what you are driving at said william i don t wear an alpaca coat with blue trousers and a seersucker vest on dress occasions like i used to do at home you talk about being cut to a pattern well ain t the pattern all right when you re in rome you ve got to do as the dagoes do this town seems to me to have other alleged metropolises skinned to flag stations according to the railroad schedule i ve got in mind chicago and saint jo and paris france are asterisk stops which means you wave a red flag and get on every other tuesday i like this little suburb of tarrytown on the hudson there s something or somebody doing all the time i m clearing a year selling automatic pumps and i m living like kings up why yesterday i was introduced to john w gates i took an auto ride with a wine agent s sister i saw two men run over by a street car and i seen edna may play in the evening talk about the west why the other night i woke everybody up in the hotel hollaring i dreamed i was walking on a board sidewalk in oshkosh what have you got against this town jack there s only one thing in it that i don t care for and that s a ferryboat the artist gazed dreamily at the cartridge paper on the wall this town said he is a leech it drains the blood of the country whoever comes to it accepts a challenge to a duel abandoning the figure of the leech it is a juggernaut a moloch a monster to which the innocence the genius and the beauty of the land must pay tribute hand to hand every newcomer must struggle with the leviathan you ve lost billy it shall never conquer me i hate it as one hates sin or pestilence or the color work in a ten cent magazine i despise its very vastness and power it has the poorest millionaires the littlest great men the lowest skyscrapers the dolefulest pleasures of any town i ever saw it has caught you old man but i will never run beside its chariot wheels it glosses itself as the chinaman glosses his collars give me the domestic finish i could stand a town ruled by wealth or one ruled by an aristocracy but this is one controlled by its lowest ingredients claiming culture it is the crudest asseverating its pre eminence it is the basest denying all outside values and virtue it is the narrowest give me the pure and the open heart of the west country i would go back there to morrow if i could don t you like this filet mignon said william shucks now what s the use to knock the town it s the greatest ever i couldn t sell one automatic pump between harrisburg and tommy o keefe s saloon in sacramento where i sell twenty here and have you seen sara bernardt in andrew mack yet the town s got you billy said jack all right said william i m going to buy a cottage on lake ronkonkoma next summer at midnight jack raised his window and sat close to it he caught his breath at what he saw though he had seen and felt it a hundred times far below and around lay the city like a ragged purple dream the irregular houses were like the broken exteriors of cliffs lining deep gulches and winding streams some were mountainous some lay in long desert ca ons such was the background of the wonderful cruel enchanting bewildering fatal great city but into this background were cut myriads of brilliant parallelograms and circles and squares through which glowed many colored lights and out of the violet and purple depths ascended like the city s soul sounds and odors and thrills that make up the civic body there arose the breath of gaiety unrestrained of love of hate of all the passions that man can know there below him lay all things good or bad that can be brought from the four corners of the earth to instruct please thrill enrich despoil elevate cast down nurture or kill thus the flavor of it came up to him and went into his blood there was a knock on his door a telegram had come for him it came from the west and these were its words come back and the answer will be yes dolly he kept the boy waiting ten minutes and then wrote the reply impossible to leave here at present then he sat at the window again and let the city put its cup of mandragora to his lips again after all it isn t a story but i wanted to know which one of the heroes won the battle against the city so i went to a very learned friend and laid the case before him what he said was please don t bother me i have christmas presents to buy so there it rests and you will have to decide for yourself what you want night had fallen on that great and beautiful city known as bagdad on the subway and with the night came the enchanted glamour that belongs not to arabia alone in different masquerade the streets bazaars and walled houses of the occidental city of romance were filled with the same kind of folk that so much interested our interesting old friend the late mr h a rashid they wore clothes eleven hundred years nearer to the latest

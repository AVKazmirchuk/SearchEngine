by way of explanation of this vast and unnecessary stationery of which this letter is composed i am always in too big a hurry to demur at kind and quality but when i get to town i will write you on small gilt edged paper that would suit even the fastidious and discriminating taste of a logan when i get to the city which will be shortly i will send you some account of this country and its inmates you are right i have almost forgotten what a regular old gum chewing ice cream destroying opera ticket vortex ivory clawing girl looks like last summer a very fair specimen of this kind ranged over about fort snell and i used to ride over twice a week on mail days and chew the end of my riding whip while she stood on the bridge and gathered up shells on the sea shore and wore the golden slippers but she has vamoosed and my ideas on the subject are again growing dim if you see anybody about to start to texas to live especially to this part if you will take your scalpyouler and sever the jugular vein cut the brachiopod artery and hamstring him after he knows what you have done for him he will rise and call you blessed this country is a silent but eloquent refutation of bob ingersoll s theory a man here gets prematurely insane melancholy and unreliable and finally dies of lead poisoning in his boots while in a good old land like greensboro a man can die as they do every day with all the benefits of the clergy w s porter austin texas april dear dave i take my pen in hand to let you know that i am well and hope these few lines will find you as well as can be expected i carried out your parting injunction of a floral nature with all the solemnity and sacredness that i would have bestowed upon a dying man s last request promptly at half past three i repaired to the robbers den commonly known as radams horticultural and vegetable emporium and secured the high priced offerings according to promise i asked if the bouquets were ready and the polite but piratical gentleman in charge pointed proudly to two objects on the counter reposing in a couple of vases and said they were i then told him i feared there was some mistake as no buttonhole bouquets had been ordered but he insisted on his former declaration and so i brought them away and sent them to their respective destinations i thought it a pity to spoil a good deck of cards by taking out only one so i bundled up the whole deck and inserted them in the bouquet but finally concluded it would not be right to violet joke my promise and i rose joke superior to such a mean trick and sent only one as directed i have a holiday to day as it is san jacinto day thermopylae had its messenger of defeat but the alamo had none mr president and fellow citizens those glorious heroes who fell for their country on the bloody field of san jacinto etc there is a bazaar to night in the representatives hall you people out in colorado don t know anything a bazaar is cedar and tacks and girls and raw cake and step ladders and

strike a good thing out west i hope we will see you soon yours as ever w s p austin texas april dear dave i received your letter in answer to mine which you never got till sometime after you had written i snatch a few moments from my arduous labors to reply the colorado has been on the biggest boom i have seen since in the pyrotechnical and not strictly grammatical language of the statesman the cruel devastating flood swept on a dreadful holocaust of swollen turbid waters surging and dashing in mad fury which have never been equalled in human history a pitiable sight was seen the morning after the flood six hundred men out of employment were seen standing on the banks of the river gazing at the rushing stream laden with debris of every description a wealthy new york banker who was present noticing the forlorn appearance of these men at once began to collect a subscription for them appealing in eloquent terms for help for these poor sufferers by the flood he collected one dollar and five horn buttons the dollar he had given himself he learned on inquiry that these men had not been at any employment in six years and all they had lost by the flood was a few fishing poles the banker put his dollar in his pocket and stepped up to the pearl saloon as you will see by this morning s paper there is to be a minstrel show next wednesday for benefit of austin grays i attended the rehearsal last night but am better this morning and the doctor thinks i will pull through with careful attention the jokes are mostly mildewed rockribbed and ancient as the sun i can give you no better idea of the tout ensemble and sine die of the affair than to state that scuddy is going to sing a song mrs harrell brought a lot of crystallized fruits from new orleans for you she wants to know if she shall send them around on bois d arc or keep them til you return answer write to your father he thinks you are leaving him out writing to everybody else first write we have the boss trick here now have sold about ten boxes of cigars betting on it in the store take four nickels and solder them together so the solder will not appear then cut out of three of them square hole like this illustration take about twelve other nickels and on top of them you lay a small die with the six up that will fit easily in the hole without being noticed you lay the four nickels over this and all presents the appearance of a stack of nickels you do all this privately so everybody will suppose it is nothing but a stack of five cent pieces you then lay another small die on top of the stack with the ace up you have a small tin cup shaped like this illustration made for the purpose you let everybody see the ace and then say you propose to turn the ace into a six you lay the tin cup carefully over the stack this way and feel around in your pocket for a pencil and not finding one the rest of this letter is lost austin texas may dear dave i received your two letters and have commenced two or three in reply but always failed to say what i wanted to and destroyed them all i heard from joe that you would probably remain in colorado i hope you will succeed in making a good thing out of it if you conclude to do so but would like to see you back again in austin if there is anything i can do for you here let me know town is fearfully dull except for the frequent raids of the servant girl annihilators who make things lively during the dead hours of the night if it were not for them items of interest would be very scarce as you may see by the statesman our serenading party has developed new and alarming modes of torture for our helpless and sleeping victims last thursday night we loaded up a small organ on a hack and with our other usual instruments made an assault upon the quiet air of midnight that made the atmosphere turn pale after going the rounds we were halted on the avenue by fritz hartkopf and ordered into his salon we went in carrying the organ etc a large crowd of bums immediately gathered prominent among which were to be seen percy james theodore hillyer randolph burmond charlie hicks and after partaking freely of lemonade we wended our way down and were duly halted and treated in the same manner by other hospitable gentlemen we were called in at several places while wit and champagne rhein wine etc flowed in a most joyous and hilarious manner it was one of the most recherche and per diem affairs ever known in the city nothing occurred to mar the pleasure of the hour except a trifling incident that might be construed as malapropos and post meridian by the hypercritical mr charles sims on attempting to introduce mr charles hicks and your humble servant to young ladies where we had been invited inside forgot our names and required to be informed on the subject before proceeding yours w s p austin texas december dear dave everything wept at your departure especially the clouds last night the clouds had a silver lining three dollars and a half s worth i fulfilled your engagement in grand tout ensemble style but there is a sad bon jour look about the thirty eight cents left in my vest pocket that would make a hired man weep all day long the heavens wept and the heavy sombre clouds went drifting about over head and the north wind howled in maniacal derision and the hack drivers danced on the pavements in wild fierce glee for they knew too well what the stormy day betokened the hack was to call for me at eight at five minutes to eight i went upstairs and dressed in my usual bijou and operatic style and rolled away to the opera emma sang finely i applauded at the wrong times and praised her rendering of the chromatic scale when she was performing on c flat andante pianissimo but otherwise the occasion passed off without anything to mar the joyousness of the hour everybody was there isidor moses and john ireland and fritz hartkopf and prof herzog and bill stacy and all the bong ton elight you will receive a draft to day through the first national bank of colorado for which you will please honor there is no news or there are no news either you like to tell lavaca street is very happy and quiet and enjoys life for jones was

faint streaks of dawn are limned in the eastern sky by the rosy fingers of aurora at noon the foul ogre cribbage stalks rampant and seven up for dim distant oysters that only the eye of faith can see the hour grows late the clock strikes another day has vanished gone into the dim recesses of the past leaving its record of misspent hours false hopes and disappointed expectations may a morrow dawn that will bring recompense and requital for the sorrows of the days gone by and a new order of things when there will be more starch in cuff and collar and less in handkerchiefs come with me out into the starlight night so calm so serene ye lights of heaven so high above earth so pure and majestic and mysterious looking down on the mad struggle of life here below is there no pity in your never closing eyes for us mortals on which you shine come with me on to the bridge ah see there far below the dark turbid stream rushing and whirling and eddying under the dark pillars with ghostly murmur and siren whisper what shall we find in your depths the stars do not reflect themselves in your waters they are too dark and troubled and swift what shall we find in your depths rest peace catfish who knows tis but a moment a leap a plunge and then oblivion or another world who can tell a man once dived into your depths and brought up a horse collar and a hoop skirt ah what do we know of the beyond we know that death comes and we return no more to our world of trouble and care but where do we go are there lands where no traveler has been a chaos perhaps where no human foot has trod perhaps

shakespeare ingomar junius brutus calliope six handed euchre grover cleveland hill city quartette johnson an early parable in one of his early letters written from austin o henry wrote a long parable that was evidently to tell his correspondent some of the local gossip here it is once upon a time there was a maiden in a land not fax away a maiden of much beauty and rare accomplishments she was beloved by all on account of her goodness of heart and her many charms of disposition her father was a great lord rich and powerful and a mighty man and he loved his daughter with exceeding great love and he cared for her with jealous and loving watchfulness lest any harm should befall her or even the least discomfort should mar her happiness and cause any trouble in her smooth and peaceful life the cunningest masters were engaged to teach her from her youngest days she played upon the harpsichord the loveliest and sweetest music she wrought fancy work in divers strange and wonderful forms that might puzzle all beholders as to what manner of things they might be she sang and all listeners hearkened thereunto as to the voice of an angel she danced stately minuets with the gay knights as graceful as a queen and as light as the thistledown borne above the clover blossoms by the wind she could paint upon china rare and unknown flowers the like unto which man never saw in colors crimson and blue and yellow glorious to behold she conversed in unknown tongues whereof no man knew the meaning and sense and created wild admiration in all by the ease and grace with which she did play upon a new and strange instrument of wondrous sound and structure which she called a banjo she had gone into a strange land far away beyond the rivers that flowed through her father s dominion farther than one could see from the highest castle tower up into the land of ice and snow where wise men famous for learning and ancient lore had gathered together from many lands and countries the daughters of great men kings and powerful rulers railroad men bankers mighty men who wished to bring up their children to be wise and versed in all things old and new here the princess abode for many seasons and she sat at the feet of old wise men who could tell of the world s birth and the stars and read the meaning of the forms of the rocks that make the high mountains and knew the history of all created things that are and here she learned to speak strange tongues and studied the deep mysteries of the past the secrets of the ancients chaldic lore etruscan inscription hidden and mystic sciences and knew the names of all the flowers and things that grow in fields or wood even unto the tiniest weed by the brook in due time the princess came back to her father s castle the big bell boomed from the high tower the heavy iron gates were thrown open banners floated all along the battlemented walls and in the grand hall servants and retainers hurried to and fro bearing gold dishes and great bowls of flaming smoking punch while oxen were roasted whole and hogsheads of ale tapped on the common by the castle walls and thither hied them the villagers one and all to make merry at the corning of the dear princess again she will come back so wise and learned they said so far above us that she will not notice us as she did once but not so the princess with a red rose in her hair and dressed so plain and neat that she looked more like a farmer s daughter than a great king s came down among them from her father s side with nods of love and welcome on her lips and a smile upon her face and took them by the hands as in the old days and none among them so lowly or so poor but what received a kind word from the gracious princess and carried away in their hearts glad feelings that she was still the same noble and gracious lady she always was then night came and torches by thousands lit up the great forest and musicians played and bonfires glowed with sparks flying like myriads of stars among the gloomy trees in the great castle hall were gathered the brave knights and the fairest ladies in the kingdom the jolly old king surrounded by the wise men and officers of state moved about among his guests stately and courteous ravishing music burst forth from all sides and down the hall moved the fair princess in the mazy dance on the arm of a knight who gazed upon her face in rapt devotion and love who was he that dared to look thus upon the daughter of the king sovereign prince of the kingdom and the heiress of her father s wealth and lands he had no title no proud name to place beside a royal one beyond that of an honorable knight but who says that that is not a title that borne worthily makes a man the peer of any that wears a crown he had loved her long when a boy they had roamed together in the great forest about the castle and played among the fountains of the court like brother and sister the king saw them together often and smiled and went his way and said nothing the years went on and they were together as much as they could be the summer days when the court went forth into the forest mounted on prancing steeds to chase the stags with hounds all clad in green and gold with waving plumes and shining silver and ribbons of gay colors this knight was by the princess side to guide her through the pathless swamps where the hunt ranged and saw that no harm came to her and now that she had come back after years of absence he went to her with fear lest she should have changed for her old self and would not be to him as she was when they were boy and girl together but no there was the same old kindly welcome the same smiling greeting the warm pressure of the hand the glad look in the eyes as of yore the knight s heart beat wildly and a dim new awakened hope arose in him was she too far away after all he felt worthy of her and of any one in fact but he was without riches only a knight errant with his sword for his fortune and his great love his only title and he had always refrained from ever telling her anything of his love for his pride prevented him and you know a poor girl even though she be a princess cannot say to a man i am rich but let that be no bar between us i am yours and will let my wealth pass if you will give up your pride no princess can say this and the knight s pride would not let him say anything of the kind and so you see there was small chance of their ever coming to an understanding well the feasting and dancing went on and the knight and the princess danced and sang together and walked out where the moon was making a white wonder of the great fountain and wandered under the rows of great oaks but spoke no word of love though no mortal man knows what thoughts passed in their heads and she gave long accounts of the wonders she had seen in the far icy north in the great school of wise men and the knight talked of the wild and savage men he had seen in the far west where he had been in battles with the heathen in a wild and dreary land and she heard with pity his tales of suffering and trials in the desert among wild animals and fierce human kings and inside the castle the music died away and the lights grew dim and the villagers had long since gone to their homes and the knight and the princess still talked of old times and the moon climbed high in the eastern sky one day there came news from a country far to the west where lay the possessions of the knight the enemy had robbed him of his treasure driven away his cattle and he found it was best to hie him away and rescue his inheritance and goods he buckled on his sword and mounted his good war horse he rode to the postern gate of the castle to make his adieus to the princess when he told her he was going away to the wild western country to do battle with the heathen she grew pale and her eyes took on a look of such pain and fear that the knight s heart leaped and then sank in his bosom a his pride still kept him from speaking the words that might have made all well she bade him farewell in a low voice and tears even stood in leer eyes but what could she say or do the knight put spurs to his horse and dashed away over the hills without ever looking back and the princess stood looking over the gate at him till the last sight of his plume below the brow of the hill the knight was gone many suitors flocked about the princess mighty lords and barons of great wealth were at her feet and attended her every journey they came and offered themselves and their fortunes again and again but none of them found favor in her eyes will the princess listen to no one they began to say among themselves has she given her heart to some one who is not among us no one could say a great and mighty physician young and of wondrous power in his art telephoned to her every night if he might come down how his suit prospered no one could tell but he persevered with great and astonishing diligence a powerful baron who assisted in regulating the finances of the kingdom and who was a direct descendant of a great prince who was cast into a lion s den knelt at her feet a gay and lively lord who lived in a castle hung with ribbons and streamers and gay devices of all kinds with other nobles of like character prostrated themselves before her but she would listen to none of them the princess rode about in quiet ways in the cool evenings upon a gray palfrey alone and very quiet and she seemed to grow silent and thoughtful as time went on and no news came from the western wars and the knight came not back again to his daughter margaret toledo ohio oct dear margaret i got your very nice long letter a good many days ago it didn t come straight to me but went to a wrong address first i was very glad indeed to hear

you bad taken him with you mrs hale is up in maine for a weeks vacation say bill i m sending your ms back by mail to day i kept it a little longer after you sent for it because one of the mcclure phillips firm wanted to see it first everybody says it is full of good stuff but thinks it should be put in a more connected shape by some skilful writer who has been trained to that sort work it seems to me that you ought to do better with it out there than you could here if you can get somebody out there to publish it it ought to sell all right n y is a pretty cold proposition and it can t see as far as the oklahoma country when it is looking for sales how about trying indianapolis or chicago duffy told me about the other ms sent out by your friend abbott kind of a bum friendly trick

next week i will be ready to meet you let me know in advance a day or two gallot is in grand rapids maybe he will run over for a day or two in haste and truly yours w s p it was hard to get o henry to take an interest in his books he was always eager to be at the undone work to be writing a new story instead of collecting old ones this letter came from north carolina it shows how much thought he gave always to titles land o the sky monday my dear colonel steger as i wired you to day i like man about town for a title but i am sending in a few others for you to look at and if any other suits you better i m agreeable here they are in preferred order the venturers transfers merry go rounds babylonica brickdust from babel babes in the jungle if none of these hit you right let me know and i ll get busy again but i think man about town is about the right thing it gives the city idea without using the old hackneyed words i am going to write you a letter in a day or so touchin on and appertainin to other matters and topics i am still improving and feeling pretty good colonel bingham has put in a new ash sifter and expects you to come down and see that it works all right all send regards to you you seem to have made quite a hit down here for a yankee salutations and good wishes yours s p this letter was found unfinished among his papers after his death his publishers had discussed many times his writing of a novel but the following letter constitutes the only record of his own opinions in the matter the date is surely or my dear mr steger my idea is to write the story of a man an individual not a type but a man who at the same time i want to represent a human nature type if such a person could exist the story will teach no lesson inculcate no moral advance no theory i want it to be something that it won t or can t be but as near as i can make it the true record of a man s thoughts his description of his mischances and adventures his true opinions of life as he has seen it and his absolutely honest deductions comments and views upon the different phases of life that he passes through i do not remember ever to have read an autobiography a biography or a piece of fiction that told the truth of course i have read stuff such as rousseau and zola and george moore and various memoirs that were supposed to be window panes in their respective breasts but mostly all of them were either liars actors or posers of course i m not trying to belittle the greatness of their literary expression all of us have to be prevaricators hypocrites and liars every day of our lives otherwise the social structure would fall into pieces the first day we must act in one another s presence just as we must wear clothes it is for the best the trouble about writing the truth has been that the writers have kept in their minds one or another or all of three thoughts that made a handicap they were trying either to do a piece of immortal literature or to shock the public or to please editors some of them succeeded in all three but they did not write the truth most autobiographies are insincere from beginning to end about the only chance for the truth to be told is in fiction it is well understood that all the truth cannot be told in print but how about nothing but the truth that s what i want to do i want the man who is telling the story to tell it not as he would to a reading public or to a confessor but something in this way suppose he were marooned on an island in mid ocean with no hope of ever being rescued and in order to pass away some of the time he should tell a story to himself embodying his adventure and experiences and opinions having a certain respect for himself let us hope he would leave out the realism that he would have no chance of selling in the market he would omit the lies and self conscious poses and would turn out to his one auditor something real and true so as truth is not to be found in history autobiography press reports nor at the bottom of an h g wells let us hope that fiction may be the means of bringing out a few grains of it the hero of the story will be a man born and raised in a somnolent little southern town his education is about a common school one but he learns afterward from reading and life i m going to try to give him a style in narrative and speech the best i ve got in the shop i m going to take him through all the main phases of life wild adventure city society something of the under world and among many characteristic planes of the phases i want him to acquire all the sophistication that experience can give him and always preserve his individual honest human view and have him tell the truth about everything it is time to say now that by the truth i don t mean the objectionable stuff that so often masquerades under the name i mean true opinions a true estimate of all things as they seem to the hero if you find a word or a suggestive line or sentence in any of my copy you cut it out and deduct it from the royalties i want this man to be a man of natural intelligence of individual character absolutely open and broad minded and show how the creator of the earth has got him in a rat trap put him here willy nilly you know the omar verse and then i want to show what he does about it there is always the eternal question from the primal source what are you going to do about it please don t think for the half of a moment that the story is going to be anything of an autobiography i have a distinct character in my mind for the part and he does not at all here the letter ends he never finished it the story of holding up a train in sixes and sevens there appears an article entitled holding up a train now the facts were given to o henry by an old and dear friend who in his wild avenging youth had actually held up trains to day he is mr al jennings of oklahoma city okla a prominent attorney he has permitted the publication of two letters o henry wrote him the first outlining the story as he thought his friend jennings ought to write it and the second announcing that with o henry s revision the manuscript had been accepted from w s porter to al jennings september st year not given but probably dear pard in regard to that article i will give you my idea of what is wanted say we take for a title the art and humor of the hold up or something like that i would suggest that in writing you assume a character we have got to respect the conventions and delusions of the public to a certain extent an article written as you would naturally write it would be regarded as a fake and an imposition remember that the traditions must be preserved wherever they will not interfere with the truth write in as simple plain and unembellished a style as you know how make your sentences short put in as much realism and as many facts as possible where you want to express an opinion or comment on the matter do it as practically and plainly as you can give it life and the vitality of facts now i will give you a sort of general synopsis of my idea of course everything is subject to your own revision and change the article we will say is written by a typical train hoister one without your education and powers of expression bouquet but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from his standpoint not from john wanamaker s yet in order to please john we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in and on the contrary do not depreciate a profession that is really only fnanciering with spurs on describe the facts and details all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his hands up in a pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see here is a rough draft of my idea begin abruptly without any philosophizing with your idea of the best times places and conditions for the hold up compare your opinions of this with those of others mention some poorly conceived attempts and failures of others giving your opinion why as far as possible refer to actual occurrences and incidents describe the manner of a hold up how many men is best where they are stationed how do they generally go into it nervous or joking or solemnly the details of stopping the train the duties of each man of the gang the behavior of the train crew and passengers here give as many brief odd and humorous incidents as you can think of your opinions on going through the passengers when is it done and when not done how is the boodle gotten at how does the express clerk generally take it anything done with the mail car under what circumstances will a train robber shoot a passenger or a train man suppose a man refuses to throw up his hands queer articles found on passengers a chance here for some imaginative work queer and laughable incidents of any kind refer whenever apropos to actual hold ups and facts concerning them of interest what could two or three brave and determined passengers do if they were to try why don t they try how long does it take to do the business does the train man ever stand in with the hold up best means of getting away how and when is the money divided how is it mostly spent best way to manoeuvre afterward how to get caught and how not to comment on the methods of officials who try to capture here s your chance to get even these ideas are some that occur to me casually you will of course have many far better i suggest that you make the article anywhere from to words get as much meat in it as you can and by the way stuff it full of western genuine slang not the eastern story paper kind get all the quaint cowboy expressions and terms of speech you can think of information is what we want clothed in the peculiar western style of the character we want to present the main idea is to be natural direct and concise i hope you will understand what i say i don t but try her a whack and send it along as soon as you can and let s see what we can do by the way mr everybody pays good prices i thought i would when i get your story put it into the shape my judgment decides upon and then send both your ms and mine to the magazine if he uses mine we ll whack up shares on the proceeds if he uses yours you get the check direct if he uses neither we are out only a few stamps sincerely your friend w s p and here is the letter telling his pard that the article had been bought by everybody s magazine this is dated pittsburg october th obviously the same year dear pard you re it i always told you you were a genius all you need is to succeed in order to make a success i enclose your letter which explains itself when you see your baby in print don t blame me if you find strange ear marks and brands on it i slashed it and cut it and added lots of stuff that never happened but i followed your facts and ideas and that is what made it valuable i ll think up some other idea for an article and we ll collaborate again some time eh i have all the work i can do and am selling it right along have averaged about per month since august st and yet i don t overwork don t think i ever will i commence about a m and generally knock off about or p m as soon as check mentioned in letter comes i ll send you your sheer of the boodle by the way please keep my nom de plume strictly to yourself i don t want any one to know just yet give my big regards to billy reason with him and try to convince him that we believe him to be pure merino and of more than average width with the kindest remembrances to yourself i remain your friend w s p at this time o henry was unknown and thought himself lucky to sell a story at any price strictly business more stories of the four million strictly business i suppose you know all about the stage and stage people you ve been touched with and by actors and you read the newspaper criticisms and the jokes in the weeklies about the rialto and the chorus girls and the long haired tragedians and i suppose that a condensed list of your ideas about the mysterious stageland would boil down to something like this leading ladies have five husbands paste diamonds and figures no better than your own madam if they weren t padded chorus girls are inseparable from peroxide panhards and pittsburg all shows walk back to new york on tan oxford and railroad ties irreproachable actresses reserve the comic landlady part for their mothers on broadway and their step aunts on the road kyrle bellew s real name is boyle o kelley the ravings of john mccullough in the phonograph were stolen from the first sale of the ellen terry memoirs joe weber is funnier than e h sothern but henry miller is getting older than he was all theatrical people on leaving the theatre at night drink champagne and eat lobsters until noon the next day after all the moving pictures have got the whole bunch pounded to a pulp now few of us know the real life of the stage people if we did the profession might be more overcrowded than it is we look askance at the players with an eye full of patronizing superiority and we go home and practise all sorts of elocution and gestures in front of our looking glasses latterly there has been much talk of the actor people in a new light it seems to have been divulged that instead of being motoring bacchanalias and diamond hungry loreleis they are businesslike folk students and ascetics with childer and homes and libraries owning real estate and conducting their private affairs in as orderly and unsensational a manner as any of us good citizens who are bound to the chariot wheels of the gas rent coal ice and wardmen whether the old or the new report of the sock and buskiners be the true one is a surmise that has no place here i offer you merely this little story of two strollers and for proof of its truth i can show you only the dark patch above the cast iron of the stage entrance door of keetor s old vaudeville theatre made there by the petulant push of gloved hands too impatient to finger the clumsy thumb latch and where i last saw cherry whisking through like a swallow into her nest on time to the minute as usual to dress for her act the vaudeville team of hart cherry was an inspiration but hart had been roaming through the eastern and western circuits for four years with a mixed up act comprising a monologue three lightning changes with songs a couple of imitations of celebrated imitators and a buck and wing dance that had drawn a glance of approval from the bass viol player in more than one house than which no performer ever received more satisfactory evidence of good work the greatest treat an actor can have is to witness the pitiful performance with which all other actors desecrate the stage in order to give himself this pleausre he will often forsake the sunniest broadway corner between thirty fourth and forty fourth to attend a matin ee offering by his less gifted brothers once during the lifetime of a minstrel joke one comes to scoff and remains to go through with that most difficult exercise of thespian muscles the audible contact of the palm of one hand against the palm of the other one afternoon bob hart presented his solvent serious well known vaudevillian face at the box office window of a rival attraction and got his d h coupon for an orchestra seat a b c and d glowed successively on the announcement spaces and passed into oblivion each plunging mr hart deeper into gloom others of the audience shrieked squirmed whistled and applauded but bob hart all the mustard and a whole show in himself sat with his face as long and his hands as far apart as a boy holding a hank of yarn for his grandmother to wind into a ball but when h came on the mustard suddenly sat up straight h was the happy alphabetical prognosticator of winona cherry in character songs and impersonations there were scarcely more than two bites to cherry but she delivered the merchandise tied with a pink cord and charged to the old man s account she first showed you a deliciously dewy and ginghamy country girl with a basket of property daisies who informed you ingenuously that there were other things to be learned at the old log school house besides cipherin and nouns especially when the teach er kept me in vanishing with a quick flirt of gingham apron strings she reappeared in considerably less than a trice as a fluffy parisienne so near does art bring the old red mill to the moulin rouge and then but you know the rest and so did bob hart but he saw somebody else he thought he saw that cherry was the only professional on the short order stage that he had seen who seemed exactly to fit the part of helen grimes in the sketch he had written and kept tucked away in the tray of his trunk of course bob hart as well as every other normal actor grocer newspaper man professor curb broker and farmer has a play tucked away somewhere they tuck em in trays of trunks trunks of trees desks haymows pigeonholes inside pockets safe deposit vaults handboxes and coal cellars waiting for mr frohman to call they belong among the fifty seven different kinds but bob hart s sketch was not destined to end in a pickle jar he called it mice will play he had kept it quiet and hidden away ever since he wrote it waiting to find a partner who fitted his conception of helen grimes and here was helen herself with all the innocent abandon the youth the sprightliness and the flawless stage art that his critical taste demanded after the act was over hart found the manager in the box office and got cherry s address at five the next afternoon he called at the musty old house in the west forties and sent up his professional card by daylight in a secular shirtwaist and plain voile skirt with her hair curbed and her sister of charity eyes winona cherry might have been playing the part of prudence wise the deacon s daughter in the great unwritten new england drama not yet entitled anything i know your act mr hart she said after she had looked over his card carefully what did you wish to see me about i saw you work last night said hart i ve written a sketch that i ve been saving up it s for two and i think you can do the other part i thought i d see you about it come in the parlor said miss cherry i ve been wishing for something of the sort i think i d like

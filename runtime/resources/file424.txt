tom without the usual extremities you always look for in a woman she says just enough in a way to convince and there is no incidental music by the orchestra i made a few illiterate requisitions upon the art of conversation at which the lady smiles friendly as if she had known me a week and then mr little bear adorns the atmosphere with the various idioms into which education can fracture the wind of speech i could see the kid s mother didn t quite place john tom but it seemed she was apprised in his dialects and she played up to his lead in the science of making three words do the work of one that kid introduced us with some footnotes and explanations that made things plainer than a week of rhetoric he danced around and punched us in the back and tried to climb john tom s leg this is john tom mamma says he he s a indian he sells medicine in a red wagon i shot him but he wasn t wild the other one s jeff he s a fakir too come on and see the camp where we live won t you mamma it is plain to see that the life of the woman is in that boy she has got him again where her arms can gather him and that s enough she s ready to do anything to please him she hesitates the eighth of a second and takes another look at these men i imagine she says to herself about john tom seems to be a gentleman if his hair don t curl and mr peters she disposes of as follows no ladies man but a man who knows a lady so we all rambled down to the camp as neighborly as coming from a wake and there she inspects the wagon and pats the place with her hand where the kid used to sleep and dabs around her eyewinkers with her handkerchief and professor binkly gives us trovatore on one strong of the banjo and is about to slide off into hamlet s monologue when one of the horses gets tangled in his rope and he must go look after him and says something about foiled again when it got dark me and john tom walked back up to the corn exchange hotel and the four of us had supper there i think the trouble started at that supper for then was when mr little bear made an intellectual balloon ascension i held on to the tablecloth and listened to him soar that redman if i could judge had the gift of information he took language and did with it all a roman can do with macaroni his vocal remarks was all embroidered over with the most scholarly verbs and prefixes and his syllables was smooth and fitted nicely to the joints of his idea i thought i d heard him talk before but i hadn t and it wasn t the size of his words but the way they come and twasn t his subjects for he spoke of common things like cathedrals and football and poems and catarrh and souls and freight rates and sculpture mrs conyers understood his accents and the elegant sounds went back and forth between em and now and then jefferson d peters would intervene a few shop worn senseless words to have the butter passed or another leg of the chicken yes john tom little bear appeared to be inveigled some in his bosom about that mrs conyers she was of the kind that pleases she had the good looks and more i ll tell you you take one of these cloak models in a big store they strike you as being on the impersonal system they are adapted for the eye what they run to is inches around and complexion and the art of fanning the delusion that the sealskin would look just as well on the lady with the warts and the pocket book now if one of them models was off duty and you took it and it would say charlie when you pressed it and sit up at the table why then you would have something similar to mrs conyers i could see how john tom could resist any inclination to hate that white squaw the lady and the kid stayed at the hotel in the morning they say they will start for home me and little bear left at eight o clock and sold indian remedy on the courthouse square till nine he leaves me and the professor to drive down to camp while he stays up town i am not enamored with that plan for it shows john tom is uneasy in his composures and that leads to firewater and sometimes to the green corn dance and costs not often does chief wish heap dough get busy with the firewater but whenever he does there is heap much doing in the lodges of the palefaces who wear blue and carry the club at half past nine professor binkly is rolled in his quilt snoring in blank verse and i am sitting by the fire listening to the frogs mr little bear slides into camp and sits down against a tree there is no symptoms of firewater jeff says he after a long time a little boy came west to hunt indians well then says i for i wasn t thinking as he was and he bagged one says john tom and twas not with a gun and he never had on a velveteen suit of clothes in his life and then i began to catch his smoke i know it says i and i ll bet you his pictures are on valentines and fool men are his game red and white you win on the red says john tom calm jeff for how many ponies do you think i could buy mrs conyers scandalous talk

pinkish haired young man saying to bud with something like anxiety in his voice as i say mr kingsbury there is something really beautiful about this night the delightful breeze and the bright stars and the clear air unite in making it wonderfully attractive yes said bud it s a nice night makes the whole world kin the burglar stepped inside the window quickly and then he took his time a burglar who respects his art always takes his time before taking anything else the house was a private residence by its boarded front door and untrimmed boston ivy the burglar knew that the mistress of it was sitting on some oceanside piazza telling a sympathetic man in a yachting cap that no one had ever understood her sensitive lonely heart he knew by the light in the third story front windows and by the lateness of the season that the master of the house had come home and would soon extinguish his light and retire for it was september of the year and of the soul in which season the house s good man comes to consider roof gardens and stenographers as vanities and to desire the return of his mate and the more durable blessings of decorum and the moral excellencies the burglar lighted a cigarette the guarded glow of the match illuminated his salient points for a moment he belonged to the third type of burglars this third type has not yet been recognized and accepted the police have made us familiar with the first and second their classification is simple the collar is the distinguishing mark when a burglar is caught who does not wear a collar he is described as a degenerate of the lowest type singularly vicious and depraved and is suspected of being the desperate criminal who stole the handcuffs out of patrolman hennessy s pocket in and walked away to escape arrest the other well known type is the burglar who wears a collar he is always referred to as a raffles in real life he is invariably a gentleman by daylight breakfasting in a dress suit and posing as a paperhanger while after dark he plies his nefarious occupation of burglary his mother is an extremely wealthy and respected resident of ocean grove and when he is conducted to his cell he asks at once for a nail file and the police gazette he always has a wife in every state in the union and fiancees in all the territories and the newspapers print his matrimonial gallery out of their stock of cuts of the ladies who were cured by only one bottle after having been given up by five doctors experiencing great relief after the first dose the burglar wore a blue sweater he was neither a raffles nor one of the chefs from hell s kitchen the police would have been baffled had they attempted to classify him they have not yet heard of the respectable unassuming burglar who is neither above nor below his station this burglar of the third class began to prowl he wore no masks dark lanterns or gum shoes he carried a calibre revolver in his pocket and he chewed peppermint gum thoughtfully the furniture of the house was swathed in its summer dust protectors the silver was far away in safe deposit vaults the burglar expected no remarkable haul his objective point was that dimly lighted room where the master of the house should be sleeping heavily after whatever solace he had sought to lighten the burden of his loneliness a touch might be made there to the extent of legitimate fair professional profits loose money a watch a jewelled stick pin nothing exorbitant or beyond rea son he had seen the window left open and had taken the chance the burglar softly opened the door of the lighted room the gas was turned low a man lay in the bed asleep on the dresser lay many things in confusion a crumpled roll of bills a watch keys three poker chips crushed cigars a pink silk hair bow and an unopened bottle of bromo seltzer for a bulwark in the morning the burglar took three steps toward the dresser the man in the bed suddenly uttered a squeaky groan and opened his eyes his right hand slid under his pillow but remained there lay still said the burglar in conversational tone burglars of the third type do not hiss the citizen in the bed looked at the round end of the burglar s pistol and lay still now hold up both your hands commanded the burglar the citizen had a little pointed brown and gray beard like that of a painless dentist he looked solid esteemed irritable and disgusted he sat up in bed and raised his right hand above his head up with the other one ordered the burglar you might be amphibious and shoot with your left you can count two can t you hurry up now can t raise the other one said the citizen with a contortion of his lineaments what s the matter with it rheumatism in the shoulder inflammatory was the inflammation has gone down the burglar stood for a moment or two holding his gun on the afflicted one he glanced at the plunder on the dresser and then with a half embarrassed air back at the man in the bed then he too made a sudden grimace don t stand there making faces snapped the citizen bad humouredly if you ve come to burgle why don t you do it there s some stuff lying around scuse me said the burglar with a grin but it just socked me one too it s good for you that rheumatism and me happens to be old pals i got it in my left arm too most anybody but me would have popped you when you wouldn t hoist that left claw of yours how long have you

we had gone there and bought rattling outfits of good clothes and were resting from our labours among the nabobs we must have been killed in that mesquite thicket for i can make an affidavit that we didn t surrender now i propose to tell why it is easy to hold up a train and then why no one should ever do it in the first place the attacking party has all the advantage that is of course supposing that they are old timers with the necessary experience and courage they have the outside and are protected by the darkness while the others are in the light hemmed into a small space and exposed the moment they show a head at a window or door to the aim of a man who is a dead shot and who won t hesitate to shoot but in my opinion the main condition that makes train robbing easy is the element of surprise in connection with the imagination of the passengers if you have ever seen a horse that has eaten loco weed you will understand what i mean when i say that the passengers get locoed that horse gets the awfullest imagination on him in the world you can t coax him to cross a little branch stream two feet wide it looks as big to him as the mississippi river that s just the way with the passenger he thinks there are a hundred men yelling and shooting outside when maybe there are only two or three and the muzzle of a forty five looks like the entrance to a tunnel the passenger is all right although he may do mean little tricks like hiding a wad of money in his shoe and forgetting to dig up until you jostle his ribs some with the end of your six shooter but there s no harm in him as to the train crew we never had any more trouble with them than if they had been so many sheep i don t mean that they are cowards i mean that they have got sense they know they re not up against a bluff it s the same way with the officers i ve seen secret service men marshals and railroad detectives fork over their change as meek as moses i saw one of the bravest marshals i ever knew hide his gun under his seat and dig up along with the rest while i was taking toll he wasn t afraid he simply knew that we had the drop on the whole outfit besides many of those officers have families and they feel that they oughtn t to take chances whereas death has no terrors for the man who holds up a train he expects to get killed some day and he generally does my advice to you if you should ever be in a hold up is to line up with the cowards and save your bravery for an occasion when it may be of some benefit to you another reason why officers are backward about mixing things with a train robber is a financial one every time there is a scrimmage and somebody gets killed the officers lose money if the train robber gets away they swear out a warrant against john doe et al and travel hundreds of miles and sign vouchers for thousands on the trail of the fugitives and the government foots the bills so with them it is a question of mileage rather than courage i will give one instance to support my statement that the surprise is the best card in playing for a hold up along in the daltons were cutting out a hot trail for the officers down in the cherokee nation those were their lucky days and they got so reckless and sandy that they used to announce before hand what job they were going to undertake once they gave it out that they were going to hold up the m k t flyer on a certain night at the station of pryor creek in indian territory that night the railroad company got fifteen deputy marshals in muscogee and put them on the train beside them they had fifty armed men hid in the depot at pryor creek when the katy flyer pulled in not a dalton showed up the next station was adair six miles away when the train reached there and the deputies were having a good time explaining what they would have done to the dalton gang if they had turned up all at once it sounded like an army firing outside the conductor and brakeman came running into the car yelling train robbers some of those deputies lit out of the door hit the ground and kept on running some of them hid their winchesters under the seats two of them made a fight and were both killed it took the daltons just ten minutes to capture the train and whip the escort in twenty minutes more they robbed the express car of twenty seven thousand dollars and made a clean get away my opinion is that those deputies would have put up a stiff fight at pryor creek where they were expecting trouble but they were taken by surprise and locoed at adair just as the daltons who knew their business expected they would i don t think i ought to close without giving some deductions from my experience of eight years on the dodge it doesn t pay to rob trains leaving out the question of right and morals which i don t think i ought to tackle there is very little to envy in the life of an outlaw after a while money ceases to have any value in his eyes he gets to looking upon the railroads and express companies as his bankers and his six shooter as a cheque book good for any amount he throws away money right and left most of

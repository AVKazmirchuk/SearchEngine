sentiments existing between jimmy and the frog cannot be exactly determined the capability of the horned frog for lasting affection is a subject upon which we have had no symposiums it is easier to guess jimmy s feelings muriel was his chef d oeuvre of wit and as such he cherished her he caught flies for her and shielded her from sudden northers yet his care was half selfish and when the time came she repaid him a thousand fold other muriels have thus overbalanced the light attentions of other jimmies not at once did jimmy hayes attain full brotherhood with his comrades they loved him for his simplicity and drollness but there hung above him a great sword of suspended judgment to make merry in camp is not all of a ranger s life there are horse thieves to trail desperate criminals to run down bravos to battle with bandits to rout out of the chaparral peace and order to be compelled at the muzzle of a six shooter jimmy had been most generally a cow puncher he said he was inexperienced in ranger methods of warfare therefore the rangers speculated apart and solemnly as to how he would stand fire for let it be known the honour and pride of each ranger company is the individual bravery of its members for two months the border was quiet the rangers lolled listless in camp and then bringing joy to the rusting guardians of the frontier sebastiano saldar an eminent mexican desperado and cattle thief crossed the rio grande with his gang and began to lay waste the texas side there were indications that jimmy hayes would soon have the opportunity to show his mettle the rangers patrolled with alacrity but saldar s men were mounted like lochinvar and were hard to catch one evening about sundown the rangers halted for supper after a long ride their horses stood panting with their saddles on the men were frying bacon and boiling coffee suddenly out of the brush sebastiano saldar and his gang dashed upon them with blazing six shooters and high voiced yells it was a neat surprise the rangers swore in annoyed tones and got their winchesters busy but the attack was only a spectacular dash of the purest mexican type after the florid demonstration the raiders galloped away yelling down the river the rangers mounted and pursued but in less than two miles the fagged ponies laboured so that lieutenant manning gave the word to abandon the chase and return to the camp then it was discovered that jimmy hayes was missing some one remembered having seen him run for his pony when the attack began but no one had set eyes on him since morning came but no jimmy they searched the country around on the theory that he had been killed or wounded but without success then they followed after saldar s gang but it seemed to have disappeared manning concluded that the wily mexican had recrossed the river after his theatric farewell and indeed no further depredations f rom him were reported this gave the rangers time to nurse a soreness they had as has been said the pride and honour of the company is the individual bravery of its members and now they believed that jimmy hayes had turned coward at the whiz of mexican bullets there was no other deduction buck davis pointed out that not a shot was fired by saldar s gang after jimmy was seen running for his horse there was no way for him to have been shot no he had fled from his first fight and afterward he would not return aware that the scorn of his comrades would be a worse thing to face than the muzzles of many rifles so manning s detachment of mclean s company frontier battalion was gloomy it was the first blot on its escutcheon never before in the history of the service had a ranger shown the white feather all of them had liked jimmy hayes and that made it worse days weeks and months went by and still that little cloud of unforgotten cowardice hung above the camp iii nearly a year afterward after many camping grounds and many hundreds of miles guarded and defended lieutenant manning with almost the same detachment of men was sent to a point only a few miles below their old camp on the river to look after some smuggling there one afternoon while they were riding through a dense mesquite flat they came upon a patch of open hog wallow prairie there they rode upon the scene of an unwritten tragedy in a big hog wallow lay the skeletons of three mexicans their clothing alone served to identify them the largest of the figures had once been sebastiano saldar his great costly sombrero heavy with gold ornamentation a hat famous all along the rio grande lay there pierced by three bullets along the ridge of the hog wallow rested the rusting winchesters of the mexicans all pointing in the same direction the rangers rode in that direction for fifty yards there in a little depression of the ground with his rifle still bearing upon the three lay another skeleton it had been a battle of extermination there was nothing to identify the solitary defender his clothing such as the elements had left distinguishable seemed to be of the kind that any ranchman or cowboy might have worn some cow puncher said manning that they caught out alone good boy he put up a dandy scrap before they got him so that s why we didn t hear from don sebastiano any more and then from beneath the weather beaten rags of the dead man there wriggled out a horned frog with a faded red ribbon around its neck and sat upon the shoulder of its long quiet master mutely it told the story of the untried youth and the swift paint pony how they

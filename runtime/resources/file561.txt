iron wrist of porthos that we have to fear it is the gascon s fury the wild and unacademic attack of the troubadour the sword of d artagnan i done it said sam i went over to frio city to do it i couldn t let him put the skibunk on you uncle ben i met him in summers s saloon i knowed what to do i said a few things to him that nobody else heard he reached for his gun first half a dozen fellows saw him do it but i got mine unlimbered first three doses i gave him right around the lungs and a saucer could have covered up all of em he won t bother you no more this is king james you speak of asked old man ellison while he sipped his coffee you bet it was and they took me before the county judge and the witnesses what saw him draw his gun first was all there well of course they put me under bond to appear before the court but there was four or five boys on the spot ready to sign the bail he won t bother you no more uncle ben you ought to have seen how close them bullet holes was together i reckon playing a guitar as much as i do must kind of limber a fellow s trigger finger up a little don t you think uncle ben then there was a little silence in the castle except for the spluttering of a venison steak that the kiowa was cooking sam said old man ellison stroking his white whiskers with a tremulous hand would you mind getting the guitar and playing that huile huile palomita piece once or twice it always seems to be kind of soothing and comforting when a man s tired and fagged out there is no more to be said except that the title of the story is wrong it should have been called the last of the barons there never will be an end to the troubadours and now and then it does seem that the jingle of their guitars will drown the sound of the muffled blows of the pickaxes and trip hammers of all the workers in the world the sleuths in the big city a man will disappear with the suddenness and completeness of the flame of a candle that is blown out all the agencies of inquisition the hounds of the trail the sleuths of the city s labyrinths the closet detectives of theory and induction will be invoked to the search most often the man s face will be seen no more sometimes he will reappear in sheboygan or in the wilds of terre haute calling himself one of the synonyms of smith and without memory of events up to a certain time including his grocer s bill sometimes it will be found after dragging the rivers and polling the restaurants to see if he may be waiting for a well done sirloin that he has moved next door this snuffing out of a human being like the erasure of a chalk man from a blackboard is one of the most impressive themes in dramaturgy the case of mary snyder in point should not be without interest a man of middle age of the name of meeks came from the west to new york to find his sister mrs mary snyder a widow aged fifty two who had been living for a year in a tenement house in a crowded neighbourhood at her address he was told that mary snyder had moved away longer than a month before no one could tell him her new address on coming out mr meeks addressed a policeman who was standing on the corner and explained his dilemma my sister is very poor he said and i am anxious to find her i have recently made quite a lot of money in a lead mine and i want her to share my prosperity there is no use in advertising her because she cannot read the policeman pulled his moustache and looked so thoughtful and mighty that meeks could almost feel the joyful tears of his sister mary dropping upon his bright blue tie you go down in the canal street neighbourhood said the policeman and get a job drivin the biggest dray you can find there s old women always gettin knocked over by drays down there you might see er among em if you don t want to do that you better go round to headquarters and get em to put a fly cop onto the dame at police headquarters meeks received ready assistance a general alarm was sent out and copies of a photograph of mary snyder that her brother had were distributed among the stations in mulberry street the chief assigned detective mullins to the case the detective took meeks aside and said this is not a very difficult case to unravel shave off your whiskers fill your pockets with good cigars and meet me in the cafe of the waldorf at three o clock this afternoon meeks obeyed he found mullins there they had a bottle of wine while the detective asked questions concerning the missing woman now said mullins new york is a big city but we ve got the detective business systematized there are two ways we can go about finding your sister we will try one of em first you say she s fifty two a little past said meeks the detective conducted the westerner to a branch advertising office of one of the largest dailies there he wrote the following ad and submitted it to meeks wanted at once one hundred attractive chorus girls for a new musical comedy apply all day at no broadway meeks was indignant my sister said he is a poor hard working elderly woman i do not see what aid an advertisement of this kind would be toward

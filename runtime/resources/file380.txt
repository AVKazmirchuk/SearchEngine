have lived that intervening score of years in a twelve month there was about her yet an aurum of indignant unappeased protesting youth that shone faintly through the premature veil of unearned decline i beg your pardon ma am said the commissioner gaining his feet to the accompaniment of a great creaking and sliding of his chair are you the governor sir asked the vision of melancholy the commissioner hesitated at the end of his best bow with his hand in the bosom of his double breasted frock truth at last conquered well no ma am i am not the governor i have the honour to be commissioner of insurance statistics and history is there anything ma am i can do for you won t you have a chair ma am the lady subsided into the chair handed her probably from purely physical reasons she wielded a cheap fan last token of gentility to be abandoned her clothing seemed to indicate a reduction almost to extreme poverty she looked at the man who was not the governor and saw kindliness and simplicity and a rugged unadorned courtliness emanating from a countenance tanned and toughened by forty years of outdoor life also she saw that his eyes were clear and strong and blue just so they had been when he used them to skim the horizon for raiding kiowas and sioux his mouth was as set and firm as it had been on that day when he bearded the old lion sam houston himself and defied him during that season when secession was the theme now in bearing and dress luke coonrod sandifer endeavoured to do credit to the important arts and sciences of insurance statistics and history he had abandoned the careless dress of his country home now his broad brimmed black slouch hat and his long tailed frock made him not the least imposing of the official family even if his office was reckoned to stand at the tail of the list you wanted to see the governor ma am asked the commissioner with a deferential manner he always used toward the fair sex i hardly know said the lady hesitatingly i suppose so and then suddenly drawn by the sympathetic look of the other she poured forth the story of her need it was a story so common that the public has come to look at its monotony instead of its pity the old tale of an unhappy married life made so by a brutal conscienceless husband a robber a spendthrift a moral coward and a bully who failed to provide even the means of the barest existence yes he had come down in the scale so low as to strike her it happened only the day before there was the bruise on one temple she had offended his highness by asking for a little money to live on and yet she must needs woman like append a plea for her tyrant he was drinking he had rarely abused her thus when sober i thought mourned this pale sister of sorrow that maybe the state might be willing to give me some relief i ve heard of such things being done for the families of old settlers i ve heard tell that the state used to give land to the men who fought for it against mexico and settled up the country and helped drive out the indians my father did all of that and he never received anything he never would take it i thought the governor would be the one to see and that s why i came if father was entitled to anything they might let it come to me it s possible ma am said standifer that such might be the case but most all the veterans and settlers got their land certificates issued and located long ago still we can look that up in the land office and be sure your father s name now was amos colvin sir good lord exclaimed standifer rising and unbuttoning his tight coat excitedly are you amos colvin s daughter why ma am amos colvin and me were thicker than two hoss thieves for more than ten years we fought kiowas drove cattle and rangered side by side nearly all over texas i remember seeing you once before now you were a kid about seven a riding a little yellow pony up and down amos and me stopped at your home for a little grub when we were trailing that band of mexican cattle thieves down through karnes and bee great tarantulas and you re amos colvin s little girl did you ever hear your father mention luke standifer just kind of casually as if he d met me once or twice a little pale smile flitted across the lady s white face it seems to me she said that i don t remember hearing him talk about much else every day there was some story he had to tell about what he and you had done mighty near the last thing i heard him tell was about the time when the indians wounded him and you crawled out to him through the grass with a canteen of water while they yes yes well oh that wasn t anything said standifer hemming loudly and buttoning his coat again briskly and now ma am who was the infernal skunk i beg your pardon ma am who was the gentleman you married benton sharp the commissioner plumped down again into his chair with a groan this gentle sad little woman in the rusty black gown the daughter of his oldest friend the wife of benton sharp benton sharp one of the most noted bad men in that part of the state a man who had been a cattle thief an outlaw a desperado and was now a gambler a swaggering bully who plied his

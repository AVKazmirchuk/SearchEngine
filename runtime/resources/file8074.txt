arthur or portsmouth but old jack wasn t working for the furniture and glass factories that night he sat down quiet and sang ramble in a half hearted way his feelings had been hurt so the twenty told me because his offer to the church had been refused but the wassail went on and brady himself couldn t have hammered the thirst mob into a better imitation of the real penchant for the stuff that you screw out of a bottle with a napkin old jack paid the twenty above me for a round leaving me on the outside of his roll he laid the roll on the table and sent for the proprietor mike says he here s money that the good people have refused will it buy of your wares in the name of the devil they say it s tainted i will says mike and i ll put it in the drawer next to the bills that was paid to the parson s daughter for kisses at the church fair to build a new parsonage for the parson s daughter to live in at o clock when the hod carriers were making ready to close up the front and keep the inside open a woman slips in the door of the restaurant and comes up to old jack s table you ve seen the kind black shawl creepy hair ragged skirt white face eyes a cross between gabriel s and a sick kitten s the kind of woman that s always on the lookout for an automobile or the mendicancy squad and she stands there without a word and looks at the money old jack gets up peels me off the roll and hands me to her with a bow madam says he just like actors i ve heard here is a tainted bill i am a gambler this bill came to me to night from a gentleman s son where he got it i do not know if you will do me the favor to accept it it is yours the woman took me with a trembling hand sir said she i counted thousands of this issue of bills into packages when they were virgin from the presses i was a clerk in the treasury department there was an official to whom i owed my position you say they are tainted now if you only knew but i won t say any more thank you with all my heart sir thank you thank you where do you suppose that woman carried me almost at a run to a bakery away from old jack and a sizzling good time to a bakery and i get changed and she does a sheridan twenty miles away with a dozen rolls and a section of jelly cake as big as a turbine water wheel of course i lost sight of her then for i was snowed up in the bakery wondering whether i d get changed at the drug store

the change for me in a bakery last saturday night yep says the solitaire in his free and easy style how did the deal turn out i asked she blew e for mills and round steak says the one spot she kept me

there this note is a legal tender at its face value for all debts public and private this talk about tainted money makes me tired says i elsie in new york no bumptious reader this story is not a continuation of the elsie series but if your elsie had lived over here in our big city there might have been a chapter in her books not very different from this especially for the vagrant feet of youth are the roads of manhattan beset with pitfall and with gin but the civic guardians of the young have made themselves acquainted with the snares of the wicked and most of the dangerous paths are patrolled by their agents who seek to turn straying ones away from the peril that menaces them and this will tell you how they guided my elsie safely through all peril to the goal that she was seeking elsie s father had been a cutter for fox otter cloaks and furs on lower broadway he was an old man with a slow and limping gait so a pot hunter of a newly licensed chauffeur ran him down one day when livelier game was scarce they took the old man home where he lay on his bed for a year and then died leaving in cash and a letter from mr otter offering to do anything he could to help his faithful old employee the old cutter regarded this letter as a valuable legacy to his daughter and he put it into her hands with pride as the shears of the dread cleaner and repairer snipped off his thread of life that was the landlord s cue and forth he came and did his part in the great eviction scene there was no snowstorm ready for elsie to steal out into drawing her little red woollen shawl about her shoulders but she went out regardless of the unities and as for the red shawl back to blaney with it elsie s fall tan coat was cheap but it had the style and fit of the best at fox otter s and her lucky stars had given her good looks and eyes as blue and innocent as the new shade of note paper and she had left of the and the letter from mr otter keep your eye on the letter from mr otter that is the clue i desire that everything be made plain as we go detective stories are so plentiful now that they do not sell and so we find elsie thus equipped starting out in the world to seek her fortune one trouble about the letter from mr otter was that it did not bear the new address of the firm which had moved about a month before but elsie thought she could find it she had heard that policemen when politely addressed or thumbscrewed by an investigation committee will give up information and addresses so she boarded a downtown car at one hundred and seventy seventh street and rode south to forty second which she thought must surely be the end of the island there she stood against the wall undecided for the city s roar and dash was new to her up where she had lived was rural new york so far out that the milkmen awaken you in the morning by the squeaking of pumps instead of the rattling of cans a kind faced sunburned young man in a soft brimmed hat went past elsie into the grand central depot that was hank ross of the sunflower ranch in idaho on his way home from a visit to the east hank s heart was heavy for the sunflower ranch was a lonesome place lacking the presence of a woman he had hoped to find one during his visit who would congenially share his prosperity and home but the girls of gotham had not pleased his fancy but as he passed in he noted with a jumping of his pulses the sweet ingenuous face of elsie and her pose of doubt and loneliness with true and honest western impulse he said to himself that here was his mate he could love her he knew and he would surround her with so much comfort and cherish her so carefully that she would be happy and make two sunflowers grow on the ranch where there grew but one before hank turned and went back to her backed by his never before questioned honesty of purpose he approached the girl and removed his soft brimmed hat elsie had but time to sum up his handsome frank face with one shy look of modest admiration when a burly cop hurled himself upon the ranchman seized him by the collar and backed him against the wall two blocks away a burglar was coming out of an apartment house with a bag of silverware on his shoulder but that is neither here nor there carry on yez mashin tricks right before me eyes will yez shouted the cop i ll teach yez to speak to ladies on me beat that ye re not acquainted with come along elsie turned away with a sigh as the ranchman was dragged away she had liked the effect of his light blue eyes against his tanned complexion she walked southward thinking herself already in the district where her father used to work and hoping to find some one who could direct her to the firm of fox otter but did she want to find mr otter she had inherited much of the old cutter s independence how much better it would be if she could find work and support herself without calling on him for aid elsie saw a sign employment agency and went in many girls were sitting against the wall in chairs several well dressed ladies were looking them over one white haired kind faced old lady in rustling black silk hurried up to elsie my dear she said in a sweet gentle voice are you looking for a position i like your face and appearance so much i want a young woman who will be half maid and half companion to me you will have a good home and i will pay you a month before elsie could stammer forth her gratified acceptance a young woman with gold glasses on her bony nose and her hands in her jacket pockets seized her arm and drew her aside i am miss ticklebaum said she of the association for the prevention of jobs being put up on working girls looking for jobs we prevented forty seven girls from securing positions last week i am here to protect you beware of any one who offers you a job how do you know that this woman does not want to make you work as a breaker boy in a coal mine or murder you to get your teeth if you accept work of any kind without permission of our association you will be arrested by one of our agents but what am i to do asked elsie i have no home or money i must do something why am i not allowed to accept this kind lady s offer i do not know said miss ticklebaum that is the affair of our committee on the abolishment of employers it is my duty simply to see that you do not get work you will give me your name and address and report to our secretary every thursday we have girls on the waiting list who will in time be allowed to accept positions as vacancies occur on our roll of qualified employers which now comprises twenty seven names there is prayer music and lemonade in our chapel the third sunday of every month elsie hurried away after thanking miss ticklebaum for her timely warning and advice after all it seemed that she must try to find mr otter but after walking a few blocks she saw a sign cashier wanted in the window of a confectionery store in she went and applied for the place after casting a quick glance over her shoulder to assure herself that the job preventer was not on her trail the proprietor of the confectionery was a benevolent old man with a peppermint flavor who decided after questioning elsie pretty closely that she was the very girl he wanted her services were needed at once so elsie with a thankful heart drew off her tan coat and prepared to mount the cashier s stool but before she could do so a gaunt lady wearing steel spectacles and black mittens stood before her with a long finger pointing and exclaimed young woman hesitate elsie hesitated do you know said the black and steel lady that in accepting this position you may this day cause the loss of a hundred lives in agonizing physical torture and the sending as many souls to perdition why no said elsie in frightened tones how could i do that ruin said the lady the demon rum do you know why so many lives are lost when a theatre catches fire brandy balls the demon rum lurking in brandy balls our society women while in theatres sit grossly intoxicated from eating these candies filled with brandy when the fire fiend sweeps down upon them they are unable to escape the candy stores are the devil s distilleries if you assist in the distribution of these insidious confections you assist in the destruction of the bodies and souls of your fellow beings and in the filling of our jails asylums and almshouses think girl ere you touch the money for which brandy balls are sold dear me said elsie bewildered i didn t know there was rum in brandy balls but i must live by some means what shall i do decline the position said the lady and come with me i will tell you what to do after elsie had told the confectioner that she had changed her mind about the cashiership she put on her coat and followed the lady to the sidewalk where awaited an elegant victoria seek some other work said the black and steel lady and assist in crushing the hydra headed demon rum and she got into the victoria and drove away i guess that puts it up to mr otter again said elsie ruefully turning down the street and i m sorry too for i d much rather make my way without help near fourteenth street elsie saw a placard tacked on the side of a doorway that read fifty girls neat sewers wanted immediately on theatrical costumes good pay she was about to enter when a solemn man dressed all in black laid his hand on her arm my dear girl he said i entreat you not to enter that dressing room of the devil goodness me exclaimed elsie with some impatience the devil seems to have a cinch on all the business in new york what s wrong about the place it is here said the solemn man that the regalia of satan in other words the costumes worn on the stage are manufactured the stage is the road to ruin and destruction would you imperil your soul by lending the work of your hands to its support do you know my dear girl what the theatre leads to do you know where actors and actresses go after the curtain of the playhouse has fallen upon them for the last time sure said elsie into vaudeville but do you think it would be wicked for me to make a little money to live on by sewing i must get something to do pretty soon the flesh pots of egypt exclaimed the reverend gentleman uplifting his hands i beseech you my child to turn away from this place of sin and iniquity but what will i do for a living asked elsie i don t care to sew for this musical comedy if it s as rank as you say it is but i ve got to have a job the lord will provide said the solemn man there is a free bible class every sunday afternoon in the basement of the cigar store next to the church peace be with you amen farewell elsie went on her way she was soon in the downtown district where factories abound on a large brick building was a gilt sign posey trimmer artificial flowers below it was hung a newly stretched canvas hearing the words five hundred girls wanted to learn trade good wages from the start apply one flight up elsie started toward the door near which were gathered in groups some twenty or thirty girls one big girl with a black straw hat tipped down over her eyes stepped in front of her say you se said the girl are you se goin in there after a job yes said elsie i must have work now don t do it said the girl i m chairman of our scab committee there s of us girls locked out just because we demanded cents a week raise in wages and ice water and for the foreman to shave off his mustache you re too nice a looking girl to be a scab wouldn t you please help us along by trying to find a job somewhere else or would you se rather have your face pushed in i ll try somewhere else said elsie she walked aimlessly eastward on broadway and there her heart leaped to see the sign fox otter stretching entirely across the front of a tall building it was as though an unseen guide had led her to it through the by ways of her fruitless search for work she hurried into the store and sent in to mr otter by a clerk her name and the letter he had written her father she was shown directly into his private office mr otter arose from his desk as elsie entered and took both hands with a hearty smile of welcome he was a slightly corpulent man of nearly middle age a little bald gold spectacled polite well dressed radiating well well and so this is beatty s little daughter your father was one of our most efficient and valued employees he left nothing well well i hope we have not forgotten his faithful services i am sure there is a vacancy now among our models oh it is easy work nothing easier mr otter struck a bell a long nosed clerk thrust a portion of himself inside the door send miss hawkins in said mr otter miss hawkins came miss hawkins said mr otter bring for miss beatty to try on one of those russian sable coats and let s see one of those latest model black tulle hats with white tips elsie stood before the full length mirror with pink cheeks and quick breath her eyes shone like faint stars she was beautiful alas she was beautiful i wish i could stop this story here confound it i will no it s got to run it out i didn t make it up i m just repeating it i d like to throw bouquets at the wise cop and the lady who rescues girls from jobs and the prohibitionist who is trying to crush brandy balls and the sky pilot who objects to costumes for stage people there are others and all the thousands of good people who are at work protecting young people from the pitfalls of a great city and then wind up by pointing out how they were the means of elsie reaching her father s benefactor and her kind friend and rescuer from poverty this would make a fine elsie story of the old sort i d like to do this but there s just a word or two to follow while elsie was admiring herself in the mirror mr otter went to the telephone booth and called up some number don t ask me what it was oscar said he i want you to reserve the same table for me this evening what why the one in the moorish room to the left of the shrubbery yes two yes the usual brand and the johannisburger with the roast if it isn t the right temperature i ll break your neck no not her no indeed a new one a peacherino oscar a peacherino tired and tiresome reader i will conclude if you please with a paraphrase of a few words that you will remember were written by him by him of gad s hill before whom if you doff not your hat you shall stand with a covered pumpkin aye sir a pumpkin lost your excellency lost associations and societies lost right reverends and wrong reverends of every order lost reformers and lawmakers born with heavenly compassion in your hearts but with the reverence of money in your souls and lost thus around us every day the voice of the city the voice of the city twenty five years ago the school children used to chant their lessons the manner of their delivery was a singsong recitative between the utterance of an episcopal minister and the drone of a tired sawmill i mean no disrespect we must have lumber and sawdust i remember one beautiful and instructive little lyric that emanated from the physiology class the most striking line of it was this the shin bone is the long est bone in the hu man bod y what an inestimable boon it would have been if all the corporeal and spiritual facts pertaining to man bad thus been tunefully and logically inculcated in our youthful minds but what we gained in anatomy music and philosophy was meagre the other day i became confused i needed a ray of light i turned back to those school days for aid but in all the nasal harmonies we whined forth from those bard benches i could not recall one that treated of the voice of agglomerated mankind in other words of the composite vocal message of massed humanity in other words of the voice of a big city now the individual voice is not lacking we can understand the song of the poet the ripple of the brook the meaning of the man who wants until next monday the inscriptions on the tombs of the pharaohs the language of flowers the step lively of the conductor and the prelude of the milk cans at a m certain large eared ones even assert that they are wise to the vibrations of the tympanum pro need by concussion of the air emanating from mr h james but who can comprehend the meaning of the voice of the city i went out for to see first i asked aurelia she wore white swiss and a bat with flowers on it and ribbons and ends of things fluttered here and there tell me i said stammeringly for i have no voice of my own what does this big er enormous er whopping city say it must have a voice of some kind does it ever speak to you how do you interpret its meaning it is a tremen dous mass but it must have a key like a saratoga trunk asked aurelia no said i please do not refer to the lid i have a fancy that every city has a voice each one has something to say to the one who can hear it what does the big one say to you all cities said aurelia judicially say the same thing when they get through saying it there is an echo from philadelphia so they are unanimous here are people said i scholastic ally compressed upon an island which is mostly lamb surrounded by wall street water the conjunc tion of so many units into so small a space must result in an identity or or rather a homogeneity that finds its oral expression through a common chan nel it is as you might say a consensus of transla tion concentrating in a crystallized general idea which reveals itself in what may be termed the voice of the city can you tell me what it is aurelia smiled wonderfully she sat on the high stoop a spray of insolent ivy bobbed against her right ear a ray of impudent moonlight flickered upon her nose but i was adamant nickel plated i must go and find out i said what is the voice of this city other cities have voices it is an assignment i must have it new york i con tinned in a rising tone had better not hand me a cigar and say old man i can t talk for publication no other city acts in that way chicago says unhes itatingly i will i philadelphia says i should new orleans says i used to louisville says don t care if i do st louis says excuse me pittsburg says smoke up now new york aurelia smiled very well said i i must go elsewhere and find out i went into a palace tile floored cherub ceilinged and square with the cop i put my foot on the brass rail and said to billy magnus the best bartender in the diocese billy you ve lived in new york a long time what kind of a song and dance does this old town give you what i mean is doesn t the gab of it seem to kind of bunch up and slide over the bar to you in a sort of amalgamated tip that bits off the burg in a kind of an epigram with a dash of bitters and a slice of excuse me a minute said billy somebody s punching the button at the side door he went away came back with an empty tin bucket again vanished with it full returned and said to me that was mame she rings twice she likes a glass of beer for supper her and the kid if you ever saw that little skeesicks of mine brace up in his high chair and take his beer and but say what was yours i get kind of excited when i bear them two rings was it the baseball score or gin fizz you asked for ginger ale i answered i walked up to broadway i saw a cop on the cor ner the cops take kids up women across and men in i went up to him if i m not exceeding the spiel limit i said let me ask you you see new york during its vocative hours it is the function of you and your brother cops to preserve the acoustics of the city there must be a civic voice that is intelligible to you at night during your lonely rounds you must have beard it what is the epitome of its turmoil and shouting what does the city say to you friend said the policeman spinning his club it don t say nothing i get my orders from the man higher up say i guess you re all right stand here for a few minutes and keep an eye open for the roundsman the cop melted into the darkness of the side street in ten minutes be had returned married last tuesday be said half gruffly you know bow they are she comes to that corner at nine every night for a comes to say hello i generally manage to be there say what was it you asked me a bit ago what s doing in the city oh there s a roof garden or two just opened twelve blocks up i crossed a crow s foot of street car tracks and skirted the edge of an umbrageous park an artificial diana gilded heroic poised wind ruled on the tower shimmered in the clear light of her namesake in the sky along came my poet hurry ing hatted haired emitting dactyls spondees and dactylis i seized him bill said i in the magazine he is cleon give me a lift i am on an assignment to find out the voice of the city you see it s a special order ordi narily a symposium comprising the views of henry clews john l sullivan edwin markham may ir win and charles schwab would be about all but this is a different matter we want a broad poetic mystic vocalization of the city s soul and meaning you are the very chap to give me a hint some years ago a man got at the niagara falls and gave us its pitch the note was about two feet below the lowest g on the piano now you can t put new york into a note unless it s better indorsed than that but give me an idea of what it would say if it should speak it is bound to be a mighty and far reaching utterance to arrive at it we must take the tremendous crash of the chords of the day s traffic the laughter and music of the night the solemn tones of dr parkhurst the rag time the weeping the stealthy bum of cab wbeels the shout of the press agent the tinkle of fountains on the roof gardens the hullabaloo of the strawberry vender and the covers of everybody s magazine the whispers of the lovers in the parks all these sounds must go into your voice not combined but mixed and of the mixture an essence made and of the es sence an extract an audible extract of which one drop shall form the thing we seek do you remember asked the poet with a chuckle that california girl we met at stiver s studio last week well i m on my way to see her she repeated that poem of mine the tribute of spring word for word she s the smartest proposi tion in this town just at present say how does this confounded tie look i spoiled four before i got one to set right and the voice that i asked you about i in quired oh she doesn t sing said cleon but you ought to bear her recite my angel of the inshore wind i passed on i cornered a newsboy and be flashed at me prophetic pink papers that outstripped the news by two revolutions of the clock s longest hand son i said while i pretended to chase coins in my penny pocket doesn t it sometimes seem to you as if the city ought to be able to talk all these ups and downs and funny business and queer things hap pening every daywhat would it say do you think if it could speak quit yer kiddin said the boy wot paper yer want i got no time to waste it s mag s birthday and i want thirty cents to git her a present here was no interpreter of the city s mouthpiece i bought a paper and consigned its undeclared treaties its premeditated murders and unfought bat tles to an ash can again i repaired to the park and sat in the moon shade i thought and thought and wondered why none could tell me what i asked for and then as swift as light from a fixed star the answer came to me i arose and hurried hurried as so many reasoners must back around my circle i knew the answer and i bugged it in my breast as i flew fearing lest some one would stop me and demand my secret aurelia was still on the stoop the moon was higher and the ivy shadows were deeper i sat at her side and we watched a little cloud tilt at the drifting moon and go asunder quite pale and discomfited and then wonder of wonders and delight of de lights our hands somehow touched and our fingers closed together and did not part after half an hour aurelia said with that smile of hers do you know you haven t spoken a word since you came back that said i nodding wisely is the voice of the city the complete life of john hopkins there is a saying that no man has tasted the full flavor of life until he has known poverty love and war the justness of this reflection commends it to the lover of condensed philosophy the three condi tions embrace about all there is in life worth knowing a surface thinker might deem that wealth should be added to the list not so when a poor man finds a long bidden quarter dollar that has slipped through a rip into his vest lining be sounds the pleasure of life with a deeper plummet than any millionaire can hope to cast it seems that the wise executive power that rules life has thought best to drill man in these three con ditions and none may escape all three in rural places the terms do not mean so much poverty is less pinching love is temperate war shrinks to con tests about boundary lines and the neighbors hens it is in the cities that our epigram gains in truth and vigor and it has remained for one john hopkins to crowd the experience into a rather small space of time the hopkins flat was like a thousand others there was a rubber plant in one window a flea bitten terrier sat in the other wondering when he was to have his day john hopkins was like a thousand others he worked at per week in a nine story red brick building at either insurance buckle s hoisting en gines chiropody loans pulleys boas renovated waltz guaranteed in five lessons or artificial limbs it is not for us to wring mr hopkins s avo cation from these outward signs that be mrs hopkins was like a thousand others the auriferous tooth the sedentary disposition the sun day afternoon wanderlust the draught upon the delicatessen store for home made comforts the furor for department store marked down sales the feeling of superiority to the lady in the third floor front who wore genuine ostrich tips and had two names over her bell the mucilaginous hours during which she remained glued to the window sill the vigi lant avoidance of the instalment man the tireless patronage of the acoustics of the dumb waiter shaft all the attributes of the gotham flat dweller were hers one moment yet of sententiousness and the story moves in the big city large and sudden things happen you round a corner and thrust the rib of your um brella into the eye of your old friend from kootenai falls you stroll out to pluck a sweet william in the park and lo bandits attack you you are am bulanced to the hospital you marry your nurse are divorced get squeezed while short on u p s and d w n s stand in the bread line marry an heiress take out your laundry and pay your club dues seemingly all in the wink of an eye you travel the streets and a finger beckons to you a handkerchief is dropped for you a brick is dropped upon you the elevator cable or your bank breaks a table d hote or your wife disagrees with you and fate tosses you about like cork crumbs in wine opened by an un feed waiter the city is a sprightly young ster and you are red paint upon its toy and you get licked off john hopkins sat after a compressed dinner in his glove fitting straight front flat he sat upon a hornblende couch and gazed with satiated eyes at art brought home to the people in the shape of the storm tacked against the wall mrs hop kins discoursed droningly of the dinner smells from the flat across the ball the flea bitten terrier gave hopkins a look of disgust and showed a man hating tooth here was neither poverty love nor war but upon such barren stems may be grafted those essentials of a complete life john hopkins sought to inject a few raisins of conversation into the tasteless dough of existence putting a new elevator in at the office he said discarding the nominative noun and the boss has turned out his whiskers you don t mean it commented mrs hopkins mr whipples continued john wore his new spring suit down to day i liked it fine it s a gray with he stopped suddenly stricken by a need that made itself known to him i believe i ll walk down to the corner and get a five cent cigar he concluded john hopkins took his bat aid picked his way down the musty halls and stairs of the flat house the evening air was mild and the streets shrill with the careless cries of children playing games con trolled by mysterious rhythms and phrases their elders held the doorways and steps with leisurely pipe and gossip paradoxically the fire escapes sup ported lovers in couples who made no attempt to fly the mounting conflagration they were there to fan the corner cigar store aimed at by john hopkins was kept by a man named freshmayer who looked upon the earth as a sterile promontory hopkins unknown in the store entered and called genially for his bunch of spinach car fare grade this imputation deepened the pessimism of fresh mayer but be set out a brand that came perilously near to filling the order hopkins bit off the roots of his purchase and lighted up at the swinging gas jet feeling in his pockets to make payment he found not a penny there say my friend he explained frankly i ve come out without any change hand you that nickel first time i pass joy surged in freshmayer s heart here was cor roboration of his belief that the world was rotten and man a peripatetic evil without a word he rounded the end of his counter and made earnest onslaught upon his customer hopkins was no man to serve as a punching bag for a pessimistic tobacconist he quickly bestowed upon freshmayer a colorado maduro eye in return for the ardent kick that be received from that dealer in goods for cash only the impetus of the enemy s attack forced the hopkins line back to the sidewalk there the con flict raged the pacific wooden indian with his carven smile was overturned and those of the street who delighted in carnage pressed round to view the zealous joust but then came the inevitable cop and imminent convenience for both the attacker and attacked john hopkins was a peaceful citizen who worked at rebuses of nights in a flat but be was not without the fundamental spirit of resistance that comes with the battle rage he knocked the policeman into a gro cer s sidewalk display of goods and gave freshmayer a punch that caused him temporarily to regret that he had not made it a rule to extend a five cent line of credit to certain customers then hopkins took spiritedly to his heels down the sidewalk closely fol lowed by the cigar dealer and the policeman whose uniform testified to the reason in the grocer s sign that read eggs cheaper than anywhere else in the city as hopkins ran he became aware of a big low red racing automobile that kept abreast of him in the street this auto steered in to the side of the sidewalk and the man guiding it motioned to hopkins to jump into it he did so without slackening his speed and fell into the turkey red upholstered seat beside the chauffeur the big machine with a dimin uendo cough flew away like an albatross down the avenue into which the street emptied the driver of the auto sped his machine without a word he was masked beyond guess in the goggles and diabolic garb of the chauffeur much obliged old man called hopkins grate fully i guess you ve got sporting blood in you all right and don t admire the sight of two men trying to soak one little more and i d have been pinched the chauffeur made no sign that he had heard hopkins shrugged a shoulder and chewed at his cigar to which his teeth had clung grimly through out the melee ten minutes and the auto turned into the open carriage entrance of a noble mansion of brown stone and stood still the chauffeur leaped out and said come quick the lady she will explain it is the great honor you will have monsieur ah that milady could call upon armand to do this thing but no i am only one chauffeur with vehement gestures the chauffeur conducted hopkins into the house he was ushered into a small but luxurious reception chamber a lady young and possessing the beauty of visions rose from a chair in her eyes smouldered a becoming anger her high arched threadlike brows were ruffled into a delicious frown milady said the chauffeur bowing low i have the honor to relate to you that i went to the house of monsieur long and found him to be not at home as i came back i see this gentleman in combat against bow you say greatest odds he is fighting with five ten thirty men gendarmes aussi yes milady he what you call swat one three eight policemans if that monsieur long is out i say to myself this gentleman be will serve milady so well and i bring him here very well armand said the lady you may go she turned to hopkins i sent my chauffeur she said to bring my cousin walter long there is a man in this house who has treated me with insult and abuse i have complained to my aunt and she laughs at me ar mand says you are brave in these prosaic days men who are both brave and chivalrous are few may i count upon your assistance john hopkins thrust the remains of his cigar into his coat pocket he looked upon this winning creature and felt his first thrill of romance it was a knightly love and contained no disloyalty to the flat with the flea bitten terrier and the lady of his choice he bad married her after a picnic of the lady label stickers union lodge no on a dare and a bet of new hats and chowder all around with his friend billy mcmanus this angel who was begging him to come to her rescue was something too heavenly for chowder and as for hats golden jewelled crowns for her say said john hopkins just show me the guy that you ve got the grouch at i ve neglected my talents as a scrapper heretofore but this is my busy night he is in there said the lady pointing to a closed door come are you sure that you do not falter or fear me said john hopkins just give me one of those roses in the bunch you are wearing will you the lady gave him a red red rose john hopkins kissed it stuffed it into his vest pocket opened the door and walked into the room it was a handsome library softly but brightly lighted a young man was there reading books on etiquette is what you want to study said john hopkins abruptly get up here and i ll give you

invisible check and it looks fine a lickpenny lover there were girls in the biggest store masie was one of them she was eighteen and a selleslady in the gents gloves here she became versed in two varieties of human beings the kind of gents who buy their gloves in department stores and the kind of women who buy gloves for unfortunate gents besides this wide knowledge of the human species masie had acquired other information she had listened to the promulgated wisdom of the other girls and had stored it in a brain that was as secretive and wary as that of a maltese cat per haps nature foreseeing that she would lack wise counsellors had mingled the saving ingredient of shrewdness along with her beauty as she has endowed the silver fox of the priceless fur above the other animals with cunning for masie was beautiful she was a deep tinted blonde with the calm poise of a lady who cooks butter cakes in a window she stood behind her counter in the biggest store and as you closed your band over the tape line for your glove measure you thought of hebe and as you looked again you wondered how she had come by minerva s eyes when the floorwalker was not looking masie chewed tutti frutti when he was looking she gazed up as if at the clouds and smiled wistfully that is the shopgirl smile and i enjoin you to shun it unless you are well fortified with callosity of the heart caramels and a congeniality for the capers of cupid this smile belonged to masie s recreation hours and not to the store but the floorwalker must have his own he is the shylock of the stores when be comes nosing around the bridge of his nose is a toll bridge it is goo goo eyes or git when be looks toward a pretty girl of course not all floor walkers are thus only a few days ago the papers printed news of one over eighty years of age one day irving carter painter millionaire trav eller poet automobilist happened to enter the big gest store it is due to him to add that his visit was not voluntary filial duty took him by the collar and dragged him inside while his mother philandered among the bronze and terra cotta statuettes carter strolled across to the glove counter in order to shoot a few minutes on the wing his need for gloves was genuine be had forgotten to bring a pair with him but his action hardly calls for apology be cause be had never heard of glove counter flirtations as he neared the vicinity of his fate be hesitated suddenly conscious of this unknown phase of cupid s less worthy profession three or four cheap fellows sonorously garbed were leaning over the counters wrestling with the mediatorial hand coverings while giggling girls played vivacious seconds to their lead upon the strident string of coquetry carter would have re treated but he had gone too far masie confronted him behind her counter with a questioning look in eyes as coldly beautifully warmly blue as the glint of summer sunshine on an iceberg drifting in southern seas and then irving carter painter millionaire etc felt a warm flush rise to his aristocratically pale face but not from diffidence the blush was intellectual in origin he knew in a moment that he stood in the ranks of the ready made youths who wooed the gig gling girls at other counters himself leaned against the oaken trysting place of a cockney cupid with a desire in his heart for the favor of a glove salesgirl he was no more than bill and jack and mickey and then be felt a sudden tolerance for them and an elating courageous contempt for the conventions upon which he had fed and an unhesitating deter mination to have this perfect creature for his own when the gloves were paid for and wrapped the carter lingered for a moment the dimples at corners of masie s damask mouth deepened all gen tlemen who bought gloves lingered in just that way she curved an arm showing like psyche s through her shirt waist sleeve and rested an elbow upon the show case edge carter had never before encountered a situation of which he had not been perfect master but now he stood far more awkward than bill or jack or mickey he had no chance of meeting this beautiful girl so cially his mind struggled to recall the nature and habits of shopgirls as be had read or heard of them somehow be had received the idea that they some times did not insist too strictly upon the regular channels of introduction his heart beat loudly at the thought of proposing an unconventional meeting with this lovely and virginal being but the tumult in his heart gave him courage after a few friendly and well received remarks on general subjects he laid his card by her hand on the counter will you please pardon me he said if i seem too bold but i earnestly hope you will allow me the pleasure of seeing you again there is my name i assure you that it is with the greatest respect that i ask the favor of becoming one of your acquaintances may i not hope for the privilege masie knew men especially men who buy gloves without hesitation she looked him frankly and smil ingly in the eyes and said sure i guess you re all right i don t usually go out with strange gentlemen though it ain t quite ladylike when should you want to see me again as soon as i may said carter if you would allow me to call at your home i masie laughed musically oh gee no she said emphatically if you could see our flat once there s five of us in three rooms i d just like to see ma s face if i was to bring a gentleman friend there anywhere then said the enamored carter that will be convenient to you say suggested masie with a bright idea look in her peach blow face i guess thursday night will about suit me suppose you come to the corner of eighth avenue and forty eighth street at i live right near the corner but i ve got to be back home by eleven ma never lets me stay out after eleven carter promised gratefully to keep the tryst and then hastened to his mother who was looking about for him to ratify her purchase of a bronze diana a salesgirl with small eyes and an obtuse nose strolled near masie with a friendly leer did you make a hit with his nobs mase she asked familiarly the gentleman asked permission to call an swered masie with the grand air as she slipped car ter s card into the bosom of her waist permission to call echoed small eyes with a snigger did he say anything about dinner in the waldorf and a spin in his auto afterward oh cheese it said masie wearily you ve been used to swell things i don t think you ve had a swelled bead ever since that hose cart driver took you out to a chop suey joint no be never mentioned the waldorf but there s a fifth avenue address on his card and if be buys the supper you can bet your life there won t be no pigtail on the waiter what takes the order as carter glided away from the biggest store with his mother in his electric runabout he bit his lip with a dull pain at his heart he knew that love had come to him for the first time in all the twenty nine years of his life and that the object of it should make so readily an appointment with him at a street corner though it was a step toward his desires tor tured him with misgivings carter did not know the shopgirl he did not know that her home is often either a scarcely habit able tiny room or a domicile filled to overflowing with kith and kin the street corner is her parlor the park is her drawing room the avenue is her garden walk yet for the most part she is as inviolate mis tress of herself in them as is my lady inside her tapestried chamber one evening at dusk two weeks after their first meeting carter and masie strolled arm in arm into a little dimly lit park they found a bench tree shadowed and secluded and sat there for the first time his arm stole gently around her her golden bronze head slid restfully against his shoulder gee sighed masie thankfully why didn t you ever think of that before masie said carter earnestly you surely know that i love you i ask you sincerely to marry me you know me well enough by this time to have no doubts of me i want you and i must have you i care nothing for the difference in our stations what is the difference asked masie curi ously well there isn t any said carter quickly ex cept in the minds of foolish people it is in my power to give you a life of luxury my social position is be yond dispute and my means are ample they all say that remarked masie it s the kid they all give you i suppose you really work in a delicatessen or follow the races i ain t as green as i look i can furnish you all the proofs you want said carter gently and i want you masie i loved you the first day i saw you they all do said masie with an amused laugh to hear em talk if i could meet a man that got stuck on me the third time he d seen me i think i d get mashed on him please don t say such things pleaded carter listen to me dear ever since i first looked into your eyes you have been the only woman in the world for me oh ain t you the kidder smiled masie how many other girls did you ever tell that but carter persisted and at length be reached the flimsy fluttering little soul of the shopgirl that existed somewhere deep down in her lovely bosom his words penetrated the heart whose very lightness was its safest armor she looked up at him with eyes that saw and a warm glow visited her cool cheeks tremblingly awfully her moth wings closed and she seemed about to settle upon the flower of love some faint glimmer of life and its possibilities on the other side of her glove counter dawned upon her carter felt the change and crowded the opportunity marry me masie be whispered softly and we will go away from this ugly city to beautiful ones we will forget work and business and life will be one long holiday i know where i should take you i have been there often just think of a shore where summer is eternal where the waves are always rip pling on the lovely beach and the people are happy and free as children we will sail to those shores and remain there as long as you please in one of those far away cities there are grand and lovely palaces and towers full of beautiful pictures and statues the streets of the city are water and one travels about in i know said masie sitting up suddenly gondolas yes smiled carter i thought so said masie and then continued carter we will travel on and see whatever we wish in the world after the european cities we will visit india and the ancient cities there and ride on elephants and see the wonder ful temples of the hindoos and brahmins and the japanese gardens and the camel trains and chariot races in persia and all the queer sights of foreign countries don t you think you would like it masie masie rose to her feet i think we had better be going home she said coolly it s getting late carter humored her he had come to know her varying thistle down moods and that it was useless to combat them but he felt a certain happy triumph he had held for a moment though but by a silken thread the soul of his wild psyche and hope was stronger within him once she had folded her wings and her cool band bad closed about his own at the biggest store the next day masie s chum lulu waylaid her in an angle of the counter how are you and your swell friend making it she asked oh him said masie patting her side curls he ain t in it any more say lu what do you think that fellow wanted me to do go on the stage guessed lulu breathlessly nit he s too cheap a guy for that he wanted me to marry him and go down to coney island for a wedding tour dougherty s eye opener big jim

of a triangle but it s a long line that has no turning barbara was alone uncle jerome and nevada had gone to the theatre barbara had not cared to go she wanted to stay at home and study in the study if you miss were a stunning new york girl and saw every day that a brown ingenuous western witch was getting hobbles and a lasso on the young man you wanted for yourself you too would lose taste for the oxidized silver setting of a musical comedy barbara sat by the quartered oak library table her right arm rested upon the table and her dextral fingers nervously manipulated a sealed letter the letter was addressed to nevada warren and in the upper left hand corner of the envelope was gilbert s little gold palette it had been delivered at nine o clock after nevada had left barbara would have given her pearl necklace to know what the letter contained but she could not open and read it by the aid of steam or a pen handle or a hair pin or any of the generally approved methods because her position in society forbade such an act she had tried to read some of the lines of the letter by holding the envelope up to a strong light and pressing it hard against the paper but gilbert had too good a taste in stationery to make that possible at eleven thirty the theatre goers returned it was a delicious winter night even so far as from the cab to the door they were powdered thickly with the big flakes downpouring diagonally from the cast old jerome growled good naturedly about villanous cab service and blockaded streets nevada colored like a rose with sapphire eyes babbled of the stormy nights in the mountains around dad s cabin during all these wintry apostrophes barbara cold at heart sawed wood the only appropriate thing she could think of to do old jerome went immediately up stairs to hot water bottles and quinine nevada fluttered into the study the only cheerfully lighted room subsided into an arm chair and while at the interminable task of unbuttoning her elbow gloves gave oral testimony as to the demerits of the show yes i think mr fields is really amusing sometimes said barbara here is a letter for you dear that came by special delivery just after you had gone who is it from asked nevada tugging at a button well really said barbara with a smile i can only guess the envelope has that queer little thing in one corner that gilbert calls a palette but which looks to me rather like a gilt heart on a school girl s valentine i wonder what he s writing to me about remarked nevada listlessly we re all alike said barbara all women we try to find out what is in a letter by studying the postmark as a last resort we use scissors and read it from the bottom upward here it is she made a motion as if to toss the letter across the table to nevada great catamounts exclaimed nevada these centre fire buttons are a nuisance i d rather wear buckskins oh barbara please shuck the hide off that letter and read it it ll be midnight before i get these gloves off why dear you don t want me to open gilbert s letter to you it s for you and you wouldn t wish any one else to read it of course nevada raised her steady calm sapphire eyes from her gloves nobody writes me anything that everybody mightn t read she said go on barbara maybe gilbert wants us to go out in his car again to morrow curiosity can do more things than kill a cat and if emotions well recognized as feminine are inimical to feline life then jealousy would soon leave the whole world catless barbara opened the letter with an indulgent slightly bored air well dear said she i ll read it if you want me to she slit the envelope and read the missive with swift travelling eyes read it again and cast a quick shrewd glance at nevada who for the time seemed to consider gloves as the world of her interest and letters from rising artists as no more than messages from mars for a quarter of a minute barbara looked at nevada with a strange steadfastness and then a smile so small that it widened her mouth only the sixteenth part of an inch and narrowed her eyes no more than a twentieth flashed like an inspired thought across her face since the beginning no woman has been a mystery to another woman swift as light travels each penetrates the heart and mind of another sifts her sister s words of their cunningest disguises reads her most hidden desires and plucks the sophistry from her wiliest talk like hairs from a comb twiddling them sardonically between her thumb and fingers before letting them float away on the breezes of fundamental doubt long ago eve s son rang the door bell of the family residence in paradise park bearing a strange lady on his arm whom he introduced eve took her daughter in law aside and lifted a classic eyebrow the land of nod said the bride languidly flirting the leaf of a palm i suppose you ve been there of course not lately said eve absolutely unstaggered don t you think the apple sauce they serve over there is execrable i rather like that mulberry leaf tunic effect dear but of course the real fig goods are not to be had over there come over behind this lilac bush while the gentlemen split a celery tonic i think the caterpillar holes have made your dress open a little in the back so then and there according to the records was the alliance formed by the only two who s who ladies in

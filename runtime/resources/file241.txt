week colonel rockingham s land has been sold for taxes thirteen times there hasn t been a peach crop in this part of georgia for two years the wet spring killed the watermelons nobody around here has money enough to buy fertilizer and land is so poor the corn crop failed and there wasn t enough grass to support the rabbits all the people have had to eat in this section for over a year is hog and hominy and pick interrupts caligula mussing up his red hair what are you going to do with that chicken feed i hands the money back to major tucker and then i goes over to colonel rockingham and slaps him on the back colonel says i i hope you ve enjoyed our little joke we don t want to carry it too far kidnappers well wouldn t it tickle your uncle my name s rhinegelder and i m a nephew of chauncey depew my friend s a second cousin of the editor of puck so you can see we are down south enjoying ourselves in our humorous way now there s two quarts of cognac to open yet and then the joke s over what s the use to go into details one or two will be enough i remember major tallahassee tucker playing on a jew s harp and caligula waltzing with his head on the watch pocket of a tall baggage master i hesitate to refer to the cake walk done by me and mr patterson g coble with colonel jackson t rockingham between us and even on the next morning when you wouldn t think it possible there was a consolation for me and caligula we knew that raisuli himself never made half the hit with burdick harris that we did with the sunrise edenville tap railroad the ethics of pig on an east bound train i went into the smoker and found jefferson peters the only man with a brain west of the wabash river who can use his cerebrum cerebellum and medulla oblongata at the same time jeff is in the line of unillegal graft he is not to be dreaded by widows and orphans he is a reducer of surplusage his favorite disguise is that of the target bird at which the spendthrift or the reckless investor may shy a few inconsequential dollars he is readily vocalized by tobacco so with the aid of two thick and easy burning brevas i got the story of his latest autolycan adventure in my line of business said jeff the hardest thing is to find an upright trustworthy strictly honorable partner to work a graft with some of the best men i ever worked with in a swindle would resort to trickery at times so last summer i thinks i will go over into this section of country where i hear the serpent has not yet entered and see if i can find a partner naturally gifted with a talent for crime but not yet contaminated by success i found a village that seemed to show the right kind of a layout the inhabitants hadn t found that adam had been dispossessed and were going right along naming the animals and killing snakes just as if they were in the garden of eden they call this town mount nebo and it s up near the spot where kentucky and west virginia and north carolina corner together them states don t meet well it was in that neighborhood anyway after putting in a week proving i wasn t a revenue officer i went over to the store where the rude fourflushers of the hamlet lied to see if i could get a

queen of the may why yes mr peters says the storekeeper i reckon we air about as moral and torpid a community as there be on the mounting according to censuses of opinion but i reckon you ain t ever met rufe tatum why no says the town constable he can t hardly have ever that air rufe is shore the monstrousest scalawag that has escaped hangin on the galluses and that puts me in mind that i ought

don t tell me there s a man in mount nebo as bad as that worse says the storekeeper he steals hogs i think i will look up this mr tatum so a day or two after the constable turned him out i got acquainted with him and invited him out on the edge of town to sit on a log and talk business what i wanted was a partner with a natural rural make up to play a part in some little one act outrages

face of may rogue though she be and disturber of sane men s peace no wise virgins cunning nor cold storage shall make her bow her head in the bright galaxy of months oh yes the story was not quite finished a night passed and higgins helped old man coulson in the morning to his chair by the window the cold of the room was gone heavenly odours and fragrant mild ness entered in hurried mrs widdup and stood by his chair mr coulson reached his bony hand and grasped her plump one mrs widdup he said this house would be no home without you i have half a million dollars if that and the true affection of a heart no lonoer in its youthful prime but still not cold could i found out what made it cold said mrs widdup leanin against his chair twas ice tons of it in the basement and in the furnace room everywhere i shut off the registers that it was coming through into your room mr coulson poor soul and now it s maytime again a true heart went on old man coulson a little wanderingly that the springtime has brought to life again and but what will my daughter say mrs widdup never fear sir said mrs widdup cheerfully miss coulson she ran away with the iceman last night sir a technical error i never cared especially for feuds believing them to be even more overrated products of our country than grapefruit scrapple or honeymoons nevertheless if i may be allowed i will tell you of an indian territory feud of which i was press agent camp follower and inaccessory during the fact i was on a visit to sam durkee s ranch where i had a great time falling off unmanicured ponies and waving my bare hand at the lower jaws of wolves about two miles away sam was a hardened person of about twenty five with a reputation for going home in the dark with perfect equanimity though often with reluctance over in the creek nation was a family bearing the name of tatum i was told that the durkees and tatums had been feuding for years several of each family had bitten the grass and it was expected that more nebuchad nezzars would follow a younger generation of each family was growing up and the grass was keeping pace with them but i gathered that they had fought fairly that they had not lain in cornfields and aimed at the division of their enemies suspenders in the back partly perhaps because there were no cornfields and nobody wore more than one suspender nor had any woman or child of either house ever been harmed in those days and you will find it so yet their women were safe sam durkee had a girl if it were an all fiction magazine that i expect to sell this story to i should say mr durkee rejoiced in a fianc e her name was ella baynes they appeared to be devoted to each other and to have perfect confidence in each other as all couples do who are and have or aren t and haven t she was tolerably pretty with a heavy mass of brown hair that helped her along he introduced me to her which seemed not to lessen her preference for him so i reasoned that they were surely soul mates miss baynes lived in kingfisher twenty miles from the ranch sam lived on a gallop between the two places one day there came to kingfisher a courageous young man rather small with smooth face and regular features he made many inquiries about the business of the town and especially of the inhabitants cognominally he said he was from muscogee and he looked it with his yellow shoes and crocheted four in hand i met him once when i rode in for the mail he said his name was beverly travers which seemed rather improbable there were active times on the ranch just then and sam was too busy to go to town often as an incom petent and generally worthless guest it devolved upon me to ride in for little things such as post cards barrels of flour baking powder smoking tobacco and letters from ella one day when i was messenger for half a gross of cigarette papers and a couple of wagon tires i saw the alleged beverly travers in a yellow wheeled buggy with ella baynes driving about town as ostentatiously as the black waxy mud would permit i knew that this infor mation would bring no balm of gilead to sam s soul so i refrained from including it in the news of the city that i retailed on my return but on the next afternoon an elongated ex cowboy of the name of simmons an old time pal of sam s who kept a feed store in kingfisher rode out to the ranch and rolled and burned many cigar ettes before he would talk when he did make oration his words were these say sam there s been a description of a galoot miscallin himself bevel edged travels impairing the atmospheric air of kingfisher for the past two weeks you know who he was he was not otherwise than ben tatum from the creek nation son of old gopher tatum that your uncle newt shot last february you know what he done this morning he killed your brother lester shot him in the co t house yard i wondered if sam had heard he pulled a twig from a mesquite bush chewed it gravely and said he did did he he killed lester the same said simmons and he did more he run away with your girl the same as to say miss ella baynes i thought you might like to know so i rode out to impart the information i am much obliged jim said sam taking the chewed twig from his

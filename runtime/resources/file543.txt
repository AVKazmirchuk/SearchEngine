dawe steered the editor again eastward then after covering a short distance into a lofty but narrow flathouse burdened with a floridly over decorated fa cade to the fifth story they toiled and dawe panting pushed his latch key into the door of one of the front flats when the door opened editor westbrook saw with feelings of pity how meanly and meagerly the rooms were furnished get a chair if you can find one said dawe while i hunt up pen and ink hello what s this here s a note from louise she must have left it there when she went out this morning he picked up an envelope that lay on the centre table and tore it open he began to read the letter that he drew out of it and once having begun it aloud he so read it through to the end these are the words that editor westbrook heard dear shackleford by the time you get this i will be about a hundred miles away and still a going i ve got a place in the chorus of the occidental opera co and we start on the road to day at twelve o clock i didn t want to starve to death and so i decided to make my own living i m not coming back mrs westbrook is going with me she said she was tired of living with a combination phonograph iceberg and dictionary and she s not coming back either we ve been practising the songs and dances for two months on the quiet i hope you will be successful and get along all right good bye louise dawe dropped the letter covered his face with his trembling hands and cried out in a deep vibrating voice my god why hast thou given me this cup to drink since she is false then let thy heaven s fairest gifts faith and love become the jesting by words of traitors and fiends editor westbrook s glasses fell to the floor the fingers of one hand fumbled with a button on his coat as he blurted between his pale lips say shack ain t that a hell of a note wouldn t that knock you off your perch shack ain t it hell now shack ain t it past one at rooney s only on the lower east side of new york do the houses of capulet and montagu survive there they do not fight by the book of arithmetic if you but bite your thumb at an upholder of your opposing house you have work cut out for your steel on broadway you may

any eyelash and to an inch of elbow room at the bar when its patrons include foes of your house and kin so when eddie mcmanus known to the capulets as cork mcmanus drifted into dutch mike s for a

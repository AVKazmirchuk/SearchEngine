love love to a woman means sacrifice if she be worthy of the name no gold or rank will outweigh with her a genuine devotion gentlemen of the er i should say my friends the case of redruth versus love and affection has been called yet who is on trial not redruth for he has been punished not those immortal passions that clothe our lives with the joy of the angels then who each man of us here to night stands at the bar to answer if chivalry or darkness inhabits his bosom to judge us sits womankind in the form of one of its fairest flowers in her hand she holds the prize intrinsically insignificant but worthy of our noblest efforts to win as a guerdon of approval from so worthy a representative of feminine judgment and taste in taking up the imaginary history of redruth and the fair being to whom he gave his heart i must in the beginning raise my voice against the unworthy insinuation that the selfishness or perfidy or love of luxury of any woman drove him to renounce the world i have not found woman to be so unspiritual or venal we must seek elsewhere among man s baser nature and lower motives for the cause there was in all probability a lover s quarrel as they stood at the gate on that memorable day tormented by jealousy young redruth vanished from his native haunts but had he just cause to do so there is no evidence for or against but there is something higher than evidence there is the grand eternal belief in woman s goodness in her steadfastness against temptation in her loyalty even in the face of proffered riches i picture to myself the rash lover wandering self tortured about the world i picture his gradual descent and finally his complete despair when he realises that he has lost the most precious gift life had to offer him then his withdrawal from the world of sorrow and the subsequent derangement of his faculties becomes intelligible but what do i see on the other hand a lonely woman fading away as the years roll by still faithful still waiting still watching for a form and listening for a step that will come no more she is old now her hair is white and smoothly banded each day she sits at the door and gazes longingly down the dusty road in spirit she is waiting there at the gate just as he left her his forever but not here below yes my belief in woman paints that picture in my mind parted forever on earth but waiting she in anticipation of a meeting in elysium he in the slough of despond i thought he was in the bughouse said the passenger who was nobody in particular judge menefee stirred a little impatiently the men sat drooping in grotesque attitudes the wind had abated its violence coming now in fitful virulent puffs the fire had burned to a mass of red coals which shed but a dim light within the room the lady passenger in her cosey nook looked to be but a formless dark bulk crowned by a mass of coiled sleek hair and showing but a small space of snowy forehead above her clinging boa judge menefee got stiffly to his feet and now miss garland he announced we have concluded it is for you to award the prize to the one of us whose argument especially i may say in regard to his estimate of true womanhood approaches nearest to your own conception no answer came from the lady passenger judge menefee bent over solicitously the passenger who was nobody in particular laughed low and harshly the lady was sleeping sweetly the judge essayed to take her hand to awaken her in doing so he touched a small cold round irregular something in her lap she has eaten the apple announced judge menefee in awed tones as he held up the core for them to see the missing chord i stopped overnight at the sheep ranch of rush kinney on the sandy fork of the nueces mr kinney and i had been strangers up to the time when i called hallo at his hitching rack but from that moment until my departure on the next morning we were according to the texas code undeniable friends after supper the ranchman and i lugged our chairs outside the two room house to its floorless gallery roofed with chaparral and sacuista grass with the rear legs of our chairs sinking deep into the hardpacked loam each of us reposed against an elm pillar of the structure and smoked el toro tobacco while we wrangled amicably concerning the affairs of the rest of the world as for conveying adequate conception of the engaging charm of that prairie evening despair waits upon it it is a bold chronicler who will undertake the description of a texas night in the early spring an inventory must suffice the ranch rested upon the summit of a lenient slope the ambient prairie diversified by arroyos and murky patches of brush and pear lay around us like a darkened bowl at the bottom of which we reposed as dregs like a turquoise cover the sky pinned us there the miraculous air heady with ozone and made memorably sweet by leagues of wild flowerets gave tang and savour to the breath in the sky was a great round mellow searchlight which we knew to be no moon but the dark lantern of summer who came to hunt northward the cowering spring in the nearest corral a flock of sheep lay silent until a groundless panic would send a squad of them huddling together with a drumming rush for other sounds a shrill family of coyotes yapped beyond the shearing pen and whippoorwills twittered in the long grass but even these dissonances hardly rippled the clear torrent of the mocking birds notes

to the suwanee river you might say one of its tributaries he used to come down and sit with me while i was getting well and aggrieve his flute and say unreconstructed things about the north you d have thought that the smoke from the first gun at fort sumter was still floating around in the air you know that was about the time they staged them property revolutions down there that wound up in the fifth act with the thrilling canal scene where uncle sam has nine curtain calls holding miss panama by the hand while the bloodhounds keep senator morgan treed up in a cocoanut palm that s the way it wound up but at first it seemed as if colombia was going to make panama look like one of the kind with dents made in it in the factory like they wear at north beach fish fries for mine i played the straw hat crowd to win and they gave me a colonel s commission over a brigade of twenty seven men in the left wing and second joint of the insurgent army the colombian troops were awfully rude to us one day when i had my brigade in a sandy spot with its shoes off doing a battalion drill by squads the government army rushed from behind a bush at us acting as noisy and disagreeable as they could my troops enfiladed left faced and left the spot after enticing the enemy for three miles or so we struck a brier patch and had to sit down when we were ordered to throw up our toes and surrender we obeyed five of my best staff officers fell suffering extremely with stone bruised heels then and there those colombians took your friend barney sir stripped him of the insignia of his rank consisting of a pair of brass knuckles and a canteen of rum and dragged him before a military court the presiding general went through the usual legal formalities that sometimes cause a case to hang on the calendar of a south american military court as long as ten minutes he asked me my age and then sentenced me to be shot they woke up the court interpreter an american named jenks who was in the rum business and vice versa and told him to translate the verdict jenks stretched himself and took a morphine tablet you ve got to back up against th dobe old man says he to me three weeks i believe you get haven t got a chew of fine cut on you have you translate that again with foot notes and a glossary says i i don t know whether i m discharged condemned or handed over to the gerry society oh says jenks don t you understand you re to be stood up against a dobe wall and shot in two or three weeks three i think they said would you mind asking em which says i a week don t amount to much after you re dead but it seems a real nice long spell while you are alive it s two weeks says the interpreter after inquiring in spanish of the court shall i ask em again let be says i let s have a stationary verdict if i keep on appealing this way they ll have me shot about ten days before i was captured no i haven t got any fine cut they sends me over to the calaboza with a detachment of coloured postal telegraph boys carrying enfield rifles and i am locked up in a kind of brick bakery the temperature in there was just about the kind mentioned in the cooking recipes that call for a quick oven then i gives a silver dollar to one of the guards to send for the united states consul he comes around in pajamas with a pair of glasses on his nose and a dozen or two inside of him i m to be shot in two weeks says i and although i ve made a memorandum of it i don t seem to get it off my mind you want to call up uncle sam on the cable as quick as you can and get him all worked up about it have em send the kentucky and the kearsage and the oregon down right away that ll be about enough battleships but it wouldn t hurt to have a couple of cruisers and a torpedo boat destroyer too and say if dewey isn t busy better have him come along on the fastest one of the fleet now see here o keefe says the consul getting the best of a hiccup what do you want to bother the state department about this matter for didn t you hear me says i i m to be shot in two weeks did you think i said i was going to a lawn party and it wouldn t hurt of roosevelt could get the japs to send down the yellowyamtiskookum or the ogotosingsing or some other first class cruisers to help it would make me feel safer now what you want says the consul is not to get excited i ll send you over some chewing tobacco and some banana fritters when i go back the united states can t interfere in this you know you were caught insurging against the government and you re subject to the laws of this country to tell the truth i ve had an intimation from the state department unofficially of course that whenever a soldier of fortune demands a fleet of gunboats in a case of revolutionary katzenjammer i should cut the cable give him all the tobacco he wants and after he s shot take his clothes if they fit me for part payment of my salary consul says i to him this is a serious question you are representing uncle sam this ain t any little international tomfoolery like

over the asphalt to the edge of the sidewalk brides maids were patting one another s sashes awry and speaking of the bride s freckles coachmen tied white ribbons on their whips and bewailed the space of time between drinks the minister was musing over his possible fee essaying conjecture whether it would suffice to purchase a new broadcloth suit for himself and a photograph of laura jane libbey for his wife yea cupid was in the air and outside the church oh my brothers surged and heaved the rank and file of the tribe of rubberers in two bodies they were with the grosgrain carpet and cops with clubs between they crowded like cattle they fought they pressed and surged and swayed and trampled one another to see a bit of a girl in a white veil acquire license to go through a man s pockets while be sleeps but the hour for the wedding came and went and the bride and bridegroom came not and impatience gave way to alarm and alarm brought about search and they were not found and then two big police men took a band and dragged out of the furious mob of onlookers a crushed and trampled thing with a wedding ring in its vest pocket and a shredded and hysterical woman beating her way to the carpet s edge ragged bruised and obstreperous william pry and violet seymour creatures of habit had joined in the seething game of the specta tors unable to resist the overwhelming desire to gaze upon themselves entering as bride and bridegroom the rose decked church rubber will out one thousand dollars one thousand dollars repeated lawyer tolman solemnly and severely and here is the money young gillian gave a decidedly amused laugh as he fingered the thin package of new fifty dollar notes it s such a confoundedly awkward amount he explained genially to the lawyer if it had been ten thousand a fellow might wind up with a lot of fireworks and do himself credit even fifty dollars would have been less trouble you heard the reading of your uncle s will con tinued lawyer tolman professionally dry in his tones i do not know if you paid much attention to its details i must remind you of one you are required to render to us an account of the manner of expenditure of this as soon as you have dis posed of it the will stipulates that i trust that you will so far comply with the late mr gillian s wishes you may depend upon it said the young man politely in spite of the extra expense it will entail i may have to engage a secretary i was never good at accounts gillian went to his club there be hunted out one whom he called old bryson old bryson was calm and forty and sequestered he was in a corner reading a book and when he saw gillian approaching he sighed laid down his book and took off his glasses old bryson wake up said gillian i ve a funny story to tell you i wish you would tell it to some one in the billiard room said old bryson you know how i hate your stories this is a better one than usual said gillian rolling a cigarette and i m glad to tell it to you it s too sad and funny to go with the rattling of billiard bars i ve just come from my late uncle s firm of legal corsairs he leaves me an even thou sand dollars now what can a man possibly do with a thousand dollars i thought said old bryson showing as much interest as a bee shows in a vinegar cruet that the late septimus gillian was worth something like half a million he was assented gillian joyously and that s where the joke comes in he s left his whole cargo of doubloons to a microbe that is part of it goes to the man who invents a new bacillus and the rest to es tablish a hospital for doing away with it again there are one or two trifling bequests on the side the butler and the housekeeper get a seal ring and each his nephew gets you ve always had plenty of money to spend observed old bryson tons said gillian uncle was the fairygod mother as far as an allowance was concerned any other heirs asked old bryson none gillian frowned at his cigarette and kicked the upholstered leather of a divan uneasily there is a miss hayden a ward of my uncle who lived in his house she s a quiet thing musical the daughter of somebody who was unlucky enough to be his friend i forgot to say that she was in on the seal ring and joke too i wish i had been then i could have had two bottles of brut tipped the waiter with the ring and had the whole business off my bands don t be superior and insulting old bry son tell me what a fellow can do with a thousand dollars old bryson rubbed his glasses and smiled and when old bryson smiled gillian knew that be in tended to be more offensive than ever a thousand dollars lie said means much or little one man may buy a happy home with it and laugh at rockefeller another could send his wife south with it and save her life a thousand dollars would buy pure milk for one hundred babies during june july and august and save fifty of their lives you could count upon a half hour s diversion with it at faro in one of the fortified art galleries it would furnish an education to an ambitious boy i am told that a genuine corot was secured for that amount in an auction room yesterday you could move to a new hampshire town and live respectably two years on it you could rent madison square garden for one evening with it and lecture your audience if you should have one on the precariousness of the pro fession of heir presumptive people might like you old bryson said gillian always unruffled if you wouldn t moralize i asked you to tell me what i could do with a thousand dollars you said bryson with a gentle laugh why bobby gillian there s only one logical thing you could do you can go buy miss lotta lauriere a diamond pendant with the money and then take yourself off to idaho and inflict your presence upon a ranch i advise a sheep ranch as i have a particular dislike for sheep thanks said gillian rising i thought i could depend upon you old bryson you ve hit on the very scheme i wanted to chuck the money in a lump for i ve got to turn in an account for it and i hate itemizing gillian phoned for a cab and said to the driver the stage entrance of the columbine theatre miss lotta lauriere was assisting nature with a powder puff almost ready for her call at a crowded matinee when her dresser mentioned the name of mr gillian let it in said miss lauriere now what is it bobby i m going on in two minutes rabbit foot your right ear a little suggested gillian critically that s better it won t take two minutes for me what do you say to a little thing in the pendant line i can stand three ciphers with a figure one in front of em oh just as you say carolled miss lauriere my right glove adams say bobby did you see that necklace della stacey had on the other night twenty two hundred dollars it cost at tiffany s but of course pull my sash a little to the left adams miss lauriere for the opening chorus cried the call boy without gillian strolled out to where his cab was waiting what would you do with a thousand dollars if you had it be asked the driver open a s loon said the cabby promptly and huskily i know a place i could take money in with both hands it s a four story brick on a corner i ve got it figured out second story chinks and chop suey third floor manicures and foreign mis sions fourth floor poolroom if you was think of putting up the capital oh no said gillian i merely asked from cu riosity i take you by the hour drive til i tell you to stop eight blocks down broadway gillian poked up the trap with his cane and got out a blind man sat upon a stool on the sidewalk selling pencils gillian went out and stood before him excuse me he said but would you mind tell ing me what you would do if you bad a thousand dollars you got out of that cab that just drove up didn t you asked the blind man i did said gillian guess you are all right said the pencil dealer to ride in a cab by daylight take a look at that if you like he drew a small book from his coat pocket and held it out gillian opened it and saw that it was a bank deposit book it showed a balance of to the blind man s credit gillian returned the book and got into the cab i forgot something be said you may drive to the law offices of tolman sharp at broad way lawyer tolman looked at him hostilely and in quiringly through his gold rimmed glasses i beg your pardon said gillian cheerfully but may i ask you a question it is not an im pertinent one i hope was miss hayden left any thing by my uncle s will besides the ring and the nothing said mr tolman i thank you very much sir said gillian and on he went to his cab he gave the driver the ad dress of his late uncle s home miss hayden was writing letters in the library she was small and slender and clothed in black but you would have noticed her eyes gillian drifted in with his air of regarding the world as inconsequent i ve just come from old tolman s he explained they ve been going over the papers down there they found a gillian searched his memory for a legal term they found an amendment or a post script or something to the will it seemed that the old boy loosened up a little on second thoughts and willed you a thousand dollars i was driving up this way and tolman asked me to bring you the money here it is you d better count it to see if it s right gillian laid the money beside her hand on the desk miss hayden turned white oh she said and again oh gillian half turned and looked out the window i suppose of course be said in a low voice that you know i love you i am sorry said miss hayden taking up her money there is no use asked gillian almost light heartedly i am sorry she said again may i write a note asked gillian with a smile i re seated himself at the big library table she sup plied him with paper and pen and then went back to her secretaire gillian made out his account of his expenditure of the thousand dollars i i these words paid by the black sheep robert gillian on account of the eternal happiness owed by heaven to the best and dearest woman on earth gillian slipped his writing into an envelope bowed and went his way his cab stopped again at the offices of tolman sharp i have expended the thousand dollars he said cheerily to tolman of the gold glasses and i have come to render account of it as i agreed there is quite a feeling of summer in the air do you not think so mr tolman he tossed a white envelope on the lawyer s table you will find there a memo randum sir of the modus operandi of the vanishing of the dollars without touching the envelope mr tolman went to a door and called his partner sharp together they explored the caverns of an immense safe forth they dragged as trophy of their search a big envelope sealed with wax this they forcibly invaded and wagged their venerable heads together over its con tents then tolman became spokesman mr gillian he said formally there was a codicil to your uncle s will it was intrusted to us privately with instructions that it be not opened until you had furnished us with a full account of your handling of the bequest in the will as you have fulfilled the conditions my partner and i have read the codicil i do not wish to encumber your understanding with its legal phraseology but i will acquaint you with the spirit of its contents in the event that your disposition of the demonstrates that you possess any of the qualifica tions that deserve reward much benefit will accrue to you mr sharp and i are named as the judges and i assure you that we will do our duty strictly according to justice with liberality we are not at all unfavorably disposed toward you mr gillian but let us return to the letter of the codicil if your disposal of the money in question has been prudent wise or unselflish it is in our power to hand you over bonds to the value of which have been placed in our hands for that purpose but if as our client the late mr gillian explicitly provides you have used this money as you have money in the past i quote the late mr gillian in reprehensible dissipation among disreputable associates the is to be paid to miriam hayden ward of the late mr gillian without delay now mr gillian mr sharp and i will examine your account in regard to the you submit it in writing i believe i hope you will repose confidence in our decision mr tolman reached for the envelope gillian was a little the quicker in taking it up he tore the account and its cover leisurely into strips and dropped them into his pocket it s all right he said smilingly there isn t a bit of need to bother you with this i don t suppose you d understand these itemized bets anyway i lost the thousand dollars on the races good day to you gentlemen tolman sharp shook their beads mournfully at each other when gillian left for they heard him whis tling gayly in the hallway as he waited for the elevator the defeat of the city robert walmsley s descent upon the city resulted in a kilkenny struggle he came out of the fight victor by a fortune and a reputation on the other band he was swallowed up by the city the city gave him what he demanded and then branded him with its brand it remodelled cut trimmed and stamped him to the pattern it approves it opened its social gates to him and shut him in on a close cropped formal lawn with the select herd of rumi nants in dress habits manners provincialism routine and narrowness he acquired that charming in solence that irritating completeness that sophisti cated crassness that overbalanced poise that makes the manhattan gentleman so delightfully small in his greatness one of the up state rural counties pointed with pride to the successful young metropolitan lawyer as a product of its soil six years earlier this county had removed the wheat straw from between its huckle berry stained teeth and emitted a derisive and bucolic laugh as old man walmsley s freckle faced bob abandoned the certain three per diem meals of the one horse farm for the discontinuous quick lunch counters of the three ringed metropolis at the end of the six years no murder trial coaching party au tomobile accident or cotillion was complete in which the name of robert walmsley did not figure tailors waylaid him in the street to get a new wrinkle from the cut of his unwrinkled trousers hyphenated fel lows in the clubs and members of the oldest subpoenaed families were glad to clap him on the back and allow him three letters of his name but the matterhorn of robert walmsley s success was not scaled until be married alicia van der pool i cite the matterhorn for just so high and cool and white and inaccessible was this daughter of the old burghers the social alps that ranged about her over whose bleak passes a thousand climbers struggled reached only to her knees she towered in her own atmosphere serene chaste prideful wading in no fountains dining no monkeys breeding no dogs for bench shows she was a van der pool fountains were made to play for her monkeys were made for other people s ancestors dogs she understood were created to be companions of blind persons and objec tionable characters who smoked pipes this was the matterhorn that robert walmsley accomplished if he found with the good poet with the game foot and artificially curled hair that he who ascends to mountain tops will find the loftiest peaks most wrapped in clouds and snow he concealed his chilblains beneath a brave and smiling exterior he was a lucky man and knew it even though he were imitating the spartan boy with an ice cream freezer beneath his doublet frappeeing the region of his heart after a brief wedding tour abroad the couple re turned to create a decided ripple in the calm cistern so placid and cool and sunless it is of the best so ciety they entertained at their red brick mausoleum of ancient greatness in an old square that is a ceme tery of crumbled glory and robert walmsley was proud of his wife although while one of his hands shook his guests the other held tightly to his alpen stock and thermometer one day alicia found a letter written to robert by his mother it was an unerudite letter full of crops and motherly love and farm notes it chronicled the health of the pig and the recent red calf and asked concerning robert s in return it was a letter direct from the soil straight from home full of biographies of bees tales of turnips peaans of new laid eggs neg lected parents and the slump in dried apples why have i not been shown your mother s let ters asked alicia there was always something in her voice that made you think of lorgnettes of ac counts at tiffany s of sledges smoothly gliding on the trail from dawson to forty mile of the tinkling of pendant prisms on your grandmothers chandeliers of snow lying on a convent roof of a police sergeant refusing bail your mother continued alicia invites us to make a visit to the farm i have never seen a farm we will go there for a week or two robert we will said robert with the grand air of an associate supreme justice concurring in an opinion i did not lay the invitation before you because i thought you would not care to go i am much pleased at your decision i will write to her myself answered alicia with a faint foreshadowing of enthusiasm felice shall pack my trunks at once seven i think will be enough i do not suppose that your mother entertains a great deal does she give many house parties robert arose and as attorney for rural places filed a demurrer against six of the seven trunks he en deavored to define picture elucidate set forth and describe a farm his own words sounded strange in his ears he had not realized how thoroughly urbsi dized he had become a week passed and found them landed at the little country station five hours out from the city a grin ning stentorian sarcastic youth driving a mule to a spring wagon hailed robert savagely hallo mr walmsley found your way back at last have you sorry i couldn t bring in the auto mobile for you but dad s bull tonguing the ten acre clover patch with it to day guess you ll excuse my not wearing a dress suit over to meet you it ain t six o clock yet you know i m glad to see you tom said robert grasp ing his brother s band yes i ve found my way at last you ve a right to say at last it s been over two years since the last time but it will be oftener after this my boy alicia cool in the summer beat as an arctic wraith white as a norse snow maiden in her flimsy muslin and fluttering lace parasol came round the corner of the station and tom was stripped of his assurance he became chiefly eyesight clothed in blue jeans and on the homeward drive to the mule alone did he confide in language the inwardness of his thoughts they drove homeward the low sun dropped a spendthrift flood of gold upon the fortunate fields of wheat the cities were far away the road lay curl ing around wood and dale and bill like a ribbon lost from the robe of careless summer the wind followed like a whinnying colt in the track of phoebus s steeds by and by the farmhouse peeped gray out of its faithful grove they saw the long lane with its convoy of walnut trees running from the road to the house they smelled the wild rose and the breath of cool damp willows in the creek s bed and then in unison all the voices of the soil began a chant addressed to the soul of robert walmsley out of the tilted aisles of the dim wood they came hollowly they chirped and buzzed from the parched grass they trilled from the ripples of the creek ford they floated up in clear pan s pipe notes from the dimming meadows the whippoorwills joined in as they pursued midges in the upper air slow going cow bells struck out a homely accompaniment and this was what each one said you ve found your way back at last have you the old voices of the soil spoke to him leaf and bud and blossom conversed with him in the old vocabu lary of his careless youth the inanimate things the familiar stones and rails the gates and furrows and roofs and turns of the road had an eloquence too and a power in the transformation the country had smiled and he had felt the breath of it and his heart was drawn as if in a moment back to his old love the city was far away this rural atavism then seized robert walmsley and possessed him a queer thing he noticed in con nection with it was that alicia sitting at his side suddenly seemed to him a stranger she did not be long to this recurrent phase never before had she seemed so remote so colorless and high so intan gible and unreal and yet he had never admired her more than when she sat there by him in the rickety spring wagon chiming no more with his mood and with her environment than the matterhorn chimes with a peasant s cabbage garden that night when the greetings and the supper were over the entire family including buff the yellow dog bestrewed itself upon the front porch alicia not haughty but silent sat in the shadow dressed in an exquisite pale gray tea gown robert s mother dis coursed to her happily concerning marmalade and lumbago tom sat on the top step sisters millie and pam on the lowest step to catch the lightning bugs mother had the willow rocker father sat in the big armchair with one of its arms gone buff sprawled in the middle of the porch in everybody s way the twilight pixies and pucks stole forth un seen and plunged other poignant shafts of memory into the heart of robert a rural madness entered his soul the city was far away father sat without his pipe writhing in his heavy boots a sacrifice to rigid courtesy robert shouted no you don t he fetched the pipe and lit it he seized the old gentleman s boots and tore them off the last one slipped suddenly and mr robert walmsley of washington square tumbled off the porch backward with buff on top of him bowling fearfully tom laughed sarcastically robert tore off his coat and vest and hurled them into a lilac bush come out here you landlubber be cried to tom and i ll put grass seed on your back i think you called me a dude a while ago come along and cut your capers tom understood the invitation and accepted it with delight three times they wrestled on the grass side holds even as the giants of the mat and twice was tom forced to bite grass at the hands of the distinguished lawyer dishevelled panting each still boasting of his own prowess they stumbled back to the porch millie cast a pert reflection upon the qualities of a city brother in an instant robert had secured a horrid katydid in his fingers and bore down upon her screaming wildly she fled up the lane pursued by the avenging glass of form a quarter of a mile and they returned she full of apology to the victorious dude the rustic mania possessed him unabatedly i can do up a cowpenful of you slow hayseeds he proclaimed vaingloriously bring on your bull dogs your hired men and your log rollers he turned handsprings on the grass that prodded tom to envious sarcasm and then with a whoop he clattered to the rear and brought back uncle like a battered colored retainer of the family with his banjo and strewed sand on the porch and danced chicken in the bread tray and did buck and wing wonders for half an hour longer incredibly wild and boisterous things he did he sang he told stories that set all but one shrieking he played the yokel the humorous clodhopper he was mad and with the revival of the old life in his blood he became so extravagant that once his mother sought gently to reprove him then alicia moved as though she were about to speak but she did not through it all she sat immovable a slim white spirit in the dusk that no man might question or read by and by she asked permission to ascend to her room saying that she was tired on her way she passed robert he was standing in the door the figure of vulgar comedy with ruffled hair reddened face and unpardonable confusion of attire no trace there of the immaculate robert walmsley the courted clubman and ornament of select circles he was do ing a conjuring trick with some household utensils and the family now won over to him without excep tion was beholding him with worshipful admiration as alicia passed in robert started suddenly he had forgotten for the moment that she was present without a glance at him she went on upstairs after that the fun grew quiet an hour passed in talk and then robert went up himself she was standing by the window when he entered their room she was still clothed as when they were on the porch outside and crowding against the window was a giant apple tree full blossomed robert sighed and went near the window he was ready to meet his fate a confessed vulgarian he foresaw the verdict of justice in the shape of that whiteclad form he knew the rigid lines that a van der pool would draw he was a peasant gam bolling indecorously in the valley and the pure cold white unthawed summit of the matterhorn could not but frown on him he had been unmasked by his own actions all the polish the poise the form that the city had given him had fallen from him like an ill fitting mantle at the first breath of a country breeze dully be awaited the approaching condemna tion robert said the calm cool voice of his judge i thought i married a gentleman yes it was coming and yet in the face of it robert walmsley was eagerly regarding a certain branch of the apple tree upon which be used to climb out of that very window he believed he could do it now he wondered bow many blossoms there were on the tree ten millions but here was some one speaking again i thought i married a gentleman the voice went on but why had she come and was standing so close by his side but i find that i have married was this alicia talking something better a man bob dear kiss me won t you the city was far away the shocks of doom here is an aristocracy of the public parks and even of the vagabonds who use them for their private apartments vallance felt rather than knew this but when he stepped down out of his world into chaos his feet brought him directly to madison square raw and astringent as a schoolgirl of the old order young may breathed austerely among the budding trees vallance buttoned his coat lighted his last cigarette and took his seat upon a bench for three minutes be mildly regretted the last hundred of his last thousand that it had cost him when the bicycle cop put an end to his last automobile ride then he felt in every pocket and found not a single penny he had given up his apartment that morning his furniture had gone toward certain debts his clothes save what were upon him had descended to his man servant for back wages as he sat there was not in the whole city for him a bed or a broiled lobster or a street car fare or a carnation for buttonhole unless be should obtain them by spong on his friends or by false pretenses therefore lie had chosen the park and all this was because an uncle had disinherited him and cut down his allowance from liberality to nothing and all that was because his nephew had disobeyed him concerning a certain girl who comes not into this story therefore all readers who brush their hair toward its roots may be warned to read no further there was another nephew of a different branch who had once been the prospective heir and favorite being without grace or hope he had long ago disappeared in the mire now drag nets were out for him he was to be rehabilitated and restored and so vallance fell grandly as lucifer to the lowest pit joining the tattered ghosts in the little park sitting there he leaned far back on the hard bench and laughed a jet of cigarette smoke up to the lowest tree branches the sudden severing of all his life s ties had brought him a free thrilling almost joyous elation he felt precisely the sensation of the aero naut when he cuts loose his parachute and lets his balloon drift away the hour was nearly ten not many loungers were on the benches the park dweller though a stubborn fighter against autumnal coolness is slow to attack the advance line of spring s chilly cohorts then arose one from a seat near the leaping foun tain and came and sat himself at vallance s side he was either young or old cheap lodging houses had flavored him mustily razors and combs had passed him by in him drink had been bottled and sealed in the devil s bond he begged a match which is the form of introduction among park benchers and then he began to talk you re not one of the regulars he said to val lance i know tailored clothes when i see em you just stopped for a moment on your way through the park don t mind my talking to you for a while i ve got to be with somebody i m afraid i m afraid i ve told two or three of those bummers over about it they think i m crazy say let tell you all i ve had to eat to day was a couple pretzels and an apple to morrow i ll stand in to inherit three millions and that restaurant you ee over there with the autos around it will be too for me to eat in don t believe it do you without the slightest trouble said vallance with a laugh i lunched there yesterday to night i couldn t buy a five cent cup of coffee you don t look like one of us well i guess those things happen i used to be a high flyer myself years ago what knocked you out of the game i oh i lost my job said vallance it s undiluted hades this city went on the other one day you re eating from china the next you are eating in china a chop suey joint i ve had more than my share of hard luck for five years i ve been little better than a panhandler i was raised up to live expensively and do nothing say i don t mind telling you i ve got to talk to somebody you see because i m afraid i m afraid my name s ide you wouldn t think that old paulding one of the millionaires on riverside drive was my uncle would you well he is i lived in his house once and had all the money i wanted say haven t you got the price of a couple of drinks about you er what s your name dawson said vallance no i m sorry to say that i m all in financially i ve been living for a week in a coal cellar on division street went on ide with a crook they called blinky morris i didn t have anywhere else to go while i was out to day a chap with some pa pers in his pocket was there asking for me i didn t know but what he was a fly cop so i didn t go around again till after dark there was a letter there be had left for me say dawson it was from a big downtown lawyer mead i ve seen his sign on ann street paulding wants me to play the prodigal nephew wants me to come back and be his heir again and blow in his money i m to call at the lawyer s office at ten to morrow and step into my old shoes again heir to three million dawson and a year pocket money and i m afraid i m afraid the vagrant leaped to his feet and raised both trembling arms above his bead he caught his breath and moaned hysterically vallance seized his arm and forced him back to the bench be quiet he commanded with something like disgust in his tones one would think you had lost a fortune instead of being about to acquire one of what are you afraid ide cowered and shivered on the bench he clung to vallance s sleeve and even in the dim glow of the broadway lights the latest disinherited one could see drops on the other s brow wrung out by some strange terror why i m afraid something will happen to me be fore morning i don t know what something to keep me from coming into that money i m afraid a tree will fall on me i m afraid a cab will run over me or a stone drop on me from a housetop or some thing i never was afraid before i ve sat in this park a hundred nights as calm as a graven image without knowing where my breakfast was to come from but now it s different i love money daw son i m happy as a god when it s trickling through my fingers and people are bowing to me with the music and the flowers and fine clothes all around as long as i knew i was out of the game i didn t mind i was even happy sitting here ragged and hungry listening to the fountain jump and watching the carriages go up the avenue but it s in reach of my hand again now almost and i can t stand it to wait twelve hours dawson i can t stand it there are fifty things that could happen to me i could go blind i might be attacked with heart disease the world might come to an end before i could ide sprang to his feet again with a shriek peo ple stirred on the benches and began to look val lance took his arm come and walk he said soothingly and try to calm yourself there is no need to become ex cited or alarmed nothing is going to happen to you one night is like another that s right said ide stay with me daw son that s a good fellow walk around with me awhile i never went to pieces like this before and i ve had a good many hard knocks do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch old man i m afraid my nerve s too far gone to try any panhandling vallance led his companion up almost deserted fifth avenue and then westward along the thirties toward broadway wait here a few minutes he said leaving ide in a quiet and shadowed spot he entered a familiar hotel and strolled toward the bar quite in his old assured way there s a poor devil outside jimmy he said to the bartender who says he s hungry and looks it you know what they do when you give them money fix up a sandwich or two for him and i ll see that he doesn t throw it away certainly mr vallance said the bartender they ain t all fakes don t like to see anybody go hungry ide folded a liberal supply of the free lunch into a napkin vallance went with it and joined his com panion ide pounced upon the food ravenously i haven t had any free lunch as good as this in a year be said aren t you going to eat any dawson i m not hungry thanks said vallance we ll go back to the square said ide the cops won t bother us there i ll roll up the rest of this ham and stuff for our breakfast i won t eat any more i m afraid i ll get sick suppose i d die of cramps or something to night and never get to touch that money again it s eleven hours yet till time to see that lawyer you won t leave me will you dawson i m afraid something might happen you haven t any place to go have you no said vallance nowhere to night i ll have a bench with you you take it cool said ide if you ve told it to me straight i should think a man put on the bum from a good job just in one day would be tearing his hair i believe i ve already remarked said vallance laughing that i would have thought that a man who was expecting to come into a fortune on the next day would be feeling pretty easy and quiet it s funny business philosophized ide about the way people take things anyhow here s your bench dawson right next to mine the light don t shine in your eyes here say dawson i ll get the old man to give you a letter to somebody about a job when i get back home you ve helped me a lot to night i don t believe i could have gone through the night if i hadn t struck you thank you said vallance do you lie down or sit up on these when you sleep for hours vallance gazed almost without winking at the stars through the branches of the trees and listened to the sharp slapping of horses hoofs on the sea of asphalt to the south his mind was active but his feelings were dormant every emotion seemed to have been eradicated ide felt no regrets no fears no pain or discomfort even when be thought of the girl it was as of an inhabitant of one of those remote stars at which be gazed he re membered the absurd antics of his companion and laughed softly yet without a feeling of mirth soon the daily army of milk wagons made of the city a roaring drum to which they marched vallance fell asleep on his comfortless bench at ten o clock on the next day the two stood at the door of lawyer mead s office in ann street ide s nerves fluttered worse than ever when the hour approached and vallance could not decide to leave him a possible prey to the dangers he dreaded when they entered the office lawyer mead looked at them wonderingly he and vallance were old friends after his greeting he turned to ide who stood with white face and trembling limbs before the expected crisis i sent a second letter to your address last night mr ide he said i learned this morning that you were not there to receive it it will inform you that mr paulding has reconsidered his offer to take you back into favor he has decided not to do so and desires you to understand that no change will be made in the relations existing between you and him ide s trembling suddenly ceased the color came back to his face and be straightened his back his jaw went forward half an inch and a gleam came into his eye he pushed back his battered bat with one hand and extended the other with levelled fin gers toward the lawyer he took a long breath and then laughed sardonically tell old paulding he may go to the devil he said loudly and clearly and turned and walked out of the office with a firm and lively step lawyer mead turned on his heel to vallance and smiled i am glad you came in he said genially your uncle wants you to return home at once he is reconciled to the situation that led to his hasty action and desires to say that all will be as hey adams cried lawyer mead breaking his sentence and calling to his clerk bring a glass of water mr vallance has fainted the plutonian fire there are a few editor men with whom i am privi leged to come in contact it has not been long since it was their habit to come in contact with me there is a difference they tell me that with a large number of the manuscripts that are submitted to them come advices in the way of a boost from the author asseverating that the incidents in the story are true the des tination of such contributions depends wholly upon the question of the enclosure of stamps some are returned the rest are thrown on the floor in a corner on top of a pair of gum shoes an overturned statu ette of the winged victory and a pile of old maga zines containing a picture of the editor in the act of reading the latest copy of le petit journal right side up you can tell by the illustrations it is only a legend that there are waste baskets in editors offices thus is truth held in disrepute but in time truth and science and nature will adapt themselves to art things will happen logically and the villain be dis comfited instead of being elected to the board of directors but in the meantime fiction must not only be divorced from fact but must pay alimony and be awarded custody of the press despatches this preamble is to warn you off the grade cross ing of a true story being that it shall be told sim ply with conjunctions substituted for adjectives wherever possible and whatever evidences of style may appear in it shall be due to the linotype man it is a story of the literary life in a great city and it should be of interest to every author within a mile radius of gosport ind whose desk holds a ms story beginning thus while the cheers following his nomination were still ringing through the old courthouse harwood broke away from the congrat ulating handclasps of his henchmen and hurried to judge creswell s house to find ida pettit came up out of alabama to write fiction the southern papers had printed eight of his stories under an editorial caption identifying the author as the son of the gallant major pettingill pettit our former county attorney and hero of the battle of lookout mountain pettit was a rugged fellow with a kind of shame faced culture and my good friend his father kept a general store in a little town called hosea pettit had been raised in the pine woods and broom sedge fields adjacent thereto he had in his gripsack two manuscript novels of the adventures in picardy of one gaston laboulaye vicompte de montrepos in the year that s nothing we all do that and some day when we make a hit with the little sketch about a newsy and his lame dog the editor prints the other one for us or on us as the say ing is and then and then we have to get a big valise and peddle those patent air draft gas burners at everybody should have em i took pettit to the red brick house which was to appear in an article entitled literary landmarks of old new york some day when we got through with it he engaged a room there drawing on the general store for his expenses i showed new york to him and he did not mention how much narrower broadway is than lee avenue in hosea this seemed a good sign so i put the final test suppose you try your band at a descriptive arti cle i suggested giving your impressions of new york as seen from the brooklyn bridge the fresh point of view the don t be a fool said pettit let s go have some beer on the whole i rather like the city we discovered and enjoyed the only true bohemia every day and night we repaired to one of those palaces of marble and glass and tilework where goes on a tremendous and sounding epic of life valhalla itself could not be more glorious and sonorous the classic marble on which we ate the great light flooded vitreous front adorned with snow white scrolls the grand wagnerian din of clanking cups and bowls the flashing staccato of brandishing cut lery the piercing recitative of the white aproned grub maidens at the morgue like banquet tables the recurrent lied motif of the cash register it was a gigantic triumphant welding of art and sound a deafening soul uplifting pageant of heroic and em blematic life and the beans were only ten cents we wondered why our fellow artists cared to dine at sad little tables in their so called bohemian restau rants and we shuddered lest they should seek out our resorts and make them conspicuous with their pres ence pettit wrote many stories which the editors re turned to him he wrote love stories a thing i have always kept free from holding the belief that the well known and popular sentiment is not properly a matter for publication but something to be privately handled by the alienists and florists but the editors had told him that they wanted love stories because they said the women read them now the editors are wrong about that of course women do not read the love stories in the magazines they read the poker game stories and the recipes for cucumber lotion the love stories are read by fat cigar drummers and little ten year old girls i am not criticising the judgment of editors they are mostly very fine men but a man can be but one man with individual opinions and tastes i knew two associate editors of a magazine who were won derfully alike in almost everything and yet one of them was very fond of flaubert while the other preferred gin pettit brought me his returned manuscripts and we looked them over together to find out why they were not accepted they seemed to me pretty fair stories written in a good style and ended as they should at the bottom of the last page they were well constructed and the events were marshalled in orderly and logical sequence but i thought i detected a lack of living substance it was much as if i gazed at a symmetrical array of presentable clamshells from which the succulent and vital inhabitants had been removed i intimated that the author might do well to get better acquainted with his theme you sold a story last week said pettit about a gun fight in an arizona mining town in which the hero drew his colt s and shot seven bandits as fast as they came in the door now if a six shooter could oh well said i that s different arizona is a long way from new york i could have a man stabbed with a lariat or chased by a pair of chap arreras if i wanted to and it wouldn t be noticed until the usual error sharp from around mcadams junction isolates the erratum and writes in to the pa pers about it but you are up against another proposition this thing they call love is as common around new york as it is in sheboygan during the young onion season it may be mixed here with a little commercialism they read byron but they look up bradstreet s too while they re among the b s and brigham also if they have time but it s pretty much the same old internal disturbance every where you can fool an editor with a fake picture of a cowboy mounting a pony with his left hand on the saddle horn but you can t put him up a tree with a love story so you ve got to fall in love and then write the real thing pettit did i never knew whether he was taking my advice or whether be fell an accidental victim there was a girl be had met at one of these studio contrivances a glorious impudent lucid open minded girl with hair the color of culmbacher and a good natured way of despising you she was a new york girl well as the narrative style permits us to say in frequently pettit went to pieces all those pains those lover s doubts those heart burnings and tremors of which be had written so unconvincingly were his talk about shylock s pound of flesh twenty five pounds cupid got from pettit which is the usurer one night pettit came to my room exalted pale and haggard but exalted she had given him a jonquil old hoss said he with a new smile flickering around his mouth i believe i could write that story to night the one you know that is to win out i can feel it i don t know whether it will come out or not but i can feel it i pushed him out of my door go to your room and write it i ordered else i can see your fin ish i told you this must come first write it to night and put it under my door when it is done put it under my door to night when it is finished don t keep it until to morrow i was reading my bully old pal montaigne at two o clock when i beard the sheets rustle under my door i gathered them up and read the story the hissing of geese the languishing cooing of doves the braying of donkeys the chatter of irre sponsible sparrows these were in my mind s ear as i read suffering sappho i exclaimed to myself is this the divine fire that is supposed to ignite genius and make it practicable and wage earning the story was sentimental drivel full of whim pering softheartedness and gushing egoism all the art that pettit had acquired was gone a pe rusal of its buttery phrases would have made a cynic of a sighing chambermaid in the morning pettit came to my room i read him his doom mercilessly he laughed idiotically all right old hoss he said cheerily make cigar lighters of it what s the difference i m going to take her to lunch at claremont to day there was about a month of it and then pettit came to me bearing an invisible mitten with the forti tude of a dish rag he talked of the grave and south america and prussic acid and i lost an after noon getting him straight i took him out and saw that large and curative doses of whiskey were ad ministered to him i warned you this was a true story ware your white ribbons if only follow this tale for two weeks i fed him whiskey and omar and read to him regularly every evening the column in the evening paper that reveals the secrets of fe male beauty i recommend the treatment after pettit was cured be wrote more stories he recovered his old time facility and did work just short of good enough then the curtain rose on the third act a little dark eyed silent girl from new hamp shire who was studying applied design fell deeply in love with him she was the intense sort but ex ternally glace such as new england sometimes fools us with pettit liked her mildly and took her about a good deal she worshipped him and now and then ignored him there came a climax when she tried to jump out of a window and he had to save her by some perfunc tary unmeant wooing even i was shaken by the depths of the absorbing affection she showed home friends traditions creeds went up like thistle down in the scale against her love it was really discom posing one night again pettit sauntered in yawning as he had told me before he said he felt that he could do a great story and as before i hunted him to his room and saw him open his inkstand at one o clock the sheets of paper slid under my door i read that story and i jumped up late as it was with a whoop of joy old pettit had done it just as though it lay there red and bleeding a woman s heart was written into the lines you couldn t see the joining but art exquisite art and pulsing na ture had been combined into a love story that took you by the throat like the quinsy i broke into pettit s room and beat him on the back and called him name names high up in the galaxy of the im mortals that we admired and pettit yawned and begged to be allowed to sleep on the morrow i dragged him to an editor the great man read and rising gave pettit his hand that was a decoration a wreath of bay and a guar antee of rent and then old pettit smiled slowly i call him gen tleman pettit now to myself it s a miserable name to give a man but it sounds better than it looks in print i see said old pettit as he took up his story and began tearing it into small strips i see the game now you can t write with ink and you can t write with your own heart s blood but you can write with the heart s blood of some one else you have to be a cad before you can be an artist well i am for old alabam and the major s store have you got a light old hoss i went with pettit to the depot and died hard shakespeare s sonnets i blurted making a last stand how about him a cad said pettit they give it to you and you sell it love you know i d rather sell ploughs for father but i protested you are reversing the de cision of the world s greatest good by old hoss said pettit critics i continued but say if the major can use a fairly good salesman and book keeper down there in the store let me know will you nemesis and the candy man we sail at eight in the morning on the celtic said honoria plucking a loose thread from her lace sleeve i heard so said young ives dropping his hat and muffing it as he tried to catch it and i came around to wish you a pleasant voyage of course you heard it said honoria coldly sweet since we have had no opportunity of inform ing you ourselves ives looked at her pleadingly but with little hope outside in the street a high pitched voice chanted not unmusically a commercial gamut of cand de ee ee s nice fresh cand ee ee ee ees d it s our old candy man said honoria leaning out the window and beckoning i want some of his motto kisses there s nothing in the broadway shops half so good the candy man stopped his pushcart in front of the old madison avenue home he had a holiday and festival air unusual to street peddlers his tie was new and bright red and a horseshoe pin almost life size glittered speciously from its folds his brown thin face was crinkled into a semi foolish smile striped cuffs with dog head buttons covered the tan on his wrists i do believe he s going to get married said honoria pityingly i never saw him taken that way before and to day is the first time in months that he has cried his wares i am sure ives threw a coin to the sidewalk the candy man knows his customers he filled a paper bag climbed the old fashioned stoop and banded it in i remember said ives wait said honoria she took a small portfolio from the drawer of a writing desk and from the portfolio a slip of flimsy paper one quarter of an inch by two inches in size this said honoria inflexibly was wrapped about the first one we opened it was a year ago apologized ives as he held out his hand for it as long as skies above are blue to you my love i will be true this he read from the slip of flimsy paper we were to have sailed a fortnight ago said honoria gossipingly it has been such a warm summer the town

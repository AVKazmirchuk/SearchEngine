forever in one long regretful sigh but as he thus made renunciation his breath formed a word or two you was the only one tamales what seen anything in it it did look like a steer didn t it old hoss phoebe you are a man of many novel adventures and varied enterprises i said to captain patricio malone do you believe that the possible element of good luck or bad luck if there is such a thing as luck has influenced your career or persisted for or against you to such an extent that you were forced to attribute results to the operation of the aforesaid good luck or bad luck this question of almost the dull insolence of legal phraseology was put while we sat in rousselin s little red tiled cafe near congo square in new orleans brown faced white hatted finger ringed captains of adventure came often to rousselin s for the cognac they came from sea and land and were chary of relating the things they had seen not because they were more wonderful than the fantasies of the ananiases of print but because they were so different and i was a perpetual wedding guest always striving to cast my buttonhole over the finger of one of these mariners of fortune this captain malone was a hiberno iberian creole who had gone to and fro in the earth and walked up and down in it he looked like any other well dressed man of thirty five whom you might meet except that he was hopelessly weather tanned and wore on his chain an ancient ivory and gold peruvian charm against evil which has nothing at all to do with this story my answer to your question said the captain smiling will be to tell you the story of bad luck kearny that is if you don t mind hearing it my reply was to pound on the table for rousselin strolling along tchoupitoulas street one night began captain malone i noticed without especially taxing my interest a small man walking rapidly toward me he stepped upon a wooden cellar door crashed through it and disappeared i rescued him from a heap of soft coal below he dusted himself briskly swearing fluently in a mechanical tone as an underpaid actor recites the gypsy s curse gratitude and the dust in his throat seemed to call for fluids to clear them away his desire for liquidation was expressed so heartily that i went with him to a cafe down the street where we had some vile vermouth and bitters looking across that little table i had my first clear sight of francis kearny he was about five feet seven but as tough as a cypress knee his hair was darkest red his mouth such a mere slit that you wondered how the flood of his words came rushing from it his eyes were the brightest and lightest blue and the hopefulest that i ever saw he gave the double impression that he was at bay and that you had better not crowd him further just in from a gold hunting expedition on the coast of costa rica he explained second mate of a banana steamer told me the natives were panning out enough from the beach sands to buy all the rum red calico and parlour melodeons in the world the day i got there a syndicate named incorporated jones gets a government concession to all minerals from a given point for a next choice i take coast fever and count green and blue lizards for six weeks in a grass hut i had to be notified when i was well for the reptiles were actually there then i shipped back as third cook on a norwegian tramp that blew up her boiler two miles below quarantine i was due to bust through that cellar door here to night so i hurried the rest of the way up the river roustabouting on a lower coast packet that made up a landing for every fisherman that wanted a plug of tobacco and now i m here for what comes next and it ll be along it ll be along said this queer mr kearny it ll be along on the beams of my bright but not very particular star from the first the personality of kearny charmed me i saw in him the bold heart the restless nature and the valiant front against the buffets of fate that make his countrymen such valuable comrades in risk and adventure and just then i was wanting such men moored at a fruit company s pier i had a ton steamer ready to sail the next day with a cargo of sugar lumber and corrugated iron for a port in well let us call the country esperando it has not been long ago and the name of patricio malone is still spoken there when its unsettled politics are discussed beneath the sugar and iron were packed a thousand winchester rifles in aguas frias the capital don rafael valdevia minister of war esperando s greatest hearted and most able patriot awaited my coming no doubt you have heard with a smile of the insignificant wars and uprisings in those little tropic republics they make but a faint clamour against the din of great nations battles but down there under all the ridiculous uniforms and petty diplomacy and senseless countermarching and intrigue are to be found statesmen and patriots don rafael valdevia was one his great ambition was to raise esperando into peace and honest prosperity and the respect of the serious nations so he waited for my rifles in aguas frias but one would think i am trying to win a recruit in you no it was francis kearny i wanted and so i told him speaking long over our execrable vermouth breathing the stifling odour from garlic and tarpaulins which as you know is the distinctive flavour of cafes in the

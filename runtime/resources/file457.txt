steps to the sidewalk and then hurried away frontward fully understanding how incidents like that must bother the psychical research people and the census takers of course i heard an explanation of it afterward as we always do about inexplicable things the landlady was mrs kannon and she leased three adjoining houses which she made into one by cutting arched doorways through the walls she sat in the middle house and answered the three bells i wonder why i have maundered so slowly through the prologue i have it it was simply to say to you in the form of introduction rife through the middle west shake hands with mrs kannon for it was in her triple house that the christmas story happened and it was there where i picked up the incontrovertible facts from the gossip of many roomers and met stickney and saw the necktie christmas came that year on thursday and snow came with it stickney harry clarence fowler stickney to whomsoever his full baptismal cognominal burdens may be of interest reached his address at six thirty wednesday afternoon address is new yorkese for home stickney roomed at west teenth street third floor rear hall room he was twenty years and four months old and he worked in a cameras of all kinds photographic supplies and films developed store i don t know what kind of work he did in the store but you must have seen him he is the young man who always comes behind the counter to wait on you and lets you talk for five minutes telling him what you want when you are done he calls the proprietor at the top of his voice to wait on you and walks away whistling between his teeth i don t want to bother about describing to you his appearance but if you are a man reader i will say that stickncy looked precisely like the young chap that you always find sitting in your chair smoking a cigarette after you have missed a shot while playing pool not billiards but pool when you want to sit down yourself there are some to whom christmas gives no christmassy essence of course prosperous people and comfortable people who have homes or flats or rooms with meals and even people who live in apartment houses with hotel service get something of the christmas flavor they give one another presents with the cost mark scratched off with a penknife and they hang holly wreaths in the front windows and when they are asked whether they prefer light or dark meat from the turkey they say both please and giggle and have lots of fun and the very poorest people have the best time of it the army gives em a dinner and the a m issue of the night final edition of the newspaper with the largest circulation in the city leaves a basket at their door full of an apple a lake ronkonkoma squab a scrambled eggplant and a bunch of kalamazoo bleached parsley the poorer you are the more christmas does for you but i ll tell you to what kind of a mortal christmas seems to be only the day before the twenty sixth day of december it s the chap in the big city earning sixteen dollars a week with no friends and few acquaintances who finds himself with only fifty cents in his pocket on christmas eve he can t accept charity he can t borrow he knows no one who would invite him to dinner i have a fancy that when the shepherds left their flocks to follow the star of bethlehem there was a bandy legged young fellow among them who was just learning the sheep business so they said to him bobby we re going to investigate this star route and see what s in it if it should turn out to be the first christmas day we don t want to miss it and as you are not a wise man and as you couldn t possibly purchase a present to take along suppose you stay behind and mind the sheep so as we may say harry stickney was a direct descendant of the shepherd who was left behind to take care of the flocks getting back to facts stickney rang the doorbell of he had a habit of forgetting his latchkey instantly the door opened and there stood mrs kannon clutching her sacque together at the throat and gorgonizing him with her opaque yellow eyes to give you good measure here is a story within a story once a roomer in who had the scotch habit not kilts but a habit of drinking scotch began to figure to himself what might happen if two persons should ring the doorbells of and at the same time visions of two halves of mrs kannon appearing respectively and simultaneously at the two entrances each clutching at a side of an open flapping sacque that could never meet overpowered him bellevue got him evening said stickney cheerlessly as he distributed little piles of muddy slush along the hall matting think we ll have snow you left your key said here the manuscript ends the unprofitable servant left unfinished and published as it here appears in everybody s magazine december i am the richer by the acquaintance of four newspaper men singly they are my encyclopedias friends mentors and sometimes bankers but now and then it happens that all of them will pitch upon the same printworthy incident of the passing earthly panorama and will send in reportorial constructions thereof to their respective journals it is then that for me it is to laugh for it seems that to each of them trained and skilled as he may be the same occurrence presents a different facet of the cut diamond life one will have it let us say that mme andre macarte s apartment was looted by six burglars who descended via the

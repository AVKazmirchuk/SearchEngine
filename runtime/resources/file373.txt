general replied the governor stiffly my son is forty two he is quite capable of deciding such questions for himself and i as his parent feel it my duty to state that your remark about er rheumatism is a mighty poor shot from a very small bore sir aimed at a purely personal and private affliction if you will allow me retorted the general you ve afflicted the public with it for some time and twas no small bore at that this first tiff between the two old comrades might have grown into something more serious but for the fortunate interruption caused by the ostentatious approach of colonel titus and another one of the court retinue from the right county to whom the general confided the coddled statesman and went his way after billy had so effectually entombed his ambitions and taken the veil so to speak in a sonnery he was surprised to discover how much lighter of heart and happier he felt he realized what a long restless struggle he had maintained and how much he had lost by failing to cull the simple but wholesome pleasures by the way his heart warmed now to elmville and the friends who had refused to set him upon a pedestal it was better he began to think to be billy and his father s son and to be hailed familiarly by cheery neighbours and grown up playmates than to be your honour and sit among strangers hearing maybe through the arguments of learned counsel that old man s feeble voice crying what would i do without you my son billy began to surprise his acquaintances by whistling as he walked up the street others he astounded by slapping them disrespectfully upon their backs and raking up old anecdotes he had not had the time to recollect for years though he hammered away at his law cases as thoroughly as ever he found more time for relaxation and the company of his friends some of the younger set were actually after him to join the golf club a striking proof of his abandonment to obscurity was his adoption of a most undignified rakish little soft hat reserving

forgotten by both but one day elmville woke to sudden excitement the news had come that a touring presidential party would honour elmville by a twenty minute stop the executive had promised a five minute address from the balcony of the palace hotel elmville rose as one man that man being of course general deffenbaugh to receive becomingly the chieftain of all the clans the train with the tiny stars and stripes fluttering from the engine pilot arrived elmville had done her best there were bands flowers carriages uniforms banners and committees without end high school girls in white frocks impeded the steps of the party with roses strewn nervously in bunches the chieftain had seen it all before scores of times he could have pictured it exactly in advance from the blue and gray speech down to the smallest rosebud yet his kindly smile of interest greeted elmville s display as if it had been the only and original in the upper rotunda of the palace hotel the town s most illustrious were assembled for the honour of being presented to the distinguished guests previous to the expected address outside elmville s inglorious but patriotic masses filled the streets here in the hotel general deffenbaugh was holding in reserve elmville s trump card elmville knew for the trump was a fixed one and its lead consecrated by archaic custom at the proper moment governor pemberton beautifully venerable magnificently antique tall paramount stepped forward upon the arm of the general elmville watched and harked with bated breath never until now when a northern president of the united states should clasp hands with ex war governor pemberton would the breach be entirely closed would the country be made one and indivisible no north not much south very little east and no west to speak of so elmville excitedly scraped kalsomine from the walls of the palace hotel with its sunday best and waited for the voice to speak and billy we had nearly forgotten billy he was cast for son and he waited patiently for his cue he carried his plug in his hand and felt serene he admired his father s striking air and pose after all it was a great deal to be a son of a man who could so gallantly hold the position of a cynosure for three generations general deffenbaugh cleared his throat elmville opened its mouth and squirmed the chieftain with the kindly fateful face was holding out his hand smiling ex war governor pemberton extended his own across the chasm but what was this the general was saying mr president allow me to present to you one who has the honour to be the father of our foremost distinguished citizen learned and honoured jurist beloved townsman and model southern gentleman the honourable william b pemberton the enchanted kiss but a clerk in the cut rate drug

spell it with the cotton and tissue paper off mellinger appears shaky and breaks his glass against the neck of the bottle i says to myself white man if i m not mistaken there s been a bait laid out where the tail of your eye could see it that night according to arrangements me and henry took the phonograph to a room in a dobe house in a dirty side street where the grass was knee high twas a long room lit with smoky oil lamps there was plenty of chairs and a table at the back end we set the phonograph on the table mellinger was there walking up and down disturbed in his predicaments he chewed cigars and spat em out and he bit the thumb nail of his left hand by and by the invitations to the musicale come sliding in by pairs and threes and spade flushes their color was of a diversity running from a three day s smoked meerschaum to a patent leather polish they were as polite as wax being devastated with enjoyments to give senor mellinger the good evenings i understood their spanish talk i ran a pumping engine two years in a mexican silver mine and had it pat but i never let on maybe fifty of em had come and was seated when in slid the king bee the governor of the district mellinger met him at the door and escorted him to the grand stand when i saw that latin man i knew that mellinger private secretary had all the dances on his card taken that was a big squashy man the color of a rubber overshoe and he had an eye like a head waiter s mellinger explained fluent in the castilian idioms that his soul was disconcerted with joy at introducing to his respected friends america s greatest invention the wonder of the age henry got the cue and run on an elegant brass band record and the festivities became initiated the governor man had a bit of english under his hat and when the music was choked off he says ver r ree fine gr r r r racias the american gentlemen the so esplendeed moosic as to playee the table was a long one and henry and me sat at the end of it next the wall the governor sat at the other end homer p mellinger stood at the side of it i was just wondering how mellinger was going to handle his crowd when the home talent suddenly opened the services that governor man was suitable for uprisings and policies i judge he was a ready kind of man who took his own time yes he was full of attention and immediateness he leaned his hands on the table and imposed his face toward the secretary man do the american senors understand spanish he asks in his native accents they do not says mellinger then listen goes on the latin man prompt the musics are of sufficient prettiness but not of necessity let us speak of business i well know why we are here since i observe my compatriots you had a whisper yesterday senor mellinger of our proposals tonight we will speak out we know that you stand in the president s favor and we know your influence the government will be changed we know the worth of your services we esteem your friendship and aid so much that mellinger praises his hand but the governor man bottles him up do not speak until i have done the governor man then draws a package wrapped in paper from his pocket and lays it on the table by

started her off it was a cornet solo very neat and beautiful and the name of it was home sweet home not one of them fifty odd men in the room moved while it was playing and the governor man kept his

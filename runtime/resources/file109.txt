its end a formidable official document was prepared encrusted with chromatic seals and jaunty with fluttering ribbons bearing the florid signatures of state this commission conferred upon el senor don felipe carrera the title of flag admiral of the republic of anchuria thus within the space of a few minutes and the dominion of a dozen extra dry the country took its place among the naval powers of the world and felipe carrera became entitled to a salute of nineteen guns whenever he might enter port the southern races are lacking in that particular kind of humor that finds entertainment in the defects and misfortunes bestowed by nature owing to this defect in their constitution they are not moved to laughter as are their northern brothers by the spectacle of the deformed the feeble minded or the insane felipe carrera was sent upon earth with but half his wits therefore the people of coralio called him el pobrecito loco the poor little crazed one saying that god had sent but half of him to earth retaining the other half a sombre youth glowering and speaking only at the rarest times felipe was but negatively loco on shore he generally refused all conversation he seemed to know that he was badly handicapped on land where so many kinds of understanding are needed but on the water his one talent set him equal with most men few sailors whom god had carefully and completely made could handle a sailboat as well five points nearer the wind than the best of them he could sail his sloop when the elements raged and set other men to cowering the deficiencies of felipe seemed of little importance he was a perfect sailor if an imperfect man he owned no boat but worked among the crews of the schooners and sloops that skimmed the coast trading and freighting fruit out to the steamers where there was no harbor it was through his famous skill and boldness on the sea as well as for the pity felt for his mental imperfections that he was recommended by the collector as a suitable custodian of the captured sloop when the outcome of don sabas little pleasantry arrived in the form of the imposing and preposterous commission the collector smiled he had not expected such prompt and overwhelming response to his recommendation he despatched a muchacho at once to fetch the future admiral the collector waited in his official quarters his office was in the calle grande and the sea breezes hummed through its windows all day the collector in white linen and canvas shoes philandered with papers on an antique desk a parrot perched on a pen rack seasoned the official tedium with a fire of choice castilian imprecations two rooms opened into the collector s in one the clerical force of young men of variegated complexions transacted with glitter and parade their several duties through the open door of the other room could be seen a bronze babe guiltless of clothing that rollicked upon the floor in a grass hammock a thin woman tinted a pale lemon played a guitar and swung contentedly in the breeze thus surrounded by the routine of his high duties and the visible tokens of agreeable domesticity the collector s heart was further made happy by the power placed in his hands to brighten the fortunes of the innocent felipe felipe came and stood before the collector he was a lad of twenty not ill favored in looks but with an expression of distant and pondering vacuity he wore white cotton trousers down the seams of which he had sewed red stripes with some vague aim at military decoration a flimsy blue shirt fell open at his throat his feet were bare he held in his hand the cheapest of straw hats from the states senor carrera said the collector gravely producing the showy commission i have sent for you at the president s bidding this document that i present to you confers upon you the title of admiral of this great republic and gives you absolute command of the naval forces and fleet of our country you may think friend felipe that we have no navy but yes the sloop the estrella del noche that my brave men captured from the coast smugglers is to be placed under your command the boat is to be devoted to the services of your country you will be ready at all times to convey officials of the government to points along the coast where they may be obliged to visit you will also act as a coast guard to prevent as far as you may be able the crime of smuggling you will uphold the honor and prestige of your country at sea and endeavor to place anchuria among the proudest naval powers of the world these are your instructions as the minister of war desires me to convey them to you por dios i do not know how all this is to be accomplished for not one word did his letter contain in respect to a crew or to the expenses of this navy perhaps you are to provide a crew yourself senor admiral i do not know but it is a very high honor that has descended upon you i now hand you your commission when you are ready for the boat i will give orders that she shall be made over into your charge that is as far as my instructions go felipe took the commission that the collector handed to him he gazed through the open window at the sea for a moment with his customary expression of deep but vain pondering then he turned without having spoken a word and walked swiftly away through the hot sand of the street pobrecito loco sighed the collector and the parrot on the pen racks screeched loco loco loco the next morning a strange procession filed through the streets to the collector s

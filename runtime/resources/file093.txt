waiting for the doctor s order there was no dust on it after they had drank twice smith said you say there were no passengers on the karlesfin doc are you sure about that it seems to me i heard somebody down on the beach say that there was one or two aboard they were mistaken sir i myself went out and put all hands through a medical examination as usual the karlesfin sails as soon as she gets her bananas loaded which will be about daylight in the morning and she got everything ready this afternoon no sir there was no passenger list like that three star a french schooner landed two slooploads of it a month ago if any customs duties on it went to the distinguished republic of anchuria you may have my hat if you won t have another come out and let s sit in the cool a while it isn t often we exiles get a chance to talk with somebody from the outside world the doctor brought out another chair to the sidewalk for his new acquaintance the two seated themselves you are a man of the world said doctor gregg a man of travel and experience your decision in a matter of ethics and no doubt on the points of equity ability and professional probity should be of value i would be glad if you will listen to the history of a case that i think stands unique in medical annals about nine years ago while i was engaged in the practice of medicine in my native city i was called to treat a case of contusion of the skull i made the diagnosis that a splinter of bone was pressing upon the brain and that the surgical operation known as trepanning was required however as the patient was a gentleman of wealth and position i called in for consultation doctor smith rose from his chair and laid a hand soft with apology upon the doctor s shirt sleeve say doc he said solemnly i want to hear that story you ve got me interrested and i don t want to miss the rest of it i know it s a loola by the way it begins and i want to tell it at the next meeting of the barney o flynn association if you don t mind but i ve got one or two matters to attend to first if i get em attended to in time i ll come right back and hear you spiel the rest before bedtime is that right by all means said the doctor get your business attended to and then return i shall wait up for you you see one of the most prominent physicians at the consultation diagnosed the trouble as a blood clot another said it was an abscess but i don t tell me now doc don t spoil the story wait till i come back i want to hear it as it runs off the reel is that right the mountains reached up their bulky shoulders to receive the level gallop of apollo s homing steeds the day died in the lagoons and in the shadowed banana groves and in the mangrove swamps where the great blue crabs were beginning to crawl to land for their nightly ramble and it died at last upon the highest peaks then the brief twilight ephemeral as the flight of a moth came and went the southern cross peeped with its topmost eye above a row of palms and the fire flies heralded with their torches and approach of soft footed night in the offing the karlesfin swayed at anchor her lights seeming to penetrate the water to countless fathoms with their shimmering lanceolate reflections the caribs were busy loading her by means of the great lighters heaped full from the piles of fruit ranged upon the shore on the sandy beach with his back against a coconut tree and the stubs of many cigars lying around him smith sat waiting never relaxing his sharp gaze in the direction of the steamer the incongruous yachtsman had concentrated his interest upon the innocent fruiter twice had he been assured that no passengers had come to coralio on board of her and yet with a persistence not to be attributed to an idling voyager he had appealed the case to the higher court of his own eyesight surprisingly like some gay coated lizard he crouched at the foot of the coconut palm and with the beady shifting eyes of the selfsame reptile sustained his espionage on the karlesfin on the white sands a whiter gig belonging to the yacht was drawn up guarded by one of the white ducked crew not far away in a pulperia on the shore following calle grande three other sailors swaggerred with their cues around coralio s solitary billiard table the boat lay there as if under orders to be ready for use at any moment there was in the atmosphere a hint of expectation of waiting for something to occur which was foreign to the air of coralio like some passing bird of brilliant plumage smith alights on this palmy shore but to preen his wings for an instant and then to fly away upon silent pinions when morning dawned there was no smith no waiting gig no yacht in the offing smith left no intimation of his mission there no footprints to show where he had followed the trail of his mystery on the sands of coralio that night he came he spake his strange jargon of the asphalt and the cafes he sat under the coconut tree and vanished the next morning coralio smithless ate its fried plantain and said the man of pictured clothing went himself away with the siesta the incident passed yawning into history so for a time must smith pass behind the scenes of the play he comes no more to coralio nor to doctor

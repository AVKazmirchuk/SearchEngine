among the swaggering men monsieur my mother is dying my uncle is a captain of guards in the palace of the king some one must fly to bring him may i hope mademoiselle interrupted davis his eyes shining with the desire to do her service your hopes shall be my wings tell me how i may reach him the lady thrust a sealed paper into his hand go to the south gate the south gate mind and say to the guards there the falcon has left his nest they will pass you and you will go to the south entrance to the palace repeat the words and give this letter to the man who will reply let him strike when he will this is the password monsieur entrusted to me by my uncle for now when the country is disturbed and men plot against the king s life no one without it can gain entrance to the palace grounds after nightfall if you will monsieur take him this letter so that my mother may see him before she closes her eyes give it me said david eagerly but shall i let you return home through the streets alone so late i no no fly each moment is like a precious jewel some time said the lady with eyes long and cozening like a gypsy s i will try to thank you for your goodness the poet thrust the letter into his breast and bounded down the stairway the lady when he was gone returned to the room below the eloquent eyebrows of the marquis interrogated her he is gone she said as fleet and stupid as one of his own sheep to deliver it the table shook again from the batter of captain desrolles s fist sacred name he cried i have left my pistols behind i can trust no others take this said the marquis drawing from beneath his cloak a shining great weapon ornamented with carven silver there are none truer but guard it closely for it bears my arms and crest and already i am suspected me i must put many leagues between myself and paris this night to morrow must find me in my chateau after you dear countess the marquis puffed out the candle the lady well cloaked and the two gentlemen softly descended the stairway and flowed into the crowd that roamed along the narrow pavements of the rue conti david sped at the south gate of the king s residence a halberd was laid to his breast but he turned its point with the words the falcon has left his nest pass brother said the guard and go quickly on the south steps of the palace they moved to seize him but again the mot de passe charmed the watchers one among them stepped forward and began let him strike but a flurry among the guards told of a surprise a man of keen look and soldierly stride suddenly pressed through them and seized the letter which david held in his hand come with me he said and led him inside the great hall then he tore open the letter and read it he beckoned to a man uniformed as an officer of musketeers who was passing captain tetreau you will have the guards at the south entrance and the south gate arrested and confined place men known to be loyal in their places to david he said come with me he conducted him

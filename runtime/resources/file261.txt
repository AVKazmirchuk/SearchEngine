the world then it was agreed that woman should forever remain as clear as a pane of glass though glass was yet to be discovered to other women and that she should palm herself off on man as a mystery barbara seemed to hesitate really nevada she said with a little show of embarrassment you shouldn t have insisted on my opening this i i m sure it wasn t meant for any one else to know nevada forgot her gloves for a moment then read it aloud she said since you ve already read it what s the difference if mr warren has written to me something that any one else oughtn t to know that is all the more reason why everybody should know it well said barbara this is what it says dearest nevada come to my studio at twelve o clock to night do not fail barbara rose and dropped the note in nevada s lap i m awfully sorry she said that i knew it isn t like gilbert there must be some mistake just consider that i am ignorant of it will you dear i must go up stairs now i have such a headache i m sure i don t understand the note perhaps gilbert has been dining too well and will explain good night iv nevada tiptoed to the hall and heard barbara s door close upstairs the bronze clock in the study told the hour of twelve was fifteen minutes away she ran swiftly to the front door and let herself out into the snow storm gilbert warren s studio was six squares away by aerial ferry the white silent forces of the storm attacked the city from beyond the sullen east river already the snow lay a foot deep on the pavements the drifts heaping themselves like scaling ladders against the walls of the besieged town the avenue was as quiet as a street in pompeii cabs now and then skimmed past like white winged gulls over a moonlit ocean and less frequent motor cars sustaining the comparison hissed through the foaming waves like submarine boats on their jocund perilous journeys nevada plunged like a wind driven storm petrel on her way she looked up at the ragged sierras of cloud capped buildings that rose above the streets shaded by the night lights and the congealed vapors to gray drab ashen lavender dun and cerulean tints they were so like the wintry mountains of her western home that she felt a satisfaction such as the hundred thousand dollar house had seldom brought her a policeman caused her to waver on a corner just by his eye and weight hello mabel said he kind of late for you to be out ain t it i i am just going to the drug store said nevada hurrying past him the excuse serves as a passport for the most sophisticated does it prove that woman never progresses or that she sprang from adam s rib full fledged in intellect and wiles turning eastward the direct blast cut down nevada s speed one half she made zigzag tracks in the snow but she was as tough as a pinon sapling and bowed to it as gracefully suddenly the studio building loomed before her a familiar landmark like a cliff above some well remembered canon the haunt of business and its hostile neighbor art was darkened and silent the elevator stopped at ten up eight flights of stygian stairs nevada climbed and rapped firmly at the door numbered she had been there many times before with barbara and uncle jerome gilbert opened the door he had a crayon pencil in one hand a green shade over his eyes and a pipe in his mouth the pipe dropped to the floor am i late asked nevada i came as quick as i could uncle and me were at the theatre this evening here i am gilbert gilbert did a pygmalion and galatea act he changed from a statue of stupefaction to a young man with a problem to tackle he admitted nevada got a whiskbroom and began to brush the snow from her clothes a great lamp with a green shade hung over an easel where the artist had been sketching in crayon you wanted me said nevada simply and i came you said so in your letter what did you send for me for you read my letter inquired gilbert sparring for wind barbara read it to me i saw it afterward it said come to my studio at twelve to night and do not fail i thought you were sick of course but you don t seem to be aha said gilbert irrelevantly i ll tell you why i asked you to come nevada i want you to marry me immediately to night what s a little snow storm will you do it you might have noticed that i would long ago said nevada and i m rather stuck on the snow storm idea myself i surely would hate one of these flowery church noon weddings gilbert i didn t know you had grit enough to propose it this way let s shock em it s our funeral ain t it you bet said gilbert where did i hear that expression he added to himself wait a minute nevada i want to do a little phoning he shut himself in a little dressing room and called upon the lightnings of tile heavens condensed into unromantic numbers and districts that you jack you confounded sleepyhead yes wake up this is me or i oh bother the difference in grammar i m going to be married right away yes wake up your sister don t answer me back bring her along too you must remind agnes of the time i saved her from drowning in lake ronkonkoma i know it s caddish to refer to it but she must come with you yes nevada is here

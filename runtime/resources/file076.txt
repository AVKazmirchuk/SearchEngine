out the town perhaps in this letter lena will say that she is yet feeling better so her mamma will be glad auf wiedersehen herr ballinger your feets will take cold out in the night air so long fritzy said old man ballinger you got a nice cool night for your drive up the road went the little black mules at their steady trot while fritz thundered at them occasional words of endearment and cheer these fancies occupied the mind of the mail carrier until he reached the big post oak forest eight miles from ballinger s here his ruminations were scattered by the sudden flash and report of pistols and a whooping as if from a whole tribe of indians a band of galloping centaurs closed in around the mail wagon one of them leaned over the front wheel covered the driver with his revolver and ordered him to stop others caught at the bridles of donder and blitzen donnerwetter shouted fritz with all his tremendous voice wass ist release your hands from dose mules ve vas der united states mail hurry up dutch drawled a melancholy voice don t you know when you re in a stick up reverse your mules and climb out of the cart it is due to the breadth of hondo bill s demerit and the largeness of his achievements to state that the holding up of the fredericksburg mail was not perpetrated by way of an exploit as the lion while in the pursuit of prey commensurate to his prowess might set a frivolous foot upon a casual rabbit in his path so hondo bill and his gang had swooped sportively upon the pacific transport of meinherr fritz the real work of their sinister night ride was over fritz and his mail bag and his mules came as gentle relaxation grateful after the arduous duties of their profession twenty miles to the southeast stood a train with a killed engine hysterical passengers and a looted express and mail car that represented the serious occupation of hondo bill and his gang with a fairly rich prize of currency and silver the robbers were making a wide detour to the west through the less populous country intending to seek safety in mexico by means of some fordable spot on the rio grande the booty from the train had melted the desperate bushrangers to jovial and happy skylarkers trembling with outraged dignity and no little personal apprehension fritz climbed out to the road after replacing his suddenly removed spectacles the band had dismounted and were singing capering and whooping thus expressing their satisfied delight in the life of a jolly outlaw rattlesnake rogers who stood at the heads of the mules jerked a little too vigorously at the rein of the tender mouthed donder who reared and emitted a loud protesting snort of pain instantly fritz with a scream of anger flew at the bulky rogers and began to assiduously pummel that surprised freebooter with his fists villain shouted fritz dog bigstiff dot mule he has a soreness by his mouth i vill knock off your shoulders mit your head robbermans yi yi howled rattlesnake roaring with laughter and ducking his head somebody git this here sour krout off n me one of the band yanked fritz back by the coat tail and the woods rang with rattlesnake s vociferous comments the dog goned little wienerwurst he yelled amiably he s not so much of a skunk for a dutchman took up for his animile plum quick didn t he i like to see a man like his hoss even if it is a mule the dad blamed little limburger he went for me didn t he whoa now muley i ain t a goin to hurt your mouth agin any more perhaps the mail would not have been tampered with had not ben moody the lieutenant possessed certain wisdom that seemed to promise more spoils say cap he said addressing hondo bill there s likely to be good pickings in these mail sacks i ve done some hoss tradin with these dutchmen around fredericksburg and i know the style of the varmints there s big money goes through the mails to that town them dutch risk a thousand dollars sent wrapped in a piece of paper before they d pay the banks to handle the money hondo bill six feet two gentle of voice and impulsive in action was dragging the sacks from the rear of the wagon before moody had finished his speech a knife shone in his hand and they heard the ripping sound as it bit through the tough canvas the outlaws crowded around and began tearing open letters and packages enlivening their labours by swearing affably at the writers who seemed to have conspired to confute the prediction of ben moody not a dollar was found in the fredericksburg mail you ought to be ashamed of yourself said hondo bill to the mail carrier in solemn tones to be packing around such a lot of old trashy paper as this what d you mean by it anyhow where do you dutchers keep your money at the ballinger mail sack opened like a cocoon under hondo s knife it contained but a handful of mail fritz had been fuming with terror and excitement until this sack was reached he now remembered lena s letter he addressed the leader of the band asking that that particular missive be spared much obliged dutch he said to the disturbed carrier i guess that s the letter we want got spondulicks in it ain t it here she is make a light boys hondo found and tore open the letter to mrs hildesmuller the others stood about lighting twisted up letters one from another hondo gazed with mute disapproval at the single sheet of paper covered with the angular german script whatever is this you ve humbugged us with dutchy you call this here a valuable

not so the princess with a red rose in her hair and dressed so plain and neat that she looked more like a farmer s daughter than a great king s came down among them from her father s side with nods of love and welcome on her lips and a smile upon her face and took them by the hands as in the old days and none among them so lowly or so poor but what received a kind word from the gracious princess and carried away in their hearts glad feelings that she was still the same noble and gracious lady she always was then night came and torches by thousands lit up the great forest and musicians played and bonfires glowed with sparks flying like myriads of stars among the gloomy trees in the great castle hall were gathered the brave knights and the fairest ladies in the kingdom the jolly old king surrounded by the wise men and officers of state moved about among his guests stately and courteous ravishing music burst forth from all sides and down the hall moved the fair princess in the mazy dance on the arm of a knight who gazed upon her face in rapt devotion and love who was he that dared to look thus upon the daughter of the king sovereign prince of the kingdom and the heiress of her father s wealth and lands he had no title no proud name to place beside a royal one beyond that of an honorable knight but who says that that is not a title that borne worthily makes a man the peer of any that wears a crown he had loved her long when a boy they had roamed together in the great forest about the castle and played among the fountains of the court like brother and sister the king saw them together often and smiled and went his way and said nothing the years went on and they were together as much as they could be the summer days when the court went forth into the forest mounted on prancing steeds to chase the stags with hounds all clad in green and gold with waving plumes and shining silver and ribbons of gay colors this knight was by the princess side to guide her through the pathless swamps where the hunt ranged and saw that no harm came to her and now that she had come back after years of absence he went to her with fear lest she should have changed for her old self and would not be to him as she was when they were boy and girl together but no there was the same old kindly welcome the same smiling greeting the warm pressure of the hand the glad look in the eyes as of yore the knight s heart beat wildly and a dim new awakened hope arose in him was she too far away after all he felt worthy of her and of any one in fact but he was without riches only a knight errant with his sword for his fortune and his great love his only title and he had always refrained from ever telling her anything of his love for his pride prevented him and you know a poor girl even though she be a princess cannot say to a man i am rich but let that be no bar between us i am yours and will let my wealth pass if you will give up your pride no princess can say this and the knight s pride would not let him say anything of the kind and so you see there was small chance of their ever coming to an understanding well the feasting and dancing went on and the knight and the princess danced and sang together and walked out where the moon was making a white wonder of the great fountain and wandered under the rows of great oaks but spoke no word of love though no mortal man knows what thoughts passed in their heads and she gave long accounts of the wonders she had seen in the far icy north in the great school of wise men and the knight talked of the wild and savage men he had seen in the far west where he had been in battles with the heathen in a wild and dreary land and she heard with pity his tales of suffering and trials in the desert among wild animals and fierce human kings and inside the castle the music died away and the lights grew dim and the villagers had long since gone to their homes and the knight and the princess still talked of old times and the moon climbed high in the eastern sky one day there came news from a country far to the west where lay the possessions of the knight the enemy had robbed him of his treasure driven away his cattle and he found it was best to hie him away and rescue his inheritance and goods he buckled on his sword and mounted his good war horse he rode to the postern gate of the castle to make his adieus to the princess when he told her he was going away to the wild western country to do battle with the heathen she grew pale and her eyes took on a look of such pain and fear that the knight s heart leaped and then sank in his bosom a his pride still kept him from speaking the words that might have made all well she bade him farewell in a low voice and tears even stood in leer eyes but what could she say or do the knight put spurs to his horse and dashed away over the hills without ever looking back and the princess stood looking over the gate at him till the last sight of his plume below the brow of the hill the knight

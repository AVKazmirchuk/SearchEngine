i have discovered that new york is the greatest summer don t say that again interrupted north unless you ve actually got a job as general passenger agent of the subway you can t really believe it i went to some trouble to try to prove my theory to my friend the weather bureau and the season had conspired to make the argument worthy of an able advocate the city seemed stretched on a broiler directly above the furnaces of avernus there was a kind of tepid gayety afoot and awheel in the boulevards mainly evinced by languid men strolling about in straw hats and evening clothes and rows of idle taxicabs with their flags up looking like a blockaded fourth of july procession the hotels kept up a specious brilliancy and hospitable outlook but inside one saw vast empty caverns and the footrails at the bars gleamed brightly from long disacquaintance with the sole leather of customers in the cross town streets the steps of the old brownstone houses were swarming with stoopers that motley race hailing from sky light room and basement bringing out their straw doorstep mats to sit and fill the air with strange noises and opinions north and i dined on the top of a hotel and here for a few minutes i thought i had made a score an east wind almost cool blew across the roofless roof a capable orchestra concealed in a bower of wistaria played with sufficient judgment to make the art of music probable and the art of conversation possible some ladies in reproachless summer gowns at other tables gave animation and color to the scene and an excellent dinner mainly from the refrigerator seemed to successfully back my judgment as to summer resorts but north grumbled all during the meal and cursed his lawyers and prated so of his confounded camp in the woods that i began to wish he would go back there and leave me in my peaceful city retreat after dining we went to a roof garden vaudeville that was being much praised there we found a good bill an artificially cooled atmosphere cold drinks prompt service and a gay well dressed audience north was bored if this isn t comfortable enough for you on the hottest august night for five years i said a little sarcastically you might think about the kids down in delancey and hester streets lying out on the fire escapes with their tongues hanging out trying to get a breath of air that hasn t been fried on both sides the contrast might increase your enjoyment don t talk socialism said north i gave five hundred dollars to the free ice fund on the first of may i m contrasting these stale artificial hollow wearisome amusements with the enjoyment a man can get in the woods you should see the firs and pines do skirt dances during a storm and lie down flat and drink out of a mountain branch at the end of a day s tramp after the deer that s the only way to spend a summer get out and live with nature i agree with you absolutely said i with emphasis for one moment i had relaxed my vigilance and had spoken my true sentiments north looked at me long and curiously then why in the name of pan and apollo he asked have you been singing this deceitful paean to summer in town i suppose i looked my guilt ha said north i see may i ask her name annie ashton said i simply she played nannette in binkley bing s production of the silver cord she is to have a better part next season take me to see her said north miss ashton lived with her mother in a small hotel they were out of the west and had a little money that bridged the seasons as press agent of binkley bing i had tried to keep her before the public as robert james vandiver i had hoped to withdraw her for if ever one was made to keep company with said vandiver and smell the salt breeze on the south shore of long island and listen to the ducks quack in the watches of the night it was the ashton set forth above but she had a soul above ducks above nightingales aye even above birds of paradise she was very beautiful with quiet ways and seemed genuine she had both taste and talent for the stage and she liked to stay at home and read and make caps for her mother she was unvaryingly kind and friendly with binkley bing s press agent since the theatre had closed she had allowed mr vandiver to call in an unofficial role i had often spoken to her of my friend spencer grenville north and so as it was early the first turn of the vaudeville being not yet over we left to find a telephone miss ashton would be very glad to see mr vandiver and mr north we found her fitting a new cap on her mother i never saw her look more charming north made himself disagreeably entertaining he was a good talker and had a way with him besides he had two ten or thirty millions i ve for gotten which i incautiously admired the mother s cap whereupon she brought out her store of a dozen or two and i took a course in edgings and frills even though annie s fingers had pinked or ruched or hemmed or whatever you do to em they palled upon me and i could hear north drivelling to annie about his odious adirondack camp two days after that i saw north in his motor car with miss ashton and her mother on the next afternoon he dropped in on me bobby said he this old burg isn t such a bad proposition in the summer time after all since i ve keen knocking around it looks better to me there are some first rate musical comedies and light operas on the roofs and in the outdoor gardens and if you hunt up the right places and stick to soft drinks you can keep about as cool here as you can in the country hang it when you come to think of it there s nothing much to the country anyhow you get tired and sunburned and lonesome and you have to eat any old thing that the cook dishes up to you it makes a difference doesn t it said i it certainly does now i found some whitebait yesterday at maurice s with a new sauce that beats anything in the trout line i ever tasted it makes a difference doesn t it i said immense the sauce is the main thing with whitebait it makes a difference doesn t it i asked looking him straight in the eye he understood look here bob he said i was going to tell you i couldn t help it i ll play fair with you but i m going in to win she is the one particular for me all right said i it s a fair field there are no rights for you to encroach upon on thursday afternoon miss ashton invited north and myself to have tea in her apartment he was devoted and she was more charming than usual by avoiding the subject of caps i managed to get a word or two into and out of the talk miss ashton asked me in a make conversational tone something about the next season s tour oh said i i don t know about that i m not going to be with binkley bing next season why i thought said she that they were going to put the number one road company under your charge i thought you told me so they were said i but they won t i ll tell you what i m going to do i m going to the south shore of long island and buy a small cottage i know there on the edge of the bay and i ll buy a catboat and a rowboat and a shotgun and a yellow dog i ve got money enough to do it and i ll smell the salt wind all day when it blows from the sea and the pine odor when it blows from the land and of course i ll write plays until i have a trunk full of em on hand and the next thing and the biggest thing i ll do will be to buy that duck farm next door few people understand ducks i can watch em for hours they can march better than any company in the national guard and they can play follow my leader better than the entire democratic party their voices don t amount to much but i like to hear em they wake you up a dozen times a night but there s a homely sound about their quacking that is more musical to me than the cry of fresh strawber rees under your window in the morning when you want to sleep and i went on enthusiastically do you know the value of ducks besides their beauty and intelligence and order and sweetness of voice picking their feathers gives you an unfailing and never ceasing income on a farm that i know the feathers were sold for in one year think of that and the ones shipped to the market will bring in more money than that yes i am for the ducks and the salt breeze coming over the bay i think i shall get a chinaman cook and with him and the dog and the sunsets for company i shall do well no more of this dull baking senseless roaring city for me miss ashton looked surprised north laughed i am going to begin one of my plays tonight i said so i must be going and with that i took my departure a few days later miss ashton telephoned to me asking me to call at four in the afternoon i did you have been very good to me she said hesitatingly and i thought i would tell you i am going to leave the stage yes said i i suppose you will they usually do when there s so much money there is no money she said or very little our money is almost gone but i am told said i that he has something like two or ten or thirty millions i have forgotten which i know what you mean she said i will not pretend that i do not i am not going to marry mr north then why are you leaving the stage i asked severely what else can you do to earn a living she came closer to me and i can see the look in her eyes yet as she spoke i can pick ducks she said we sold the first year s feathers for a poor rule i have always maintained and asserted ime to time that woman is no mystery that man can foretell construe subdue comprehend and interpret her that she is a mystery has been foisted by herself upon credulous mankind whether i am right or wrong we shall see as harper s drawer used to say in bygone years the following good story is told of miss mr mr and mr we shall have to omit bishop x and the rev for they do not belong in those days paloma was a new town on the line of the southern pacific a reporter would have called it a mushroom town but it was not paloma was first and last of the toadstool variety the train stopped there at noon for the engine to drink and for the passengers both to drink and to dine there was a new yellow pine hotel also a wool warehouse and perhaps three dozen box residences the rest was composed of tents cow ponies black waxy mud and mesquite trees all bound round by a horizon paloma was an about to be city the houses represented faith the tents hope the twice a day train by which you might leave creditably sustained the role of charity the parisian restaurant occupied the muddiest spot in the town while it rained and the warmest when it shone it was operated owned and perpetrated by a citizen known as old man hinkle who had come out of indiana to make his fortune in this land of condensed milk and sorghum there was a four room unpainted weather boarded box house in which the family lived from the kitchen extended a shelter made of poles covered with chaparral brush under this was a table and two benches each twenty feet long the product of paloma home carpentry here was set forth the roast mutton the stewed apples boiled beans soda biscuits puddinorpie and hot coffee of the parisian menu ma hinkle and a subordinate known to the ears as betty but denied to the eyesight presided at the range pa hinkle himself with salamandrous thumbs served the scalding viands during rush hours a mexican youth who rolled and smoked cigarettes between courses aided him in waiting on the guests as is customary at parisian banquets i place the sweets at the end of my wordy menu ileen hinkle the spelling is correct for i have seen her write it no doubt she had been named by ear but she so splendidly bore the orthography that tom moore himself had he seen her would have indorsed the phonography ileen was the daughter of the house and the first lady cashier to invade the territory south of an east and west line drawn through galveston and del rio she sat on a high stool in a rough pine grand stand or was it a temple under the shelter at the door of the kitchen there was a barbed wire protection in front of her with a little arch under which you passed your money heaven knows why the barbed wire for every man who dined parisianly there would have died in her service her duties were light each meal was a dollar you put it under the arch and she took it i set out with the intent to describe ileen hinkle to you instead i must refer you to the volume by edmund burke entitled a philosophical inquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautiful it is an exhaustive treatise dealing first with the primitive conceptions of beauty roundness and smoothness i think they are according to burke it is well said rotundity is a patent charm as for smoothness the more new wrinkles a woman acquires the smoother she becomes ileen was a strictly vegetable compound guaranteed under the pure ambrosia and balm of gilead act of the year of the fall of adam she was a fruit stand blonde strawberries peaches cherries etc her eyes were wide apart and she possessed the calm that precedes a storm that never comes but it seems to me that words at any rate per are wasted in an effort to describe the beautiful like fancy it is engendered in the eyes there are three kinds of beauties i was foreordained to be homiletic i can never stick to a story the first is the freckle faced snub nosed girl whom you like the second is maud adams the third is or are the ladies in bouguereau s paintings ileen hinkle was the fourth she was the mayoress of spotless town there were a thousand golden apples coming to her as helen of the troy laundries the parisian restaurant was within a radius even from beyond its circumference men rode in to paloma to win her smiles they got them one meal one smile one dollar but with all her impartiality ileen seemed to favor three of her admirers above the rest according to the rules of politeness i will mention myself last the first was an artificial product known as bryan jacks a name that had obviously met with reverses jacks was the outcome of paved cities he was a small man made of some material resembling flexible sandstone his hair was the color of a brick quaker meeting house his eyes were twin cranberries his mouth was like the aperture under a drop letters here sign he knew every city from bangor to san francisco thence north to portland thence s e to a given point in florida he had mastered every art trade game business profession and sport in the world had been present at or hurrying on his way to every head line event that had ever occurred between oceans since he was five years old you might open the atlas place your finger at random upon the name of a town and jacks would tell you the front names of three prominent citizens before you could close it again he spoke patronizingly and even disrespectfully of broadway beacon hill michigan euclid and fifth avenues and the st louis four courts compared with him as a cosmopolite the wandering jew would have seemed a mere hermit he had learned everything the world could teach him and he would tell you about it i hate to be reminded of pollock s course of time and so do you but every time i saw jacks i would think of the poet s description of another poet by the name of g g byron who drank early deeply drank drank draughts that common millions might have quenched then died of thirst because there was no more to drink that fitted jacks except that instead of dying he came to paloma which was about the same thing he was a telegrapher and station and express agent at seventy five dollars a month why a young man who knew everything and could do everything was content to serve in such an obscure capacity i never could understand although he let out a hint once that it was as a personal favor to the president and stockholders of the s p ry co one more line of description and i turn jacks over to you he wore bright blue clothes yellow shoes and a bow tie made of the same cloth as his shirt my rival no was bud cunningham whose services had been engaged by a ranch near paloma to assist in compelling refractory cattle to keep within the bounds of decorum and order bud was the only cowboy off the stage that i ever saw who looked like one on it he wore the sombrero the chaps and the handkerchief tied at the back of his neck twice a week bud rode in from the val verde ranch to sup at the parisian restaurant he rode a many high handed kentucky horse at a tremendously fast lope which animal he would rein up so suddenly under the big mesquite at the corner of the brush shelter that his hoofs would plough canals yards long in the loam jacks and i were regular boarders at the restaurant of course the front room of the hinkle house was as neat a little parlor as there was in the black waxy country it was all willow rocking chairs and home knit tidies and albums and conch shells in a row and a little upright piano in one comer here jacks and bud and i or sometimes one or two of us according to our good luck used to sit of evenings when the tide of trade was over and visit miss hinkle ileen was a girl of ideas she was destined for higher things if there can be anything higher than taking in dollars all day through a barbed wire wicket she had read and listened and thought her looks would have formed a career for a less ambitious girl but rising superior to mere beauty she must establish something in the nature of a salon the only one in paloma don t you think that shakespeare was a great writer she would ask with such a pretty little knit of her arched brows that the late ignatius donnelly himself had he seen it could scarcely have saved his bacon ileen was of the opinion also that boston is more cultured than chicago that rosa bonheur was one of the greatest of women painters that westerners are more spontaneous and open hearted than easterners that london must be a very foggy city and that california must be quite lovely in the springtime and of many other opinions indicating a keeping up with the world s best thought these however were but gleaned from hearsay and evidence ileen had theories of her own one in particular she disseminated to us untiringly flattery she detested frankness and honesty of speech and action she declared were the chief mental ornaments of man and woman if ever she could like any one it would be for those qualities i m awfully weary she said one evening when we three musketeers of the mesquite were in the little parlor of having compliments on my looks paid to me i know i m not beautiful bud cunningham told me afterward that it was all he could do to keep from calling her a liar when she said that i m only a little middle western girl went on ileen who justs wants to be simple and neat and tries to help her father make a humble living old man hinkle was shipping a thousand silver dollars a month clear profit to a bank in san antonio bud twisted around in his chair and bent the rim of his hat from which he could never be persuaded to separate he did not know whether she wanted what she said she wanted or what she knew she deserved many a wiser man has hesitated at deciding bud decided why ah miss ileen beauty as you might say ain t everything not sayin that you haven t your share of good looks i always admired more than anything else about you the nice kind way you treat your ma and pa any one what s good to their parents and is a kind of home body don t specially need to be too pretty ileen gave him one of her sweetest smiles thank you mr cunningham she said i consider that one of the finest compliments i ve had in a long time i d so much rather hear you say that than to hear you talk about my eyes and hair i m glad you believe me when i say i don t like flattery our cue was there for us bud had made a good guess you couldn t lose jacks he chimed in next sure thing miss ileen he said the good lookers don t always win out now you ain t bad looking of course but that s nix cum rous i knew a girl once in dubuque with a face like a cocoanut who could skin the cat twice on a horizontal bar without changing hands now a girl might have the california peach crop mashed to a marmalade and not be able to do that i ve seen er worse lookers than you miss ileen but what i like about you is the business way you ve got of doing things cool and wise that s the winning way for a girl mr hinkle told me the other day you d never taken in a lead silver dollar or a plugged one since you ve been on the job now that s the stuff for a girl that s what catches me jacks got his smile too thank you mr jacks said ileen if you only knew how i appreciate any one s being candid and not a flatterer i get so tired of people telling me i m pretty i think it is the loveliest thing to have friends who tell you the truth then i thought i saw an expectant look on ileen s face as she glanced toward me i had a wild sudden impulse to dare fate and tell her of all the beautiful handiwork of the great artificer she was the most exquisite that she was a flawless pearl gleaming pure and serene in a setting of black mud and emerald prairies that she was a a corker and as for mine i cared not if she were as crtiel as a serpent s tooth to her fond parents or if she couldn t tell a plugged dollar from a bridle buckle if i might sing chant praise glorify and worship her peerless and wonderful beauty but i refrained i feared the fate of a flatterer i had witnessed her delight at the crafty and discreet words of bud and jacks no miss hinkle was not one to be beguiled by the plated silver tongue of a flatterer so i joined the ranks of the candid and honest at once i became mendacious and didactic in all ages miss hinkle said i in spite of the poetry and romance of each intellect in woman has been admired more than beauty even in cleopatra herself men found more charm in her queenly mind than in her looks well i should think so said ileen i ve seen pictures of her that weren t so much she had an awfully long nose if i may say so i went on you remind me of cleopatra miss ileen why my nose isn t so long said she opening her eyes wide and touching that comely feature with a dimpled forefinger why er i mean said i i mean as to mental endowments oh said she and then i got my smile just as bud and jacks had got theirs thank every one of you she said very very sweetly for being so frank and honest with me that s the way i want you to be always just tell me plainly and truthfully what you think and we ll all be the best friends in the world and now because you ve been so good to me and understand so well how i dislike people who do nothing but pay me exaggerated compliments i ll sing and play a little for you of course we expressed our thanks and joy but we would have been better pleased if ileen had remained in her low rocking chair face to face with us and let us gaze upon her for she was no adelina patti not even on the fare wellest of the diva s farewell tours she had a cooing little voice like that of a turtle dove that could almost fill the parlor when the windows and doors were closed and betty was not rattling the lids of the stove in the kitchen she had a gamut that i estimate at about eight inches on the piano and her runs and trills sounded like the clothes bubbling in your grandmother s iron wash pot believe that she must have been beautiful when i tell you that it sounded like music to us she must have been beautiful when i tell you that it sounded like music to us ileen s musical taste was catholic she would sing through a pile of sheet music on the left hand top of the piano laying each slaughtered composition on the right hand top the next evening she would sing from right to left her favorites were mendelssohn and moody and sankey by request she always wound up with sweet violets and when the leaves begin to turn when we left at ten o clock the three of us would go down to jacks little wooden station and sit on the platform swinging our feet and trying to pump one another for dews as to which way miss ileen s inclinations seemed to lean that is the way of rivals they do not avoid and glower at one another they convene and converse and construe striving by the art politic to estimate the strength of the enemy one day there came a dark horse to paloma a young lawyer who at once flaunted his shingle and himself spectacularly upon the town his name was c vincent vesey you could see at a glance that he was a recent graduate of a southwestern law school his prince albert coat light striped trousers broad brimmed soft black hat and narrow white muslin bow tie proclaimed that more loudly than any diploma could vesey was a compound of daniel webster lord chesterfield beau brummell and little jack horner his coming boomed paloma the next day after he arrived an addition to the town was surveyed and laid off in lots of course vesey to further his professional fortunes must mingle with the citizenry and outliers of paloma and as well as with the soldier men he was bound to seek popularity with the gay dogs of the place so jacks and bud cunningham and i came to be honored by his acquaintance the doctrine of predestination would have been discredited had not vesey seen ileen hinkle and become fourth in the tourney magnificently he boarded at the yellow pine hotel instead of at the parisian restaurant but he came to be a formidable visitor in the hinkle parlor his competition reduced bud to an inspired increase of profanity drove jacks to an outburst of slang so weird that it sounded more horrible than the most trenchant of bud s imprecations and made me dumb with gloom for vesey had the rhetoric words flowed from him like oil from a gusher hyperbole compliment praise appreciation honeyed gallantry golden opinions eulogy and unveiled panegyric vied with one another for pre eminence in his speech we had small hopes that ileen could resist his oratory and prince albert but a day came that gave us courage about dusk one evening i was sitting on the little gallery in front of the hinkle parlor waiting for ileen to come when i heard voices inside she had come into the room with her father and old man hinkle began to talk to her i had observed before that he was a shrewd man and not unphilosophic ily said he i notice there s three or four young fellers that have been callin to see you regular for quite a while is there any one of em you like better than another why pa she answered i like all of em very well i think mr cuninngham and mr jacks and mr harris are very nice young men they are so frank and honest in everything they say to me i haven t known mr vesey very long but i think he s a very nice young man he s so frank and honest in everything he says to me now that s what i m gittin at says old hinkle you ve always been sayin you like people what tell the truth and don t go humbuggin you with compliments and bogus talk now suppose you make a test of these fellers and see which one of em will talk the straightest to you but how ll i do it pa i ll tell you how you know you sing a little bit ily you took music lessons nearly two years in logansport it wasn t long but it was all we could afford then and your teacher said you didn t have any voice and it was a waste of money to keep on now suppose you ask the fellers what they think of your singin and see what each one of em tells you the man that ll tell you the truth about it ll have a mighty lot of nerve and ll do to tie to what do you think of the plan all right pa said ileen i think it s a good idea i ll try it ileen and mr hinkle went out of the room through the inside doors unobserved i hurried down to the station jacks was at his telegraph table waiting for eight o clock to come it was bud s night in town and when he rode in i repeated the conversation to them both i was loyal to my rivals as all true admirers of all ileens should be simultaneously the three of us were smitten by an uplifting thought surely this test would eliminate vesey from the contest he with his unctuous flattery would be driven from the lists well we remembered ileen s love of frankness and honesty how she treasured truth and candor above vain compliment and blandishment linking arms we did a grotesque dance of joy up and down the platform singing muldoon was a solid man at the top of our voices that evening four of the willow rocking chairs were filled besides the lucky one that sustained the trim figure of miss hinkle three of us awaited with suppressed excitement the application of the test it was tried on bud first mr cunningham said ileen with her dazzling smile after she had sung when the leaves begin to turn what do you really think of my voice frankly and honestly now as you know i want you to always be toward me bud squirmed in his chair at his chance to show the sincerity that he knew was required of him tell you the truth miss ileen he said earnestly you ain t got much more voice than a weasel just a little squeak you know of course we all like to hear you sing for it s kind of sweet and soothin after all and you look most as mighty well sittin on the piano stool as you do faced around but as for real singin i reckon you couldn t call it that i looked closely at ileen to see if bud had overdone his frankness but her pleased smile and sweetly spoken thanks assured me that we were on the right track and what do you think mr jacks she asked next take it from me said jacks you ain t in the prima donna class i ve heard em warble in every city in the united states and i tell you your vocal output don t go otherwise you ve got the grand opera bunch sent to the soap factory in looks i mean for the high screechers generally look like mary ann on her thursday out but nix for the gargle work your epiglottis ain t a real side stepper its footwork ain t good with a merry laugh at jacks criticism ileen looked inquiringly at me i admit that i faltered a little was there not such a thing as being too frank perhaps i even hedged a little in my verdict but i stayed with the critics i am not skilled in scientific music miss ileen i said but frankly i cannot praise very highly the singing voice that nature has given you it has long been a favorite comparison that a great singer sings like a bird well there are birds and birds i would say that your voice reminds me of the thrush s throaty and not strong nor of much compass or variety but still er sweet in er its way and er thank you mr harris interrupted miss hinkle i knew i could depend upon your frankness and honesty and then c vincent vesey drew back one sleeve from his snowy cuff and the water came down at lodore my memory cannot do justice to his masterly tribute to that priceless god given treasure miss hinkle s voice he raved over it in terms that if they had been addressed to the morning stars when they sang together would have made that stellar choir explode in a meteoric shower of flaming self satisfaction he marshalled on his white finger tips the grand opera stars of all the continents from jenny lind to emma abbott only to depreciate their endowments he spoke of larynxes of chest notes of phrasing arpeggios and other strange paraphernalia of the throaty art he admitted as though driven to a corner that jenny lind had a note or two in the high register that miss hinkle had not yet acquired but that was a mere matter of practice and training and as a peroration he predicted solemnly predicted a career in vocal art for the coming star of the southwest and one of which grand old texas may well be proud hitherto unsurpassed in the annals of musical history when we left at ten ileen gave each of us her usual warm cordial handshake entrancing smile and invitation to call again i could not see that one was favored above or below another but three of us knew we knew we knew that frankness and honesty had won and that the rivals now numbered three instead of four down at the station jacks brought out a pint bottle of the proper stuff and we celebrated the downfall of a blatant interloper four days went by without anything happening worthy of recount on the fifth jacks and i entering the brush arbor for our supper saw the mexican youth instead of a divinity in a spotless waist and a navy blue skirt taking in the dollars through the barbed wire wicket we rushed into the kitchen meeting pa hinkle coming out with two cups of hot coffee in his hands where s ileen we asked in recitative pa hinkle was a kindly man well gents said he it was a sudden notion she took but i ve got the money and i let her have her way she s gone to a corn a conservatory in boston for four years for to have her voice cultivated now excuse me to pass gents for this coffee s hot and my thumbs is tender that night there were four instead of three of us sitting on the station platform and swinging our feet c vincent vesey was one of us we discussed things while dogs barked at the moon that rose as big as a five cent piece or a flour barrel over the chaparral and what we discussed was whether it is better to lie to a woman or to tell her the truth and as all of us were young then we did not come to a decision roads of destiny roads of destiny i go to seek on many roads what is to be true heart and strong with love to light will they not bear me in the fight to order shun or wield or mould my destiny unpublished poems of david mignot the song was over the words were david s the air one of the countryside the company about the inn table applauded heartily for the young poet paid for the wine only the notary m papineau shook his head a little at the lines for he was a man of books and he had not drunk with the rest david went out into the village street where the night air drove the wine vapour from his head and then he remembered that he and yvonne had quarrelled that day and that he had resolved to leave his home that night to seek fame and honour in the great world outside when my poems are on every man s tongue he told himself in a fine exhilaration she will perhaps think of the hard words she spoke this day except the roisterers in the tavern the village folk were abed david crept softly into his room in the shed of his father s cottage and made a bundle of his small store of clothing with this upon a staff he set his face outward upon the road that ran from vernoy he passed his father s herd of sheep huddled in their nightly pen the sheep he herded daily leaving them to scatter while he wrote verses on scraps of paper he saw a light yet shining in yvonne s window and a weakness shook his purpose of a sudden perhaps that light meant that she rued sleepless her anger and that morning might but no his decision was made vernoy was no place for him not one soul there could share his thoughts out along that road lay his fate and his future three leagues across the dim moonlit champaign ran the road straight as a ploughman s furrow it was believed in the village that the road ran to paris at least and this name the poet whispered often to himself as he walked never so far from vernoy had david travelled before the left branch three leagues then the road ran and turned into a puzzle it joined with another and a larger road at right angles david stood uncertain for a while and then took the road to the left upon this more important highway were imprinted in the dust wheel tracks left by the recent passage of some vehicle some half an hour later these traces were verified by the sight of a ponderous carriage mired in a little brook at the bottom of a steep hill the driver and postilions were shouting and tugging at the horses bridles on the road at one side stood a huge black clothed man and a slender lady wrapped in a long light cloak david saw the lack of skill in the efforts of the servants he quietly assumed control of the work he directed the outriders to cease their clamour at the horses and to exercise their strength upon the wheels the driver alone urged the animals with his familiar voice david himself heaved a powerful shoulder at the rear of the carriage and with one harmonious tug the great vehicle rolled up on solid ground the outriders climbed to their places david stood for a moment upon one foot the huge gentleman waved a hand you will enter the carriage he said in a voice large like himself but smoothed by art and habit obedience belonged in the path of such a voice brief as was the young poet s hesitation it was cut shorter still by a renewal of the command david s foot went to the step in the darkness he perceived dimly the form of the lady upon the rear seat he was about to seat himself opposite when the voice again swayed him to its will you will sit at the lady s side the gentleman swung his great weight to the forward seat the carriage proceeded up the hill the lady was shrunk silent into her corner david could not estimate whether she was old or young but a delicate mild perfume from her clothes stirred his poet s fancy to the belief that there was loveliness beneath the mystery here was an adventure such as he had often imagined but as yet he held no key to it for no word was spoken while he sat with his impenetrable companions in an hour s time david perceived through the window that the vehicle traversed the street of some town then it stopped in front of a closed and darkened house and a postilion alighted to hammer impatiently upon the door a latticed window above flew wide and a nightcapped head popped out who are ye that disturb honest folk at this time of night my house is closed tis too late for profitable travellers to be abroad cease knocking at my door and be off open spluttered the postilion loudly open for monsiegneur the marquis de beaupertuys ah cried the voice above ten thousand pardons my lord i did not know the hour is so late at once shall the door be opened and the house placed at my lord s disposal inside was heard the clink of chain and bar and the door was flung open shivering with chill and apprehension the landlord of the silver flagon stood half clad candle in hand upon the threshold david followed the marquis out of the carriage assist the lady he was ordered the poet obeyed he felt her small hand tremble as he guided her descent into the house was the next command the room was the long dining hall of the tavern a great oak table ran down its length the huge gentleman seated himself in a chair at the nearer end the lady sank into another against the wall with an air of great weariness david stood considering how best he might now take his leave and continue upon his way my lord said the landlord bowing to the floor h had i ex expected this honour entertainment would have been ready t t there is wine and cold fowl and m m maybe candles said the marquis spreading the fingers of one plump white hand in a gesture he had y yes my lord he fetched half a dozen candles lighted them and set them upon the table if monsieur would perhaps deign to taste a certain burgundy there is a cask candles said monsieur spreading his fingers assuredly quickly i fly my lord a dozen more lighted candles shone in the hall the great bulk of the marquis overflowed his chair he was dressed in fine black from head to foot save for the snowy ruffles at his wrist and throat even the hilt and scabbard of his sword were black his expression was one of sneering pride the ends of an upturned moustache reached nearly to his mocking eyes the lady sat motionless and now david perceived that she was young and possessed of pathetic and appealing beauty he was startled from the contemplation of her forlorn loveliness by the booming voice of the marquis what is your name and pursuit david mignot i am a poet the moustache of the marquis curled nearer to his eyes how do you live i am also a shepherd i guarded my father s flock david answered with his head high but a flush upon his cheek then listen master shepherd and poet to the fortune you have blundered upon to night this lady is my niece mademoiselle lucie de varennes she is of noble descent and is possessed of ten thousand francs a year in her own right as to her charms you have but to observe for yourself if the inventory pleases your shepherd s heart she becomes your wife at a word do not interrupt me to night i conveyed her to the chateau of the comte de villemaur to whom her hand had been promised guests were present the priest was waiting her marriage to one eligible in rank and fortune was ready to be accomplished at the alter this demoiselle so meek and dutiful turned upon me like a leopardess charged me with cruelty and crimes and broke before the gaping priest the troth i had plighted for her i swore there and then by ten thousand devils that she should marry the first man we met after leaving the chateau be he prince charcoal burner or thief you shepherd are the first mademoiselle must be wed this night if not you then another you have ten minutes in which to make your decision do not vex me with words or questions ten minutes shepherd and they are speeding the marquis drummed loudly with his white fingers upon the table he sank into a veiled attitude of waiting it was as if some great house had shut its doors and windows against approach david would have spoken but the huge man s bearing stopped his tongue instead he stood by the lady s chair and bowed mademoiselle he said and he marvelled to find his words flowing easily before so much elegance and beauty you have heard me say i was a shepherd i have also had the fancy at times that i am a poet if it be the test of a poet to adore and cherish the beautiful that fancy is now strengthened can i serve you in any way mademoiselle the young woman looked up at him with eyes dry and mournful his frank glowing face made serious by the gravity of the adventure his strong straight figure and the liquid sympathy in his blue eyes perhaps also her imminent need of long denied help and kindness thawed her to sudden tears monsieur she said in low tones you look to be true and kind he is my uncle the brother of my father and my only relative he loved my mother and he hates me because i am like her he has made my life one long terror i am afraid of his very looks and never before dared to disobey him but to night he would have married me to a man three times my age you will forgive me for bringing this vexation upon you monsieur you will of course decline this mad act he tries to force upon you but let me thank you for your generous words at least i have had none spoken to me in so long there was now something more than generosity in the poet s eyes poet he must have been for yvonne was forgotten this fine new loveliness held him with its freshness and grace the subtle perfume from her filled him with strange emotions his tender look fell warmly upon her she leaned to it thirstily ten minutes said david is given me in which to do what i would devote years to achieve i will not say i pity you mademoiselle it would not be true i love you i cannot ask love from you yet but let me rescue you from this cruel man and in time love may come i think i have a future i will not always be a shepherd for the present i will cherish you with all my heart and make your life less sad will you trust your fate to me mademoiselle ah you would sacrifice yourself from pity from love the time is almost up mademoiselle you will regret it and despise me i will live only to make you happy and myself worthy of you her fine small hand crept into his from beneath her cloak i will trust you she breathed with my life and and love may not be so far off as you think tell him once away from the power of his eyes i may forget david went and stood before the marquis the black figure stirred and the mocking eyes glanced at the great hall clock two minutes to spare a shepherd requires eight minutes to decide whether he will accept a bride of beauty and income speak up shepherd do you consent to become mademoiselle s husband mademoiselle said david standing proudly has done me the honour to yield to my request that she become my wife well said said the marquis you have yet the making of a courtier in you master shepherd mademoiselle could have drawn a worse prize after all and now to be done with the affair as quick as the church and the devil will allow he struck the table soundly with his sword hilt the landlord came knee shaking bringing more candles in the hope of anticipating the great lord s whims fetch a priest said the marquis a priest do you understand in ten minutes have a priest here or the landlord dropped his candles and flew the priest came heavy eyed and ruffled he made david mignot and lucie de verennes man and wife pocketed a gold piece that the marquis tossed him and shuffled out again into the night wine ordered the marquis spreading his ominous fingers at the host fill glasses he said when it was brought he stood up at the head of the table in the candlelight a black mountain of venom and conceit with something like the memory of an old love turned to poison in his eyes as it fell upon his niece monsieur mignot he said raising his wineglass drink after i say this to you you have taken to be your wife one who will make your life a foul and wretched thing the blood in her is an inheritance running black lies and red ruin she will bring you shame and anxiety the devil that descended to her is there in her eyes and skin and mouth that stoop even to beguile a peasant there is your promise monsieur poet for a happy life drink your wine at last mademoiselle i am rid of you the marquis drank a little grievous cry as if from a sudden wound came from the girl s lips david with his glass in his hand stepped forward three paces and faced the marquis there was little of a shepherd in his bearing just now he said calmly you did me the honor to call me monsieur may i hope therefore that my marriage to mademoiselle has placed me somewhat nearer to you in let us say reflected rank has given me the right to stand more as an equal to monseigneur in a certain little piece of business i have in my mind you may hope shepherd sneered the marquis then said david dashing his glass of wine into the contemptuous eyes that mocked him perhaps you will condescend to fight me the fury of the great lord outbroke in one sudden curse like a blast from a horn he tore his sword from its black sheath he called to the hovering landlord a sword there for this lout he turned to the lady with a laugh that chilled her heart and said you put much labour upon me madame it seems i must find you a husband and make you a widow in the same night i know not sword play said david he flushed to make the confession before his lady i know not sword play mimicked the marquis shall we fight like peasants with oaken cudgels hola francois my pistols a postilion brought two shining great pistols ornamented with carven silver from the carriage holsters the marquis tossed one upon the table near david s hand to the other end of the table he cried even a shepherd may pull a trigger few of them attain the honour to die by the weapon of a de beaupertuys the shepherd and the marquis faced each other from the ends of the long table the landlord in an ague of terror clutched the air and stammered m m monseigneur for the love of christ not in my house do not spill blood it will ruin my custom the look of the marquis threatening him paralyzed his tongue coward cried the lord of beaupertuys cease chattering your teeth long enough to give the word for us if you can mine host s knees smote the floor he was without a vocabulary even sounds were beyond him still by gestures he seemed to beseech peace in the name of his house and custom i will give the word said the lady in a clear voice she went up to david and kissed him sweetly her eyes were sparkling bright and colour had come to her cheek she stood against the wall and the two men levelled their pistols for her count un deux trois the two reports came so nearly together that the candles flickered but once the marquis stood smiling the fingers of his left hand resting outspread upon the end of the table david remained erect and turned his head very slowly searching for his wife with his eyes then as a garment falls from where it is hung he sank crumpled upon the floor with a little cry of terror and despair the widowed maid ran and stooped above him she found his wound and then looked up with her old look of pale melancholy through his heart she whispered oh his heart come boomed the great voice of the marquis out with you to the carriage daybreak shall not find you on my hands wed you shall be again and to a living husband this night the next we come upon my lady highwayman or peasant if the road yields no other then the churl that opens my gates out with you into the carriage the marquis implacable and huge the lady wrapped again in the mystery of her cloak the postilion bearing the weapons all moved out to the waiting carriage the sound of its ponderous wheels rolling away echoed through the slumbering village in the hall of the silver flagon the distracted landlord wrung his hands above the slain poet s body while the flames of the four and twenty candles danced and flickered on the table the right branch three leagues then the road ran and turned into a puzzle it joined with another and a larger road at right angles david stood uncertain for a while and then took the road to the right whither it led he knew not but he was resolved to leave vernoy far behind that night he travelled a league and then passed a large chateau which showed testimony of recent entertainment lights shone from every window from the great stone gateway ran a tracery of wheel tracks drawn in the dust by the vehicles of the guests three leagues farther and david was weary he rested and slept for a while on a bed of pine boughs at the roadside then up and on again along the unknown way thus for five days he travelled the great road sleeping upon nature s balsamic beds or in peasants ricks eating of their black hospitable bread drinking from streams or the willing cup of the goatherd at length he crossed a great bridge and set his foot within the smiling city that has crushed or crowned more poets than all the rest of the world his breath came quickly as paris sang to him in a little undertone her vital chant of greeting the hum of voice and foot and wheel high up under the eaves of an old house in the rue conti david paid for lodging and set himself in a wooden chair to his poems the street once sheltering citizens of import and consequence was now given over to those who ever follow in the wake of decline the houses were tall and still possessed of a ruined dignity but many of them were empty save for dust and the spider by night there was the clash of steel and the cries of brawlers straying restlessly from inn to inn where once gentility abode was now but a rancid and rude incontinence but here david found housing commensurate to his scant purse daylight and candlelight found him at pen and paper one afternoon he was returning from a foraging trip to the lower world with bread and curds and a bottle of thin wine halfway up his dark stairway he met or rather came upon for she rested on the stair a young woman of a beauty that should balk even the justice of a poet s imagination a loose dark cloak flung open showed a rich gown beneath her eyes changed swiftly with every little shade of thought within one moment they would be round and artless like a child s and long and cozening like a gypsy s one hand raised her gown undraping a little shoe

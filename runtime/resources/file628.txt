his voice had a note of martyrdom running through its senile quaver my rheumatism has been growing steadily worse these past months william i am sorry father said billy gently and i am nearly seventy eight i am getting to be an old man i can recall the names of but two or three who were in public life during my administration what did you say is the nature of this position that is offered you william a federal judgeship father i believe it is considered to be a somewhat flattering tender it is outside of politics and wire pulling you know no doubt no doubt few of the pembertons have engaged in professional life for nearly a century none of them have ever held federal positions they have been land holders slave owners and planters on a large scale one of two of the derwents your mother s family were in the law have you decided to accept this appointment william i am thinking it over said billy slowly regarding the ash of his cigar you have been a good son to me continued the governor stirring his pipe with the handle of a penholder i ve been your son all my life said billy darkly i am often gratified piped the governor betraying a touch of complacency by being congratulated upon having a son with such sound and sterling qualities especially in this our native town is your name linked with mine in the talk of our citizens i never knew anyone to forget the vindculum murmured billy unintelligibly whatever prestige pursued the parent i may be possessed of by virtue of my name and services to the state has been yours to draw upon freely i have not hesitated to exert it in your behalf whenever opportunity offered and you have deserved it william you ve been the best of sons and now this appointment comes to take you away from me i have but a few years left to live i am almost dependent upon others now even in walking and dressing what would i do without you my son the governor s pipe dropped to the floor a tear trickled from his eye his voice had risen and crumbled to a weakling falsetto and ceased he was an old old man about to be bereft of a son that cherished him billy rose and laid his hand upon the governor s shoulder don t worry father he said cheerfully i m not going to accept elmville is good enough for me i ll write to night and decline it at the next interchange of devoirs between the governor and general deffenbaugh on lee avenue his excellency with a comfortable air of self satisfaction spoke of the appointment that had been tendered to billy the general whistled that s a plum for billy he shouted who d have thought that billy but confound it it s been in him all the time it s a boost for elmville it ll send real estate up it s an honour to our state it s a compliment to the south we ve all been blind about billy when does he leave we must have a reception great gatlings that job s eight thousand a year there s been a car load of lead pencils worn to stubs figuring on those appointments think of it our little wood sawing mealy mouthed billy angel unawares doesn t begin to express it elmville is disgraced forever until she lines up in a hurry for ratification and apology the venerable moloch smiled fatuously he carried the fire with which to consume all these tributes to billy the smoke of which would ascend as an incense to himself william said the governor with modest pride has declined the appointment he refuses to leave me in my old age he is a good son the general swung round and laid a large forefinger upon the bosom of his friend much of the general s success had been due to his dexterity in establishing swift lines of communication between cause and effect governor he said with a keen look in his big ox like eyes you ve been complaining to billy about your rheumatism my dear general replied the governor stiffly my son is forty two he is quite capable of deciding such questions for himself and i as his parent feel it my duty to state that your remark about er rheumatism is a mighty poor shot from a very small bore sir aimed at a purely personal and private affliction if you will allow me retorted the general you ve afflicted the public with it for some time and twas no small bore at that this first tiff between the two old comrades might have grown into something more serious but for the fortunate interruption caused by the ostentatious approach of colonel titus and another one of the court retinue from the right county to whom the general confided the coddled statesman and went his way after billy had so effectually entombed his ambitions and taken the veil so to speak in a sonnery he was surprised to discover how much lighter of heart and happier he felt he realized what a long restless struggle he had maintained and how much he had lost by failing to cull the simple but wholesome pleasures by the way his heart warmed now to elmville and the friends who had refused to set him upon a pedestal it was better he began to think to be billy and his father s son and to be hailed familiarly by cheery neighbours and grown up playmates than to be your honour and sit among strangers hearing maybe through the arguments of learned counsel that old man s feeble voice crying what would i do without you my son billy began to surprise his acquaintances by whistling as he walked up the street others he astounded by slapping them disrespectfully upon their backs and raking up old anecdotes he had not had the time to recollect for years though he hammered away at his law cases as thoroughly as ever he found more time for relaxation and the company of his friends some of the younger set were actually after him to join the golf club a striking proof of his abandonment to obscurity was his adoption of a most undignified rakish little soft hat reserving the plug for sundays and state occasions billy was beginning to enjoy elmville though that irreverent burgh had neglected to crown him with bay and myrtle all the while uneventful peace pervaded elmville the governor continued to make his triumphal parades to the post office with the general as chief marshal for the slight squall that had rippled their friendship had to all indications been forgotten by both but one day elmville woke to sudden excitement the news had come that a touring presidential party would honour elmville by a twenty minute stop the executive had promised a five minute address from the balcony of the palace hotel elmville rose as one man that man being of course general deffenbaugh to receive becomingly the chieftain of all the clans the train with the tiny stars and stripes fluttering from the engine pilot arrived elmville had done her best there were bands flowers carriages uniforms banners and committees without end high school girls in white frocks impeded the steps of the party with roses strewn nervously in bunches the chieftain had seen it all before scores of times he could have pictured it exactly in advance from the blue and gray speech down to the smallest rosebud yet his kindly smile of interest greeted elmville s display as if it had been the only and original in the upper rotunda of the palace hotel the town s most illustrious were assembled for the honour of being presented to the distinguished guests previous to the expected address outside elmville s inglorious but patriotic masses filled the streets here in the hotel general deffenbaugh was holding in reserve elmville s trump card elmville knew for the trump was a fixed one and its lead consecrated by archaic custom at the proper moment governor pemberton beautifully venerable magnificently antique tall paramount stepped forward upon the arm of the general elmville watched and harked with bated breath never until now when a northern president of the united states should clasp hands with ex war governor pemberton would the breach be entirely closed would the country be made one and indivisible no north not much south very little east and no west to speak of so elmville excitedly scraped kalsomine from the walls of the palace hotel with its sunday best and waited for the voice to speak and billy we had nearly forgotten billy he was cast for son and he waited patiently for his cue he carried his plug in his hand and felt serene he admired his father s striking air and pose after all it was a great deal to be a son of a man who could so gallantly hold the position of a cynosure for three generations general deffenbaugh cleared his throat elmville opened its mouth and squirmed the chieftain with the kindly fateful face was holding out his hand smiling ex war governor pemberton extended his own across the chasm but what was this the general was saying mr president allow me to present to you one who has the honour to be the father of our foremost distinguished citizen learned and honoured jurist beloved townsman and model southern gentleman the honourable william b pemberton the enchanted kiss but a clerk in the cut rate drug store was samuel tansey yet his slender frame was a pad that enfolded the passion of romeo the gloom of laura the romance of d artagnan and the desperate inspiration of melnotte pity then that he had been denied expression that he was doomed to the burden of utter timidity and diffidence that fate had set him tongue tied and scarlet before the muslin clad angels whom he adored and vainly longed to rescue clasp comfort and subdue the clock s hands were pointing close upon the hour of ten while tansey was playing billiards with a number of his friends on alternate evenings he was released from duty at the store after seven o clock even among his fellow men tansey was timorous and constrained in his imagination he had done valiant deeds and performed acts of distinguished gallantry but in fact he was a sallow youth of twenty three with an over modest demeanour and scant vocabulary when the clock struck ten tansey hastily laid down his cue and struck sharply upon the show case with a coin for the attendant to come and receive the pay for his score what s your hurry tansey called one got another engagement tansey got an engagement echoed another not on your life tansey s got to get home at motten by her peek s orders it s no such thing chimed in a pale youth taking a large cigar from his mouth tansey s afraid to be late because miss katie might come down stairs to unlock the door and kiss him in the hall this last delicate piece of raillery sent a fiery tingle into tansey s blood for the indictment was true barring the kiss that was a thing to dream of to wildly hope for but too remote and sacred a thing to think of lightly casting a cold and contemptuous look at the speaker a punishment commensurate with his own diffident spirit tansey left the room descending the stairs into the street for two years he had silently adored miss peek worshipping her from a spiritual distance through which her attractions took on stellar brightness and mystery mrs peek kept a few choice boarders among whom was tansey the other young men romped with katie chased her with crickets in their fingers and jollied her with an irreverent freedom that turned tansey s heart into cold lead in his bosom the signs of his adoration were few a tremulous good morning stealthy glances at her during meals and occasionally oh rapture a blushing delirious game of cribbage with her in the parlour on some rare evening when a miraculous lack of engagement kept her at home kiss him in the hall aye he feared it but it was an ecstatic fear such as elijah must have felt when the chariot lifted him into the unknown but to night the gibes of his associates had stung him to a feeling of forward lawless mutiny a defiant challenging atavistic recklessness spirit of corsair adventurer lover poet bohemian possessed him the stars he saw above him seemed no more unattainable no less high than the favour of miss peek or the fearsome sweetness of her delectable lips his fate seemed to him strangely dramatic and pathetic and to call for a solace consonant with its extremity a saloon was near by and to this he flitted calling for absinthe beyond doubt the drink most adequate to his mood the tipple of the roue the abandoned the vainly sighing lover once he drank of it and again and then again until he felt a strange exalted sense of non participation in worldly affairs pervade him tansey was no drinker his consumption of three absinthe anisettes within almost as few minutes proclaimed his unproficiency in the art tansey was merely flooding with unproven liquor his sorrows which record and tradition alleged to be drownable coming out upon the sidewalk he snapped his fingers defiantly in the direction of the peek homestead turned the other way and voyaged columbus like into the wilds of an enchanted street nor is the figure exorbitant for beyond his store the foot of tansey had scarcely been set for years store and boarding house between these ports he was charted to run and contrary currents had rarely deflected his prow tansey aimlessly protracted his walk and whether it was his unfamiliarity with the district his recent accession of audacious errantry or the sophistical whisper of a certain green eyed fairy he came at last to tread a shuttered blank and echoing thoroughfare dark and unpeopled and suddenly this way came to an end as many streets do in the spanish built archaic town of san antone butting its head against an imminent high brick wall no the street still lived to the right and to the left it breathed through slender tubes of exit narrow somnolent ravines cobble paved and unlighted accommodating a rise in the street to the right was reared a phantom flight of five luminous steps of limestone flanked by a wall of the same height and of the same material upon one of these steps tansey seated himself and bethought him of his love and how she might never know she was his love and of mother peek fat vigilant and kind not unpleased tansey thought that he and katie should play cribbage in the parlour together for the cut rate had not cut his salary which sordidly speaking ranked him star boarder at the peek s and he thought of captain peek katie s father a man he dreaded and abhorred a genteel loafer and spendthrift battening upon the labour of his women folk a very queer fish and according to repute not of the freshest the night had turned chill and foggy the heart of the town with its noises was left behind reflected from the high vapours its distant lights were manifest in quivering cone shaped streamers in questionable blushes of unnamed colours in unstable ghostly waves of far electric flashes now that the darkness was become more friendly the wall against which the street splintered developed a stone coping topped with an armature of spikes beyond it loomed what appeared to be the acute angles of mountain peaks pierced here and there by little lambent parallelograms considering this vista tansey at length persuaded himself that the seeming mountains were in fact the convent of santa mercedes with which ancient and bulky pile he was better familiar from different coigns of view a pleasant note of singing in his ears reinforced his opinion high sweet holy carolling far and harmonious and uprising as of sanctified nuns at their responses at what hour did the sisters sing he tried to think was it six eight twelve tansey leaned his back against the limestone wall and wondered strange things followed the air was full of white fluttering pigeons that circled about and settled upon the convent wall the wall blossomed with a quantity of shining green eyes that blinked and peered at him from the solid masonry a pink classic nymph came from an excavation in the cavernous road and danced barefoot and airy upon the ragged flints the sky was traversed by a company of beribboned cats marching in stupendous aerial procession the noise of singing grew louder an illumination of unseasonable fireflies danced past and strange whispers came out of the dark without meaning or excuse without amazement tansey took note of these phenomena he was on some new plane of understanding though his mind seemed to him clear and indeed happily tranquil a desire for movement and exploration seized him he rose and turned into the black gash of street to his right for a time the high wall formed one of its boundaries but further on two rows of black windowed houses closed it in here was the city s quarter once given over to the spaniard here were still his forbidding abodes of concrete and adobe standing cold and indomitable against the century from the murky fissure the eye saw flung against the sky the tangled filigree of his moorish balconies through stone archways breaths of dead vault chilled air coughed upon him his feet struck jingling iron rings in staples stone buried for half a cycle along these paltry avenues had swaggered the arrogant don had caracoled and serenaded and blustered while the tomahawk and the pioneer s rifle were already uplifted to expel him from a continent and tansey stumbling through this old world dust looked up dark as it was and saw andalusian beauties glimmering on the balconies some of them were laughing and listening to the goblin music that still followed others harked fearfully through the night trying to catch the hoof beats of caballeros whose last echoes from those stones had died away a century ago those women were silent but tansey heard the jangle of horseless bridle bits the whirr of riderless rowels and now and then a muttered malediction in a foreign tongue but he was not frightened shadows nor shadows of sounds could daunt him afraid no afraid of mother peek afraid to face the girl of his heart afraid of tipsy captain peek nay nor of these apparitions nor of that spectral singing that always pursued him singing he would show them he lifted up a strong and untuneful voice when you hear them bells go tingalingling serving notice upon those mysterious agencies that if it should come to a face to face encounter there ll be a hot time in the old town to night how long tansey consumed in treading this haunted byway was not clear to him but in time he emerged into a more commodious avenue when within a few yards of the corner he perceived through a window that a small confectionary of mean appearance was set in the angle his same glance that estimated its meagre equipment its cheap soda water fountain and stock of tobacco and sweets took cognizance of captain peek within lighting a cigar at a swinging gaslight as tansey rounded the corner captain peek came out and they met vis a vis an exultant joy filled tansey when he found himself sustaining the encounter with implicit courage peek indeed he raised his hand and snapped his fingers loudly it was peek himself who quailed guiltily before the valiant mien of the drug clerk sharp surprise and a palpable fear bourgeoned upon the captain s face and verily that face was one to rather call up such expressions on the faces of others the face of a libidinous heathen idol small eyed with carven folds in the heavy jowls and a consuming pagan license in its expression in the gutter just beyond the store tansey saw a closed carriage standing with its back toward him and a motionless driver perched in his place why it s tansey exclaimed captain peek how are you tansey h have a cigar tansey why it s peek cried tansey jubilant at his own temerity what deviltry are you up to now peek back streets and a closed carriage fie peek there s no one in the carriage said the captain smoothly everybody out of it is in luck continued tansey aggressively i d love for you to know peek that i m not stuck on you you re a bottle nosed scoundrel why the little rat s drunk cried the captain joyfully only drunk and i thought he was on go home tansey and quit bothering grown persons on the street but just then a white clad figure sprang out of the carriage and a shrill voice katie s voice sliced the air sam sam help me sam tansey sprung toward her but captain peek interposed his bulky form wonder of wonders the whilom spiritless youth struck out with his right and the hulking captain went over in a swearing heap tansey flew to katie and took her in his arms like a conquering knight she raised her face and he kissed her violets electricity caramels champagne here was the attainment of a dream that brought no disenchantment oh sam cried katie when she could i knew you would come to rescue me what do you suppose the mean things were going to do with me have your picture taken said tansey wondering at the foolishness of his remark no they were going to eat me i heard them talking about it eat you said tansey after pondering a moment that can t be there s no plates but a sudden noise warned him to turn down upon him were bearing the captain and a monstrous long bearded dwarf in a spangled cloak and red trunk hose the dwarf leaped twenty feet and clutched them the captain seized katie and hurled her shrieking back into the carriage himself followed and the vehicle dashed away the dwarf lifted tansey high above his head and ran with him into the store holding him with one hand he raised the lid of an enormous chest half filled with cakes of ice flung tansey inside and closed down the cover the force of the fall must have been great for tansey lost consciousness when his faculties revived his first sensation was one of severe cold along his back and limbs opening his eyes he found himself to be seated upon the limestone steps still facing the wall and convent of santa mercedes his first thought was of the ecstatic kiss from katie the outrageous villainy of captain peek the unnatural mystery of the situation his preposterous conflict with the improbable dwarf these things roused and angered him but left no impression of the unreal i ll go back there to morrow he grumbled aloud and knock the head off that comic opera squab running out and picking up perfect strangers and shoving them into cold storage but the kiss remained uppermost in his mind i might have done that long ago he mused she liked it too she called me sam four times i ll not go up that street again too much scrapping guess i ll move down the other way wonder what she meant by saying they were going to eat her tansey began to feel sleepy but after a while he decided to move along again this time he ventured into the street to his left it ran level for a distance and then dipped gently downward opening into a vast dim barren space the old military plaza to his left some hundred yards distant he saw a cluster of flickering lights along the plaza s border he knew the locality at once huddled within narrow confines were the remnants of the once famous purveyors of the celebrated mexican national cookery a few years before their nightly encampments upon the historic alamo plaza in the heart of the city had been a carnival a saturnalia that was renowned throughout the land then the caterers numbered hundreds the patrons thousands drawn by the coquettish senoritas the music of the weird spanish minstrels and the strange piquant mexican dishes served at a hundred competing tables crowds thronged the alamo plaza all night travellers rancheros family parties gay gasconading rounders sightseers and prowlers of polyglot owlish san antone mingled there at the centre of the city s fun and frolic the popping of corks pistols and questions the glitter of eyes jewels and daggers the ring of laughter and coin these were the order of the night but now no longer to some half dozen tents fires and tables had dwindled the picturesque festival and these had been relegated to an ancient disused plaza often had tansey strolled down to these stands at night to partake of the delectable chili con carne a dish evolved by the genius of mexico composed of delicate meats minced with aromatic herbs and the poignant chili colorado a compound full of singular flavour and a fiery zest delightful to the southron s palate the titillating odour of this concoction came now on the breeze to the nostrils of tansey awakening in him hunger for it as he turned in that direction he saw a carriage dash up to the mexicans tents out of the gloom of the plaza some figures moved back and forward in the uncertain light of the lanterns and then the carriage was driven swiftly away tansey approached and sat at one of the tables covered with gaudy oil cloth traffic was dull at the moment a few half grown boys noisily fared at another table the mexicans hung listless and phlegmatic about their wares and it was still the night hum of the city crowded to the wall of dark buildings surrounding the plaza and subsided to an indefinite buzz through which sharply perforated the crackle of the languid fires and the rattle of fork and spoon a sedative wind blew from the southeast the starless firmament pressed down upon the earth like a leaden cover in all that quiet tansey turned his head suddenly and saw without disquietude a troop of spectral horsemen deploy into the plaza and charge a luminous line of infantry that advanced to sustain the shock he saw the fierce flame of cannon and small arms but heard no sound the careless victuallers lounged vacantly not deigning to view the conflict tansey mildly wondered to what nations these mute combatants might belong turned his back to them and ordered his chili and coffee from the mexican woman who advanced to serve him this woman was old and careworn her face was lined like the rind of a cantaloupe she fetched the viands from a vessel set by the smouldering fire and then retired to a tent dark within that stood near by presently tansey heard a turmoil in the tent a wailing broken hearted pleading in the harmonious spanish tongue and then two figures tumbled out into the light of the lanterns one was the old woman the other was a man clothed with a sumptuous and flashing splendour the woman seemed to clutch and beseech from him something against his will the man broke from her and struck her brutally back into the tent where she lay whimpering and invisible observing tansey he walked rapidly to the table where he sat tansey recognized him to be ramon torres a mexican the proprietor of the stand he was patronizing torres was a handsome nearly full blooded descendant of the spanish seemingly about thirty years of age and of a haughty but extremely courteous demeanour to night he was dressed with signal magnificence his costume was that of a triumphant matador made of purple velvet almost hidden by jeweled embroidery diamonds of enormous size flashed upon his garb and his hands he reached for a chair and seating himself at the opposite side of the table began to roll a finical cigarette ah meester tanse he said with a sultry fire in his silky black eyes i give myself pleasure to see you this evening meester tansee you have many times come to eat at my table i theenk you a safe man a verree good friend how much would it please you to leeve forever not come back any more inquired tansey no not leave leeve the not to die i would call that said tansey a snap torres leaned his elbows upon the table swallowed a mouthful of smoke and spake each word being projected in a little puff of gray how old do you theenk i am meester tansee oh twenty eight or thirty thees day said the mexican ees my birthday i am four hundred and three years of old to day another proof said tansey airily

leaning over the table until he lay flat upon it eet is the chili con carne made not from the beef or the chicken but from the flesh of the senorita young and tender that ees the secret everee month you must eat of it having care to do so before the moon is full and you will not die any times see how i trust you friend tansee to night i have bought one young ladee verree pretty so fina gorda blandita to morrow the chili will be ready ahora si one thousand dollars i pay for thees young ladee from an americano i have bought a verree tip top man el capitan peek que es senor for tansey had sprung to his feet upsetting the chair the words of katie reverberated in his ears they re going to eat me sam this then was the monstrous fate to which she had been delivered by her unnatural parent the carriage he had seen drive up from the plaza was captain peek s where was katie perhaps already before he could decide what to do a loud scream came from the tent the old mexican woman ran out a flashing knife in her hand i have released her she cried you shall kill no more they will hang you ingrato encatador torres with a hissing exclamation sprang at her ramoncito she shrieked once you loved me the mexican s arm raised and descended you are old he cried and she fell and lay motionless another scream the flaps of the tent were flung aside and there stood katie white with fear her wrists still bound with a cruel cord sam she cried save me again tansey rounded the table and flung himself with superb nerve upon the mexican just then a clangour began the clocks of the city were tolling the midnight hour tansey clutched at torres and for a moment felt in his grasp the crunch of velvet and the cold facets of the glittering gems the next instant the bedecked caballero turned in his hands to a shrunken leather visaged white bearded old old screaming mummy sandalled ragged and four hundred and three the mexican woman was crawling to her feet and laughing she shook her brown hand in the face of the whining viejo go now she cried and seek your senorita it was i ramoncito who brought you to this within each moon you eat of the life giving chili it was i that kept the wrong time for you you should have eaten yesterday instead of to morrow it is too late off with you hombre you are too old for me this decided tansey releasing his hold of the gray beard is a private family matter concerning age and no business of mine with one of the table knives he hastened to saw asunder the fetters of the fair captive and then for the second time that night he kissed katie peek tasted again the sweetness the wonder the thrill of it attained once more the maximum of his incessant dreams the next instant an icy blade was driven deep between his shoulders he felt his blood slowly congeal heard the senile cackle of the perennial spaniard saw the plaza rise and reel till the zenith crashed into the horizon and knew no more when tansey opened his eyes again he was sitting upon those self same steps gazing upon the dark bulk of the sleeping convent in the middle of his back was still the acute chilling pain how had he been conveyed back there again he got stiffly to his feet and stretched his cramped limbs supporting himself against the stonework he revolved in his mind the extravagant adventures that had befallen him each time he had strayed from the steps that night in reviewing them certain features strained his credulity had he really met captain peek or katie or the unparalleled mexican in his wanders had he really encountered them under commonplace conditions and his over stimulated brain had supplied the incongruities however that might be a sudden elating thought caused him an intense joy nearly all of us have at some point in our lives either to excuse our own stupidity or to placate our consciences promulgated some theory of fatalism we have set up an intelligent fate that works by codes and signals tansey had done likewise and now he read through the night s incidents the finger prints of destiny each excursion that he had made had led to the one paramount finale to katie and that kiss which survived and grew strong and intoxicating in his memory clearly fate was holding up to him the mirror that night calling him to observe what awaited him at the end of whichever road he might take he immediately turned and hurried homeward clothed in an elaborate pale blue wrapper cut to fit miss katie peek reclined in an armchair before a waning fire in her room her little bare feet were thrust into house shoes rimmed with swan s down by the light of a small lamp she was attacking the society news of the latest sunday paper some happy substance seemingly indestructible was being rhythmically crushed between her small white teeth miss katie read of functions and furbelows but she kept a vigilant ear for outside sounds and a frequent eye upon the clock over the mantel at every footstep upon the asphalt sidewalk her smooth round chin would cease for a moment its regular rise and fall and a frown of listening would pucker her pretty brows at last she heard the latch of the iron gate click she sprang up tripped softly to the mirror where she made a few of those feminine flickering passes at her front hair and throat which are warranted to hypnotize the approaching guest the door bell rang miss katie in her haste turned the blaze of the lamp lower instead of higher and hastened noiselessly down stairs into the hall she turned the key the door opened and mr tansey side stepped in why the i de a exclaimed miss katie is this you mr tansey it s after midnight aren t you ashamed to wake me up at such an hour to let you in you re just awful i was late said tansey brilliantly i should think you were ma was awfully worried about you when you weren t in by ten that hateful tom mcgill said you were out calling on another said you were out calling on some young lady i just despise mr mcgill well i m not going to scold you any more mr tansey if it is a little late oh i turned it the wrong way miss katie gave a little scream absent mindedly she had turned the blaze of the lamp entirely out instead of higher it was very dark tansey heard a musical soft giggle and breathed an entrancing odour of heliotrope a groping light hand touched his arm how awkward i was can you find your way sam i i think i have a match miss k katie a scratching sound a flame a glow of light held at arm s length by the recreant follower of destiny illuminating a tableau which shall end the ignominious chronicle a maid with unkissed curling contemptuous lips slowly lifting the lamp chimney and allowing the wick to ignite then waving a scornful and abjuring hand toward the staircase the unhappy tansey erstwhile champion in the prophetic lists of fortune ingloriously ascending to his just and certain doom while let us imagine half within the wings stands the imminent figure of fate jerking wildly at the wrong strings and mixing things up in her usual able manner a departmental case in texas you may travel a thousand miles in a straight line if your course is a crooked one it is likely that both the distance and your rate of speed may be vastly increased clouds there sail serenely against the wind the whip poor will delivers its disconsolate cry with the notes exactly reversed from those of his northern brother given a drought and a subsequently lively rain and lo from a glazed and stony soil will spring in a single night blossomed lilies miraculously fair tom green county was once the standard of measurement i have forgotten how many new jerseys and rhode islands it was that could have been stowed away and lost in its chaparral but the legislative axe has slashed tom green into a

leaf fan and his linen duster to set out for the capital the pan handle solon winds his muffler above his well buttoned overcoat and kicks the snow from his well greased boots ready for the same journey all this merely to hint that the big ex republic of the southwest forms a sizable star on the flag and to prepare for the corollary that things sometimes happen there uncut to pattern and unfettered by metes and bounds the commissioner of insurance statistics and history of the state of texas was an official of no very great or very small importance the past tense is used for now he is commissioner of insurance alone statistic and history are no longer proper nouns in the government records in the year the governor appointed luke coonrod standifer to be the head of this department standifer was then fifty five years of age and a texan to the core his father had been one of the state s earliest settlers and pioneers standifer himself had served the commonwealth as indian fighter soldier ranger and legislator much learning he did not claim but he had drank pretty deep of the spring of experience if other grounds were less abundant texas should be well up in the lists of glory as the grateful republic for both as republic and state it has busily heaped honours and solid rewards upon its sons who rescued it from the wilderness wherefore and therefore luke coonrod standifer son of ezra standifer ex terry ranger simon pure democrat and lucky dweller in an unrepresented portion of the politico geographical map was appointed commissioner of insurance statistics and history standifer accepted the honour with some doubt as to the nature of the office he was to fill and his capacity for filling it but he accepted and by wire he immediately set out from the little country town where he maintained and was scarcely maintained by a somnolent and unfruitful office of surveying and map drawing before departing he had looked up under the i s s s and h s in the encyclopaedia britannica what information and preparation toward his official duties that those weighty volumes afforded a few weeks of incumbency diminished the new commissioner s awe of the great and important office he had been called upon to conduct an increasing familiarity with its workings soon restored him to his accustomed placid course of life in his office was an old spectacled clerk a consecrated informed able machine who held his desk regardless of changes of administrative heads old kauffman instructed his new chief gradually in the knowledge of the department without seeming to do so and kept the wheels revolving without the slip of a cog indeed the department of insurance statistics and history carried no great heft of the burden of state its main work was the regulating of the business done in the state by foreign insurance companies and the letter of the law was its guide as for statistics well you wrote letters to county officers and scissored other people s reports and each year you got out a report of your own about the corn crop and the cotton crop and pecans and pigs and black and white population and a great many columns of figures headed bushels and acres and square miles etc and there you were history the branch was purely a receptive one old ladies interested in the science bothered you some with long reports of proceedings of their historical societies some twenty or thirty people would write you each year that they had secured sam houston s pocket knife or santa ana s whisky flask or davy crockett s rifle all absolutely authenticated and demanded legislative appropriation to purchase most of the work in the history branch went into pigeon holes one sizzling august afternoon the commissioner reclined in his office chair with his feet upon the long official table covered with green billiard cloth the commissioner was smoking a cigar and dreamily regarding the quivering landscape framed by the window that looked upon the treeless capitol grounds perhaps he was thinking of the rough and ready life he had led of the old days of breathless adventure and movement of the comrades who now trod other paths or had ceased to tread any of the changes civilization and peace had brought and maybe complacently of the snug and comfortable camp pitched for him under the dome of the capitol of the state that had not forgotten his services the business of the department was lax insurance was easy statistics were not in demand history was dead old kauffman the efficient and perpetual clerk had requested an infrequent half holiday incited to the unusual dissipation by the joy of having successfully twisted the tail of a connecticut insurance company that was trying to do business contrary to the edicts of the great lone star state the office was very still a few subdued noises trickled in through the open door from the other departments a dull tinkling crash from the treasurer s office adjoining as a clerk tossed a bag of silver to the floor of the vault the vague intermittent clatter of a dilatory typewriter a dull tapping from the state geologist s quarters as if some woodpecker had flown in to bore for his prey in the cool of the massive building and then a faint rustle and the light shuffling of the well worn shoes along the hall the sounds ceasing at the door toward which the commissioner s lethargic back was presented following this the sound of a gentle voice speaking words unintelligible to the commissioner s somewhat dormant comprehension but giving evidence of bewilderment and hesitation the voice was feminine the commissioner was of the race of cavaliers who make salaam before the trail of a skirt without considering the quality of its cloth there stood in the door a faded woman one of the numerous sisterhood of the unhappy she was dressed all in black poverty s perpetual mourning for lost joys her face had the contours of twenty and the lines of forty she may have lived that intervening score of years in a twelve month there was about her yet an aurum of indignant unappeased protesting youth that shone faintly through the premature veil of unearned decline i beg your pardon ma am said the commissioner gaining his feet to the accompaniment of a great creaking and sliding of his chair are you the governor sir asked the vision of melancholy the commissioner hesitated at the end of his best bow with his hand in the bosom of his double breasted frock truth at last conquered well no ma am i am not the governor i have the honour to be commissioner of insurance statistics and history is there anything ma am i can do for you won t you have a chair ma am the lady subsided into the chair handed her probably from purely physical reasons she wielded a cheap fan last token of gentility to be abandoned her clothing seemed to indicate a reduction almost to extreme poverty she looked at the man who was not the governor and saw kindliness and simplicity and a rugged unadorned courtliness emanating from a countenance tanned and toughened by forty years of outdoor life also she saw that his eyes were clear and strong and blue just so they had been when he used them to skim the horizon for raiding kiowas and sioux his mouth was as set and firm as it had been on that day when he bearded the old lion sam houston himself and defied him during that season when secession was the theme now in bearing and dress luke coonrod sandifer endeavoured to do credit to the important arts and sciences of insurance statistics and history he had abandoned the careless dress of his country home now his broad brimmed black slouch hat and his long tailed frock made him not the least imposing of the official family even if his office was reckoned to stand at the tail of the list you wanted to see the governor ma am asked the commissioner with a deferential manner he always used toward the fair sex i hardly know said the lady hesitatingly i suppose so and then suddenly drawn by the sympathetic look of the other she poured forth the story of her need it was a story so common that the public has come to look at its monotony instead of its pity the old tale of an unhappy married life made so by a brutal conscienceless husband a robber a spendthrift a moral coward and a bully who failed to provide even the means of the barest existence yes he had come down in the scale so low as to strike her it happened only the day before there was the bruise on one temple she had offended his highness by asking for a little money to live on and yet she must needs woman like append a plea for her tyrant he was drinking he had rarely abused her thus when sober i thought mourned this pale sister of sorrow that maybe the state might be willing to give me some relief i ve heard of such things being done for the families of old settlers i ve heard tell that the state used to give land to the men who fought for it against mexico and settled up the country and helped drive out the indians my father did all of that and he never received anything he never would take it i thought the governor would be the one to see and that s why i came if father was entitled to anything they might let it come to me it s possible ma am said standifer that such might be the case but most all the veterans and settlers got their land certificates issued and located long ago still we can look that up in the land office and be sure your father s name now was amos colvin sir good lord exclaimed standifer rising and unbuttoning his tight coat excitedly are you amos colvin s daughter why ma am amos colvin and me were thicker than two hoss thieves for more than ten years we fought kiowas drove cattle and rangered side by side nearly all over texas i remember seeing you once before now you were a kid about seven a riding a little yellow pony up and down amos and me stopped at your home for a little grub when we were trailing that band of mexican cattle thieves down through karnes and bee great tarantulas and you re amos colvin s little girl did you ever hear your father mention luke standifer just kind of casually as if he d met me once or twice a little pale smile flitted across the lady s white face it seems to me she said that i don t remember hearing him talk about much else every day there was some story he had to tell about what he and you had done mighty near the last thing i heard him tell was about the time when the indians wounded him and you crawled out to him through the grass with a canteen of water while they yes yes well oh that wasn t anything said standifer hemming loudly and buttoning his coat again briskly and now ma am who was the infernal skunk i beg your pardon ma am who was the gentleman you married benton sharp the commissioner plumped down again into his chair with a groan this gentle sad little woman in the rusty black gown the daughter of his oldest friend the wife of benton sharp benton sharp one of the most noted bad men in that part of the state a man who had been a cattle thief an outlaw a desperado and was now a gambler a swaggering bully who plied his trade in the larger frontier towns relying upon his record and the quickness of his gun play to maintain his supremacy seldom did any one take the risk of going up against benton sharp even the law officers were content to let him make his own terms of peace sharp was a ready and an accurate shot and as lucky as a brand new penny at coming clear from his scrapes standifer wondered how this pillaging eagle ever came to be mated with amos colvin s little dove and expressed his wonder mrs sharp sighed you see mr standifer we didn t know anything about him and he can be very pleasant and kind when he wants to we lived down in the little town of goliad benton came riding down that way and stopped there a while i reckon i was some better looking then than i am now he was good to me for a whole year after we were married he insured his life for me for five thousand dollars but for the last six months he has done everything but kill me i often wish he had done that too he got out of money for a while and abused me shamefully for not having anything he could spend then father died and left me the little home in goliad my husband made me sell that and turned me out into the world i ve barely been able to live for i m not strong enough to work lately i heard he was making money in san antonio so i went there and found him and asked for a little help this touching the livid bruise on her temple is what he gave me so i came on to austin to see the governor i once heard father say that there was some land or a pension coming to him from the state that he never would ask for luke standifer rose to his feet and pushed his chair back he looked rather perplexedly around the big office with its handsome furniture it s a long trail to follow he said slowly trying to get back dues from the government there s red tape and lawyers and rulings and evidence and courts to keep you waiting i m not certain continued the commissioner with a profoundly meditative frown whether this department that i m the boss of has any jurisdiction or not it s only insurance statistics and history ma am and it don t sound as if it would cover the case but sometimes a saddle blanket can be made to stretch you keep your seat just for a few minutes ma am till i step into the next room and see about it the state treasurer was seated within his massive complicated railings reading a newspaper business for the day was about over the clerks lolled at their desks awaiting the closing hour the commissioner of insurance statistics and history entered and leaned in at the window the treasurer a little brisk old man with snow white moustache and beard jumped up youthfully and came forward to greet standifer they were friends of old uncle frank said the commissioner using the familiar name by which the historic treasurer was addressed by every texan how much money have you got on hand the treasurer named the sum of the last balance down to the odd cents something more than a million dollars the commissioner whistled lowly and his eyes grew hopefully bright you know or else you ve heard of amos colvin uncle frank knew him well said the treasurer promptly a good man a valuable citizen one of the first settlers in the southwest his daughter said standifer is sitting in my office she s penniless she s married to benton sharp a coyote and a murderer he s reduced her to want and broken her heart her father helped build up this state and it s the state s turn to help his child a couple of thousand dollars will buy back her home and let her live in peace the state of texas can t afford to refuse it give me the money uncle frank and i ll give it to her right away we ll fix up the red tape business afterward the treasurer looked a little bewildered why standifer he said you know i can t pay a cent out of the treasury without a warrant from the comptroller i can t disburse a dollar without a voucher to show for it the commissioner betrayed a slight impatience i ll give you a voucher he declared what s this job they ve given me for am i just a knot on a mesquite stump can t my office stand for it charge it up to insurance and the other two sideshows don t statistics show that amos colvin came to this state when it was in the hands of greasers and rattlesnakes and comanches and fought day and night to make a white man s country of it don t they show that amos colvin s daughter is brought to ruin by a villain who s trying to pull down what you and i and old texans shed our blood to build up don t history show that the lone star state never yet failed to grant relief to the suffering and oppressed children of the men who made her the grandest commonwealth in the union if statistics and history don t bear out the claim of amos colvin s child i ll ask the next legislature to abolish my office come now uncle frank let her have the money i ll sign the papers officially if you say so and then if the governor or the comptroller or the janitor or anybody else makes a kick by the lord i ll refer the matter to the people and see if they won t endorse the act the treasurer looked sympathetic but shocked the commissioner s voice had grown louder as he rounded off the sentences that however praiseworthy they might be in sentiment reflected somewhat upon the capacity of the head of a more or less important department of state the clerks were beginning to listen now standifer said the treasurer soothingly you know i d like to help in this matter but stop and think a moment please every cent in the treasury is expended only by appropriation made by the legislature and drawn out by checks issued by the comptroller i can t control the use of a cent of it neither can you your department isn t disbursive it isn t even administrative it s purely clerical the only way for the lady to obtain relief is to petition the legislature and to the devil with the legislature said standifer turning away the treasurer called him back i d be glad standifer to contribute a hundred dollars personally toward the immediate expenses of colvin s daughter he reached for his pocketbook never mind uncle frank said the commissioner in a softer tone there s no need of that she hasn t asked for anything of that sort yet besides her case is in my hands i see now what a little rag tag bob tail gotch eared department i ve been put in charge of it seems to be about as important as an almanac or a hotel register but while i m running it it won t turn away any daughters of amos colvin without stretching its jurisdiction to cover if possible you want to keep your eye on the department of insurance statistics and history the commissioner returned to his office looking thoughtful he opened and closed an inkstand on his desk many times with extreme and undue

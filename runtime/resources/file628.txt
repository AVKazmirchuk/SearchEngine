society dame when it was finished her husband looked at it with a peculiar expression on his face and the next week he sued for divorce i remember one case of a prominent banker who sat to me while i had his portrait on exhibition in my studio an acquaintance of his came in to look at it bless me says he does he really look like that i told him it was considered a faithful likeness i never noticed that expression about his eyes before said he i think i ll drop downtown and change my bank account he did drop down but the bank account was gone and so was mr banker it wasn t long till they put me out of business people don t want their secret meannesses shown up in a picture they can smile and twist their own faces and deceive you but the picture can t i couldn t get an order for another picture and i had to give up i worked as a newspaper artist for a while and then for a lithographer but my work with them got me into the same trouble if i drew from a photograph my drawing showed up characteristics and expressions that you couldn t find in the photo but i guess they were in the original all right the customers raised lively rows especially the women and i never could hold a job long so i began to rest my weary head upon the breast of old booze for comfort and pretty soon i was in the free bed line and doing oral fiction for hand outs among the food bazaars does the truthful statement weary thee o caliph i can turn on the wall street disaster stop if you prefer but that requires a tear and i m afraid i can t hustle one up after that good dinner no no said chalmers earnestly you interest me very much did all of your portraits reveal some unpleasant trait or were there some that did not suffer from the ordeal of your peculiar brush some yes said plumer children generally a good many women and a sufficient number of men all people aren t bad you know when they were all right the pictures were all right as i said i don t explain it but i m telling you facts on chalmers s writing table lay the photograph that he had received that day in the foreign mail ten minutes later he had plumer at work making a sketch from it in pastels at the end of an hour the artist rose and stretched wearily it s done he yawned you ll excuse me for being so long i got interested in the job lordy but i m tired no bed last night you know guess it ll have to be good night now o commander of the faithful chalmers went as far as the door with him and slipped some bills into his hand oh i ll take em said plumer all that s included in the fall thanks and for the very good dinner i shall sleep on feathers to night and dream of bagdad i hope it won t turn out to be a dream in the morning farewell most excellent caliph again chalmers paced restlessly upon his rug but his beat lay as far from the table whereon lay the pastel sketch as the room would permit twice thrice he tried to approach it but failed he could see the dun and gold and brown of the colors but there was a wall about it built by his fears that kept him at a distance he sat down and tried to calm himself he sprang up and rang for phillips there is a young artist in this building he said a mr reineman do you know which is his apartment top floor front sir said phillips go up and ask him to favor me with his presence here for a few minutes reineman came at once chalmers introduced himself mr reineman said he there is a little pastel sketch on yonder table i would be glad if you will give me your opinion of it as to its artistic merits and as a picture the young artist advanced to the table and took up the sketch chalmers half turned away leaning upon the back of a chair how do you find it he asked slowly as a drawing said the artist i can t praise it enough it s the work of a master bold and fine and true it puzzles me a little i haven t seen any pastel work near as good in years the face man the subject the original what would you say of that the face said reineman is the
